"TV WEEKEND;
BRITAIN IN THE BLITZ ERA; MONTH OF HEALTH SPECIALS",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/02/arts/tv-weekend-britain-in-the-blitz-era-month-of-health-specials.html,THE new Masterpiece Theater series beginning on WNET Channel 13 on Sunday night at 9 is Danger UXB the letters representing unexploded bomb The Nazi blitz of Britain in World War II included bombs that usually intentionally would not immediately explode A bomb disposal unit was assigned the harrowing job of defusing the monsters The hero of Danger UXB is called Brian Ash Ashes to ashes dust to dust somebody jokes grimly The first of the 13 episodes shows him as the green officer reporting for duty facing the scorn of his companys veterans and going on his first defusing expedition Helped by a sympathetic sergeant the young second lieutenant gets through the ordeal with mixed feelings His nervousness causes him to vomit but the applause of bystanders gives him an unexpected lift All of this is extremely well done but it is difficult to figure out where the other 12 episodes will go The prospect of a Bomb of the Week special is not terribly stimulating But the project has promising credits It was created and produced by John Hawkesworth producer of Upstairs Downstairs and The Duchess of Duke Street Ash is played by Anthony Andrews the appealing actor who played the man who married Georgina in Upstairs Downstairs And the authenticity in true British fashion is heartthumpingly on target Coming up with a theme for its January schedule Channel 13 will offer a Focus on Health A collection of about 24 hours of healthrelated specials begins tonight at 9 with the debut of a sixpart weekly series called Hard Choices Examining the revolution in medical technology these programs  a production of Station KCTS in Seattle  will consider some of the ethical questions being raised The host is Dr Willard Gaylin president of the Institute of Society Ethics and the Life Sciences at the Hastings Center The opening hour deals with Boy or Girl Should the Choice Be Ours Through several new techniques parents can now choose the sex of their children The question If we can should we The answer may not be as simple as superficial arguments would indicate On the nay side some opponents maintain that choosing an identity comes close to imposing an identity In the process children are likely to become objects considered as means not as ends in themselves Some physicians do not divulge information about the sex of an unborn child because the patient might then seek an abortion The proponents include Dr Neil McIntyre inventor of the amniocentesis test that reveals fetus chromosone disorder and as he accidently discovered the sex of the child At first opposed to sex disclosure he later changed his mind feeling he could not inflict his morals on other people Other supporters cite exceptional cases in which one sex or the other might pose a special problem A disease carried by females for instance might affect male children only On top of everything there is the social fact that whether through tradition or conditioning most parents yearn for a son The determination of sex might be a form of birth control halting the habit of having more children in an effort to have a son On the other hand more males in the society could according to some experts trigger a rise in violence and crime even in homosexuality This survey produced written and directed by Graham Chedd rambles on too long but the issues are undeniably important Immediately following at 10 tonight the Health in Focus package continues with Stalking Immortality This 1978 film by Jane and William Hitchcock reviews a number of scientific attempts to control the processes of aging The narrator is Jason Robards Hardly anything idiotic or promising is left out There is cryogenics and the freezing of a corpse for later thawing in a world that has discovered the fountain of youth and immortality There are Senior Olympics featuring an 82yearold pole vaulter and an 89yearold jogger There is Nathan Pritikin founder of a Longevity Institute and a bestselling diet declaring that anyone who doesnt live 100 years has been cheated There is in other words just about every fad or fact connected with the subject of aging Some of the information is simply common sense especially those parts dealing with diet and nutrition A bit of it is briefly qualifying The genetic code is mentioned in passing with the advice to choose your parents and grandparents wisely But it is added even that is not a guarantee In short Stalking Immortality offers with a straight face a compendium of fantasies generated for a society suffering from youth lunacy Of course a few people live to advanced age with their physical powers and energies remarkably in tact Medicine nutrition and sanitation have lengthened the average life span Maybe a few more years can be squeezed out of the birthdeath cycle But a visit to the average nursing home will deliver the unmistakable message that old age is anything but a blessing The sight of the deluded elderly doddering about with hair transplants has become singularly ludicrous Dr Jonathan Miller was closer to the target when in the concluding episode of The Body in Question he observed that in allowing us to grow older science has merely created lives without expectationresembling an enforced tenancy in derelict premises For all its lofty tones Stalking Immortality is the equivalent of those titillating tabloids displayed at supermarket checkout counters Finally continuing the weekends documentary trend tomorrow night at 10 CBS News will carry Embassy a closeup look at the lives of an American Ambassador and his staff The envoy involved is Morton Abramowitz 47yearold Ambassador to Thailand The problem is that an ambassador doesnt really do all that much these days As the program concedes most of the action is in Washington not in the field Mr Abramowitz says I dont make foreign policy but he adds I try to influence those who do make policy Mr Abramowitz is followed by the correspondent Ed Bradley on trips to a rice camp serving refugees near the Cambodian border and to Washington where he gets to chat with Secretary of State Edmund S Muskie The point is made that the embassy is primarily a channel of communications between Thailand and the United States A hefty chunk of the hour is devoted to the embassys head of personnel who was quitting his post after 13 years in the Foreign Service For managers he says about his job its simply not very interesting Neither is this documentary  for just about anybody
MT. SINAI DOCTORS STUDY A DISEASE AFFLICTING JEWS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/02/nyregion/mt-sinai-doctors-study-a-disease-afflicting-jews.html,Doctors at Mount Sinai Medical Center are making a major effort to control Gauchers disease an incurable and inherited affliction that strikes approximately one of every 2500 Jews born in the United States Similar to several other genetic diseases such as TaySachs which kills in infancy and the much rarer NeimannPick disease Gauchers is a deadly recessive gene disorder that has been found to primarily afflict Jews of European ethnic origin Since about half of this countrys estimated eight million Jews live in the New York metropolitan area with most of them having European origins it was only natural that a New York City medical center with Jewish philanthropic origins would choose to make a major attempt to fight the disease 1500 in Metropolitan Area That effort helped persuade Dr Robert J Desnick to leave the University of Minnesota three years ago to become the chief of the division of genetics at the Mount Sinai center and to help lead the centers battle against Gauchers disease and the other genetically transmitted cellstorage diseases that data show are largely confined to Jews Dr Desnick estimates there are 1500 Gaucher patients in the metropolitan area making it the most prevalent of the Jewish genetic diseases It is his hope that Mount Sinai can provide a clinical and research center that will enable him and other physicians to make earlier and more accurate diagnoses of the disease to provide better care in treating it and to offer more extensive genetic counseling to parents carrying the recessive gene disorder Toward this end the Mount Sinai center will sponsor an international symposium on Gauchers disease next July Named After Physician Gauchers named after Phillippe C E Gaucher the French physician who discovered the disease in 1882 is a rare and tragic disorder and many of its victims do not survive a painracked childhood No one talks of finding a cure for the disease although that is the goal of research scientists such as Dr Desnick who have studied it and personally witnessed the destruction of its victims Essentially Gauchers and TaySachs are diseases in which victims lack a specific enzyme or a chemical produced by the body to break down and eliminate the accumulation of fatty substances within the cells The disease is transmitted by parents who are carriers of the recessive enzyme deficiency In TaySachs which occurs in one of every 3000 Jewish births the fatty substances accumulate in the brain and central nervous system of the victim causing severe complications and eventually death usually before the age of 5 In Gauchers fatty material accumulates in the liver spleen and bone marrow of its victims Although the progression of the disease varies from patient to patient it usually causes gross enlargements of the affected organs It can also cause painful swelling of the joints and make bones so brittle that they break easily Abortion Is Possible Thus far medical research combined with genetic counseling has enabled prospective Jewish parents to know beforehand if their expected child will have TaySachs disease thus giving them the chance to abort the fetus The discovery is made through a process known as amniocentesis in which it is possible to study the fluid in which the fetus floats in the womb and thus determine whether the unborn child lacks the specific enzyme whose absence causes the disease For the disease to occur both parents must carry the recessive gene if they do the odds are one in four that their child will be afflicted In an interview in his office at the Mount Sinai center Dr Desnick a specialist in inherited diseases and birth defects said that with only one or two exceptions he knew of no couple who had ever gone ahead and had a child in whom TaySachs disease had been diagnosed before birth In contrast it is far more difficult to determine whether prospective parents are genetic carriers of Gauchers disease What is known is that about one of 25 Jews carries the defect that the chances are one in 625 that each member of a couple will carry it and that one of every four children of that couple is likely to inherit the disease Tried to Replace Enzyme Earlier research sought to replace in the TaySachs patient the missing enzyme But natural barriers prevented the enzyme from reaching the brain cells to break down and eliminate the fatty materials that were accumulating there Similarly efforts to arrest Gauchers disease by injecting the missing enzyme in the patient have been attempted but have shown no clinical success Although an inherited pathological condition can be ameliorated there is no cure for genetic disorders Until such an effective treatment is found Dr Desnick hopes to provide better management of Gauchers disease For example many physicians unfamiliar with Gauchers have recommended the removal of a victims speen when it became enlarged through the accumulation of fatty material Causes Worse Complications But the removal Dr Desnick said will then cause the disease to concentrate in the victims bone marrow resulting in even worse complications Another problem is that determining whether a parent is a carrier of Gauchers disease can only be accomplished by the use of cultured cells taken from a skin biopsy a procedure that is so cumbersome and expensive that it makes it extremely difficult to administer on a large scale Consequently Dr Desnick and his colleagues are hoping to discover a screening mechanism that will indentify carriers of Gauchers disease as easily as those carrying TaySachs Finally Dr Desnick suspects that wide variations of Gauchers between its young and elderly victims may offer a clue that ultimately will provide medicine with an effective treatment for the disease
"THE MENSHIVIK, BOLSHEVIK, STALINIST FEMINIST",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/04/books/the-menshivik-bolshevik-stalinist-feminist.html,BOLSHEVIK FEMINIST The Life of Aleksandra Kollontai By Barbara Evans Clements Illustrated 352 pp Bloomington Indiana University Press 15 ALEKSANDRA KOLLONTAI Socialism Feminism and the Bolshevik Revolution By Beatrice Farnsworth Illustrated 456 pp Stanford Calif Stanford University Press 2850 ALEXANDRA KOLLONTAI The Lonely Struggle of the Woman Who Defied Lenin By Cathy Porter Illustrated 553 pp New York The Dial Press 1495 HAD anyone told Alexandra Kollontai around 1910 that a book about her would one day bear the title Bolshevik Feminist she would have reacted with incredulity An adherent of the Menshevik faction of Russian Marxists prior to World War I she was initially opposed to Lenins Bolshevik group with their advocacy of revolution through conspiracy and violence She was equally opposed during those years to the Russian and international feminist movements seeing them as efforts by bourgeois ladies to divert energies from the struggle for the coming proletarian revolution Yet a decade later Kollontai was a member of the Bolshevik Central Committee that had carried out the October Revolution the highestranking woman in the first Soviet Government and an eloquent advocate of the social and sexual equality of women More or less forgotten at the time of her death in 1952 Kollontai has lately been the object of a minor revival in the Soviet Union Her Soviet biographers and the editors of the censored reissues of her memoirs and books minimize her Menshevik past her disagreements with Lenin and her interest in sexual liberation They stress instead her loyalty to the Bolshevik cause and her diplomatic career during the Stalin era With the current high interest in both feminism and Marxism in the West the rediscovery of Kollontai was predictable Throughout the 1970s her theoretical writings were brought out in new translations by various publishing houses in West Germany England and here Cassandra Editions in Chicago has published a collection of her fiction Love of Worker Bees Now we have three fullscale biographies in English which seek with varying degrees of objectivity to outline Kollontais historical role and to appropriate her ideas and experience to the newly revived feminist trends in Western democracies Two of the biographers Barbara Evans Clements and Beatrice Farnsworth are professors of history at American colleges Akron University and Wells College respectively Cathy Porter is a freelance scholar based in London The radicalization of Alexandra Kollontai in the last years of the 19th century followed a pattern that was typical of the Russia of her time but unfamiliar in the West until recently She was born into a wealthy and aristocratic family in 1872 Her father a general in the czars army secretly financed her studies of Marxism in Zurich and later helped her hide illegal revolutionary leaflets from the police Her husband Vladimir Kollontai another military man she bore his name to the end of her life complacently agreed to terminate their brief marriage and to raise their son when she decided to be a fulltime revolutionary and devote herself to destroying the privileges of the class into which she was born Unlike other upperclass women revolutionaries Kollontai never gave up her elegant manners and stylish clothes Her fur wraps and plumed My Fair Ladytype hats were later to contrast strikingly with her activities as the Peoples Commissar of Social Welfare and her inflammatory Leninist rhetoric Kollontais political career breaks down conveniently into three stages Menshevik Bolshevik and Stalinist Her Menshevik phase is neatly summed up by a chapter heading in Cathy Porters book Heckling the Feminists During the six decades that preceded the October Revolution the feminist movement in Russia underwent a complex evolution and had an array of impressive achievements to its credit Mid19thcentury sermons by George Sand about every womans right to personal fulfillment and by John Stuart Mill about family institutions enslaving women found fertile soil in Russia The first Russian periodical devoted to the liberation of women but written and edited by men The Dawn Rassvet appeared in 1859 In the postreform decade of the 1860s there were womens residential communes in every major city Their participants sought a productive and meaningful life outside the existing social and family structures Energetic and resourceful women such as Maria Trubnikova Anna Filosofova she was Sergei Diaghilevs aunt and later Countess Sophia Panina braved social opprobrium and Governmental opposition to secure the access of women to higher education and improve the living conditions of women factory workers By the turn of the century Russian women were studying at universities entering the medical and other professions in unprecedented numbers organizing cooperative movements and engaging in numerous other activities never imagined by those in the West who see prerevolutionary Russia only in terms of czars and terrorists With the legalization of all political parties after the 1905 revolution most of the radical and liberal ones made the equality of women a part of their platforms The feminist tide in Russia reached its apogee when one month after the collapse of the Romanov dynasty the Provisional Government under Alexander Kerensky granted women full civil and political rights including the vote This was several years before American women could vote Russian feminism had two formidable opponents the reactionary right which believed that a womans place was in the home and the Marxist movement The roots of all oppression the Marxists reasoned are economic Proletarians whether men or women are exploited by the bourgeoisie and a proletarian revolution will put an end to that Before the revolution any concern with the equality of women any effort to secure for them the vote equal job opportunities or higher education was divisive and counterrevolutionary In this area Russian Marxists followed the example of their German colleagues When in 1901 the prominent German Marxist Lily Braun published her book Die Frauenfrage in which she went beyond economics and analyzed the oppression of women as a sex she was denounced by the redoubtable Clara Zetkin and read out of the international Marxist movement Alexandra Kollontais contributions to the antifeminist campaign of the Marxists were her coaching of a group of women workers to disrupt the 1908 national congress of Russian feminists by shouting slogans and the publication in 1909 of her book The Social Bases of the Woman Question a 400page diatribe against the leaders of the feminist movement Kollontais Bolshevik phase began when she made up her differences with Lenin in 1915 a rapprochement that was due to their joint defeatist position during World War I By the time of the liberaldemocratic revolution of February 1917 Kollontai was Lenins disciple For the next few years her life was a whirlwind of activity As chronicled by her biographers it has the flickering intensity of a melodramatic silent film She was briefly imprisoned by the Provisional Government She participated in Lenins and Trotskys decision to seize power and was rewarded with a cabinetlevel post Sophia Panina had been a cabinet minister in the Provisional Government so the Bolsheviks felt they could do no less Kollontai led a detachment of revolutionary sailors in occupying the venerated Alexander Nevsky Monastery in Petrograd an action which inaugurated the persecution of religious believers that is such a prominent feature of Soviet life to this day In the midst of it all the 45yearold Kollontai married the gigantic 28yearold sailor Pavel Dybenko Bolshevik leaders reacted to the difference in their ages like cackling village gossips Then Dybenko was put on trial for desertion cleared with Kollontais aid whereupon the pair embarked on a series of fantastic peregrinations through Civil Wartorn south Russia in the course of which their marriage fell apart Kollontai described the relationship in her roman a clef Vasilisa Malygina It was at that time that Kollontai began to concentrate on securing equal rights and a modicum of power for women Her name is often connected with such widely acclaimed developments of those years as the legalization of abortion accessibility of divorce maternity benefits and the founding of the special bureau of the Communist Party devoted to organizing and indoctrinating women the Zhenotdel All three biographies contain devastating documentation of the hostility of the male Bolshevik leaders to any program legislation or organization addressed specifically to the interests of women of the constant necessity for Kollontai and other women within the Bolshevik hierarchy to pretend that their concern with womens issues had nothing to do with the ideology of the despised feminist equal righters Thus abortion was legalized only as a temporary measure necessitated by the Civil War the legalization was expressly proclaimed to serve the benefit of the collective not of the individual woman in need of an abortion There can be no better illustration of the secondclass citizenship of women in this new society than the story of how the offices of the Zhenotdel were required to move to a remote corner of the party headquarters building so that the womens jabbering would not disturb the male comrades during their important tasks This should come as no surprise to those familiar with Lenins thinly veiled misogyny While Lenin could write eloquently on the economic exploitation of women he also had his wife and motherinlaw wait on him hand and foot In his letters thinking like a female or acting like a female was the worst accusation he could fling at another male Lenins notion of the participation of women in the political process may be gauged from his behavior at the International Socialist Womens Conference held in Bern in 1915 As described by Beatrice Farnsworth Lenin handpicked a delegation of Bolshevik women headed by his wife Nadezhda Krupskaya and his mistress Inessa Armand wrote their position papers and speeches and from a table in a nearby restaurant instructed them on what to say throughout the conference The liberal feminist Ariadna Tyrkova a school friend of Krupskayas was told by Lenin that once he gained power he would see to it that her likes were hanged from street lamps Lenins letters to Inessa Armand and his recorded conversations with Clara Zetkin leave no doubt that he found the sexual liberation of women repellent Kollontais expectation that she and other women would be granted real political power in the Soviet Government her disregard for the sexual double standard and her insistence that Soviet society be converted into a socialist utopia regardless of human costs were bound to clash with the views of Lenin and Trotsky Her utopia came not from Marxist sources but from a famous dream sequence in Nikolai Chernyshevskys 1863 novel What Is to Be Done a novel whose influence on the Russian revolutionary movement as a whole was incalculable Chernyshevsky described an ideal society of the future where all social and personal problems are forever solved by housing the entire population in coeducatinal dormitories feeding them in communal dining halls raising children in communal nurseries and sharing all work This for Kollontai was the essence of communism Chernyshevsky expected his utopia to evolve after many centuries but Kollontai in true Bolshevik fashion wanted it enforced immediately During the hardships and shortages of the Civil War Soviet authorities did try introducing some of these collectivist institutions But communal dining rooms served inedible food communal laundries shredded clothes and in Bolshevikoperated daycare centers some children eg the younger daughter of the poet Marina Tsvetaeva were allowed to starve to death Kollontai was not concerned with the human misery all this caused She supported Trotskys forcible labor conscription which even some of the Bolsheviks likened to a new form of serfdom because women were conscripted along with men and herded into collective labor units which she believed would raise their consciousness And she opposed Lenins New Economic Policy NEP which saved the country from famine by stopping the brutal requisitions of grain and livestock from the peasants and allowing them to charge a fair price for their produce For Kollontai this was favoring the peasants over the urban proletariat Her big confrontation with the party leaders came in January 1921 over what is known as the Workers Opposition Like so many things in the Soviet Union this was not at all what its name implies It was a bid by a group of Bolshevik fundamentalists led by Kollontai to compel Lenin to implement their MarxistChernyshevskian utopia Among their demands were the abolition of the NEP collectivization of agriculture dismissal from industry of technological experts trained before the Revolution as potential spies and expulsion from the Communist Party of anyone who was not of certifiably proletarian origin None of the new biographies conveys the full irrationality and cruelty of Kollontais proposed program With hindsight it reads like something halfway between the Chinese Cultural Revolution and Cambodia under Pol Pot After the defeat of the Workers Opposition Kollontai was sent into honorary exile abroad by being appointed Soviet ambassador first to Norway and then to Sweden Her writings on the sexual equality of women and her treacly fiction of the early 1920s which reflected her own unconventional sex life rather than anything in Soviet reality were quickly discredited in a press campaign orchestrated by Krupskaya Ironically at the very same time they were eagerly seized upon by foreign psychologists and sociologists as evidence of the unprecedented rights and sexual freedom enjoyed by women under the Soviet system From 1923 on Kollontai gave up her feminist concerns For the rest of her career she loyally served Stalin She offered no objection to the patriarchal legislation of 1926 and the constitution of 1936 which deprived Soviet women of many of the gains they had achieved after the February and October Revolutions She rewrote history and falsified her own role in her memoirs of the 1930s She did not protest when her exhusband exlover and numerous old friends were massacred in the purges The brutal collectivization of the peasants which sent millions of them to Gulag camps and the frameups of innumerable technical experts as foreign spies under Stalin was of course exactly what Kollontai had advocated back in 1921 Of the three biographers Cathy Porter has done a lot of research on Kollontai but otherwise seems to know next to nothing about Russian history or culture She repeatedly calls the prerevolutionary Russian aristocracy middle class she thinks that the Silver Age of the early 20th century that produced so much splendid literature and art was a time of glorifying a revolting sexual rage for incest pedophilia lust and suicide and she describes the Russian League of Womens Equality a coalition of liberal and nonBolshevik revolutionary women during the Provisional Government as a rightwing feminist organization Throughout her book Miss Porter shows herself incapable of distinguishing between historical fact and propagandistic slogan Her biography has all the depth of a simplistic political poster Beatrice Farnsworth is a trained historian whose earlier writings on Soviet topics I admired The aim of her book on Kollontai as stated in the beginning is to persuade the informed reader that early Bolshevism differed quantitatively from later Stalinism To achieve this Professor Farnsworth based her biography primarily on Kollontais own writing Krupskayas memoirs and early Soviet womens magazines This is like writing the history of slavery in America on the basis of the memoirs of plantation owners The book dismisses the entire achievement of Russian feminists other than Kollontai as the work of philanthropists and patronesses The epithet bourgeois is wielded every few pages to squash anyone Kollontai disagreed with or disliked For the later stages of Kollontais career Professor Farnsworth tries to turn her into a dissident and an antiStalinist Now unlike other old Bolsheviks who were in Stalins power in Moscow Kollontai was safe in her sumptuous Stockholm residence during the purges Yet she went on supporting and justifying everything Stalin did This can only mean she agreed with him With a shocking absence of moral perspective Professor Farnsworth seeks to build up the readers sympathy for Kollontai one of the original architects of the Soviet system by meaningless parallels between her fate and the fate of the poet Anna Akhmatova one of that systems most tragic victims The image this book projects is not that of Kollontai as she was but as Professor Farnsworth would have liked her to be This is reinforced by her frequent speculations about what Kollontai might have felt on this or that occasion or what she could have done but didnt Bolshevik Feminist by Barbara Evans Clements is the only one of the three biographies that is factually reliable and historically objective Like the other two biographers Professor Clements tends to view Kollontai through rosetinted glasses but unlike them she is interested in establishing the facts She goes beyond the writings of the Bolsheviks and their admirers for her sources and she realizes that Kollontais own writings are often unreliable Hers is a portrait that is sympathetic excessively so to my mind but it is neither adulatory nor tendentiously distorted In describing the two key episodes of Kollontais life the occupation of the Alexander Nevsky Monastery and the Workers Opposition this is the only book of the three to tell the reader what actually happened Because of their focus none of these books can give an adequate account of feminist issues in Russia before and after the Revolution Much more can be learned from a book like Women in Soviet Society by Gail Warshofsky Lapidus University of California Press 1978 which I read concurrently with the three biographies A fascinating and scrupulously fair treatment of the subject it is also an instance of feminist history at its most informative and rewarding Having long respected Alexandra Kollontai on the strength of her reputation as a feminist and sexual liberationist I was astounded at the extent to which reading these three admiring biographies and then checking some of their sources made me dislike her Against their authors intentions the books showed me that Kollontais feminism was hostile to most women such as peasants or intellectuals predicated on coercion and doomed to failure because she let it be used by men for whom feminist rhetoric was a tool for gaining and extending their own power The modern Western womens movement which is run by women tolerates diversity and seeks to achieve its aims through nonviolent means has much more in common with such earlier Russian figures as Anna Filosofova or Ariadna Tyrkova than with Kollontais totalitarian fanaticism
"IDEOLOGY ASIDE, NEW CONGRESS IS LIKELY TO STAY NEAR THE CENTER",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/04/weekinreview/ideology-aside-new-congress-is-likely-to-stay-near-the-center.html,Things are going to be different around here Democratic Representative Morris K Udall mused recently I dont think the country wants us to turn back the clock but they want us to slow down to digest what weve swallowed After Election Day there was much talk about America taking a sharp turn to the right and the new Congress that opens for business tomorrow is clearly more conservative than the one that just left town Republicans will hold a threevote edge in the Senate the first time the party has controlled either chamber in 26 years And while the Democrats still cling to a 26vote margin in the House a coalition of conservatives from both parties is expected to exert a great deal of influence The Senate is due to open confirmation hearings on Mr Reagans cabinet nominees this week After these are completed  perhaps by Inauguration Day if Senator Howard H Baker Jr the new majority leader has his way  Congress will turn to what has been billed as the main business of this session the economy Republicans and their conservative allies on and off Capitol Hill have plenty of ideas for dealing with inflation and a plethora of other noneconomic difficulties But as Representative Udall suggests the actual process of forging legislation and governing the country is difficult and compli cated In Congressional legislating most of the game is played between the 30yard lines The great forces of inertia and compromise that in the past have frequently pushed liberal and conservative players toward the middle of the field wont be lacking in the 97th Congress For one thing moderate Republicans particularly in the Senate seem ready to join Democrats in blocking the more extreme conservative measures particularly in the area of civil rights There is talk of using the filibuster a tactic many moderates once fervently denounced when the conservatives used it At the same time some liberals  in light of what happened to many of their bretheren Nov4  may edge much nearer the center themselves For another although ideological conservatives made a lot of noise during the campaign they havent so far turned up in great numbers among Mr Reagans closest advisers and prospective cabinet officers who will be shaping the Administrations own legislative proposals By and large the Presidentelect has shown a distinct preference for professional managers in the mold of Caspar W Weinberger the nominee for Secretary of Defense Mr Reagans aides say he wont repeat Jimmy Carters mistakes in dealing with Capitol Hill and stands ready to consult regularly with Congressional leaders including House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr Above all the Republicans new responsibilities in the words of Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi the Republican whip have had a sobering effect Adds Strom Thurmond of South Carolina who will head the Senate Judiciary Committee All legislation of any consequence is a compromise You have to recognize that In the coming months this process of compromise is likely to be severely tested in the following areas The Budget  There appears to be broad support on Capitol Hill for higher defense spending and lower taxes but many Congressmen are expected to fall to squabbling when it comes to specific budget cuts Every dollar in the current budget has a defender An initial test will come when Mr Reagan tries to fulfill his campaign pledge to cut the 1981 budget by 2 percent or about 18 billion according to current figures At the same time he will have to revise Mr Carters proposed budget for 1982 For both documents the Presidentelect has yet to identify his proposed reductions Many hit lists are circulating likely targets will be such survivors of the war on poverty as the Legal Services program Taxes  Mr Reagan continues to espouse the KempRoth proposal which would cut taxes by 10 percent a year for three years Senator Robert Dole new chairman of the Finance Committee prefers a more modest oneyear bill and may well get his way In addition to personal income tax relief any package is likely to include accelerated depreciation for business investments in plant and equipment and perhaps a cut in capital gains taxes Social Welfare  Most Republicans are convinced that if they are to somehow seize control of Government spending they must reduce the massive entitlement programs that account for more than half the Federal budget One probable target is the food stamp program whose benefits have recently been raised by 115 percent because of increases in the rate of inflation A move is likely to reduce eligibility standards and limit the program to the truly needy Proposals also have been advanced for trimming Social Security benefits and raising the retirement age but any attempted alteration in that program would mean a protracted fight One of the few possible innovations from this Congress is tuition tax credits a plan that appeals to many conservatives and Roman Catholics a growing segment of the Republican electorate  who send their children to private schools Civil Rights  Conservatives threaten to amend or repeal the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and to propose constitutional amendments that would ban abortion and courtordered school busing and restore prayer to the classroom But amendments are hard to pass so conservatives might try to accomplish the same purposes by cutting off funds to certain Government agencies such as the Justice Department or restricting the jurisdiction of Federal courts Military Spending  The Pentagons budget will certainly rise the questions are how high and what new weapons systems will be funded President Carter will evidently propose a supplemental appropriation for 1981 of about 62 billion Reagan advisers are pushing for an increase of 20 billion But many Democrats and some newly influential Republicans are not ready to give the Pentagon a blank check they agree with Representative James R Jones the new chairman of the Budget Committee when he says that no budget item should be sacrosanct Foreign Affairs  The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty is dead and few foreign issues seem to have a high priority Disputes could come over proposals to repeal the grain embargo against the Soviet Union and equip F15 fighters sold to Saudi Arabia with advanced refueling devices But the overriding concern of the Congress and the Reagan Administration will probably be the economy In the 1982 round of Congressional elections many voters will judge the Republicans on whether life has gotten any easier Already some of the new Republican powers on Capitol Hill seem to be making tentative excuses We cant work miracles Senator Dole said recently
REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: TIES THAT BIND EAST EUROPE SEEM TO BE GETTING LOOSER,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/04/world/reporter-s-notebook-ties-that-bind-east-europe-seem-to-be-getting-looser.html,The Communist countries of Eastern Europe appear to be going their separate ways to a degree unthinkable a decade ago Their diversity in attitudes and policies has been spotlighted lately in their responses to the political and economic crisis in Poland the chill of which the nearest Communist countries feel deeply but which is looked upon by the more distant Communist nations with indifference bordering in some cases on contempt In both Prague and East Berlin for example there were press reactions to the worsening of Polands labor unrest in early December that echoed those of the Soviet press including publication of a Tass report later withdrawn alleging that antisocialist demonstrations had occurred in a Polish town Soviet divisions were alerted in East Germany and Czechoslovakia as were some Czechoslovak units in the forests next to Poland East Germany even took the step of virtually sealing its frontier to Polish travelers At the other extreme Bulgarias press even though it normally follows the Soviet line faithfully has simply played down the Polish crisis devoting more space as a Communist official observed here to its preoccupation with ancient Balkan rivalries over who owns Macedonia and its interest in better relations with neighboring Greece In Belgrade several young intellectuals voiced disdain for the events in Poland Who cares about Poland remarked a young lawyer We have our own worries There is a coffee shortage here Even in such nearby countries as East Germany Czechoslovakia and Hungary the traveler encounters striking differences in perceptions of the Polish troubles which officials explain as deriving from historical traditions as well as specific national interests All of the Communistruled countries of Europe are bound to Poland by substantial trade connections as well as varying degrees of economic collaboration based on the principle of the division of labor With the exception of independent Yugoslavia these countries have also been bound together since 1955 in the military alliance known as the Warsaw Pact which includes the Soviet Union Poland East Germany Czechoslovakia Hungary Rumania and Bulgaria In addition they have been partners in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance the Sovietbloc equivalent of the Common Market for the last 30 years Yugoslavia has observer status in it and trades heavily with the full members As a leading Communist Party official in Budapest explained in an interview last month the Soviet bloc is like a family and when one member gets in trouble the rest feel it Highranking officials in both East Berlin and Prague pointed out in similar discussions that the failure of Polands strikebound coal mines to deliver anthracite that their countries had contracted forced East German and Czechoslovak enterprises to shut down for lack of fuel A recent walk down the long corridors of Pragues Baroquestyle Cernin Palace the home of the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs was like a walk in a coal mine so dark was it We have lights every 30 feet along the corridor ceilings but we turned off most of the bulbs to save energy a Czechoslovak official remarked It is our contribution to overcoming the energy crisis Eastern Europe has been a dark place in the winter ever since the end of World War II But recent energysaving moves have made it darker than a decade ago and some of the darkness has come about because no coal is coming out of the huge mines of Polish Silesia That and the sudden invasions of East Germany Czechoslovakia and Hungary by hundreds of thousands of Polish consumers in the shops of border towns and in the capitals seeking to purchase what was no longer available in Polish stores has brought Polands crisis into the everyday lives of their Communist neighbors in the most direct and not always welcome manner The Polish troubles involving a virtual breakdown of the economy and subsequent loss of political control by Polands ruling Communist Party has sent some shivers down the spines of every other Communist Central Committee in Eastern Europe judging by conversations with highranking party officials in four capitals They remember something like the Polish crisis happening in Prague in 1968 in Budapest in 1956 and in East Berlin in 1953 provoking armed Soviet intervention on each of these occasions and great bloodshed in the case of the Hungarian uprising 24 years ago So Polands 1980 crisis has made the Communist leaders along the periphery wonder about their own futures While as Communists they maintain that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with the Sovietoriginated system they acknowledge that carrying out the system of oneparty rule and centrally controlled economies and collectivized agriculture except in Poland and Yugoslavia varies greatly from country to country in Eastern Europe as do the results The rules are the same in every socialist country a Hungarian party leader said in an interview Methods differ from one country to another Habits differ for historical reasons and there is the human factor When I joined the party I believed that once we took power all problems would be solved Now I realize that were in front of the big problems You have to work every day and on a mass basis and what ever happens we are responsible Conversations with Communist officials in Belgrade Budapest East Berlin and Prague revealed a familiar kind of defensiveness  born of ingrained suspicion of any Western discussion partner  combined this time with a degree of despair over the size of the political and economic problems confronting all of the party leaderships In Belgrade it was despair over the continuation of inflation at an annual rate of more than 30 percent and the increasing foreign debt In Budapest the subject was the drastic shifts projected for the Hungarian economy in the next fiveyear plan which involves an overall annual rate of growth of 3 percent but which is supposed to bring a 20 percent rate of growth in some industrial sectors The Hungarians responsible for the plan are painfully aware of the severe dislocations that such unevenness in development can bring In East Berlin the party leaders were pleased with last years gross national product growth of 45 percent and the plans for a 5 percent growth rate in 1981 But they are unhappy about the chill in relations with West Germany on which East Germany depends for a fair portion of its relative prosperity They place the blame mainly on Helmut Schmidt the West German Chancellor whom they accuse of having personally insulted their President and party chief Erich Honecker by cancelling a scheduled visit last September with a brusque telephone call instead of a polite written note as is diplomatically customary Mr Honecker several of his aides said might have even accepted Mr Schmidts pretext for cancellation the Polish crisis  on its face were it not for the manner of its delivery although the East German leadership maintains that relations with West Germany have an intrinsic importance that supersedes whatever happens in Poland A highranking East Berlin official said that his Government was annoyed again when Klaus Bolling Bonns newly designated envoy to East Germany paid his first official call Dec 22 in West Berlin on that citys Mayor Dietrich Stobbe instead of in East Berlin where he is to be accredited Who does he think he is growled an East Berlin official In Prague the preoccupations are a bit different According to wellplaced Communist officials there is a residue of anxiety in the leadership that has to do with memories of the breakdown of party authority in Czechoslovakias 1968 crisis and the lack of enthusiastic broad support for the present Government of President Gustav Husak We are scared of change said a Czechoslovak Communist and yet we must live with change or wither away So whenever the Government tries to alter pay scales or increase work quotas and Czechoslovak workers protest the authorities invariably cave in As in the past relief is sought in jokes which sprout and spread even in the snow cover and darkness of winter providing a kind of social nourishment In Budapest one hears that the Pope asks God two questions and learns to his satisfaction that there will be neither female priests nor abortion rights in the Roman Catholic Church during his lifetime Then he asks God a third question as a Pole Lord will the Polish economy ever stand on its own two feet in my lifetime the Pope asks No my son not in your lifetime and not in My lifetime either God responds Nineteen days in four capitals is too short a time to draw pervasive conclusions about the ways in which the Eastern European Communist countries are developing But it is apparent that much has changed the multitude of private automobiles that make traffic on some of East Berlins broad avenues resemble that of Manhattan new and convenient subways in Prague and Budapest shops with plentiful supplies in contrast to the shortages of only a few years ago and the ability of Hungarians and Yugoslavs to travel all over the world which millions of them do every year Such freedoms are not uniform in the Soviet bloc however A 25yearold Czechoslovak said Id need four different sets of clearances before I got the passport to travel in the West and theres no way Ill get them Big deal All Id do is spend two weeks going to Switzerland Austria and West Germany just to look around Then Id come back But they wont even let me try East German Bulgarian and Rumanian youths are similarly constrained The Soviet presence remains enormous in East Europe but it is visible only in terms of an occasional jeep of the Soviet Army or in the increasing number of Soviet tourists passing through Nor do people talk about their big brother it seems Conversations with scores of Eastern Europeans of various stations turned up only one who even mentioned the Soviet Union or its people that was a Czechoslovak official who said simply to the Western traveler You should really visit Moscow once Still with all the certainty of a continuation of the Soviet presence in Eastern Europe one is impressed by the signs of growing diversity and of a greater sense of national identity sometimes of revived national pride especially in countries like East Germany and Hungary where the economies are doing relatively well It is to be seen in the diversity of growth rates in the differing degrees and qualities of ties with Western countries and in the domestic preoccupations of individual East Germans Czechs Slovaks Rumanians Bulgars Yugoslavs Hungarians and of course the Poles While the ties that bind including the presence of Soviet troops and economic collaboration are strong the centrifugal forces seem to be growing stronger too
Feminist Health Clinics,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/04/magazine/l-feminist-health-clinics-209057.html,Allow me to share some of the insights I have had while working at several womens health clinics including the first legal abortion clinic in the United States the Womens Medical Center in New York City A New Era for Feminist Health Clinics by Paula Span Nov 23 Things have changed incredibly during the last 10 years While the hostility between the medical profession and women was well founded at the beginning of the last decade we now indeed are seeing a new era in health care In my last job as director of a womencontrolled womenowned womens healthcare clinic we employed about 10 doctors Each of these doctors male and female was extremely responsive toward the patients needs Part of the reason I believe was that the doctors we chose were residents and therefore had more progressive attitudes than their older colleagues Another reason and more important I think was that the women who worked at the clinic believed the doctors were cooperative and they saw them as colleagues not authority figures MERLE S GOLDBERG President International Womens Health Coalition Washington Feminist Health
A TOUGH '81 SESSION LOOMING IN ALBANY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/05/nyregion/a-tough-81-session-looming-in-albany.html,Criminal justice rent control gambling aid for mass transportation and most of all how to spend New York States money will be among the major issues facing the Legislature when it returns to Albany this week The 204th session of the Assembly and Senate which opens Wednesday will be forced by the law and the courts to face many issues it does not want to face and will be prevented by a lack of money from doing many of the things it wants to do That is expected to make this session difficult and frustrating even though it is not a state election year many of the issues have been debated before and the political mix of the people dealing with them will be about same Democrats firmly in control in the Assembly Republicans dominating the Senate Legislators or interest groups or local governments or anybody who has a concern about things that are going on in Albany are going to be in for a big surprise if they think this is going to be an uninteresting session said Richard J Roth spokesman for the Senates Republican majority leader Warren M Anderson This doesnt look like an off year Political leaders and their aides point for example to these problems that must be faced  The laws putting about 700000 New York City apartments under rent stabilization expire but the sharp change in the citys rental market  higher rents and a shortage of apartments  may make a simple renewal of the statute less likely than when it last expired four years ago Rent control laws for 100000 suburban and upstate apartments must be reviewed as well A task force of the incoming Reagan Administration has recommended denying Federal funds to cities that have rent control but state officials do not believe that Presidentelect Ronald Reagan will press that point after he takes office  The issue of state Medicaid financing of abortions will certainly return but since the last time it was considered the United States Supreme Court has ruled that states have no obligation to pay for this operation That is likely to harden the positions of abortion foes who have vowed to do anything they can to stop this spending  The Legislature has set a deadline of May 15 for formulating a solution to the states problem of finding a more equitable method of property asssessment And the state courts may also issue a final ruling this year in the continuing legal battle over the discrepancies among the amounts that are spent to educate pupils in various school districts  A Federal court is considering a challenge to the constitutionality of the states new tax on oil companies which finances mass transportation around the state If that is struck down the state government will have to struggle through another messy political battle over how to pay for its transit systems particularly the deficitridden Metropolitan Transportation Authority  Following court abolition of the states minimum price system for wine the Legislature will be asked by Governor Carey to extend that deregulation by abolishing all price controls on wine and liquor at the wholesale and retail levels Serious Budget Questions As tough to resolve as these issues may be the budget will be worse Governor Carey has been preaching about hard times for months asserting that he is working with a 198182 budget that started out with an 800 million deficit The Speaker of the Democraticled Assembly Stanley Fink of Brooklyn has also gone on record as acknowledging that this year will be very austere although he has shown in the past that his definition of austerity and the Governors can be hundreds of millions of dollars apart A spokesman for Speaker Fink agreed that the budget which is expected to be about 16 billion will be the issue The big question is going to be how are you going to divide up the pie There is also expected to be a renewed push for a new accounting system that would make it easier to understand how big the pie really is Dealing with these problems will be roughly the same numbers of Democrats and Republicans The Assembly will be in Democratic control with 85 Democrats and one Liberal who is expected to side with the Democrats against 64 Republicans The Senate as before will be under Republican control 35 to 25 with all but two of its members incumbents Among other major issues they are expected to face are these Criminal Justice As they have for the last several years proponents of the death penalty are expected to push soon after the opening of the session for reinstatement of capital punishment for some types of murder Governor Carey has remained firm in his resolve to veto the measure Assembly Speaker Fink said yesterday that supporters of the measure were getting close to though still short of the 100 votes they would need to override a veto Leaders of the Democraticled Assembly have already called for a substantial increase in spending to put more police on the streets in highcrime areas and to expand the court system and the prisons to handle the resulting cases Governor Carey in his State of the State message is expected to make a series of criminaljustice proposals some of them similar The Legislature may also begin to act on some of the proposals recommended by a commission on sentencing last year Among the suggestions are some additional limits on plea bargaining and on the discretion that judges have in sentencing criminals Mr Carey is also expected to repeat his call for constitutional amendments to restructure the states various trial courts into a single statewide system and to provide for appointment rather than election of many judges The merger is given some chance of acceptance the socalled merit selection proposal is given little hope in the Legislature Education The Legislature is expected to continue to move gradually toward equal spending per pupil in the states public schools a goal that court decisions indicate will eventually have to be achieved Speaker Fink has indicated he will press for more financing for community colleges around the state which he says have been highly successful in giving technical education to people who remain in New York State and the Senate has indicated its interest as well The Senate meanwhile is talking about making more students eligible for the states Tuition Assistance Program by relaxing some of the limits on income The Legislature also is expected to battle over making teaching a licensed profession The State Board of Regents has already approved some elements of a plan but to enact it would require state money  and thus the Legislatures assent Casino Gambling In a latehour compromise at the last session the Legislature approved eight possible constitutional amendments to permit casino gambling in New York State They offer a variety of options for publicly run and privately run casinos in various parts of the state This session will be asked to decide which if any of the options get presented to the voters and whether some agreement can be found is an open question Housing In addition to rent control and stabilization the Legislature is expected to seek more help for the states MitchellLama housing projects A bailout aimed largely at the two financially shakiest developments  Coop City in the Bronx and Rochedale Village in Queens  was enacted at last Novembers special session But other proposals such as changes to make it easier for the state to enforce the terms of mortgages and aid for poorer tenants hardhit by sharp rent increases were deferred Also expiring are some of the regulations that prevent the evictions of some tenants  such as the elderly and handicapped  when rental housing is being converted to cooperatives And Mayor Kochs stopgap bill preventing the eviction of some loft tenants enacted last November will lapse as well this June Labor Laws providing for binding arbitration for the contracts of policemen and firefighters outside New York City expire this year as does the evercontroversial heart bill which allows and police officers and firefighters to retire at threequarters pay if they develop a heart ailment during their term of service In addition the most recent revision of the states complicated public employee pension system expires this year and must be reviewed and renewed Governor Carey will be asked once again by the Legislature to increase pension benefits for some public employees  which he vetoed last year  and he is expected to be somewhat more willing to accept the plan Although the 1980 census has been completed legal challenges to the figures are likely to delay any legislative action on reapportionment until after the regular session Finally many sections of the states unemployment insurance system expire this year including the laws governing the level of benefits and the experience rating plan which determines how much different industries pay into the states unemployment insurance fund These are expected to be subject to some debate before their renewal

"LIBERAL GROUP RATES THE SENATE, BUT DISCOUNTS A SHIFT TO THE LEFT",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/05/us/liberal-group-rates-the-senate-but-discounts-a-shift-to-the-left.html,Americans for Democratic Action a national liberal organization issued its ratings of the 1980 voting records of United States Senators today describing an apparent liberal trend as merely a concerted effort to hold back the spread of conservatism The organizations ratings of Senators voting patterns rose in 1980 because moderates were forced to vote with liberals to stop harmful legislation the group said Despite the shift a spokesman for the group said that conservatives had killed welfare reform aid to victims of domestic violence youth unemployment legislation and a fair housing enforcement bill that supporters called the most important civil rights legislation of the decade The average rating for 1980 was 46 percent as against 38 percent in 1979 meaning that the average Senator agreed with the organizations positions in 46 percent of his votes on 18 topics Democrats were rated an average of 58 percent 10 percentage points higher than in 1979 Republicans averaged 29 percent  up from 23 in 1979 Northern Democrats got a 66 percent rating up from 61 and Southern Democrats got a 42 percent rating up from 26 The groups national director Leon Shull said These figures do not indicate that the Senate has grown more liberal over the past year Instead they show that conservatives began to take the initiative in the Senate and that moderates were forced to side with the liberals to prevent harmful legislation from passing Lower Ratings Expected Indications are that the next round of the groups ratings will be lower because Republicans have taken control of the Senate with conservative candidates defeating many veteran liberals In the future we may not have the necessary votes to fight off the rightwing legislative onslaught Mr Shull said Eight Senators all Democrats scored more than 80 percent in the ratingsThe voting topics examined included such issues as limiting Federal spending to a set percentage of national output draft registration the MX missile arms control disaster aid to Nicaragua abortion and Federal safety inspections of small business The highest rating 94 percent went to Carl Levin Democrat of Michigan Others with high ratings all Democrats were Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin who was defeated by a conservative in November 89 Paul ETsongas of Massachusetts 89 Alan Cranston of California 83 Patrick J Leahy of Vermont 83 Howard M Metzenbaum of Ohio 83 Donald W Riegle Jr of Michigan 83 and Paul S Sarbanes of Maryland 83 A Zero for Goldwater Three senators all Republicans scored below 10 percent Barry Goldwater of Arizona got a zero rating and Gordon J Humphrey of New Hampshire and John G Tower of Texas both got a 6 percent rating for voting with the ADA position one time Eighteen Democrats had scores of 72 or more Three Republicans scored 72 percent John H Chafee of Rhode Island Charles McC Mathias Jr of Maryland and Lowell P Weicker Jr of Connecticut Three Senators in the metropolitan New York area besides Senator Weicker scored 72 percent They were Daniel P Moynihan Democrat of New York and Harrison A Williams Jr and Bill Bradley both Democrats of New Jersey Lower in the ratings were Jacob K Javits Republican of New York at 61 percent and Abraham A Ribicoff Democrat of Connecticut 56 The liberal group has been rating Senators legislative records since 1947 Its marking system counts absences as votes against the ADA position so some prominent liberals such as Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts who was on the Presidential campaign trail much of the year did not get high ratings
No Headline,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/06/us/no-headline-211915.html,lican Senators Page B10 NEW CONGRESS HARMONY AND SKIRMISHES BY MARTIN TOLCHIN WASHINGTON Jan 5  The 97th Congress convened today and different parties took control of the House and Senate for the first time since 1932 their pledges of bipartisan cooperation quickly giving way to partisan verbal skirmishes The new more conservative Congress convened in a party atmosphere with children running through the aisles of the House while some freshmen members bottlefed infants on their laps and family members and friends waved from the galleries The session is expected to focus on the economy budget taxes national defense the American role in world affairs proposed cutbacks in social programs and possibly on such issues as abortion busing and organized prayer in schools Diminished Status for Democrats In the Senate Democrats appeared to be adjusting to their diminished status by accepting the inevitability of the confirmation of Alexander M Haig Jr Presidentelect Ronald Reagans nominee for Scretary of State In the House however Democratic leaders sought rules changes and favorable committee ratios to ward off a possible alliance between Republicans and conservative Democrats In the House where the Democrats are still in the majority Representative Thomas P ONeill Jr Democrat of Massachusetts was elected to his third term as Speaker We intend to adapt to changed circumstances to seek the common ground with the other body and the new President Mr ONeill said When differences occur as they no doubt will we will air them in an atmosphere of constructive dialogue rather than partisan recrimination The Republicancontrolled Senate meanwhile was brought to order by Vice President Walter F Mondale in one of his last official acts Many senators commented on the increased spaces between desks on the Democratic side of the aisle and the more crowded area of the Republicans who last controlled the chamber in 1954 The last time different parties controlled the House and Senate was in 1932 when the majority of senators were Republicans and most of members of the House were Democrats Senate Leaders Trade Quips Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina the senior Republican was elected president pro tempore of the Senate Senator John C Stennis of Mississippi as the senior Democrat was nominated for the post by Senator Robert C Byrd Democrat of West Virginia the new minority leader who said I have some doubt with respect to the outcome as I look about me I see the slightly thinned ranks of Democrats and look at the other side and see the slightly bloated ranks of the Republicans Senator Howard H Baker Jr Republican of Tennessee the new majority leader replied It is often said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder What may seem bloated on their side seems like simply political justice on this side Pledging not to obstruct the Republican majority Mr Byrd said Well cooperate where we can when the administrations programs make sense and where we differ well differ constructively Opening day was nevertheless marked by partisan arguments especially in the House where Republicans bitterly assailed committee ratios that they felt unduly benefited the Democrats Although the Democrats now control the chamber by a percentage of 56 to 44 they will control the House Rules Committee by a ration of 11 to 5 the Ways and Means Committee by 2 to 1 and the Appropriations Committee by 3 to 2 These ratios were adopted by partyline votes Ratios Assailed by Republicans Representative Barber B Conable Jr Republican of upstate New York the ranking minority member of the Ways and Means Committee said power should be fairly used and it is not being fairly used in this respect But Representative Jim Wright Democrat of Texas the majority leader countered Just as the American people chose a Republican to sit in the White House so the American people chose a Democratic majority in the House In another move the Republican House leaders sought a rules change that would hold the Federal budget to 225 perof the Gross National Product or from 706 to 720 billion in the fiscal year 1982 but were defeated They also sought to remove Rules Committee jurisdiction over the budgets presentation on the House floor When it comes to House rules only one rule applies the Speaker wins and we lose Representative Bob Michel of Illinois the Republican leader told the House Charge of Partisan Exercise But Representative Jim Jones Democrat of Oklahoma the new budget chairman termed the proposal basically a partisan exercise intended to embarass the Democrats Senator Baker called for televised coverage of Senate proceedings saying that we have the votes to assure such coverage He said he considered television simply an electronic extension of the public galleries The Senate is scheduled to begin confirmation hearings on Mr Reagans Cabinet nominees tomorrow with the hope of completing the confirmation process by Inauguration Day Jan 20 The House however has little to occupy it for the next two weeks Both bodies are expected to hold pro forma sessions until Jan 19th
REAGAN'S LIAISON CHIEF ON CAPITOL HILL TO FOCUS ON HARMONY AS HIS PRIORITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/06/us/reagan-s-liaison-chief-on-capitol-hill-to-focus-on-harmony-as-his-priority.html,The Hill is a very unforgiving place observed Max L Friedersdorf who will be the chief link with the Congress for the Reagan White House If you make one mistake they remember it forever if you do something right you never hear about it Mr Friedersdorf who was a Congressional lobbyist for Presidents Nixon and Ford indicated today that he was determined to avoid making that first mistake At a breakfast meeting with reporters he outlined his strategy for wooing and winning Congressional support His aim is to pay very close attention from the beginning to requests and communications from Congress Plans to Cultivate Democrats Specifically he intends to cultivate conservative Congressional Democrats whose support he seeks so as to give Republicans a working majority in the House which unlike the Senate continues to be controlled by Democrats To gain such support Mr Friedersdorf said that Presidentelect Ronald Reagan would meet privately this week with key Democratic and Republican legislators A meeting is especially sought with Representative Jim Jones Democrat of Oklahoma who will become head of the House Budget Committee Mr Jones said today that he had not been contacted about such a meeting but that he would welcome one Paying close attention to Congressional desires Mr Friedersdorf said would mean having someone practically live in the majority and minority leaders offices It would also require cultivation of ranking Democratic committee members as well as Republican chairmen he said because its a lot easier to change legislation in committee than on the House or Senate floor Mr Reagan also plans to hold regular bipartisan leadership meetings at least once every three weeks or more often if warranted he said Priorities May Be Revised Mr Friedersdorf indicated that good Congressional relations might require that the administration downgrade the priority of legislation on controversial social issues such as busing and abortion Were going to concentrate on economics he said Mr Friedersdorf also hopes to avoid the mistakes of the Carter White House whose Congressional relations office has been frequently criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike For one thing he said he intends to have a small staff but one familiar with Capitol Hill They got off to a bad start he said of the Carter Administrations Congressional office headed by Frank Moore Frank was chastised for four years for not returning one telephone call Mr Friedersdorf 51 years old is welcome in most offices on Capitol Hill He was a newspaperman in his native Indiana and in 1961 became an administrative assistant to Representative Richard L Roudebush Republican of Indiana In 1970 he was appointed associate director for Congressional relations with the Office of Economic Opportunity and two years later he went to the White House Congressional Liaison office as deputy director Last month he resigned his post as chairman of the Federal Election Commission to take the White House post for Presidentelect Reagan Current Relations Beautiful Mr Friedersdorf a tall silverhaired man who exudes confidence described the current state of ExecutiveCongressional relations as beautiful He cautioned however that relations between the two branches were bound to become strained at times This is a thankless job he said Youre the ham in the sandwich between the White House and Capitol Hill Mr Friedersdorf said however that he was optimistic that the honeymoon might persist despite the inevitable tensions Its a little like feline amour there has to be a fair amount of yowling and scratching before theres mutual pleasure he said He predicted that the Senate would confirm Alexander M Haig Jr as Secretary of State and James Watt as Secretary of the Interior before Mr Reagans inauguration If the entire Cabinet is confirmed by then he said they might possibly be sworn in on Capitol Hill on Inauguration Day A swearingin ceremony in Congress would be a symbol of Mr Reagans desire for a close working relationship with Congress he said
EDUCATION 'ANALYSTS' WIN BATTLE IN WAR OF PHILOSOPHY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/06/science/education-analysts-win-battle-in-war-of-philosophy.html,BOSTON AS in Athens so in America Philosophers disagree sometimes with passion Last week in a battle fought with virtually every traditional academic weapon short of hemlock proponents of analytic philosophy reasserted their control of the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association At the divisions annual meeting here the analysts soundly defeated candidates of a coalition of pluralists who charge that they have been unfairly excluded from positions of leadership The debate marked by personal acrimony as well as philosophical differences dramatized the political nature of the worlds oldest academic profession All academic fields have factions and personality conficts said John J McDermott a pluralist from Texas A and M In philosophy the issue seems to be whether some of us are actually in the profession Since World War II the analytic approach to philosophy has been dominant in American universities Primarily a product of such 20thcentury thinkers as Ludwig Wittgenstein and Bertrand Russell it seeks to clarify traditional problems of philosophy through logic and by careful analysis of language and concepts Philosophy is a continuation at a more abstract or inclusive level of the natural sciences said Willard Quine of Harvard University one of the greatest of contemporary American analytic philosophers The opposing term pluralist describes not a single approach but a variety of nonanalytical schools including phenomenology existentialism metaphysics and the American pragmatism that grew from the thought of John Dewey and William James Unlike the analysts they see philosophy as a way of describing the world rather than analyzing thoughts and they see themselves as heirs to the philosophers and issues of the past In discussing the ethics of abortion for example an analytical philosopher might begin by analyzing terms such as nonvoluntary while a representative of one of the pluralist schools might start by describing a situation in which an abortion took place Pluralists charge that analysts fascination with logic and highly technical arguments  coupled with their acknowledged indifference to the history of philosophy  is driving undergraduate students away from philosophy courses In schools like Vanderbilt and Stony Brook where pluralists are represented on the faculties you get as much as 15 percent of students enrolled in philosophy courses at any given time said Donald Idhe a professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook At places like Maryland or Pittsburgh where the analysts are dominant you get only about five percent The struggle between the two factions broke out at last years convention of the Eastern Division when the Committee on Pluralism successfully challenged the official slate of officers The dissidents managed to elect John E Smith of Yale as vice president and captured the other two available elective seats on the 10member executive committee Professor Smith now moves up to the presidency of the 3000member division At last weeks convention the analysts fought back A letter was circulated over the signatures of nine past presidents charging that the Committee on Pluralism seeks to obtain through political means a position of influence which its members have not been able to obtain through their philosophical work The Pluralists Lose Again The counterstrike succeeded When the votes were counted Adolf Grunbaum of the University of Pittsburgh an analytic philosopher who had lost the election last year won the vicepresidency over William Barrett the New York University professor who was the pluralist entry The pluralist candidates for the executive committee John Lachs of Vanderbilt University and Sandra Rosenthal of Loyola in New Orleans were also defeated The rhetoric of the political debate left little doubt that the participants were professional philosophers At a rally organized by pluralists on the eve of the election Bruce Wilshire of Rutgers University said that he looked forward to a day when the various groups and parts of it will define themselves as parts of the whole not parts which are the whole Privately the two sides frequently engaged in personal attacks A Yale analyst described one pluralist colleague as a joke and another as not a serious contributor to philosophical literature Professor Lachs riposted for the pluralists How about those who have the political power without philosophical distinction Underlying the conflict are some fundamental nonintellectual tensions within philosophy As in other fields there has been a dispersion of talent beyond such traditional bastions of influence as Harvard Princeton Michigan and more recently Pittsburgh and departments at universities such as Vanderbilt Kansas and Arizona have become increasingly visible The pluralists most of whom come from such newer institutions claim that the structure of the APA does not reflect this democratization Its a revolt of the provinces against the Northeast said Mr Lachs No William James at Harvard The pluralists also claim that analysts conspire to keep nonanalytic philosophy out of the influential journals and that they do not regard the pluralist approaches as serious philosophy It would be most unusual for example for a student at Harvard to do a dissertation on Dewey or James Analysts readily concede that they are not particularly familiar with the opposition Professor Quine asked whether individual pluralists might be exceptions to the generalizations in the letter he signed replied I suppose so but I dont know their work A variously attributed saying in higher education is that academic politics are so bitter because so little is at stake At the convention this became a serious issue Pluralists argued that by controlling the association the analysts are in a position to advise foundations and the National Endowment for the Humanities where to distribute their grants suggest experts to evaluate departments determine who presents and publishes scholarly papers and influence who gets jobs and who does not The analysts however deny that such power flows from the organization Philosophers do philosophy not associations said Ruth Marcus of Yale I cant think of a single occasion where the APA was called upon to compose a council or make a grant for someone The Eastern division voted last week to elect future officers by mail ballot Pluralists said this procedure would give a voice to philosophers from smaller institutions who cannot afford to come to the meetings One analyst disputed this conclusion however saying they will still vote for the people they read Professor McDermott formerly a professor at Queens College in New York City noted that there is not a single major philosophy

NEW CONSERVATIVE COALITION; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/07/us/new-conservative-coalition-news-analysis.html,A conservative coalition of Republicans and Sun Belt Democrats that could well dominate the House of Representatives particularly on economic and military issues is starting to emerge on Capitol Hill If the budding alliance flourishes over the next two years it would make it much easier for Presidentelect Ronald Reagan to move his legislative program through Congress As a result of last Novembers election the Republicans already hold a sixvote edge in the Senate the first time they have controlled either chamber in 26 years The nascent coalition faces sizable obstacles in attempting to move the legislature to the right All legislation requires compromise and the task of developing a consensus tends to moderate extreme positions on both sides of the spectrum Yesterday for instance Republican leaders in the House conceded that they no longer favored a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget and instead preferred a flat lid on Federal spending The spending lid a much less drastic remedy than the constitutional amendment can command a broader consensus in Congress said Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York a leading Republican conservative Moreover Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr one of the last of the oldline liberals left in Congress still commands great personal respect When House Democrats apportioned committee assignments today Mr ONeill spoke out in favor of only two candidates and both won handily Aggressive Young Liberals A third stumbling block is that a group of young and aggressive liberals on the Democratic side are now discussing ways to use the same delaying tactics against conservative initiatives that Republican used against Democrats in the last Congress The conservative Democrats strengthened their hand today when they placed three of their stalwarts on key House Committees Representative Kent Hance of Texas on Ways and Means Representative Wes Watkins of Oklahoma on Appropriations and Representative Phil Gramm of Texas on Budget Historically Republicans have allied with Southern Democrats or Dixiecrats to promote conservative views on social and civil rights issues But the Dixiecrats have been transformed into what might be called Suncrats those who represent the booming areas of the South and Southwest and are more concerned with economics than with racial or social issues Its economics strictly economics asserted Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi the Republican whip who is a leading force behind the conservative coalition Were not talking about abortion or busing were talking about budget controls spending cuts and tax rate cuts Conservatives Perceive Trend Conservative Democrats became more aggressive after the last election because they felt the country was starting to swing their way Liberal Democrats insisted Representative Gramm of Texas are out of step with the thinking of the American people The Democrats lost 33 seats in the House reducing their margin to 51 seats and the defection of 26 members to the Republicans could cost the Democrats control Right after the election Mr Gramm and others analyzed House voting records and invited about 35 of the most conservative Democrats enough to hold the balance of power to form a new group called the Democratic Forum How these complicated relationships will evolve is still uncertain Most analysts here now expect the conservatives to make their strongest impact on the issue of increasing military spending while cutting back on domestic expenditures Most analysts expect the first real test of the conservative coalition to come on the Federal budget

TOMORROW'S CAREER WOMAN AT A CROSSROADS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/10/opinion/l-tomorrow-s-career-woman-at-a-crossroads-217220.html,To the Editor The findings of the Brown University group correlate with preliminary impressions in a pending study of women medical students The women in my sample are bright sophisticated closer even than the college students to achieving feminist goals they are also trained to look at the facts he facts indicated that something is very wrong These highly accomplished women find that they are spending disproportionate amounts of time feeling lonely sad bored Successful careers coupled with meaningful relationships intimacies without past or present in lieu of family are not working out The 1960s womens movement has failed these women because it was not innovative It encouraged the women to enter the male work world but it did not alter that world All qualified women in my college class in 1950 were admitted to medical school  on their terms In interviews we had to pledge not to marry and not to have children while in training We did this with our fingers crossed behind our backs But when we cheated there were severe sanctions I was forced to take a years leave of absence for reasons of health when it was learned at my school that I was pregnant The colleges which are encouraging young women to enter professions are continuing to fail them A few years ago I was asked to speak to premedical students at my old college Barnard and I was struck by the discrepancies between their interests and those of their mentors Abortion and birth control dominated the material at the Womens Center and for the students the issue was career and marriage If these questions were addressed by the mentors I saw no evidence of it and when I tried to discuss this with the two deans who came to hear me I evidently turned them off The most unfortunate consequence of all this is that we are already experiencing the beginnings of a backlash  increasing disenchantment of women with careers It neednt be so I am not as naive as I was years ago when I argued that all work institutions could be redesigned to fit the needs of men and women raising families Nursing mothers cannot be sent into combat and their husbands arent being narcissistic when they refuse to leave work to help with the kids But a number of social institutions can be redesigned to accommodate these complex needs High on the list of priorities are parttime jobs that would enable women to maintain continuity Crucial is the need to change current labor immigration and social policies which have eliminated the mainstay of my generation of working mothers  the availability of nurses and housekeepers Daycare centers as the bright young women in the article perceive cannot address themselves to the problem of children in our culture It is not necessary to be a superwoman to combine family and career But it is necessary to confront our society and force it to change to accommodate these legitimate aspirations EDITH T SHAPIRO D Englewood NJ Dec 30 1980
THE STRUGGLE OF WOMEN DIRECTORS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/11/magazine/the-struggle-of-women-directors.html,The past couple of days had been tough ones for the young film director The filming the day before had involved difficult setups in the middle of Lake Ontario in a pitching boat The weather was foul the schedule tight and a few of the actors were seasick The next morning there was a fire on a set in an old Tudor mansion in Toronto that wiped out four hours of shooting I keep waiting for the panic said Candace OConnor the young Canadian actress who is one of the stars of the film By now this place should be in an absolute uproar I guess a womans just different Annettes being simply marvelous What Annette Cohen and her cast and crew were engaged in is a unique film project an anthology of nine short vignettes on the subject of love all of them written by women Antonia Fraser Liv Ullmann Gael Greene Germaine Greer Mai Zetterling Penelope Gilliatt Nancy Dowd Edna OBrien and Joni Mitchell directed by women Annette Cohen Liv Ullmann Mai Zetterling and Nancy Dowd and produced by a woman Renee Perlmutter a Canadian making her first movie with her own company Coup Films Ltd Love a moderately budgeted internationally financed film is the biggest thing to come along for women in the movie industry since 1933 when Dorothy Arzner directed Katharine Hepburn in Christopher Strong Unfortunately however women directors as a class are not faring well today At the time the four female directors were at work in Toronto there was not a single woman directing cameras on a movie set anywhere in the United States True Claudia Weills Its My Turn has been playing to good audiences throughout the country since it opened in October and Lee Grants Tell Me a Riddle opened last month to generally favorable reviews But for the most part women directors feel the film industry in the United States discriminates against them on an almost unprecedented scale Of course film directing is one of the most exclusive professions in the world with only a handful of men or women ever getting the opportunity to direct a major motion picture If its difficult for men women feel that for them it sometimes seems nearly impossible Men in the film industry from studio bosses to directors are defensive on the subject They acknowledge that sexist attitudes persist but they claim that opportunities for women to direct have never been better The trouble they say is that with one or two exceptions firstrate mainstream women directors have not emerged who combine the creative and leadership qualities needed to handle multimillion dollar projects Many women these men say want to make womens pictures This notion is angrily rejected by aspiring women directors and they are making the industry aware of the depth of their frustration and bitterness The motionpicture industry and television is maleoriented and always has been these women say Movies are still financed by banks and banks they contend are unwilling to bet large sums of money on women directors The women point out that when a male director is temperamental this is often considered part of his artistic genius when a woman is temperamental she is acting like a woman and is not to be trusted When a man produces an expensive flop he is judged as an individual and generally given another chance When one woman fails all women are tainted Whatever the reason the statistics suggest that women are being short shrifted Last June a committee of women members of the Directors Guild of America invited executives of all the major studios and television networks as well as some large independent production companies to a meeting in the guilds Los Angeles headquarters The producers were presented with a package of statistics that pointed out that of the 7332 feature films not including documentaries or films made by small independent production companies released by major distributors during the last 30 years only 14 or twotenths of 1 percent were directed by women And that out of 65500 hours of national network primetime dramatic television for the same period only 115 hours mostly productions concerned with female themes or twotenths of 1 percent were directed by women The statistics may be a little misleading in that they include only feature films released by major distributors and do not include small independent productions  films that did not receive major distribution and promotion  or documentaries industrial and educational films Nor do the television statistics include publictelevision productions which have a better record of employing women directors Nevertheless it is films released by the big distributors that are seen by the larger public these are the films that have the opportunity to make money the rest too often really do not count commercially It may seem also at first glance that in the last few years things have changed for the better Joan Darling directed First Love Joan Tewkesbury directed Old Boyfriends But one look at the production statistics for some representative major studios for 19781979 the last year for which complete statistics are available illustrate graphically what women directors find themselves up against Columbia Studios Feature films Female directors 0 Male 11 Television episodes Female directors 1 Male directors 138 Universal Studios Category feature films Female directors 0 Male directors 17 Television episodes Female directors 2 Male directors 381 Paramount Studios Feature films Female directors 0 Male directors 8 Television episodes Female directors 1 Male directors 211 We know how hard it is for men to become directors in this industry very hard Nell Cox a committee member told the executives at the meeting but the odds against women are apparently 998 percent harder Many of the male executives at the meeting expressed shock and dismay at the statistics and said they had no idea that things were so bad o aid in righting the balance the womens committee proposed an affirmativeaction program and the formation of a resource group of prominent men and women  including such industry heavyweights as Claire Townsend vice president of the production of features at 20th Century Fox and Verna Fields her counterpart at Universal Studios who would meet with selected women directors assess their work and report back to the guild After the meeting a lot of letters went out to production staffs from studio heads who wanted to put themselves on record for supporting the womens aims and who declared their intentions to do better Fundamentally however little has changed as yet During their discussions with executives the committee members emphasized the absence of women from episodic television which is the real center of the film industry today Its where young male directors get their training Its where directors can make a living while learning and polishing their craft  an opportunity that with the exception of soft shows like The Waltons and Family is largely denied to women who are caught in a seemingly inescapable Catch22 situation Women are told they cant direct episodic television or movies because they dont have enough hours of directing under their belt And they cant acquire those hours because no one hires them to direct While men entering the industry encounter similar problems the women claim that their experiences are infinitely worse because of sexism Occasionally the established female star of a television show will direct an episode or two Nancy Walker for example did some Rhodas and Mary Tyler Moores and Penny Marshall did a couple of Laverne  Shirleys But most of the top shows have regular directors who lock themselves into a series and very few of those regulars are women The exclusion operates on every level When she was still a film editor Verna Fields who is widely acknowledged to have saved more directors hides in the cutting room than most of them would care to admit was suggested as the director for Jaws II she won an Academy Award for editing Jaws after another director fell by the wayside But she says I was told I couldnt do it because according to guild rules in order to replace another director I had to have directed one feature film or 90 minutes of television and technically on paper I hadnt Barbara Peters a veteran lowbudget actionandexploitation film director reports that when I was teaching a directing course at an experimental film college in Los Angeles I helped one student shoot and put together a 10minute videotape to use as his calling card With it he immediately got an episode of The Incredible Hulk to direct I couldnt even get an interview on that show Although production companies are willing to look at test videotapes in the hope of unearthing a new young directing talent few of them seem to consider the possibility that that talent could be female Jan Haag a woman film director who administers the American Film Institutes West Coast branch programs to aid film makers explains Young men come out of our Center for Advanced Film Studies and go straight into jobs in TV and film The women in our workshops produce tapes  many of which are as good or better than the mens yet they cant get a look in Increasing numbers of women are also coming out of other film schools but their chances have not appreciably changed as yet Adell Aldrich daughter of veteran director Robert Aldrich began her career as a script supervisor at the age of 16 My father she says started off his career as a craft serviceman going for coffee and moved from third assistant slowly but steadily through the ranks to director  My family told  me the men in the industry simply didnt see women in that light They were right It took me 18 years to be given the opportunity to direct smallbudget films for independent studios Other women seem stuck permanently in assistantdirector or secondassistant director ruts while their male counterparts move up more steadily to directors chairs Why has an industry which may have had a woman as its first storyfilm director it is hotly debated whether Alice GuyBlache who directed La Fee Aux Choux made in Paris in 1896 was the first person to direct a story film an industry which allowed the late Dorothy Arzner to become one of the top 10 Hollywood directors in the 30s been so resistant to giving opportunity to women directors since World War II There was one notable exception in this worst of times for women directors in America Ida Lupino tired as an actress of waiting for the right films to come along formed her own production company with her then husband the late Collier Young and between 1949 and 1954 directed produced and wrote eight feature films characterized by their tough subject matter and their provocative picture of American life beneath the surface and went on to do shows for television Ida Lupinos films were lowbudget fastshoot independent Her first feature Not Wanted 1949 the tale of an unwed mother who gives up her baby and then kidnaps another cost 110000 to make and grossed 1 million It might have been characterized as a womens picture but one could certainly not say the same of the The HitchHiker an allmale suspense drama shot in 1953 of which a contemporary reviewer wrote It is breathtakingly keyed to an agonizing pitch of terror for its full running time In the three decades since no other woman has managed to amass a similar body of work One possible explanation of the phenomenon is that the history of women as film directors has simply not been fully documented As the writerdirector Nancy Dowd pointed out in Action magazine in 1973 the history of the great directors began to be written in the 50s spurred on by the French creators of the auteur theory wherein directors not stories became preeminent When the interest spread to America it did so in a climate that was scarcely sensitive to womens efforts It was the era of the feminine mystique wrote Nancy Dowd of Jayne Mansfield Betty Crocker cake mixes Dior waists crinolines and Mamie Eisenhower  The cultural blinders of the era she continued blunted the historians scholarship They simply did not see or could not believe or preferred to forget that women had been among the first film makers that women had made distinguished films that women directors had amassed significant filmographies Women also tended to have been allowed to direct when directing wasnt considered all that important Under the old studio system the ranks of journeymen directors could well include an Ida Lupino Once the director became the star from the mid50s on women were to all intents and purposes passed over It became easier to ignore women as directors The one woman who could not be ignored because she was so obviously a cinematic genius Leni Riefenstahl was easily discredited because of her Nazi connections Some male industry leaders today rush to explain the dearth of women directors Women dont have the technical skill to direct Women cant control the floor Male crews dont respect them Women are stubborn inflexible and wont compensate Women make heavyhanded messagey films that no one wants to see Women dont have the physical stamina Directing for television is a very very tough job says Douglas S Cramer a coexecutive producer with Aaron Spelling Productions the company that makes The Love Boat and Vega Its a merciless constant pounding Its gruelling I dont want to sound like a chauvinist but I dont know if a woman could stand up to it Its easy to blame male chauvinism says Harry Ufland one of Los Angeless most successful agents with a reputation for launching many firsttime directors none of them women but its quite simply that no woman except Elaine May has ever made a good movie and her last one Mikey and Nicky never got finished Everyone knows how brilliant she is but no one will trust her with a film The rest of the womens stuff Ive seen is just awful It is difficult for a neophyte male director today to get a production company to take a chance on him It is virtually impossible for a woman She simply adds an extra layer of risk in an already risky formula At the present uncertain time in the movie industry what with the advent of home video cassettes cable and other new software no one is quite sure who the audience is anymore No one therefore is inclined to take risks and women directors are perceived as the greatest risk of all Film producers claim that budgets today are too big for them to entrust a movie to a woman And television producers say their budgets are too small to risk the mistakes an untested woman director might make Money and power move the film industry Women have traditionally had neither Banks which lend money for films are notoriously conservative but say women directors they become positively Scroogelike when a woman is at the helm of a picture And there is little indication that the introduction of womens banks has made any difference But first and fundamentally the word director like general continues to have a primarily male connotation Fay Kanin who is currently president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences head of her own production company and writer andor coproducer of such television hits as Friendly Fire Hustling and Tell Me Where It Hurts explains it this way The director is a papa figure We were always told women couldnt exercise authority over a bunch of men Its nonsense of course Some women are lousy at authority But then so are some men But old conditionings die hard Verna Fields sits in her large prestigious vice presidents office at Universal Studios surrounded by posters of some of the successful films shes edited and admits To be honest my early education has never really left me Its like how you feel passing a nun even though youve given up Catholicism a long time ago It will take several generations in this industry to get over our subservience to the male gender It may be this early conditioning that produces a profound lack of confidence in the women themselves when they decide to try their hand at directing As Barbra Streisand who is widely believed to have virtually directed many of the films she has starred in over the years prepares to make her official movie directing debut with the musical Yentl for her own production company she is according to a woman who has worked closely with her so scared shes making herself ill The fear of course comes from the visibility of failure A man makes a bad movie and its John Doe whos made a bomb When a woman fails its women who cant direct A Moment by Moment or a Cant Stop the Music sets every woman who has ever directed or wanted to direct back a decade A Heavens Gate or a 1941 would finish them forever But such monumental failures by men are regarded as momentary aberrations by otherwise gifted directors A Robert Altman can direct a string of failures and still get Popeye Ken Russell can produce embarrassment after embarrassment and go on to Altered States The injustice galls We want the same opportunity to make fools of ourselves as the men says Nancy Walker who directed Cant Stop the Music If nervous studio heads these days watch young male directors closely  and they do the scrutiny is multiplied tenfold for women It was like being in a fishbowl says Claudia Weill of her experience with Columbia Pictures on Its My Turn The New York Times film critic Janet Maslin said the movie was full of brief telling details that Miss Weill somehow makes unexpectedly interesting I heard the production people she reports talking to the crew  You mean she took five takes not an inordinate amount on that What the hell is she doing that kind of thing The new breed of women production executives at studios can go only so far to help Theyll bring up a woman directors name a couple of times says Barbara Peters then they simply have to let it drop Otherwise they might be asked Whats the matter with you cant you work with a man There are however small signs of hope The presence of women executives at several major studios may represent the best chance for a change New studios in town like Francis Ford Coppolas Zoetrope are apparently receptive to women directors and are actively seeking projects from them Lucy Fisher who started in the industry as a studio reader 12 years ago and is now vice president for worldwide productions at Zoetrope says Weve been interested in women making films since before it became fashionable And she points out that it makes good sense to hire new people both male and female to direct The public certainly hasnt been too happy with the caliber of movies they have been getting lately from the same old people she adds so why go back to them just because you know them At 20th Century Fox Sherry Lansing says she is discussing a development deal with Karen Arthur director of Legacy and one with Gilliam Armstrong director of My Brilliant Career and there are several others cooking which she does not want to discuss until they become settled She however emphasizes that she has trouble answering when she is asked how many projects with women directors her studio has I simply dont break them down into male and female she says We have some projects were talking about with terrific directors and yes some of them happen to be women Ive seen some wonderful films by women Sherry Lansing adds Elaine May did two of the best films Ive ever seen I loved Its My Turn Ive seen brilliant work from Joan Silver Beth Brickell a director called Evelyn Demme and Amy Heckerling and therere lots more  Six months from now Im sure well have several projects under way with women at the helm Most woman directors agree that bigname actresses those with enough clout to have director approval could help by insisting that a woman be at least considered in the running to make their pictures But it rarely happens When Jane Fonda was asked at the 1975 San Francisco Film Festival why she had never worked with a woman director she said there werent any Later says Karen Arthur who was honored at the festival as one of three outstanding new directors of the year I asked her if shed view some of my films She refused She had told the woman who had directed her in a documentary  on Vietnam  that women shouldnt direct A spokesman for Jane Fonda quotes the actress as saying Its totally false I dont recall ever meeting Miss Arthur but if I refused to see her films it was because I didnt have the time The one thing on which even their critics agree is that women directors are especially sensitive in their handling of actors On the set of Love in Canada Candace OConnor explained that from an actors point of view in a story involving rather explicit sex a woman director is a plus all around I keep waiting for Annette Cohen to say Oh for Gods sake Candace relax so its a nude scene so what Ive heard it so often from men But I know she wont There are just some things I dont have to explain to a woman Candace OConnors male costar Robin Ward was equally enthusiastic Ive worked for women directors often in the theater This is my first experience with one in films and I can tell you that given my druthers I prefer a woman director Theyre so much more willing to discuss things with you There is none of that mysteriousness that some of the male directors seem to enjoy wrapping things up with Ideally a significant influx of women on the directorial scene would add a whole new perspective to the human experience the filmic equivalents of Joyce Carol Oates Margaret Drabble or Joan Didion It was evident in The Heartbreak Kid a satire on the ethnic males fantasy of the WASP princess that could surely only have been done justice to by an ethnic female like Elaine May It was evident in Hester Street Joan Micklin Silvers film of an immigrant woman growing up to the realization of her own strength It was evident in Lee Grants short film The Stronger wherein Strindbergs old tale of two women battling over a man became an altogether different story in which the man was a virtual irrelevancy And it is there in her new film Tell Me a Riddle in which flashbacks are used not simply to detail a dying old womans past but to let the audience into her imagery to show not only what the woman is thinking but how she thinks it But some women directors have felt impotent and deprived of selfexpression for so long that in their frustration what sometimes comes out when they finally do get the chance to direct is hostile feminist excess films in which too much time is spent dealing with menstruation rape and abortion  the kind of wallow that few women and even fewer men want to sit through These are probably the kind of excesses that first efforts inevitably bring and will pass but many women think that the time has come for female directors to put aside the overall subject of women for a whileI find them so icky says Mai Zetterling once billed as the Swedish Sex Bomb now a wellregarded director in Europe all this adoration of the tummy  women standing in front of mirrors oiling pregnant bellies Most women directors are not interested in pouring their anger onto the screen nor are they interested in being pigeonholed Nancy Dowd who wrote the original story of Coming Home and the raunchy brutal script for the movie Slap Shot about the very male sport of ice hockey and is making her directorial debut in Love asks How come no one is interested in what a woman thinks about freedom Small subjects films about interpersonal relationships the kind of pictures European film makers both male and female make  these are the pictures that the majority of women directors say they want to make But too often in America these are contemptuously tagged womens pictures by studio heads who consider them the kiss of death at the box office Despite the success of films like Kramer vs Kramer and Ordinary People voted 1980s best film by the New York Film Critics Circle the suggestion is that people arent ready for real life on the screen In Europe the picture has traditionally been somewhat brighter for women Directors like Lina Wertmuller Mai Zetterling Agnes Varda and in Britain Betty Box have found a market for their incisive satirical looks at their societies foibles But the European movie is a vastly different animal from the American breed There movies are still regarded as individual artistic efforts And in North America the Canadians have traditionally had more room for women because explains the producer Renee Perlmutter Our country is too young to have an oldboy network that disdains women We have a whole different sensibility to our sex But even in Canada it is significant that the Frenchspeaking section of the country has many more women film directors than the English section In the United States however any woman who wants to direct finds herself struggling with one key question Can her sensibilities ever fit into a financial reality that says the average cinema goer is a 14to 24yearold male Karen Arthur who will begin shooting her third major motion picture Lady Beware in April and had to raise her 4 million budget from independent investors after Universal which had optioned the project dropped out says I battled endlessly with a studio head over the picture There was one scene where the girl goes to do her laundry and finds the crotch cut out of her panties and the nipples out of her bras Any woman would be completely terrified by that He thought it was funny I can relate to The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now she adds but it appears a man cant relate to my world Its the essence of the problem Thwarted in their attempt to make major feature films some women directors have tried a different route Barbara Peters who doesnt mind being called the Queen of B Pictures has been making exploitation films  like Humanoids from the Deep Moving Violation and Candy Striped Nurses heavy on sex and violence and packed with car crashes stunts and chases She believes that more women would make action pictures if they werent so intimidated Look its like a bunch of little girls trying to get into the boys baseball game she says and being told Go away youre not good enough So they say OK well go over to Mary Janes yard and play our own game They stick to what the men arent doing One area which has become a safe haven for women is the documentary field and many and varied have been the contributions of women directors to it But in the United States documentaries are considered nonprestigious and uncommercial ie they dont make money The field is one in which a woman can get stuck and from which there is relatively little movement into feature films We shouldnt try to be protected from the battle declares Karen Arthur just because we havent been to war before I adored those meetings with a studio head They gave me a chance to sharpen my negotiating talents They taught me how to work him better how to manipulate Men are battlescarred from these meetings They know the players We dont even begin to understand the rules So far the biggest commercial success for a woman director since Elaine Mays Heartbreak Kid belongs to Claudia Weill who had to put together three grants to make her first success Girlfriends a modest little picture which convinced Columbia Pictures to ante up 7 million for Its My Turn Before these two films Miss Weill who has been working in film production ever since her student days at Radcliffe produced and directed the documentary Joyce at 34 and did some 20 segments of Sesame Street for public television before directing The Other Half of the Sky the chronicle of Shirley Maclaines trip to China which won an Academy Award nomination Before Its My Turn was released it was reportedly mucked about with considerably Hollywood sources say that the producer Ray Stark had so little confidence in Miss Weill that he took the film away from her for editing But Ray Stark has a reputation for being crass and insensitive with directors male or female and many women expressed little sympathy for Miss Weills plight What exactly did she expect snorts Nancy Dowd Anybody who makes a film for Ray Stark must expect the worst Nevertheless the film survived and audiences are seeing it and the next woman to come along may find it easier because of Miss Weills success Box office returns on the film are excellent an indication that if given the big studio treatment  major distribution widespread advertising and marketing  a womans film can be just as succcessful as any other good wellpromoted film Meanwhile the fate of women directors is unenviable They make ends meet by teaching stage directing or consulting on films directed by men They live frugally and they keep moving Joan Tewkesbury whose first film Old Boyfriends brought her a flurry of attention and who has just finished shooting The Acorn People a Movie of the Week for NBCTV says Youve got to keep the momentum going Im moving to New York to do more theater You can get awfully stale in this town sitting around listening to all the deals the boys are making Nancy Dowd is writing a play for Englands National Theater Some women are even making movies Joan Micklin Silver who has a production company with her husband will begin shooting Medallion a contemporary thriller in the political arena sometime in 1981 and Lee Grant is planning a comedy chase film for shooting next spring Others are still trying to get projects off the ground Adell Aldrichs Twinkle Twinkle Martha Hinkle starring Valerie Perrine is currently being considered by several studios Amy Heckerlings My Kind of Guy went the rounds from Universal to MGM before being dropped  a common enough experience but evidently more so when women directors are involved Meanwhile many women search for a mentor  usually a male producer who will in some way further their career Or they write hoping to tie themselves to a commercial project that the studios want enough to let them direct And always theres the struggle to raise money You have endless dinners with men whom you convince yourself are interested in investing in your movie says Karen Arthur when all the time theyre looking at your breasts They evaporate when you suggest getting together with your lawyer Sometimes the temptation to give up is overwhelming Joelle Dobrow a news and specials director says Its crisis time for me If it doesnt happen in the next six years its all over Im not 22 anymore Im a director its all I know What am I supposed to do open a restaurant Elaine May the woman director with perhaps the most talent has apparently given up directing films because Polly Platt says She did it for her personal life This can be a very defeating town and at some point you have to say what am I giving up for this The resource committee appointed by the Directors Guild to look into the plight of women in films had been scheduled to make its final report by last Oct 8 The guilds national executive secretary Michael H Franklin waited at the appointed time Not one member of the committee showed up nor were any apologies sent A top executive at a major studio said that on

ociation of Motion Picture and Television Producers say that the resource committee was in trouble on several counts The National Labor Relations Act prohibits the making of employment decisions on the basis of guild membership and the group met only with guild members Also by restricting their interview candidates women says the AMPTP lawyer the resource committee was discriminating against other minorities in the guild But it was clearly stated at the womens meeting with the producers that other minorities would be next that this was simply the first in a series of such affirmativeaction efforts Unofficially members of the producers association complain that the guild is simply playing politics They were facing the threat of suits from their own women members says one lawyer Theyre simply trying to protect their own rear ends by passing the buck to the producers Nevertheless an angry national board of the Directors Guild voted to file a complaint for discrimination against the production companies with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which will hear the case on Jan 19 It may do them little good and it could produce a backlash If a man has a woman forced on him says 20th Century Fox vice president Claire Townsend hell hate her Hell want her to fail And it will do more damage to women further down the line The prospects for women directors are perhaps most promising for actresses who are interested in directing people like Barbra Streisand Lee Grant Anne Bancroft who made her directorial debut with Fatso Dyan Cannon whose short film Number One was well received and was nominated for an Academy Award and Lee Remick who plans to direct her next film These women could make it to a secure stephold because they have the visibility and clout that the others lack They are accustomed to dealing with the power brokers and they have the added advantage of being able to finance their efforts by their acting I edited Tell Me a Riddle while acting in Charlie Chan says Lee Grant and finished the mixing while doing The Fright in Montreal Its exhausting but it works Most reasonable people in the industry agree however that there simply hasnt been a sufficient body of work from any woman director to really tell who if any is likely to have staying power Watching from the sidelines Polly Platt a production designerproducer who with her former husband Peter Bogdanovitch launched such successful films as The Last Picture Show and Whats Up Doc says that regrettably she has not yet seen anyone she considers a really exciting talent among the ranks of women directors But just to keep things in perspective she says dont forget that John Ford made over 130 films the first 45 of them were absolutely lousy And Peter and I plowed through many of Hitchcocks efforts made in England Most of the very early ones were quite dreadful Fay Kanin is optimistic If anyone had told me 10 years ago that thered be so many women producers today I wouldnt have believed it Its just snowballed I know itll be harder for directors but it will come How much harder is the question For every film that actually gets to the screen there are 50 to 100 in development that never make it That means it takes over 100 production executives to make about five films Becoming a director therefore is approximately 20 times more competitive than being a producer No wonder then as Fay Kanin admits Its going to be two steps forward and three back for a while but it will come Sherry says well get to the day when none of us will have woman as an automatic prefix stuck in front of our title For women directors that day cant come soon enough,,
THE FOUR NEW CONGRESSWOMEN ON THE ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/11/style/the-four-new-congresswomen-on-the-issues.html,The most striking similarity among the four candidates who beat the odds last November to become the newest female members of the House of Representatives emerges slowly They use many of the same words when they speak of the troubles facing America and of ways to solve these problems They talk as befits winners in the conservative sweep of 1980 of reducing the size and scope of government of redirecting tax policies and of bringing down the rate of inflation But what stands out most is not what theyre saying but rather what they have left unspoken For when asked to list what they see as the most important problems facing this country and what theyre interested in accomplishing in Congress none of them mention any of the traditional issues of feminism such as abortion or the passage of the proposed Federal equal rights amendment or establishment of a national daycare system Sure womens issues concern me said Claudine Schneider a 33yearold environmental activist who became the first Republican to represent Rhode Island in the House since 1938 and the first woman to hold a major political office in the state But she continued I think its important to note that womens issues are not just issues that relate to daycare centers or to housing for single parents Womens issues also include energy and national defense and discussions of national security They include everything Results Did Not Meet Predictions This was not a particularly good election year for women in Congress While there will be a record number of women in the House and Senate with 19 in the first body and two in the second it had been anticipated that female candidates would do better in 1980 than they did One reason for this was that the Republican tide totally overwhelmed Democratic women who were not incumbents Not one new Democratic woman will take a seat in the 97th Congress Like her colleagues Mrs Schneider favors ratification of the equal rights amendment and supports abortion rights She also supports Federal financing of abortions believing that without such financing we would be discriminating against the poor The other three women however believe that such financing should only be granted in cases of rape incest or threat to the mothers life I do not believe it is the responsibility of the Federal taxpayer to finance abortions said Bobbi Fiedler newly elected Congresswoman from Californias San Fernando Valley It is a position that fits in with the fiscal conservatism in which all four women say they believe I think the emphasis instead of being so much on abortion should be on education said Mrs Schneider a former producer and hostess of a public television affairs program in Providence RI who first gained prominence through her opposition to the building of a nuclear power plant What is startling she added is the fact there are so many teenagers who become pregnant and are are having abortions I think where the responsibility should lie for this education is in the schools in the churches and in the family By letting society say let a bunch of Congressmen in Washington make that decision were shunting off the responsibility of the family to make those decisions Her primary concern she said is to do something about inflation Environmental concerns are also high on her list separating her somewhat from the House Republican bloc Her husband Eric Schneider works for the Environmental Protection Agency in Narragansett RI where they live Lynn Martin a 41yearold Illinois State Senator elected last fall to take over the Northern Illinois seat in the House vacated by John B Anderson has her own problem in discussing the highly emotional issues of the womens movement such as the proposed equal rights amendment and abortion Im a halfIrish state politician she said There isnt any politician male or female who likes these issues because theyre such trouble You think anyone who got far enough to be elected to Congress is going to bring up these issues on their own Give us a rest whatever side youre on Mrs Martin a teacher became a member of the Winnebago County Board in 1972 won a place in the State House in 1977 and then moved on to the State Senate in 1979 She is called a moderate Republican and waged a difficult primary battle against a wellfinanced campaign by a minister from the partys right wing who had given Mr Anderson a tough race in 1978 She won the general election easily In my view the most important issue is not the ERA its not even a daycare program said Mrs Martin The most important issue is ultimately the economy There are issues that psychologically may be important but of substantive importance ultimately the economy is the problem She was asked how she rated womens issues on her agenda Zip was the reply Its a stereotype said Marge Roukema who beat threeterm incumbent Andrew Maguire for his seat representing New Jerseys Seventh District Nobody asks a man if his issues are male issues I was elected to represent all the people of my district and thats far more important I dont think in terms of what are womens issues Mrs Roukema had lost to Mr Maguire in 1978 But she kept running and beat him in November It was a race that posed a problem for a number of womens groups because as a Congressman Mr Maguire had built a reputation as a strong feminist He had attacked Mrs Roukema for lacking political experience This was her first election to public office although Mrs Roukema had been deeply involved in civic activities She was a trustee on the local board of education chairman of the local government reform committee founding member of the Senior Citizens Housing Corporation and board member of the Leukemia Society I think its a marginal interest now said Mrs Roukema when asked about womens issues At 51 she considers Congress her third career Her first was as a secondary teacher and her second was the raising of three children one of whom died of leukemia four years ago at the age of 17 Her husband a psychiatrist in Ridgewood has been very supportive she said I see the period up ahead as one of transition from the traditional liberal policies of the postRoosevelt era she said I view this period and particularly the first part of the new decade as a search for new coalitions a search for new approaches I firmly believe that unless we expand economic opportunities through the private sector we wont be able to go out and deal effectively with other problems Led a Fight Against Busing Mrs Fiedler came to Congress by way of her opposition to courtordered busing in her home city Los Angeles It began with Bustop a community group she founded and led that opposed forced busing From there Mrs Fiedler 43 was elected to the Los Angeles School Board a board that runs a school district of 35 million people She defeated James C Corman a 20year veteran of the House and one of the topranking members of the House Ways and Means Committee by fewer than 800 votes It was one of the Republicans biggest victories and a major upset for the Democrats She is fighting to overcome being labeled a oneissue politician My primary interest is reducing the size and scope of government she said and reducing government spending She describes herself as a fiscal conservative and a social liberal Asked if her views on busing are liberal she replied Yes absolutely Its a question of freedom of people having the freedom to make their own decisions
CORRECTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/13/nyregion/correction-221141.html,An article on the Style page on Sunday incorrectly stated the position of Representative Marge Roukema the newly elected Congresswoman from New Jerseys Seventh District on the abortion issue Mrs Roukema supports Federal funds for abortions in all cases
"JUDGE JOHN DOOLING JR., 72, DIES; MADE RULING ON ABORTION FUNDS",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/13/obituaries/judge-john-dooling-jr-72-dies-made-ruling-on-abortion-funds.html,Judge John Francis Dooling Jr the Federal judge who declared unconstitutional the socalled Hyde Amendment restricting Federal financing of abortions for indigent women died of a heart attack yesterday a block away from his home in Brooklyn while walking to work He was 72 years old Judge Dooling who had returned to work a week ago after recuperating from pulmonary edema last November was named to the Federal bench by President John F Kennedy in 1961 after 27 years with the Wall Street law firm of Sullivan  Cromwell The bestknown and one of the most controversial rulings of his career came last January when he delivered a 642page opinion striking down the Congressional ban on most Federal financing for abortions After 39 months and thousands of pages of testimony and 13 months of deliberation the judge cited First and Fifth Amendment protections in deciding that the Hyde Amendment interfered with a womans religious beliefs and her right to privacy His Longest Opinion He also noted in his opinion the longest of his career that limiting free abortions represented unequal treatment for the poor However the United States Supreme Court revived the Congressional restrictions on Medicaid funds when it ruled last July that Congress may refuse to finance most abortions for poor women even those for whom the procedure was medically necessary Judge Dooling a Roman Catholic who sent all of his five children to parochial schools said he had had no difficulty reconciling his churchs opposition to abortion with his opinion on the case This doesnt have to do with what I think about abortion or what the church thinks about abortion Judge Dooling said at the time It has to do with the validity in civil law of restrictions on the funding for abortion in light of decisions of the Supreme Court Mr Dooling the son of a Brooklyn doctor graduated from St Francis College in 1929 He attended St Johns University Law School at night while serving as a clerk at Sullivan  Cromwell during the day Later he transferred to Harvard Law School where he was an editor of The Harvard Law Review Became Partner in Firm Mr Dooling then went on to specialize in litigation at Sullivan  Cromwell where he became a partner before accepting his judicial appointment to the Eastern District Judge Dooling worked hard taking notes tirelessly in court relying little on law clerks and writing his lengthy opinions himself in longhand The results were often complex but Mr Dooling was impatient with those who could not unravel a train of thought that seemed perfectly clear to him I remember how annoyed he was one time when one of his clerks couldnt understand one of his footlong sentences and he took it home to show it to my mother and me and we couldnt understand it either recalled Mr Doolings daughter Anna Never one to waste time Judge Dooling indulged his passion for reading not only in the usual sitting position but also while walking to work Following a heart attack in 1962 Anna Dooling said The doctor told him he had to walk very slowly and I guess daddy thought that was pretty dull so he began reading I think he tripped on occasion because of it Judge Dooling is survived by his wife the former Dorothea Elizabeth Bernard a son Peter and four daughters Marie and Anna Dooling Julienne Nann and Deborah Fitzgerald A funeral mass will be offered Thursday at 930 AM at St Saviours Church in Brooklyn
SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP; USE OF MAILBOXES TO DISTRIBUTE LEAFLETS FACES STUDY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/13/us/supreme-court-roundup-use-of-mailboxes-to-distribute-leaflets-faces-study.html,The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether the Federal Government can prosecute someone for depositing unstamped mail in a neighbors mailbox A 47yearold law prohibits the placement in private mailboxes of mailable matter that has not actually been stamped and mailed The Justices accepted an appeal by the United States Postal Service from a ruling by a Federal judge in New York last year that the law violated the freespeech rights of a Westchester County civic group that used mailboxes as the principal way of distributing its leaflets The group the Council of Greenburgh Civic Associations challenged the law after the Postal Service threatened it with prosecution The law carries a fine of 300 and applies only to mailboxes not to mail slots cut into doors Free Speech vs Revenue Loss After initially dismissing the case United States District Judge William C Conner ruled last April that the cost to free expression imposed by the law outweighed the Postal Services arguments that the law was necessary to prevent the loss of revenue and to protect against mail fraud Judge Conner concluded that use of the mails was financially prohibitive for most civic groups and that alternatives such as leaving the flyers under a doormat were much less satisfactory than using a mailbox The case US Postal Service v Council of Greenburgh Civic Associations No 80608 was not brought as a class action so Judge Conners decision technically applies only to the Greenburgh group But in urging the Justices to hear its appeal the Postal Service argued that numerous groups would now bring similar lawsuits Returning from their fourweek Christmas recess the Justices also took the following actions today Judges Finances The Court refused without comment to hear an appeal by seven Federal judges who contended that they could not constitutionally be required to disclose their finances as required of all highranking Federal officials by the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 The judges challenged the law on the ground that it violated the doctrine of separation of powers They lost in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit The Supreme Court Justices themselves have made annual disclosures since the law took effect Duplantier v US No 791180 Abortion Case The Justices refused a request by the State of Arizona to grant a stay of a lower court order that it continue to honor a contract with the statess Planned Parenthood organizations to provide family planning services A Federal district court ruled last year that Arizona could not legally refuse to channel its share of Federal family planning funds to Planned Parenthood The Arizona Legislature had pased a budget amendment forbidding state funds from going to organizations that provide abortions or abortion referral and counseling The state is appealing the ruling to a Federal appeals court and sought a Supreme Court stay in the meantime Arizona v Planned Parenthood No A530 Libel Cases The Court let stand a 350000 libel judgment won by Joseph L Alioto the former Mayor of San Francisco against the company that published Look Magazine Mr Alioto sued for libel over an article the magazine printed in 1969 entitled The Web That Links San Franciscos Mayor Alioto and the Mafia Three trials produced hung juries on various issues Mr Alioto prevailed in the fourth trial which was without a jury Cowles Communications v Alioto No 80628 In a second libel case the Court refused to hear an appeal by a Virginia newspaper from a ruling that a Government contractor was not a public figure for libel purposes The Supreme Court requires libel plaintiffs who are public figures to prove that the alleged libel was deliberate or committed with reckless disregard for the truth an important protection for newspapers in writing about public affairs In todays case Loudoun TimesMirror v Arctic Co No 80521 the newspaper was sued by a research company that had been hired as a consultant on a county project The trial court ruled that the company should be regarded as a public official but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed on the ground that the company served as a scientific factfinder not a policymaker Juvenile Confession The Court refused to hear an appeal by the State of California from the reversal of a murder conviction of a 13yearold boy The California Court of Appeal in reversing the conviction ruled that the police had violated the boys socalled Miranda rights by not telling him that his grandparent were available to speak with him at the police station The state argued that the ruling was an unwarranted expansion of the Supreme Courts Miranda doctrine which holds in part that a suspect must be advised of the right to refuse to answer police questions before consulting a lawyer Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun voted to hear the case California v Patrick W No 80174 Chief Justice Warren E Burger voted to reverse the California decision without hearing arguments
SIMPLE TEST COULD SCREEN ALL EXPECTANT MOTHERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/13/science/simple-test-could-screen-all-expectant-mothers.html,ALL expectant mothers not just those known to be at risk of producing deformed or diseased babies may soon be able to take a simple test for the presence of certain common crippling or lethal birth defects which may strike at random in families with no history of the disorders The test was designed to spot a class of malformations of the brain and spinal cord called neural tube defects which occur as early as the third week of fetal growth and affect nearly two of every 1000 pregnancies in the United States Unlike hemophilia or TaySachs disease these defects frequently appear in families with no history of the problem And unlike Downs syndrome mongolism they are not associated with advanced age of the mother But before the test becomes a routine part of prenatal care the kits for administering it will have to be approved for sale by the Food and Drug Administration which is holding public hearings in Washington this Thursday to consider the matter As many as three million women a year in the United States are potentially affected by the outcome since the laboratory test kits in question can spot a variety of dangers early in pregnancy simply by analyzing a sample of the mothers blood Should the drug agency approve the test kits for marketing mass screening programs could be instituted throughout the country That possibility has already raised difficult questions in medicine technology and ethics The test kits would not be sold to individuals but to commercial laboratories that would accept blood samples from physicians offering the test to their patients Experimental or pilot programs in several states have already shown the test to be effective not only in identifying birth defects but in giving doctors early warning of other possibly dangerous situations including the presence of twins or triplets pseudopregnancy fetal death and low birthweight The most serious neural tube defects are spina bifida and anencephaly In spina bifida the vertebrae that normally protect the spinal cord fail to form properly leaving a hole in the backbone where the nerves can be pushed out to become stretched and damaged Children born with this condition are often paralyzed from birth below the level of the opening The paralysis may leave them incapable of controlling their bowels or bladder and highly susceptible to chronic urinary tract infections Whats more the syndrome often includes hydrocephalus or water on the brain which can lead to mental retardation Anencephaly entails abnormal formation of the brain and head so that the overwhelming majority of affected infants are stillborn or die soon after birth Both spina bifida and anencephaly appear to be more common among whites than blacks The incidence of neural tube defects is three times higher in Britain than in the United States and the test was developed in 1972 by Dr David J H Brock of Edinburgh It is a multistage procedure that begins early in the second trimester of pregnancy with an analysis of the mothers blood for signs of a telltale infantile protein called alphafetoprotein or AFP Every human fetus produces AFP throughout prenatal development and secretes it via the urine into the amniotic fluid From there traces of the protein can cross the placenta into the mothers bloodstream The function of AFP is unknown as is the reason its production stops soon after birth However since adults do not normally have AFP in their blood any that is detected can be assumed to come from the fetus Small quantities are normal but large quantities which have been found in about 50 of every 1000 women tested are a warning signal calling for a repeat of the test Those women with persistently high levels of AFP in their blood are then given an ultrasound scan  an echo picture of the uterus that can instantly determine the presence of two or more fetuses which would account for the excess AFP entering the mothers blood Or the scan could show a single fetus with the abnormally shaped head characteristic of anencephaly Hard Decisions for Parents If ultrasound testing yields no explanation the woman usually undergoes amniocentesis the extraction of a small amount of amniotic fluid through a needle inserted in her abdomen A high level of AFP in the fluid is a strong indication that the baby will be born with spina bifida as the protein is apparently pouring out through an open lesion At this point the prospective parents have to decide whether to have an abortion or prepare themselves for the birth of a handicapped child Another ethical issue related to the test is that of informed consent At what stage of the procedure should the obstetrician explain the test Some argue that a detailed explanation at the time of the initial test provokes needless anxiety in most of the women tested Others counter that withholding such information is unacceptable because no test with a possibility of such a grave outcome should proceed without the patients full awareness While the test kits make the early steps of the procedure relatively simple for any commercial laboratory many doctors are concerned that other procedures important for prenatal diagnosis  ultrasound amniocentesis  are neither readily available nor equally reliable at different centers Amniocentesis carries a small but significant risk of induced abortion Dr Fritz Fuchs of The New York HospitalCornell Medical Center which offers the AFP test free in an experimental program said It is absolutely imperative that any step toward mass screening be part of a total effort including sonography amniocentesis and especially counseling Approval May Be Limited Dr Stuart L Nightingale the FDAs acting associate commissioner for health affairs points out that approval of the test kits would not mean approval of the concept of mass screening for neural tube defects although he concedes that the availability of such kits would certainly make mass screening easier Dr James E Haddow associate medical director of the Foundation for Blood Research in Scarborough Me said his experience as head of a threeyear statewide pilot program for detection of neural tube defects convinced him of the wider importance of offering the AFP test It has great merit with regard to pregnancy management Dr Haddow said It gives us the earliest indication of twin birth yet possible Although ultrasound could be routinely used to diagnose multiple pregnancies and anencephaly its longterm effects are unknown and the procedure costs at least 50 at most centers According to Dr Haddow the AFP test which can be analyzed for about 15 to 25 poses no risk to the fetus and can screen out women who may not need ultrasound Performing amniocentesis at 60 or more on every pregnant woman would be too expensive and involve unnecessary risk Dr Haddow said We also pick up missed abortions and false pregnancies with the AFP test he added And we are learning that lownm AFP values which were ignored until recently also give us important information Usually a very low value means that the fetal age has been grossly overestimated This is a potentially dangerous situation since women have been known to undergo induced labor and give birth to premature babies because their obstetricians thought they were overdue The test procedure though very reliable when performed correctly is not foolproof Aside from errors that could occur at any stage there is a basic biological difficulty to contend with In some pregnancies Dr Haddow said for reasons we dont understand AFP does not get into the maternal serum In such a case it would be impossible to detect a neural tube defect or other problem All you can do is lower the risk he concluded You cant remove it

TOPICS; A JUDGE A TRADITION; Well-Tempered Justice,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/14/opinion/topics-a-judge-a-tradition-well-tempered-justice.html,Last summer when the Supreme Court struck down the Dooling decision on Medicaid abortion funds the Federal District Court judge who wrote it thought of those whose lives would be intimately affected How could they do this to the poor he asked an acquaintance The episode tells much about Judge John Dooling Jr who died Monday at the age of 72 He was a man of intellect and courage but also of compassion He had hoped of course that the Court would uphold his sweeping decision that Congressional efforts to limit Medicaid abortion funds were unconstitutional for half a dozen reasons He documented the harsh implications of a Medicaid cutoff for the health of poor pregnant women The Supreme Court overruled him in a narrow and punitive decision and it remains hard and callous to say he was wrong In 20 years on the Federal bench John Dooling won honor and respect for the way he handled innumerable cases whether involving school desegregation the privacy rights of a high school student or abortion He pursued facts doggedly once turning up in the schoolrooms of Queens to see firsthand the effect of segregation on black youths Though an observant Catholic he held his personal beliefs apart from judicial issues His compass was the Constitution

REAGAN SHOULD USE REAGANISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/15/opinion/reagan-should-use-reaganism.html,Even before he takes the Inaugural oath next Tuesday we must ask Is Presidentelect Ronald Reagan moving away from the very positions that elected him There are early signs that he may be His campaign promised more than a new personality with a different world outlook He especially signaled a shift in the most pained area of American life He vowed to change the domestic economic and social policies that began with Franklin D Roosevelt and grew through Democratic thick Lyndon B Johnsons Great Society and Republican thin Richard M Nixons Were all Keynesians now I voted for Jimmy Carter Having been a charter member of the Northeastern liberal press establishment I could not bring myself to endorse with my vote Ronald Reagans social views for example those on abortion judges Darwin minority rights even though I was confident that he had no intention of acting on them However when he was elected I was glad because we needed a change In and out of government those of my leanings have had their liberal views dominate the country to the point of exhaustion and national frustration Even we admitted that nothing was working as well as it should and that we had very little if anything fresh to offer for the future So I welcomed the burst of blatant Sun Belt conservatism But will Mr Reagan really ask for enough of his own new brand of governance Or will he be compromised by conventional wisdom and move to the more confused middle ground I hope not But so far the omens are mixed On the eve of taking office Mr Reagan we are told seems unusually relaxed KempRothtype tax cuts may be postponed because taxes cannot be cut until Federal spending is  if ever Some of his economists have even figured out that the Federal deficit that holiest of all conservative dragons in real dollars is really not rising A brisk pace not a frenetic one is being discussed A sense of urgency not emergency Cutting all those Federal programs  food stamps welfare aid to the aged and unemployed Government pensions agricultural subsidies aid to cities  are humanely being reconsidered in Mr Reagans words to prevent penalizing anyone who is dependent for help on the rest of us Thats a noble sentiment but it is just what the Democrats have been saying for years No Bolshevik perversity on my part makes me want the Reagan administration to try its extreme views so that it can fail I deeply want it to succeed because for now we who have been on the other side have nothing better or more promising to offer It is early of course to suggest conclusively that Ronald Reagan will not try what he promised But Mrs Margaret Thatcher Britains Conservative Prime Minister came to office espousing painful rightwing policies which she has incompletely pursued leaving her Government not only unsuccessful but her unproved philosophical premises in disrepute And Jimmy Carter early in his Presidency ringingly and impressively termed energy the leading problem of the 20th century declared the moral equivalent of war and then never told Americans how to do battle For domestic affairs Mr Reagan has the cabinet to do what he said he would He has a Director of the Office of Management and Budget who is young enough to suffer no oldprogram hangups and smart enough to stimulate anybody or anything an able Secretary of Defense who although no warrior has an impressive record in Governmentwaste disposal an antienvironmentalist Secretary of the Interior a pronuclear Secretary of Energy a Secretary of Agriculture who believes that food is not only a crop but also a weapon and a successful big businessman as Secretary of the Treasury who wants a single integrated longterm economic plan He has in addition a Republican Senate and a House that while Democratic has a conservative majority This graceful so far Presidentelect also will be at the height of his power when he takes office Even I would let him try almost any program he asked for The assumption of power brings responsibilities and complexities that the pursuit of it can ignore Fair enough But with the message of the election still fresh there has never been a better time to find out whether Ronald Reagans conservative economic and socialpolicy pronouncements can really work He should try those policies Then we can find out if he is right and thankfully embrace his views for our benefit or regretfully reject them and seek even newer solutions to old problems
THE ONLY-CHILD PHENOMENON,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/18/magazine/the-only-child-phenomenon.html,Didi Moore a freelance writer living in New York is the eldest of four children By Didi Moore ntil two years ago Jonathan Frank a selfpossessed second grader from Albuquerque NM asked his parents with some regularity for a baby brother or sister His 35yearold mother Karen fed up with the questions and fairly convinced there would be no more children sat Jonathan down one day and said Let me tell you what it would be like if we had a new baby The baby would cry at night It would keep you up Youd have to look after it And I wouldnt have as much time to play with you Oh yuk announced Jonathan I dont want another baby And he never asked for one again With that explanation Jonathan Frank made peace with his lot as an only child It has long been considered a disadvantage  even a misfortune  to grow up an only child To this day the stereotype persists that he or she is spoiled lonely and aloof Even the expression only child  suggests that sympathy is in order Onlies have trouble getting along with peers they are forever getting sick they grow up to be selfcentered unhappy adults So pervasive is this attitude that in national surveys one of the leading reasons couples cite for having a second baby is to prevent the first from being an only child But necessity we might say is the mother of the single child Because more and more married women not only want to work but have to work they are bearing children later than ever before And a choking economy is making child rearing an increasingly expensive proposition In a 1979 study the United States Department of Agriculture put the cost of raising a child born in 1960 to the age of 18 in a moderateincome family at 34300 and the cost of raising the same child born in 1979  assuming 10 percent inflation at 165300 In a recent article in Parents magazine Thomas Tilling also figuring a 10 percent inflation rate but adding an average of 61000 in salary that a mother would give up by staying home during the first five years and including the provision of various middleclass amenities such as music lessons estimated that raising a child born in 1980 to the age of 18 would cost a quarter of a million dollars At the same time sociologists recognizing that research on only children is limited and strongly biased are beginning to examine the reality behind the spoiledbrat image In just the last two years the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has sponsored 11 studies on the singlechild family The research has shown that only children are not disadvantaged In fact in some instances they grow up to be more accomplished and successful than children with siblings Zero Population Growth an organization advocating population stabilization has taken up the singlechild cause A new campaign urges highschool students to consider the advantages of a onechild family when they think about their future In short not only does new evidence show that the negative stereotype of the only child is illfounded but the singlechild family is achieving new popularity as more contemporary couples decide that once is enough It is no secret that childbearing has dropped precipitately in the United States since the end of the baby boom in the late 1950s Demographers anticipated a surge in the late 70s when the baby boomers reached their childbearing years But the son of baby boom has turned into what Landon Y Jones in his new book on the postWorld War II generation Great Expectations refers to as the baby bust According to the United States Census Bureau the average number of births expected by wives 18 to 24 years old dropped from 29 in 1967 to 22 in 1978 Today the average completedfamily size per woman is 18 which means that women are actually having fewer children than they expected Some of the groundwork for this trend was laid by the campaigns for environmental and population awareness during the last 15 years Smaller families became more acceptable In 1978 72 percent of 18to 24yearold wives expected to have two or fewer children compared with 45 percent in 1967 And says Martin OConnell a statistician in the fertilitystatistics branch at the Census Bureau the recent figures are likely to predict future trends more accurately than past estimates because the widespread availability of contraceptives in the last decade allows women greater control over births With more than 50 percent of women in the work force compared with 22 percent in the 1920s fewer of them are willing to give up their earning power to stay at home While a housewife in the 50s might have spread child rearing over 10 to 15 years todays working woman finds two to five years more suited to her timetable Census figures for women born in the 30s show that 44 percent of them had their first child by the time they were 21 years old But among their daughters women born in the 50s only 29 percent had given birth by the same age The later women start says Dr OConnell of the Census Bureau generally the fewer children they have And the longer they postpone birth the less likely it is to happen More things come into conflict The career has developed to such a point that a child becomes even less opportune You have more competing roles While the increasing popularity of singlechild families is largely a result of socioeconomic pressures the current flurry of research on the subject is so positive that it gives the trend a newfound acceptability The big surprise says Toni Falbo assistant professor of educational psychology at the University of Texas in Austin and a leading researcher on only children is that only children are not significantly different from anyone else In studies of children college students and adults the life patterns accomplishments marriages and physical wellbeing of onlies are consistent with those of their peer group If anything because of parental attention and the decreased drain on finances onlies are found to be better educated and more careeroriented Along with oldest children with whom they are often grouped onlies are also firstborns and all firstborns are only children for some period of time onlies are disproportionately represented in colleges graduate schools and the professions Some observers have found that they are also selfstarters good independent workers and strong leaders who can also have a hard time taking orders A favorite statistic of the proonlies is that 14 of the first group of 16 astronauts in the United States Space Program were only children or firstborns The strongest defense of only children comes from a comprehensive study completed in January 1980 by John G Claudy William S Farrell Jr and Charles W Dayton psychologists at the American Institutes for Research in Palo Alto Calif Based on a survey of more than 400000 highschool students begun in 1960 and followed up at regular intervals it looked at 3221 respondents measuring only children against children with one other sibling Compared with the members of twochild families only childen were found on the basis of extensive questions about aptitudes achievements interests and activities to be smarter more creative and more ambitious They appeared more cultured mature and socially sensitive although less outgoing than their counterparts with siblings They tended to marry bettereducated spouses and to have fewer children And more often their careers tended to be whitecollar scientific and cerebral rather than bluecollar outdoor or manual occupations Of all its findings the team was most surprised by the higher intelligence of only children In prior studies onlies had consistently ranked between oldest and youngest children The only explanation I could give for our finding on cognitive ability says Dr Claudy is that in this study all the subjects came from twoparent families Only children tend to be overrepresented in singleparent homes and that variable was not controlled for in previous studies Its possible that children from singleparent homes do less well on achievement aptitude tests What our data said though was that all things being equal only children do a little better Like oldest middle or youngest children onlies are profoundly affected by their birth position Onlies usually grow up faster because they are around adults more than children They learn quickly to hold their own in adult conversation More than other children onlies are included in the activities of their parents They are well behaved and appear worldly Parents are inclined to forget that this is pseudo sophistication and are often horrified when their child suddenly acts like the 8yearold he or she is Without other children to diffuse the attention parentchild relationships are particularly intense in onechild families Parents and child are neophyte actors playing firsttime roles in a three  and sometimes two  character play The experience can be warm supportive and open Or it can be tense manipulative and competitive Because there are only three people in the family onlies are often brought unwittingly into the politics of their parents marriages One young woman recalls that from the time she was 3 her father insisted on including her every time he and her mother went out using her as a wedge On the other hand onlies are generally more sensitive to their parents ups and downs because they are with them more I would involve myself in their differences recalls Ken Schwartz a 30yearold lawyer in Los Angeles I wanted to protect that triangle because it was the only family I had Id side with one to keep peace or the other to be a buffer I was a little Henry Kissinger Katie Schaefer was born when her mother a prominent psychotherapist was 42 There was little question that she would be an only child Beautiful bright and engaging she was adored by both her parents It was her father though who won her heart The stories she wrote at school were always about him Their relationship was special I felt when I was younger that my mother wasnt part of the bond between my father and me says Katie now 18 and a sophomore at Northwestern University He cultivated that because he didnt feel good about my mother she wasnt understanding or supportive of him I was too young to make a judgment But the message I got from him whether it was true or not was that my mother was the baddie The relationship between Katie and her mother improved when her father left home 10 years ago and has become even closer since Katie went away to college At the same time it is harder for only children to break away from their parents because they are severing the only bonded relationship they have ever had Only children consider the undivided attention of their parents a mixed blessing In a study of 105 onlies aged 8 to 66 Sharryl H Hawke a social scientist and coauthor with David Knox of One Child by Choice found that the same proportion  onethird of the group considered more parental attention an advantage as considered it a disadvantage Having your mother devote her days exclusively to you can be a delight for a child But if the child reaches 6 and is not permitted to spend five minutes alone the attention can be aggravating Encouraging children with their studies can build selfconfidence and security But nightly scrutiny at the dinner table can lead them to feel like a failure when they do not bring home an A exam paper You become an overachiever says one young woman Youre the only one If you have a bad year theres no one to compensate You cant fall back on the achievements of a brother or sister Parents tend to expect more of onlies And because they are forever firsttime parents they are less relaxed than parents who have more children Even into adulthood onlies feel a tremendous responsibility not to disappoint their parents I have a very strong sense of what my parents expectations of me are says a 35yearold newspaper reporter I feel better talking to them when I have a job or have a good project Im always trying to put up a brave front with them Because they are used to being alone only children tend to be less gregarious than siblings Nonetheless they are frequently leaders in school And since they do not have to share their room hide their diary from a kid brother or sister or wear handmedowns they are often the envy of their friends When it comes to possessions and experiences onlies know they have the better deal I always had a little more than everyone else says Ken Schwartz My parents could afford to give me iceskating lessons and art classes  anything I was interested in  because it was only me Only children in middleto uppermiddleclass families are often exposed from an early age to travel theater and fine dining Only an only child gets steak at a restaurant when she cant decide what she wants says Sally Clark 33 a magazine editor in Manhattan Parents dont order steak for three kids At some point however most only children ask  or at least yearn  for a brother or sister If that does not work they sometimes make one up There was an older girl who used to babysit for me Katie Schaefer recalls and I told my friends she was my older sister It was very important for me to be like everyone else Other onlies seeing friends scrapping with older siblings decide they are better off alone One only recalls having nightmares that her mother would have another child While conducting research for her book Sharryl Hawke found there are three moments in their lives when only children commonly wish for a sibling When they start first grade and realize other kids have brothers and sisters at adolescence when both boys and girls want an older brother boys for protection and girls to get them dates and when as adults their own children leave home and their parents are aging or dead Thats when many onlies have the greatest sense of having missed something says Sharryl Hawke The prospect of losing their spouse grows into a real fear and old friendships become particularly important Only children put great stock in friendships And because they have had no experience with the ups and downs of sibling relationships  battling one minute buddies the next  they tend to fear every quarrel as the end of a friendship If the friendship breaks up they are more inclined than other children to blame themselves says Dr Murray M Kappelman author of Raising the Only Child Onlies often find that making friends with other only children is the most satisfying arrangement If I get close to someone and find he has a brother he has a good relationship with I feel betrayed says David Barrett a 30yearold Manhattan lawyer I feel that I could never be as close to him as his brother is He would never need me as much as I need him I realize there are all kinds of reasons why he might trust me more but my gut reaction is otherwise Nonetheless many only children cherish a memory of dinners at the home of a friend from a large family I loved the freeforall says a young woman about meals with her best friends family of four daughters There wasnt so much attention focused on one person  on me When only children look for spouses they tend to seek out someone their own age Often they will marry another only or an eldest child Unconsciously they look for the sibling they never had says Sharryl Hawke Though it has been thought that onlies are bad marriage risks because they are not used to sharing recent studies show that onlies make no worse marriage partners than anyone else Their age at marriage and their rate of divorce are on a par with the national average When it comes to planning their own families however onlies are not inclined to repeat their own experience A Thanksgiving table set for three did not make them feel part of a family I want to have the family I never had says a young journalist now pregnant with her first child We want a family and that means a couple of kids Though only children sometimes imagine themselves at the head of a table of 10 children they more practically pick two as their ideal family size Single children who as adults do act out their fantasy by filling their house with kids are often unhappy The realities of noise tumult and sibling rivalry with which they have had no experience often shatter their longheld dream of what it would be like to have a big family A poignant disadvantage to only childhood is loneliness I wouldnt want a child of mine to get to be 31 and realize good times had been missed says Sally Clark who felt her childhood was short on exposure to peers Proponents of singlechild families say early and frequent exposure to other children combats loneliness And small nuclear families can be compensated for by including friends and other relatives to make an extended family particularly at holidays But onlies report feeling most acutely alone at the time of divorce or family crisis I was in college when my parents divorced says Ken Schwartz Until then I never felt alone But I had no grandparents anymore no first cousins few aunts and uncles  my mother is also an only child  and I realized then that there wasnt going to be much of a family in the future I wasnt going to have any support group when I was my parents age I realized Id never be a blood uncle and my kids wouldnt have any first cousins It was very scary Schwartz believes that divorce is worse for an only child Theres no such thing as being neutral he continues I kept wondering if I had done something wrong I became selfish As much as I care for my parents I resented the responsibility I was confessor and mediator I couldnt rid myself of the burden I wanted to talk to a brother or sister who would really understand Theres no way a friend can understand what went on in our household According to Dr Kappelman divorce is more difficult for the only child because the parents caught up in their own struggle tend to forget about him or her The only child is out there alone That must be recognized by the parent he says It must be reinforced to the child that We are separating but not from you Coping with the illness or death of a parent may also be worse for an only child because there is no sibling to share the decisionmaking or the grief Though the burden of looking after elderly parents is rarely distributed evenly among siblings an only child is more inclined to feel guilty If he or she does not visit an ailing parent no one will If a decision turns out to be a bad one there is no one to share the blame When his father died Dr Kappelman then 17 deferred mourning for 10 years As an only son I gave in to my mothers needs and widowhood During college Id drive home every Friday night to be with her and drive back at 5 the next morning for my Saturday lab What we both needed was to find our own peer group for support The portrait that emerges of a many singlechild parents is of careerminded people who generally prefer the company of adults They often struggle over the decision of whether to have a second baby as doubt lingers in one or both partners minds about the wisdom of having only one And while practicality wins out there is commonly ambivalence for years Some clinical observers have found that parents of onlies frequently have estranged relationships with their own siblings They are usually older and have been married longer than the average parent when their child is born But unlike their counterparts a generation ago todays singlechild parents are more likely to cite voluntary reasons for not having more children The explanations for the only children born in my generation were death hardship or fertility problems It was involuntary says Dr Falbo who is 34 years old A lot of husbands didnt return from World War II Now people use birth control Theyre making the choice Ray Garcia and Fruzsina Harsanyi of Washington are typical of the new breed of singlechild parents Both were previously married Ray 47 has two collegeage sons from his first marriage Fruzsina 38 had none An executive at an energysystems firm she had never found the right time to have a child First I was getting my PhD then I had just started a new job then I was in a high visibility job at HUD the Department of Housing and Urban Development Something always held me back But the scale tipped at some point I guess its the biological clock A year and a half ago their daughter Gabrielle was born Having a child is everything I always wanted it to be Fruzsina says Sometimes I think Id like to do it again But I cant imagine having more than one child from either the organizational or emotional standpoint I can do everything I want with Gabrielle and with my work Even without asking however parents of onlies often hear from friends relatives even near strangers who think they are making a big mistake It is a disservice to the child and to the parents themselves they argue But the implication is always that youre selfish and wrong says Sharryl Hawke the mother of an only son In terms of social acceptance the only child is more a last frontier than childlessness says H Theodore Groat professor of sociology at Bowling Green State University and author of a report published last April on adult only children Though we found no evidence of negative consequences for onlies in adult life Im sure we havent put to rest the notions about only children being disadvantaged What we have done is put the burden of proof on those who think there are significant personality differences to document them under controlled circumstances A look at history gives some understanding of the origins of the onlychild stereotype Until the turn of the century children were often needed as workers and because infant mortality was high it was economically important to have many children In the early 1900s G Stanley Hall a prominent psychologist reported on some of the first research on onlies He wrote Being an only child is a disease in itself  we commonly find the only child jealous selfish egotistical dependent aggressive domineering or quarrelsome Halls opinion was widely publicized and accepted  and it remained unchallenged for several decades More positive research in the 1940s and 50s  when big families were all the vogue  did little to change opinions Recent studies are likely to have more effect because there is more interest in having only children But says Dr Falbo acceptability will not really be won until there are more role models for having  and being  only children Whether the future will see a continuing increase in singlechild families seems to depend on the demographic theory to which one subscribes Richard A Easterlin professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania and author of the justreleased Birth and Fortune says that highbirthrate generations  like the postWorld War II baby boomers  are troubled by more peer competition resulting in high unemployment and lower salaries and therefore they have fewer children Lowbirthrate generations  like the baby booms parents and it seems likely their children  have more births because things are good for them economically On the other hand Charles F Westoff director of Princeton Universitys Office of Population Research predicts a continuation of the current low rate because of welldocumented changes in our society increased numbers of women in the work force delayed marriages and childbirth a high divorce rate and available contraception A third theory put forth by William P Butz and Michael P Ward economists with the Rand Corporation holds that fertility is high during a recession when womens wages are low and they are encouraged to stay at home and that fertility declines when womens wages rise and job opportunities increase There seems to be no accommodation however for times like the present when there is a recession and an increase in women in the work force National policy  a change in abortion laws for example  can also strongly influence birth trends For the time being the popularity of smaller families is unmistakable And perhaps the biggest winner has been the only child With new awareness of the benefits of single childhood and more available advice on how to avoid the pitfalls only children are finally shedding their pitiable image Kenneth Terhune the principal psychologist at Calspan Corporation a research organization in Buffalo put it most succinctly when he wrote The only child it seems is more maligned than maladjusted
"ENJOYING ITS MAJORITY, G.O.P. MAKES PLANS",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/18/weekinreview/enjoying-its-majority-gop-makes-plans.html,ON Tuesday there will be a Republican in the White House a Republican majority in the Senate and a strong minority in the House The Week in Review asked Senator Pete V Domenici of New Mexico chairman of the Budget Committee Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi House minority whip and Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon chairman of the Republican Conference to talk about how this new balance of power will work from the GOP perspective Excerpts of their discussion with Judith Miller Martin Tolchin and Steven V Roberts correspondents in the Washington Bureau of The New York Times and Caroline Rand Herron an editor of The Review follow Republican Priorities Question In the Carter years there was talk especially from Republicans about reasserting Congressional prerogatives What about with a Republican White House Mr Domenici Six or seven months ago I offered a proposal that if we dont have the courage to make cuts why dont we set a budget level and then say to President Carter We give you the prerogative within the following parameters to bring the budget under control In matters fiscal if we dont bring some kind of control my prediction is Either a constitutional amendment will be passed on balanced budgets or some kind of impoundment authority will be given to Presidents Mr Lott The other side of that might be that now that you have the power you might guard it a little bit jealously  as the Democrats have I think to the extreme Mr Packwood During the zenith of the antiVietnam feeling and the argument on the imperial Presidency we beat our breasts and passed only a couple of acts really the war powers act and the budget act which also contained recision Presidential authority subject to Congressional concurrence to cancel an appropriation Its not going to make any difference in the relation of Congress to the President just because the Republicans had a big sweep Mr Lott In my opinion Congress has been a little bit out of hand for several years  not just in the budget area also in foreign affairs I said that during the Carter Administration when I disagreed with a lot of what he was doing Q Where specifically did Congress overexert Mr Lott Well of course you could argue over any one you might cite Cyprus was one I dont think it worked out too well on either side for us Maybe we should get into certain areas But the sale of military weapons in the Middle East while Congress certainly has a say on money affairs the President has an extraordinary role To set the broad interest is one thing But on an issuetoissue basis I think theres a risk Mr Packwood There were specific actions which I expect any Congress will continue to take if we are riled up enough I dont think anybody is saying that the President ought to have a free hand to do whatever he wants in foreign policy including committing us to appropriations Mr Domenici But dont you agree that one of the most significant instruments in foreign policy is Americas military preparedness Is there any doubt that starting with Nixon weve been at such odds that we end up with a President who doesnt have the instruments he thinks he needs Mr Packwood Youre mixing apples and oranges You recall a year ago when we went down to see Carter This was Congress asking a President to support us in an arms increase not the other way around Mr Domenici But in the first couple of years of his Administration we were saying the opposite Mr Lott In the House well be able to find quite often enough Democrats agreeing with 192 Republicans to pass appropriate defense funding Q What are your plans for working with corralling seducing  whatever word you want to use  the 30 to 35 House Democrats who have put conservative pressure on the leadership and whose votes could swing control Mr Lott Well have some Republicans who have specific duties to work with Democrat Congressmen from Texas or Florida or Georgia or Oklahoma One of the things were going to do is to not demand their purity When its purely a partyline vote we wont go to them and really twist arms We will wait for those issues where it is really important And that does include the economy first off and defense Q Alexander Haig said that he does not consider himself bound by the partys foreign policy plank because he didnt play much of a role in creating it Mr Lott I dont agree with everything in it and I was vicechairman of it Q Do Congressional Republicans feel commitment to the Republican platform Mr Packwood To the good parts of it Mr Domenici That platform contains a very specific list of military hardware and it contains some very precise figures on what they ought to be spending I personally dont feel bound by that list in its entirety I hope that we have a team that will also look at what we can afford Q How about language concerning abortion busing school prayer Is there commitment there Mr Lott Presidentelect Reagan has indicated and were saying that at least initially we are going to be concentrating on the economy Q Would it be a mistake to get into these other areas Mr Domenici I hope were capable of improving the procedure which lets us vote on those issues If we could take the issues of abortion busing prayers in the schools and get them out of the appropriation process Mr Lott Thats been our problem in the House We cant get any of those things out of Judiciary Committee This route has been taken because theyve been stymied on even getting a hearing Mr Packwood Governor Reagan was elected because of foreign policy and defense spending and the economy He would be making a tragic mistake if he were to now put abortion and school busing and prayer on the front burner All it would do is divide the country divide Congress Ill be very surprised if this Administration makes any effort to push those issues Q Does being in the majority mean you have to look at some of these issues differently Mr Packwood Its different only in this sense Theres always a natural tendency for the party to want to support its President Thats been true I guess as long as weve had parties and Presidents Obviously it would also have been different had there been a Democratic President who was not advocating policies we agree with But not with the Republican President who I assume is going to advocate what we agree with Q Thats a unitary we How many Republican Parties are there Mr Packwood On most of the issues of defense foreign policy budget cuts there is going to be very close harmony Mr Domenici Would you not add some major effort to restrain abusive regulatory processes and a multiyear tax cut or tax reform program Thats an item on the fire Mr Packwood Its an item Although I find more difference of opinion even in the Administration on effective dates and business cuts or individual cuts with reports of the deficit getting bigger and bigger Mr Lott You know its always a matter of priority When youre in the minority you can have a shotgun blast but when you become a majority or you potentially have a working majority you have to have a list Q But theres been a very vocal element in your party that has put strong priority on some of these issues you now are saying should be put on the back burner Mr Lott But they recognize the economy has got to be dealt with I dont think its a matter of putting anything on the back burner Its deciding that you must act here first or all these other issues  they may not have a chance at all unless we deal with the economy Mr Domenici I dont want to let my friend from Oregons statement about the issues of abortion prayer in the school and the like  I think he was saying that theyre not of national significance enough to concern a President in terms of what should be on his platter I dont agree But I agree that this President has learned and his advisers have learned that one of the major shortcomings of President Carter is that he had too many legislative items Party Strategy Q What you were talking about could come under the general heading of getting Congressional Republicans off the hook Arent you abdicating responsibility Mr Domenici Absolutely not Neither Dave Stockman nor the Presidentelects other economic advisers claim to know it all Theyre getting many of the ideas from the good staff people here Its kind of a collegial effort for a change Beyond that it will be up to our own good leadership to get an agenda that will get the work done and still leave room for those other issues Mr Lott Right now were stuck with the Carter budget There are limitations on what we can do without the President taking some action And so we may ask him to because our hands are tied And then we will take up his battle On the social issues Certainly they will be volatile But they are there I still hope that a little momentum may fall by the wayside Busing for instance has been pushed awfully aggressively sometimes The way the Administration handles those issues may quieten them down It may not be such an emotional thing if handled differently Mr Packwood Good point Mr Lott But secondly when we finally do come to a decision or some votes on these issues it wont split the party We will disagree we may vote differently But its always been a philosophical rather than a partisan issue Mr Packwood I still sense that the majority of the people do not want to upset the Supreme Courts decision legalizing abortion I cant tell on school prayer one way or the other But I sense a growing irritation about quotas And in busing  I dont care how you cut it  you have to count Mr Lott I see weve already resolved one issue here Mr Packwood Now were down to only two Techniques and Goals Q Lets get down to procedure In budgeting when the time comes for a vote on issues affecting your state all of a sudden there is a different view about what is indispensible What will Republicans do to enhance the ability of Congress to make those painful cuts Mr Domenici We are going to attempt to come up with a mechanism whereby there will not have to be literally scores of individual votes Mr Packwood Thats the key Mr Domenici  and that there is a reconciliationrecisiondeferral package that may end up with only four or five major votes in each body to carry out at least the first thrust of a multiyear budgetcontrol package Q Is that to spread the political risk so Mr Packwood Let me rephrase it So the entire public thats affected feels that everybody is taking a cut If you start coming down the road with a 700 million cut in the sewer program and a 11 million cut in a highway program and each of them are individual votes and each of us has a sewer plant and a highway  If we cannot get a reasonably consolidated vote then youre going to see the power delegated back to the President Q During the campaign when asked repeatedly how he would balance the budget cut taxes and increase defense spending the Presidentelects answer was Cut fraud and waste and abuse Are you all saying that was unrealistic Mr Domenici The word waste does not mean that the law as it is on the books is being abused It can mean that the law has vested certain people with rights to get benefits that the average American would think wasteful You very well could be saying theres a better way to structure the benefits so that those most in need continue to get food stamps and maybe even more Mr Lott That could apply to farmers home loans Q In other words however you define waste there are going to have to be substantive cuts in programs Mr Packwood They could be cut off or you may tighten further eligibility You may almost freeze it Mr Lott Im not a budget expert but I just have to say I dont necessarily think it means a significant number of people are going to be cut off We still need that safety net there Its just a matter of how its administered Mr Packwood For example if you have a program which requires eligibility of 6000 income or below then you simply dont change the 6000 regardless of inflation Mr Lott Youve seen Stockmans list The cuts dont involve very many people Youre talking about junk mail subsidy Youre talking about arts and humanities programs Q One year from now what would you like to have done Mr Domenici In energy I hope that pricing of crude oil and gasoline will have been deregulated I hope our President exercises his prerogative On the budget end I would hope that we would have forced a vote which would cut this years budget somewhere between 12 and 15 billion basically modify the flow of tax dollars under current law about 30 to 40 billion and put in place a multiyear taxreform taxcut package that is heavy on the side of reinvesting in this nation Mr Packwood I echo that And that we dont wander off into extraneous unrelated matters Mr Lott I just hope that after a year it will be evident to the American people that we are determined that Congress and the President work together and that the economy is going to be turned around
ARE THESE HOLLYWOOD'S FINEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/20/movies/are-these-hollywood-s-finest.html,Academy Award season has rolled around again and the studios are once more spending hundreds of thousands of dollars advertising their candidates Columbia has budgeted 400000 for tradepaper advertisements in an attempt to get nominations for its seven pictures while 20th CenturyFox is spending 250000 on its seven films The results sometimes seem bizarre Among the actors whose performances were demolished by most critics Chevy Chase Seems Like Old Times George C Scott The Formula and Gene Wilder Stir Crazy are being promoted by their studios for best actor All three movies which were equally demolished are being offered for best picture At a cost of from 2900 to 4500 apiece for purchasing the space creating a design and doing the engraving there are also multiple two or fourcolor ads for Deborah Raffin Touched by Love Amy Irving The Competition John Travolta Urban Cowboy Clint Eastwood best actor and best director for Bronco Billy Anne Bancroft The Elephant Man Barbara Hershey The Stunt Man and Robert Sacchi The Man With Bogarts Face People look at some of our ads and say They cant be serious says one studio vice president But we do it to cement relationships We massage the actors ego because were looking forward to the actors next picture not back to the picture were advertising And an ad or even a series of ads is a relatively small price to pay Directors writers sometimes even cinematographers are as vain as the actors says a different studios vice president of publicity All the studios get deluged by managers and agents whose clients want ads Some of the actors and film makers even count pages They say Fox bought six pages for Dolly Parton why do I only get four Advertisements do serve some legitimate purposes of course In particular they serve to remind Academy members of technical accomplishments Although even some of the ads for technical achievements do appear to get out of hand There was one for best costume design for the prison uniforms in Brubaker Ads are also effective reminders of praised supporting performances in movies that came out early in the year such as Levon Helms father in Coal Miners Daughter and of praised performances in movies that almost no one went to see such as Diana Scarwid in Inside Moves Blythe Danner and Michael OKeefe in The Great Santini Sam Shepard in Resurrection or Mary Steenburgen in Melvin and Howard And we always try to include screening information in our ads says Marvin Levy Columbia vice president since the prime purpose of the ads is to get Academy members to see the film No amount of advertising in the world can win a nomination for a movie no one has seen Gary Kurtz producer of Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back is the latest of the cinema school graduates of the 1960s to become a director Mr Kurtz a classmate of George Lucas Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins at the University of Southern California and Mr Lucass producer for the last six years will direct Mr God This Is Anna based on a fiveyearold book that has a cult following in England David Essex the English rock star told me he would play in the movie free says Lawrence Bachmann who will produce Mr God This Is AnnaAfter I bought the book Kurtz called to tell me that he and his wife are crazy about the book and he wanted to direct it Mr God This Is Anna which takes place during World War II is says Mr Bachmann a true story published pseudonymously of an English child with a startling effect on everybody she meets Mr Bachmann who was head of production in England for MetroGoldwynMayer for 15 years works out of his house in Oxford You dont need a huge organization he says You dont need wastefully high budgets All you need is a good story the right attack and the determination to make a movie for a reasonable price Mr Bachmann is the son of a Hollywood pioneer JG Bachmann who ran Paramount with BP Schulberg and gave such directors as Dorothy Arzner and Ernst Lubitsch their chance in Hollywood He is producing Whose Life Is It Anyway at MGM After he had purchased that awardwinning Broadway play he was turned down by every studio  including MGM twice  before David Begelman the new president of MGM agreed to back the 125 million movie According to Mr Bachmann Dustin Hoffman Jack Nicholson and Robert Redford were interested in playing the movies quadraplegic hero but insisted on seeing a finished script Richard Dreyfuss who is starring in the film agreed to sign for the role without that demand Mr Bachmann will follow Whose Life Is It Anyway with John Wyndhams sciencefiction classic The Midwich Cuckoos also for MGM Oddly enough Mr Bachmann was responsible for The Village of the Damned the 1959 version of the same novel in which the women of an English village are impregnated by malevolent unearthly beings I couldnt really do the book properly then he says of overseeing that production in England for MGM Twenty years ago you couldnt talk about abortion censorship didnt even allow you to mention impregnation This time well do it right For the first time in its history the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has been plagued by forged identification cards A woman was arrested in the lobby of a Westwood theater last week after she tried to get into the theater using a 1980 Academy card she said she had bought for 30 Academy cards this time of year allow their holders to get into almost any firstrun Los Angeles movie theater free so that they may see films on which they will have to vote for awards According to Art Sarno publicity man for the academy no one knows whether there are 20 or 2000 forged membership cards The academy is reprinting its 1981 card in a different color and is working with the Los Angeles Motion Picture District Attorneys Task Force to check on possible criminal prosecution of people who are using the forged cards
IN THE NATION; Mandate And Burden,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/20/opinion/in-the-nation-mandate-and-burden.html,Ronald Reagan is being inaugurated as the 40th President of the United States for one reason above all others  because high inflation and interest rates and continuing unemployment convinced the public that his economic promises offered more hope than Jimmy Carters discredited policies If that is so then the primary standard by which Mr Reagan should be judged in the coming years is his success or lack of it in righting the economy  most particularly in bringing down the rate of price increases Conservatives will of course protest properly that there were other causes for Mr Reagans electoral college landslide Closely examined however none seem remotely as important as economic discontent and the publics desire to try a new approach The public certainly endorsed the Republican candidates promises to cut Federal spending and slash income tax rates by 10 percent a year for three consecutive years But he proposed these steps primarily as a means to the greater end of revitalizing the economy and controlling inflation The new President won votes too with his promise to strengthen the nations military forces But this was a matter of credibility rather than policy since Mr Carter made the same promise In his final budget the outgoing President called for a 63 billion increase in fiscal 1981 military spending and recommended future rises of 5 percent annually after inflation Mr Reagan will not find the money to do much more One of Mr Reagans most consistent themes was that he would get the Government off the backs of the people But neither a postelection poll by Dr Gallup nor a New York Times CBS survey of those who voted found a demand for diminished public services Nor did Mr Reagan contend in his campaign that getting the Government off our backs required anything so radical as a repeal of the New Deal and its progeny Rather he worked hard to reassure the voters of his support for Social Security for one good example and throughout the campaign he prudently slipped toward the center from his more rightward stance in the primaries That reflected the historical fact that the American electorate does not choose radical Presidents whether of the left or right Mr Reagan opposed abortion  a contradiction since his approach would return Government to the backs of women  and the Equal Rights Amendment two good reasons why he got the support of the Moral Majority and other cultural counterrevolutionaries They were an important element of his coalition but it can hardly be said that their concerns were his major issues or that as President theres much he can do about them Mr Reagan no doubt will try to keep faith with all those who supported him for any of these reasons But the pattern of his and his personal teams transition activities leaves little doubt that they too consider the economy not just his first priority but the principal test of his Presidency And few men have entered the White House facing a more complex task The longterm inflation rate is running at 10 percent and in 1981 a wage spurt of 10 percent or so is expected as workers try to catch up in the familiar inflationary cycle Social Security benefits and others indexed to the cost of living will rise too Increased payroll taxes and a minimum wage rise have already given the economy its first inflationary shot of 1981 Productivity gains that might compensate are not in sight and the trend has been down not up Mr Carters proposed military spending let alone any that Mr Reagan effects beyond that will be particularly inflationary since it adds nothing to supply in the marketplace Spending cuts that might offset the military increase will be found if at all in a Federal budget in which approximately 75 percent of expenditures are uncontrollable  from hardtocut entitlement programs such as Medicare and food stamps to interest payments on the national debt What OPEC might do to American prices is unpredictable  but what the immediate decontrol of domestic oil and gas will do is not The effect of the proposed Reagan tax cuts is hotly disputed conventional economists say it will be inflationary but Laffer Curve fans insist the plan will generate investment and production hence expand the tax base to compensate for lower tax rates We shall see Jimmy Carter found that even an induced recession couldnt slow inflation as a downturn used to do Compensation to the unemployed nowadays helps keep demand high and in the 1980 slump factory wage levels actually rose by 11 percent So Ronald Reagan faces a task perhaps as formidable as that which confronted Franklin Roosevelt 48 years ago  and without the emergency conditions and Congressional majorities that gave FDR virtually a free hand All Americans will wish their new President well as he begins the job  but none should expect miracles nor demand success tomorrow
REFORMER WHO WOULD REVERSE THE NEW DEAL'S LEGACY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/21/us/reformer-who-would-reverse-the-new-deal-s-legacy.html,The nation today arrived at a fascinating and quite remarkable moment in its political history A 69yearold citizen politician who spent most of his working life in another profession has entered the White House and won the opportunity to lead what he hopes will become a political revolution Or more precisely to lead a conservative political reformation that seeks to redirect the role of government in American life and perhaps to reshape the national political landscape for the rest of the century For Ronald Wilson Reagan inaugurated today as the nations 40th President is a crusader the first missionary conservative to gain the White House with the aim of reversing the liberal New Deal revolution of governmental activism and Democratic Party dominance established by Franklin D Roosevelt nearly half a century ago He comes as a reformer preaching the gospel that government is not the solution government is the problem promising an era of national renewal based on less government not more and projecting that same jaunty smiling selfconfidence of Mr Roosevelt in the teeth of public cynicism and economic despair Would Reverse New Deal Legacy In philosophical terms Mr Reagan has proclaimed his opposition to the principal legacy of the New Deal that the private sector left to itself cannot be trusted to produce progress and social justice and that government must intervene to protect the citizenry and to promote their welfare in virtually every walk of life His domestic agenda calls for reducing taxes curbing Federal spending rolling back regulations holding the line on hiring dismantling at least one Cabinet department moving to turn back to the states some functions of the sprawling Federal establishment His faith is that by releasing the shackled potential of private enterprise America can embark on a new era of economic growth regain its oncevaunted technological supremacy and international competitiveness and ultimately work itself out of crippling and demoralizing inflation His foreign policy agenda calls above all for a restoration of the margin of safety in the strategic nuclear competition with the Soviet Union reversing what he has described as the perilous vulnerability of the nations strategic deterrent forces and reversing what conservatives have decried as the policy of American vacillation and retreat around the globe Only after that process has begun and the new Administration has moved to bolster the Atlantic Alliance Mr Reagan has said will he be ready to take up serious negotiations for arms control Monumental Challenge The challenge is monumental For this son of Hollywood has captured the Presidency at a time when the wellsprings of national confidence had nearly run dry and the yearning for America to regain control of its destiny is palpable across the land A decade ago the seemingly endless agony of the Vietnam War sapped the nations strength and morale and left the stinging sensation that something had gone profoundly wrong The seizure of the American hostages in Iran sharpened the pain of national humiliation For 14 long months those hostages pawns in internal Iranian feuding were a metaphor for Americas sense of impotence Their release on the day of Mr Reagans inauguration has brought a surge of good feeling a national sigh of relief that the torment of the hostage ordeal is now over But the long deadlock has left a residue of bitterness as well as uncertainty here and abroad about whether America has the strength and resolve to protect its public servants from terrorism in other lands The new Administration enters office knowing it may barely have time to catch its breath before having to confront another hostage crisis in El Salvador or some other turbulent nation At home the nations economic afflictions seem to have baffled economic thinkers and foiled policymakers Three Presidents have ventured forth to do battle with the twinheaded monster of inflation and unemployment and though sometimes temporarily successful they have ultimately been devoured National Problems Americas aging industry loses out increasingly to foreign competitors Growing dependence on imported oil has been an insistent reminder of the limits of Americas once seemingly inexhaustible resources and of its new vulnerability to the leverage of alien powers Americans may laugh about watching Japanese television sets driving German cars or seeing wealthy Arabs buying up choice real estate but theirs is brittle laughter In the wake of Vietnam and Watergate the powers of the Presidency have been at ebb tide The Watergate scandal undermined public confidence in politics and politicians Congressional assertiveness matched foreign assertiveness For eight of the last 12 years the Government stood stalmated by Democratic control of Congress and Republican control of the White House Yet even with both branches of Government in Democratic hands under Jimmy Carter power was so fragmented that special interests perpetuated many stalemates with their singleminded legislative obstructionism Mr Carter had ambitions for an energentic Presidency but proved unable to generated a cohesive purposeful governing coalition Now with the characteristic optimism of the newly elected the Reagan Adminstration proclaims its power to overcome national disarray and to set a positive new course Bolstered by the first Republican majority in the Senate in 26 years plus 33 new seats and a conservative though not Republican majority in the House of Representatives the new Republican leadership contends that the Reagan electoral landslide gave them a mandate for a bold experiment n conservatism Hopes for Republican Era Party leaders like Bill Brock the former National Chairman think at long last they discern the end of the Democratic era and perceive the potential for a fundamental political realignment that will make the Republicans with their base in the West and South the dominant party in America for the rest of the century Yet doubts linger Once before when Dwight D Eisenhower won the Presidency in 1952 after 20 years of Democratic rule the Republicans thought they had overturned the powerful New Deal coalition Later in 1968 Richard M Nixon thought his ascendancy signaled a turning point But in neither case was a political watershed crossed Now some Republicans believe an irresistable conservative tide has swept the nation With the defeat of such Democratic liberal champions in the Senate as George McGovern of South Dakota Frank Church of Idaho and John C Culver of Iowa they say the mood of the country and Congress has shifted irreversibly to the right But they overlook the fact that moderates and liberals were also winning in such diverse states as California Vermont Maryland Colorado Georgia and Washington and that the 1980 vote may have been primarily a mass protest againt the ins The test of the political trends and of the Republican performance will come in the 1982 and 1984 elections We have brought together the elements of a new coalition observed Mr Brock The cementing of that coalition depends on our performance in office Weve got to act with some urgency to deal with the problems of which people voted An Unusual Odyssey For Ronald Reagan personally this moment this challenge represents the culmination of an unusual political odyssey It began with his televised speech in 1964 on behalf of Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona a stirring address that catapulted him into the conservative vanguard led to two successful runs for governor of California and three tries for the Presidency By quoting or evoking Franklin Delano Roosevelt so often this past year Mr Reagan has escalated expectations and invited exalted comparisons for his Presidency His supporters relish the notion that he could become a conservative Republican version of Mr Roosevelt I divide American Presidents into journeymen Presidents who run the machine and make it go and symbolic Presidents who make radical changes said Howard H Baker Jr the new Senate majority leader Ford and Carter and even Truman and Johnson were journeymen Presidents Roosevelt and Nixon were symbolic Presidents Nixon made drastic changes in foreign policy I think Reagan will be a symbolic President Some Presidential scholars like James David Barber of Duke University discount Mr Reagans upbeat speeches as simplistic and unrealistic cheerleading without clear purpose and vision They expect him to be a fairly passive President a throwback to the conservative probusiness quietism of Warren G Harding or William Howard Taft Touch of Kennedy Magic Seen Other scholars such as Tom Cronin of Colorado College detect a touch of the Kennedy magic and glamour in Mr Reagans rhetoric and his political presence John F Kennedy had a way with words a way of talking about issues in simple terms that made them interesting and got people to listen said Dr Cronin Reagan has that knack too And like Kennedy there is a contagious optmism about him He realizes theres a morale problem in this country and he addresses it Still others compare the Californian with Dwight Eisenhower another citizenpolitican with roots in the Middle West who brought to the President the uncomplicated outlook of smalltown America a faith in free enterprise a penchant for delegating authority to powerful subordinates a corporate style of leadership and the infectious charm and geewhiz grin of the boy next door But Mr Reagan has already foreshadowed a more activist Presidency than Mr Eisenhowers He has encouraged extravagant expectations and his advisers know that if he is to succeed he will need time  time to revive the economy to revitalize defense to revamp the Government and to reverse inflation The time imperative presses him to produce an immediate sense of forward motion to produce the feeling that he has taken charge and begun to halt the drift and uncertainty that caused such an explosive burst of voter frustration against the Democrats And he has signaled that he intends his first days in office to convey a sense of urgency The most natural political asset of this son of a shoe salesman from Tampico Ill whose highest boyhod ambition was to be a playbyplay announcer for the Chicago Cubs is his capacity for communication For he has won a reputation as the most effective media politician of the television era a man who can project his vision to the people and periodically replenish his political power by ralling popular support Real Political Test However it will take more than stage presence for him to succeed The real test will be whether President Reagan can forge an effective coalition with Congress to carry out his conservative agenda His advisers sense the need to discipline Congressional Republicans to shed the disorderly habits of opposition They say in advance that the new President must avoid being lured away from his central priorities into the byways of controversy over such pet conservative issues as abortion school prayer or gun control They recognize the need to win over moderates Eager to broaden his political support Mr Reagan has risked irking his hardright loyalists by assembling a Cabinet and a group of toplevel White House advisers that is decidedly mainstream Republican Pragmatic establishment Republicans outnumber conservative ideologues Easterners hold more than half of the top 15 positions On his preinaugural trips to Washington Mr Reagan has begun wooing Democrats as well as fellow Republicans The challenge now is to marshal that support for his own objectives and to know when to make the vital compromises that insure his political momentum We have the opportunity to do what Konrad Adenauer did in Germany to become the party of peace and prosperity and to stay in power for two generations said Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York an enthusiastic Reaganite But so far what weve done is make campaign promises Well be the majority party once we show we can implement policies that bring about the prosperity and full employment without inflation that we have promised If we fail then 1980 will turn out not to have been a signifiant election after all
"POMP, FUR COATS AND SUN FOR THE HAPPY NEW PRESIDENT",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/21/us/pomp-fur-coats-and-sun-for-the-happy-new-president.html,Blowing kisses singing the Marine Hymn and waving his greetings all the way from Capitol Hill to the White House Ronald Reagan took charge of the nations core today at the head of his own parade and even filled in the lulls by working the Presidential reviewing stand with handshakes and kind words for the happy workers of his new Administration Americans returned his enthusiasm as they watched in waves 10 deep along Pennsylvania Avenue as Mr Reagan slowly rode by in an opentop limousine with his wife Nancy at his side bright as a beacon in a cardinalred outfit The day seemed perfectly cued for Mr Reagans triumphal arrival to power with a welltimed flood of sunshine bathing him as he reached his inaugural peroration on the gleaming Presidential perch built onto the Capitols west front It Made Me Cry Oh its so good it made me cry shouted Maxine Hinkle a Reagan Republican from Buchanan WVa I cant believe how everything is coming out a happy ending The almost balmy day saw some Republicans in the VIP stands shedding their fur coats as they returned to power after a fouryear absence and they applauded marched danced and congratulated one another into the night at a dozen spots with the Democrats gone from sight For some in the crowd it was a test to find some bit of human scale or significant symbol in an inauguration deliberately planned as a lavish one as a sign of renewed Presidential power In the last inauguration Jimmy Carter fantasized the common man walking down Pennsylvania Avenue but Reagan fantasizes the business man coming on strong in a limo said Charles Minkowitz an economics student at George Washington University who rode his bike downtown to see the parade For my money we need a businessman fantasy right now so Reagan is right on time A Bucket to Stand On At the fringes of the Capitol throng Ann Schutt borrowed a bucket to stand on and got a glimpse of the distant President but heard only snatches of his speech Something about the will to survive and that sounded good to me said Mrs Schutt who said she had long been a Reagan supporter because of his opposition to abortion Ignoring the speech and the parade Richard Kornicke stationed himself at the south fence of the White House all day with an open umbrella that carried a last letterstitched message to Jimmy Carter Thank you Mr President for four years of peace Mr Kornicke said he wanted no part of the new President Did you see them on television last night sitting there like a king and his queen as all these stars catered to them The rule of this city today though was honest enthusiasm for a moment in history Even some students who were shouting Hell no we wont go we wont fight for Texaco  an echo of protests past carried on over the new draft registration  pushed forward and craned in simple curiosity as their new President went by at 10th Street The crowds were happy and relaxed gathering at idle moments around people with portable radios and television sets Theyre in the air a bearded man shouted from one of these clusters moments after the Presidents speech was over No one had to ask what he meant and the word of the hostages freedom spread across the Capitol lawn A Doomsday Sandwich Board Mr Reagan had not gone three blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue until he passed the first doomsday sandwich board of his Administration handprinted and carried by a sadfaced man named Tom Phelan You Can Save the World and You Better the sign advised The new President seemed attentive to every instant of his day from the sudden thumping of the 21gun salute at his moment of taking office to the various types of horses that pranced past the gentleman rancher as he sat in the parade reviewing stand outside the White House Each fresh marching contingent seemed to get some special wave or signal from the President and as his wife clapped marching time Mr Reagan could be seen singing along with the bouncy service themes as the bands of the Marines Air Force and Navy moved past At the outset the parade was not run with campaign efficiency and the Presidents Cabinet nominees their families and friends waited idly as nothing went past finally laughing and applauding a mere police car that motored by Set off in a grand glassfronted showcase the new Reagan retinue was studied tightly by people in nearby reveiwing stands One man nudged another and pointed to the sight of Henry A Kissinger a Secretary of State from past Republican administrations working his way over to chat in the front row with Alexander M Haig Jr Mr Reagans choice for Secretaty of State After a moment Mr Haig took out a note pad and jotted down something as Mr Kissinger talked From Boone to Buckley Mr Reagan himself dealt neatly with a similar moment of nonparade by simply turning his back on the reviewing window  and the nation and enthusiastically working his own happy claque of supporters and loved ones as if they were the first Iowa caucuses of 1984 The day was planted firmly in patriotism right down to the nights crashing splurge of fireworks At noon the Capitol throng gathered for the oath of office was urged to stand join hands and sing a stanza of America the Beautiful Obediently many did particularly those in the front rows where the range of upraised voices stretched from Pat Boone the entertainer to William F Buckley Jr the conservative polemicist Some witnesses seemed to hear what they wanted as the new Administration paraded into town I know Mr Reagan said he wants to cut the bureaucracy down said Thomas Benignus a handsomely large civil servant who was recalling inaugurations back to the frosty day of John F Kennedys resolve But you know one of the great things about this country is that the Government doesnt depend on the wishes of one man alone A Day for Museums Too He obviously felt unthreatened in the warm inaugural sunshine Even more contained only a block away from the parade was Stanley Mires a lawyer with the Postal Service who skipped the festivity and leisurely visited the newly opened display of Leonardo da Vincis Codex Leicester at the Corcoran Gallery Inauguration Day is one of the best times to find the museums empty he explained holding a magnifying glass up to the priceless 450yearold diary Outside Michael McDonagh followed the parade with the relish of a historian but the ambivalence of a Democrat I got involved in politics in the days of Eugene McCarthy he explained And I fear its going to take 8 or 10 years before these guys are done again Out on Pennsylvania Avenue the parade of Republicans went by oblivious happy incumbent
ABORTION FOES MEET WITH REAGAN AFTER MARCH IN CAPITAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/23/us/abortion-foes-meet-with-reagan-after-march-in-capital.html,Thousands of foes of abortion marched from the White House to the Capitol today to demand a constitutional amendment to protect the life of the unborn The marchers denounced as infamy the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that overturned state laws prohibiting abortion They sang the Battle Hymn of the Republic and chanted We want life yes we do we want life how about you Seven representatives of the marchers met later for 30 minutes in the Oval office with President Reagan Health and Human Services Secretary Richard S Schweiker and several members of the House of Representatives The marchers did not seek a commitment from the President on the constitutional amendment but their spokesman said it would be difficult to understand how Congress could continue to waste any more time before acting on the amendment knowing that the President was committed to the goals of opponents of abortion Crowd Estimate of 50000 The March for Life was organized by Nellie Gray a retired Federal employee who has planned a march every year on the anniversary of the court decision The crowd was estimated by the Washington police at 50000 On Capitol Hill Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina and Representative Robert Dornan Republican of California introduced a constitutional amendment that would establish the full right to life from the moment of conception Senator Jake Garn Republican of Utah filed another amendment that would ban abortions except when the life of the mother was threatened Earlier a cheering throng assembled on the oval park south of the White House for the march and heard Secretary Schweiker pledge that his department would pursue a policy of opposing abortion The department is responsible for administering the program that provides Federal money for women unable to pay for an abortion When the marchers reached Capitol Hill they split into groups assigned to lobby in the House and Senate office buildings and began making the rounds of Congressional offices Karen Mulauser executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League said at a news conference here today that she found it odd that conservatives who say they want to reduce government interference in private matters want to tell a woman a family they must bear a child when one was not planned It might require an enforcement program to prosecute the women who had abortions and prompt creation of a Federal Bureau of Pregnancy Investigation she said
REAGAN ORDERS CUT IN FEDERAL TRAVEL AND CONSULKTANT USE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/23/us/reagan-orders-cut-in-federal-travel-and-consulktant-use.html,President Reagan in another set of actions underscoring his Inauguration Day declaration that government is the problem today ordered a 15 percent reduction in travel by Federal employees a 5 percent reduction in consulting services and limits on furniture procurement and unnecessary office refurbishments On his third day in office the President also chose Vice President Bush to head a new interagency study group aimed at easing Government regulations Mr Bush said the Reagan Administration would lift some regulations even before the study group got started Were seeking real reform and tangible results Mr Reagan told reporters at a surprise appearance in the White House press briefing room as Mr Bush stood at his side He said the study group would cut away the thicket of irrational and senseless regulations Mr Reagan declined to answer questions but James S Brady his press secretary said the President would hold his first news conference soon Other Administration officials said it could be early next week The White House press office said the costcutting directives issued today would yield 300 million in savings a large part of which would come from the travel curbs Federal travel and transportation now costs nearly 9 billion annually most of it for the military Mr Reagans 15 percent reduction does not apply to permanent changes in station for military personnel The President had another busy day of both courtesy calls and staff meetings The courtesy calls were primarily separate visits with key Democratic members of the House of Representatives who are going to have a say in the handling of the Presidents legislation on energy and the economy This morning Mr Reagan also met again with individual Cabinet members and their families for picturetaking sessions Joking about the delays in Senate confirmation for many of them he said he was surprised that with the delays some of them had not gotten up and said I dont work here and walked out The Cabinet members laughed A formal swearingin ceremony for the Cabinet as a group has been postponed twice by Mr Reagan but some Cabinet members have arranged for themselves to be sworn in separately Secretary of State Alexander M Haig Jr did just that this morning taking the oath of office at the White House The President met briefly this afternoon with the March for Life a coalition of antiabortion groups Several hundred members earlier had marched outside the White House shouting We want Reagan We want Reagan As a Presidential candidate Mr Reagan several times endorsed a Constitutional amendment to ban abortions The onehour meeting was Mr Reagans first visit at the White House with a public organization and he took the occasion to praise the groups for their work Afterward John McKay a leader of the Ad Hoc Commitee in Defense of Life praised Mr Reagan for his superb commitment to the antiabortion cause The coalition also presented the President a bouquet of longstemmed red roses Mr Brady the White House press secretary said today that on his first day in office Mr Reagan had made brief telephone calls to the leaders of Canada France Britain West Germany Italy and Japan But as the new Administration was taking its first steps on curbing Government which Reagan aides have said would be their first priority it was finding its actions once again overshadowed by the continuing attention given to both the return of the 52 American hostages from Iran and the news that they had been subjected to abuse while in captivity In Praise of Patriotism Mr Reagans only direct public comments on the subject came in a statement he asked to have conveyed to the freed hostages praising their professionalism and patriotism Mr Brady said Mr Reagan was saving expanded comment on the situation for his first news conference Mr Reagans order on unnecessary travel furniture procurement and refurbishment came in the form of a memorandum to all heads of departments and agencies Mr Brady said it would also apply to the Presidential office at the White House but he said that Mr Reagan intended to go ahead with a complete refurbishment of the living quarters at the White House Mr Reagans wife Nancy has hired Ted Graber a Beverly Hills Calif interior decorator to arrange that work Each new incoming administration is given 50000 to redecorate the living quarters Former President Carter did not spend all of this sum Mr Brady said and as a result theres a great deal of painting cleaning and fixingup to be done Various newspaper articles on Mr Graber have reported that his costs will be considerably in excess of 50000 However Sheila Patton press secretary to Mrs Reagan said today that any costs over 50000 would be raised from private sources The Reagans have raised several million dollars from contributors for expenses related to the transition and inauguration

DEMOCRATS IN SEARCH OF IDEAS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/magazine/democrats-in-search-of-ideas.html,4747 words Tom Wicker writes The New York Timess In the Nation column twice weekly By Tom Wicker Campaigning for reelection last year in a South Dakota supermarket George S McGovern met two elderly women who said they would vote against him because he was too liberal Then he watched them pay for their groceries with food stamps  the fruits of a liberal Democratic program that no one had supported more vigorously than he That told him the former Senator says that his reelection campaign was lost And all too many other voters in 1980 seemed as willing to forget or overlook years of Democratic programs that have helped people with everything from medical problems to home mortgages When the smoke of election cleared the party had lost the Presidency 12 Senate seats  including Mr McGoverns  33 House seats four governorships and 220 state legislative posts Now with Ronald Reagan in the White House the Republicans controlling the Senate and the conservative movement having won its chance to reshape the country the Democrats are in the words of Scott Matheson the Democratic Governor of Utah a disheveled lot Their basic approach  big and costly Government programs of benevolent intent but mixed results  has fallen into disrepute with inflationconscious voters Little is agreed upon to replace or supplement that approach which goes back to Franklin D Roosevelt and the partys organization is almost nonexistent On the last point the Democrats need a new chairman capable of holding the partys various factions tenuously together but favoring none Fund raising will be crucial and the party probably will have to shift from an emphasis on big contributions to a broader base of small but consistent givers  a system that was one of a number of innovations developed by the Republicans as a consequence of their 1964 debacle when Barry Goldwater was defeated by Lyndon B Johnson in a landslide At party headquarters concentrating exclusively on winning and holding the White House will no longer do Future Presidential victories to be solid will have to be built from the ground up with intelligent concentration on local state and Congressional campaigns In the last four years under chairman Bill Brock of Tennessee the Republican National Committee poured more than 5 million into winning state legislative seats  an imaginative longterm investment that will pay large dividends in future candidacies for higher office especially when states begin the redistricting necessitated by the 1980 census Many leading Democrats also believe their party has been coasting on old victories Some of them think it needs a new kind of instrument similar to the old Democratic Advisory Committee of the 1950s to help develop and publicize what has been most lacking  new ideas about governing and new means of pursuing the traditional Democratic goals of social and economic justice and economic opportunity for all without bankrupting or alienating the middle class Such revitalization is overdue for a party that has let itself become the proponent of political orthodoxy and elephantine bureaucracy Even a certified thinker like Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan New Yorks Democratic senior Senator concedes that most of the intellectual ferment in recent American politics has bubbled up on the Republican side  producing for example advocacy of supplyside economics This is an an innovative approach emphasizing Government stimulation of production rather than consumption that sounds appealing whether or not it is put into practice by the Reagan Administration and proves ultimately successful One of Bill Brocks favorite dictums while GOP chairman was that politics is a battle of ideas The 1980 election is a clear warning that the current battle of ideas is being won by the Republicans with their emphasis on a return to the free marketplace and diminished Government intervention in the private lives of Americans This represents a remarkable turnaround in modern American politics In the waning days of his reelection campaign for example Jimmy Carter reiterated day after day the old oncesuccessful theme that the Democrats had conquered the Depression invented Social Security and Medicare and  against callous Hooveresque Republican opposition  created the good life for the average American Even the kind of audiences that usually turn out for Democratic rallies seemed to find this appeal tired if not tiresome The Reagan formula Get the Government off the backs of the American people certainly produced more votes  84 million more Probably nothing less than such a jolt could have evoked so much soulsearching in the party of FDR JFK and LBJ Organizationally the Democrats have already begun to meet their problems An agreement has been reached for example among four important party figures  Senator Edward M Kennedy Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Lane Kirkland of the AFLCIO and Walter F Mondale the former Vice President  that they will try to find a national chairman acceptable to all segments of the party Jimmy Carter very nearly discredited politically by his smashing defeat apparently intends to take little part in this or any other party decision The most active candidate for the chairmanship is Charles T Manatt twice the California state chairman no real campaigns are visible for others being mentioned including former Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former state chairman Patrick J Cunningham of New York Democratic members of the House and Senate moreover have declared that they expect all candidates for the chairmanship to appear before them prior to the chairmans election by the Democratic National Committee in late February So have the Democratic governors and the conference of state party chairmen This is a beginning on the task of moving the national committee away from concentrating heavily on the Presidency which it has done at least since the Johnson Administration Numerous Democrats  as diverse as Lieut Gov Mario Cuomo of New York and Representative Henry S Reuss of Wisconsin  have come forward with blueprints for a new Democratic Advisory Committee to help reformulate party policies Capitol Hill powers like Mr ONeill have expressed support for the idea if not for any particular plan The outgoing Democratic chairman John C White of Texas  who has been sharply criticized for focusing too narrowly on Mr Carters reelection  has even suggested that the Democratic National Committee headquarters be moved from downtown Washington to a new location on Capitol Hill Such a move would be symbolically apt besides thats where the Republicans are located and they seem to be doing something right In the realm of ideas there is not yet general agreement among Democrats on what needs to be done significantly however there is more talk about what to do in the future than about triumphs in the past A recurrent theme among Democrats concerned for their partys rebirth is that theres nothing wrong with its goals  whats needed are new ways of pursuing them less bureaucratic less costly less intrusive more effective ways Some noteworthy stirrings are visible  particularly among younger Democrats with no great emotional commitment to the doctrines of the past and those with ambitions not likely to be served by a moribund party Five months before election day for example firstterm Senator Paul E Tsongas of Massachusetts startled Americans for Democratic Action with a call for a new liberalism that he thought might include tax credits to business to get the economy going After the campaign Senator Tsongas who had not been up for reelection explained that he believed the Democrats and liberals generally had been living off a New Deal tradition of priming the pump that ran counter to the realities of the 1970s and 1980s when economic growth had noticeably slowed New Dealism conflicted with these new realities the Senator suggested because if you have an expanding economic pie there is room for generosity There is room for if you will liberalism If you have an economic pie that has stopped growing you have a very different emotional climate on your hands Mr Mondale  a likely Presidential contender in 1984  agrees I think the people felt we were getting a little stale he said in a postelection interview with Terence Smith of The New York Times One of the reasons we lost Im convinced is that the economy has ceased to grow to produce new wealth and add new jobs without also reigniting inflation  The pie is not growing maybe shrinking and were fighting over the division of existing resources That the middle class has retreated from liberalism because of a dwindling economic pie is an idea widespread among Democrats Stuart E Eizenstat President Carters special assistant for domestic policy said after Mr Carters defeat The taxpayers of America  the great American middle class  are frustrated at persistent high inflation and its corrosive impact and at heavy pockets of unemployment in basic industries that are losing their competitive edge Many believe the Democratic party lost touch with their concerns Senator Gary Harts ability to overcome a popular opponent and the Reagan tide in conservative Colorado marked him as another probable Presidential contender in 1984 Even before that victory he had called for a new Democratic coalition of middleincome people concerned about economic stability and national security workers who hope for better opportunities for their children the elderly the unemployed minorities and the young Mr Hart believes that by 1980 the Democrats had come to depend too much on creating new agencies that sent people checks he thinks his party needs instead to look for market mechanisms nonbureaucratic nonprogrammatic methods for achieving the same ends One of his favorite examples is lifeline utility rates  avoiding Federal energy subsidies to the disadvantaged by requiring state regulators to give say the elderly an electricity rate as low as any big industrial consumer can command No Federal agency no bureaucratic jobs no taxpayers money he points out but aid to the elderly all the same Senator Hart also proposes innovations such as using state surpluses and publicemployee pension funds to help rebuild cities To carry out the Democrats commitment to their black supporters he would rely less on civil rights and Federal employment programs than on providing tax incentives for minority job training in the private sector and for minority employment in new energy and urban projects Whether such an untraditional approach would be welcomed by the black community is an open question Senator Hart a member of the Armed Services Committee insists Democrats must also reclaim a reputation for concern with national defense  a point some Democrats have been stressing for years Unlike many of them the Colorado Senator emphasizes concentration on improving the fighting qualities and combat readiness of existing forces rather than on costly new weapons systems like the MX mobile missile As far back as 1978 another new Democratic face Senator Carl Levin of Michigan warned that his party had slipped into thinking that its traditional attitudes and programs were more important than the revitalization of society Now he argues that what we must do is learn again that a free people are to be trusted and that Government need not tell them in endless detail how they are to behave in order to achieve common goals Some of his specific recommendations include more sunset legislation to shut down ineffective or unnecessary programs and fewer permanently authorized programs greater regulatory flexibility a reduction of the number of rules governing Federal grants and of the needless endless forms that so bedevil our people Numerous other ideas are readily available although not always widely accepted For example Representative James R Jones of Oklahoma the new chairman of the House Budget Committee advocates spendinglimit legislation that would hold the Federal budget to 20 percent of the gross national product except when the majority of Congress votes to breach that ceiling In recent years Federal budgets have tended to run somewhere between 21 and 23 percent of the GNP Mr Jones argues that such a limit would help counter a popular but probably unworkable constitutional amendment  which Republicans in the new Senate may sponsor  forcing a balanced budget that it would make Congress assume greater control of the permanently authorized uncontrollables programs which now absorb about 75 percent of the Federal budget and that it might also help the Democrats shake the big spender label that has haunted them in every recent election and contributed heavily to the 1980 defeat If a shrinking or nongrowing economic pie has turned the public sour on liberalism then a party that wants to remain liberal should logically develop plausible approaches to achieving stable economic growth at a low rate of inflation Mr Eizenstat among others favors supporting TIP  the acronym for a taxbased incomes policy by which the Government would grant tax credits to members of unions that hold down wages and to companies that limit price increases This would provide more direct restraint short of Government controls than the guidelines that proved ineffective for the Carter Administration The Democrats also need ideas for rebuilding American industrial and trade competitiveness Welfare reform and relief from mounting Social Security payroll taxes ought also to be peculiarly their concerns since the basic programs are Democratic in origin Whats to be done moreover about a situation in which by 1990 the oilproducing regions of the country are likely to rake in about 120 billion in added revenues  the result of decontrolled oil and gas prices  that in effect will be paid by the already hardpressed consuming regions of the Northeast and Middle West This new kind of sectional conflict discussed in the 1980 campaign only by John Anderson the independent candidate sooner or later will have to concern the Democrats most particularly their electoral hopes are concentrated heavily in the consuming regions while the Republicans seem to have taken tight hold on the Sun Belt including its oilproducing states Foreignpolicy issues too demand Democratic selfexamination Will they tamely go along with a Republican return to something like coldwar policies Or will they find ways to advocate a relaxation of tensions in SovietAmerican relations and nuclear arms control without opening themselves to the charge of being soft on national defense What about the Carter Administrations humanrights policy which  for all its flaws  improved the American position in the third world notably in Africa and to some extent in Latin America These difficult foreignpolicy issues have the highest potential for creating bitter divisions among Democrats Since the McGovern Presidential campaign of 1972 the party has been more or less split along hawkdove lines with a faction led by Senator Henry M Jackson of Washington advocating a tougher stance against the Russians and some thirdworld nations To prevent President Reagan and the Republicans from preempting the hard line Jackson Democrats might become even more insistent on their approach And they may well have a Presidential candidate  possibly Senator Moynihan  in 1984 Sorting out all these issues and arriving at new and appealing positions would not be easy even as an academic exercise It will be a lot harder in an amorphous political party without a recognized leader with a party structure that has to be overhauled and with the effort probably divided between members of Congress and other party elements  all under the pressure of competing with a new Republican Administration headed by a President who has shown himself to be perhaps the most effective political communicator at least since John F Kennedy Besides not every Democrat  in office or out  necessarily agrees that the party needs an intellectual rebirth or would accept such a controversial theme as Gary Harts support for increased worker participation in the ownership of production facilities Old habits and attitudes die hard Inevitably too the remaking of the party will be affected by the expected 1984 Presidential contest between Mr Mondale and the leader of the traditional liberals Senator Edward M Kennedy  not to mention the maneuverings of perhaps a half dozen or more other candidates in 1984 On the other hand as Fritz Mondale concluded a month after the election One of the virtues of losing is that it gives you time to think again to renew and refresh yourself  We especially those of us who might be thinking about running for President have a priceless opportunity now a chance to use this time to really focus on  the central questions  Some of the current Democratic agitation is no doubt overwrought It seems clear that the state of the economy  high inflation and unemployment  was the single most important cause of their 1980 defeat And while Democrats and the Carter Administration of course bear a sizable share of responsibility for that many of its causes were not in their control OPEC for one thing  and scarcely call for party overhaul President Reagans Electoral College landslide moreover as well as the startling turnover in the Senate have created the impression that the Republican victory was a greater upheaval than in fact it was Closer analysis of the 1980 voting discloses for example President Reagan polled just under 27 percent of the votingage population  less actually than the 272 percent Jimmy Carter won in 1976 Even the Republican candidates share of those actually voting 5075 percent was 10 points less than Richard Nixons 1972 percentage Much of the responsibility for the Democratic debacle must be borne by Jimmy Carter on whom the electorate delivered a resounding vote of no confidence his share of votingage citizens declined from that 272 percent in 1976 to less than 22 in 1980 In contrast although the Democrats lost control of the Senate they actually won 518 percent of the popular vote in all Senate races against 469 percent for the Republicans Similarly in the total popular vote for the House Democrats ran a virtual dead heat 4915 percent to 4948 for the Republicans and in gubernatorial races the popular vote in all states was even closer 4983 percent for the Democrats to 4997 for the Republicans Even after 1980 Democrats hold the governorships of 27 states both houses of the legislature in 28 states and one house in five more Those figures suggest a closely divided country not one under strong Republican dominance And a few Democratic candidates scored notable victories  Senator Alan Cranston with a margin of better than 16 million in Ronald Reagans home state Senator John Glenn with a similar landslide in conservative Ohio Representative Morris K Udall of Arizona whose winning percentage rose six points over 1978 and Senator Hart Liberaltomoderate Democrats and Republicans will be able occasionally to field a working majority in the Senate Even the pattern of recent Presidential elections offers some comfort to the Democrats it shows that landslides arent necessarily a death knell for the losers Richard Nixon won the Presidency just four years after Lyndon Johnsons 45state victory in 1964 Jimmy Carter was elected only four years after Mr Nixons own landslide 6069 percent of the popular vote in 1972 In that light Mr Reagans 51 percent and 44 states dont look quite so ominous for the Democrats Perhaps more important its now the Republicans who have the responsibility hence the necessity to succeed LBJs landslide slipped away in the quagmire of Vietnam Mr Nixons in the dark places of Watergate President Reagan need encounter calamities of no such magnitude to see his mandate go the same way perhaps even more quickly As Bill Brock put it the day after the election The cementing of the new Republican coalition depends on our performance in office Weve got to act with some urgency to deal with the problems on which people voted unemployment and inflation Senator Hart put a sharp partisan edge on the same point I give the Reagan Administration about 18 to 24 months to prove it doesnt have any answers either And Senator Tsongas has pointed out with an air of expectation that for years the Republicans have had the advantage of espousing what I would consider simplistic notions  The trouble with those ideas is that you may someday find yourself God forbid in power Not only will President Reagan be expected to fulfill his promises he also could find himself in messy political trouble if powerful leaders of the new conservative Senate  his Senate precipitate a series of fights that the new President does not need Theyre already talking about a constitutional amendment to ban abortions A bill to prevent Federal courts from blocking prayer in the schools is on the front burner so is a voucher plan to help parents pay private school tuition as an alternative to public schools Chairman J Strom Thurmond of the Senate Judiciary Committee is talking of restoring the death penalty to Federal criminal law as well as repealing the landmark Voting Rights Act The merit if any of these conservative proposals may be debated but each is bound to embroil President Reagan in a struggle either with his own right wing or with the more moderate elements of his winning coalition Either way his political capital could be rapidly expended A laundry list of established social programs in any case will come before the 97th Congress for renewal or elimination  clean air and water legislation for example Head Start a variety of regulatory provisions and those food stamps that failed to carry South Dakota for George McGovern but whose elimination might not please those two women in the supermarket The possibility is not remote therefore that without their rethinking anything the Democrats without a Carter Presidency to drag them down could look considerably better to the voters even by 1982 than they did in 1980 Remembering what happened after 1964 and 1972 that acerbic sage of American politics Richard M Scammon of the Elections Research Center has cautioned Democrats not to leap too rapidly into controversial party reform or a coordinated Europeanstyle 18point program because theres no guarantee the normal operations of politics wont bring you back into power more quickly than anything else Nevertheless it would be a mistake for the Democrats to conclude that theyre still in reasonably good shape and need only show up for the next election To cite only the most obvious reason the Reagan landslide was different from all others since 1932 in 1980 as then the voters turned out the incumbents while in the landslides of 1936 1956 1964 and 1972 the voters confirmed the party in office Even if only symbolically therefore the Republicans 1980 victory is too similar for comfort to the one that began the last long era of one partys supremacy In 1980 moreover voters were continuing a trend that was visible in 1976 During that period the Republicans picked up 15 Senate and 49 House seats 11 governorships and 578 state legislative seats a handsome harvest indeed That suggests the possibility that President Nixons Watergate misfortunes and the Souths support for one of its own in 1976 merely interrupted a period of Republican resurgence If so relying on President Reagan to crash and burn as Nixon did wont necessarily reverse this underlying longterm trend Perhaps more alarming were the defections in 1980 of so many elements of the postRoosevelt Democratic coalition  particularly the oncesolid South Moving toward Republicanism for many years before 10 of the 11 Confederate states supported Mr Carter in 1976 the South swung around in 1980 to give 10 of the same states to President Reagan All told the Republicans gained four Senate and nine House seats in the South last year and grabbed the governorship of Arkansas too The region now seems more nearly a Republican than a Democratic stronghold and will increase its Congressional and Electoral College strength after the Congressional reapportionment based on the 1980 census If confirmed this shift could be fatal to the Democrats national ambitions for years to come Given the now longestablished Republican dominance of the Western states  many of which will also gain strength as a result of reapportionment  a consistently Republican South would tend to make the Democrats basically a regional party based in the Northeast and Middle West Other Democratic defections included Jewish voters who moved in substantial numbers to the Republicans so did bluecollar workers particularly white nonunion members Blacks held fast for the Democrats but did not turn out heavily Liberals never enthusiastic about Jimmy Carter gave considerable support to John Anderson Over all the decline in Democrats voting Democratic  who instead voted Republican or for Mr Anderson or stayed home  defeated Mr Carter and the reverse coattail effect dragged many another Democrat down too A final fact for Democrats to ponder is that total voter turnout in 1980 sank again to only 5395 percent of the eligible electorate Taken together moreover Mr Carter and Mr Reagan the major party nominees won less than half of those eligible to vote That means that more than half the electorate is out there waiting to be seduced into voting for one party or the other or perhaps if they continue to default a new one Declining turnout also seems to mean that only an evershrinking pool of Americans cares enough about what either party is offering  in terms of either programs or personalities  to support one of them Republican failure will not change this grim fact for the Democrats But by revitalizing their party and their message Democrats might enable themselves to compete again not just with the Republicans but for that turnedoff half of the electorate In so doing they might also reverse the long decline of American politics  the period of frustration and futility which since the mid1960s has seen neither party able to govern effectively or to perpetuate power once it was won while more and more Americans have turned against politics and government apparently convinced of their ineffectuality
Westchester Journal,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/nyregion/westchester-journal-237909.html,FIFTH graders at the R J Bailey School in Greenburgh are comparing life along the Hudson with life along the Ganges River in India through an exchange of essays paintings poetry and maps made by students along with newspapers and various cultural artifacts In December the Westchester class received a box of items from the Campus School in Kanpur India They have have been put on display in the school lobby and will remain there through midFebruary they may be seen from 8 AM to 2 PM Among the items was a newspaper in Hindi reporting the election of Ronald Reagan maps made by the children of the Ganges as it flows through their town a bell a shoe a tape recording of Indian poetry autobiographies of the Indian children and 100 stamps in small denominations In return the 25 Westchester children sent their own autobiographies and pictures a recording of the class singing and a book written in honor of the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr written by a fifthgrade class at the school in 1968 the year Dr King was assassinated The next package will contain essays on the Hudson River and enough stamps  14 worth  to be divided among the 19 Indian children The works of the Greenburgh students will be assembled for an exhibition on the Hudson at the Campus School in the spring Jan Rubinowitz an art teacher at the Bailey School said that the connection with an Indian river town was partly a coincidence She is a member of the executive board of the United States Society for Education through Art and arranged for a school contact through an Indian she met at a school conference Richard Marks a fifthgrade teacher agreed to have his class work on the project When they studied the map they discovered that Kanpur was also a river town The Westchester youngsters are now doing research on the Hudson to gather materials to send to India They visited the Clearwater the restored Hudson River sloop in October and drew pictures of it along with the docks and the river In December they visited the South Street Seaport Museum and they are now planning an exchange of tapings of folk music and are studying the bridges tunnels pollution problems and communtities along the river A proposed merger between the Westchester Regional Theater of Harrison and the Main Street Theater of White Plains the countys two Actors Equity troupes has been called off the boards of the two companies have announced Stephen Rosenfield artistic director of Main Street said the two groups had decided not to continue their negotiations because they would of necessity be protracted and they considered a delay unfair to their subscribers Mr Rosenfield whose theater uses free facilities in the Galleria shopping mall in White Plains said that seats had been made available for the 3100 Westchester Regional subscribers to Main Street productions of A Moon for the Misbegotten which opens Feb 18 and Candida which begins April 22 There was no immediate comment from Westchester Regional which stopped productions at the Emelin Theater in Mamaroneck this month because of lack of funds The Westchester County Historical Society has formed a Multicultural History Center whose purpose is to collect and document present and past contributions made by the countys ethnic groups and organizations The center will be situated in the historical societys headquarters at 43 Read Avenue in Tuckahoe and its 15 fee will include membership in the society as well as an oral history course on the county The oral history course will be taught by Ruth Dennis of the County Executives staff who holds a certificate in oral history from Fordham University Sessions are Mondays from 8 to 10 PM at society headquarters and will be held through March 2 Both the center and the course are part of planned celebrations for the countys tricentennial of 1983 The Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion now has its own office at 149 Grand Street in White Plains according to Polly Rothstein the groups director Its a big step forward for us she said The old office which was shared with other agencies was at 255 Grove Street Mrs Rothstein said the office had been opened to mark the eighth anniversary last week of the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion It is open Mondays through Thursdays from 930 AM to 430 PM The phone number is 9465363 The coalition a privately financed organization has about 9000 families on its mailing list Mrs Rothstein said She is seeking to double that number this year as part of an effort to counteract an expected drive by antiabortion forces to cut off Medicaid funds for abortions by New York State and to restrict minors access to abortion The major work will be in Albany she said A cutoff of Medicaid funds in New York Mrs Rothstein said probably would trigger others to cut it off New York is one of nine states and the District of Columbia providing such funds In Westchester County she said a program of socalled house meetings has been under way since last April The sessions started by the National Abortion Rights League involve inviting prochoice people to house meetings to learn about the threats to legal abortion and become activists to take some concrete action in support of abortion rights For 1981 she said we are stepping it up and moving upcounty Three such meetings in Briarcliff Mount Kisco and Peekskill are scheduled for next month As the wait for a final word on the resolution of the Iranian hostage crisis stretched from a matter of minutes to hours and then finally to days the 52 Americans held by Iran for more than 14 months were very much on the minds of those at the Jewish Community Center of White Plains Rabbi Maurice Davis the senior rabbi at the center said that the Friday night service began with a moment of silence for the hostages At the Saturday morning service Rabbi Davis spoke of the hostages to a boy who was being bar mitzvahed The passage he was reading had to do with being summoned to aid others the rabbi said about Moses going down to release the slaves from Egypt The rabbi said he had told the boy that the weekend in which he read how you are called on to help others became the weekend that the hostages release became imminent Last Sunday when Iran announced that an agreement had been reached the rabbi said he had noted in the centers religious school that it was the 18th day of the month of January and that in Hebrew the letters for the number 18  CH and Y  also mean life The days lesson he said was dedicated to the lifesaving of the hostages Eighteen will always be the day in which it happened he said After 22 years of greeting new arrivals in Westchester and Putnam Counties for

Washington In 1970 she was elected an assistant vice president of the company and most recently has been its field representative in Westchester and Putnam Counties She estimated that company representatives visited between a million and 15 million families around the country a year about 10000 of them in Westchester where the company has been for 49 of its 53 years Families she observed are not what they used to be Families as a whole are a great deal smaller than they used to be she said A great many visits are made on single people and childless couples and even families that have children have many fewer Another factor is that women work she added The number of women not involved in jobs parttime or fulltime is negligible And the women going back to work after having children are getting younger and younger Fifteen years ago Mrs Elbert said the women who were ready to start working waited till kids were in school all day Today thats not true They go back when the children are extremely young sometimes before they go to nursery school Because so many women are away from home during the day Mrs Elbert said Welcome Wagon representatives make many more nighttime and weekend visits to those who have recently moved or become parents than they used to The 75 to 100 representatives in Westchester try to visit anyone who has moved  single married divorced or all points between  those who purchase or rent their homes whether those homes are singlefamily houses or apartments They bring a basket bearing information about the community as well as gifts and invitations from local businessmen The service is paid for by business people who use Welcome Wagon as a method of advertising Noting that the majority of Welcome Wagon representatives are women who are seeking reentry into the work world Mrs Elbert said that her plans included further graduate study and research in midlife career change and preretirement planning
REPUBLICANS PLAN A WIDER CONTEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/weekinreview/republicans-plan-a-wider-contest.html,The inauguration of the 15th Republican President may have been a moment of more than ordinary historic note It may have been a significant marker on the road to a classic political realignment With the Presidency the Senate for the first time in a quarter century a narrower deficit than usual in the House gains in state capitals and a strong political apparatus the Republicans are in a position to exploit conservative strains in the national mood They may well manage to convert themselves from a minority party that sometimes wins big as they did in 1980 into a majority party The single best reason for Republicans to take that hope seriously  and for Democrats to fear it  is that this time they are not taking it for granted as they seemed to in 1953 and 1969 At the Republican National Committee meeting on Jan17 party leaders talked as if they know that a majority is not locked in on automatic pilot The new national chairman Richard Richards emphasized that we have a long way to go a theme in which his predecessor Bill Brock and Vice President Bush also joined Emphasizing Nuts and Bolts The evidence that this is more than talk is still fragmentary in such tokens as the choice of Mr Richards a longtime Reagan backer with a reputation as a highly skilled nutsandbolts organizer in his days as Utah Republican state chairman and in the willingness of conservative senators to eschew vendettas against moderate colleagues and let them succeed to offices such as majority leader and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee But the Republicans do appear to understand that realignment takes time and that the Democratic coalition was built over three elections those of 1928 1932 and 1936 They seem aware that when President Reagan took his oath even after his November landslide only 46 percent of elected Federal officials were Republicans In the state capitals the figure is only 39 percent In the public at large according to the latest Gallup Polls the percentage has increased but only to 26 percent The last two times Republicans turned the Democrats out of the White House in 1953 and 1969 the percentages in the state capitals and among the public higher There are several likely hunting grounds The South is identified by Richard Scammon the election analyst as one of the most promising He sees opportunities for the Republicans to replace conservative House Democrats with their own as they have already done in the Senate But he also points to bluecollar workers especially Catholics as a constituency to be nurtured Focusing on the Economy Robert M Teeter president of Detroits Market Opinion Research argues that realignment comes when previous nonvoters are attracted into the system as happened in 1936 and sees the necessary ingredients as the partys avoiding going back and picking up the negative that its the party of the rich and keeping a heavy focus on the problems of the economy Dont get yourselves bogged down in a lot of social issues he warned That argument of the partys need to concentrate on the economy and not indulge in issues such as abortion and busing comes repeatedly from key advisers like Richard B Wirthlin He argues that the main thrust behind the Reagan triumph was not merely unhappiness with the economy but the expectation that Mr Reagan could fix it And Mr Brock contended that taking the focus off the economy is the temptation that must be avoided and will be avoided But that is not the way everyone sees it Richard Viguerie the New Rights direct mail leader sneers at that argument as one that comes from establishment Republicans who really dont like the social issues If unemployment was zero they still wouldnt want to talk about school prayer He and an ideological fellow traveler Paul Weyrich of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress argue that social issues and the efforts of groups like the Moral Majority played a critical role if not in the Presidential race in enough Senate races to make the difference between a 53to47 majority and a close minority Mr Weyrich also argued that while ignoring the economy would be foolish it would be equally mistaken to forget the social issues New voters drawn to the party by those concerns would see it through if economic recovery took a long time he said while newfound exDemocratic friends might desert This inevitable dispute along with conservative attacks on some Administration appointees such as Terrell Bell for the Department of Education or Lawrence Eagleburger for Assistant Secretary of State underlines a warning from one Republican state chairman David F Norcross of New Jersey Unless Republicans can learn to live together with ourselves he contends their opportunities may be squandered Mr Brock and the taste of victory kept intraparty backbiting to a minimum in 1979 and 1980 But now that there are spoils to fight over the temptation may prove irresistible One approach about which there seems to be little quarrel is the emphasis on technical help fundraising polling and the like from national headquarters This includes the Senate and House campaign committees It also means focusing on such unRepublican areas as cities and their black voters Melvin T Larsen the Michigan state chairman put it simply These suburbanrural victories are tremendous but to build a majority were going to have to hold our own in the cities That isnt happening yet and the organizational approach isnt all there is to it although when Mr Larsen talks of planting hickory trees to attract squirrels his huntingvoting metaphor acknowledges a tree that takes 20 years to bear fruit In the short run even Mr Weyrich concedes that the economy matters a lot to GOP hopes for 1982 and 1984 There are indeed wide differences about how much real economic progress is needed and how much sense of movement will do instead But Mr Reagan gave what Mr Wirthlin concedes was a significant hostage to fortune in his debate with Mr Carter In 1984 if not before politicians will be saying as Mr Reagan did on Oct28 Ask yourself Are you better off than you were four years ago If Republicans must leave it to Democrats to ask that question their chance for realignment may be lost
WHAT BECAME OF CHILDHOOD INNOCENCE?,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/magazine/what-became-of-childhood-innocence.html,Once upon a time in the Golden Age of Innocence an imaginary 12yearold girl from New England named Lolita slept with a middleaged European intellectual named Humbert Humbert and shocked American sensibilities the daily reviewer of The New York Times called Vladimir Nabokovs novel repulsive and disgusting Twentyfive years after Lolitas publication as Edward Albees dramatic adaptation prepares to open on Broadway Nabokovs vision of American childhood seems nothing if not prescient The public of 1956 was outraged not only by the thought of early sex but also by the image of a child so knowing jaded and unchildlike How much more familiar Lolita is today There is no doubt that 9 10 11 and 12yearolds of the 1980s have more in common with Lolita at least in what they know than with those guileless and innocent creatures in their shiny Mary Janes and pigtails their scraped knees and trusting ways that were called children not so long ago But if parents are no longer surprised many are still distressed and genuinely confused about whether their children are being inevitably cheated out of childhood or whether some good may come from this early worldliness What happened to blur the boundaries between childhood and adulthood What became of childhood innocence Without a doubt the upheavals of the 1960s  from divorce and the breakdown of the family to womens liberation and increased employment  weakened the protective membrane that once sheltered children from precocious experience and knowledge of the adult world The aging babies of the postWorld War II baby boom gave children greater power in their greater numbers Above all television virtually uncontrolled in all but a minority of homes has caused children to gorge on the fruit of knowledge not only about sex but also about the complexities of life in general  Vietnam Watergate the energy crisis famine As adult culture sloughs off layer after layer of vestigial Victorianism  in books in rock music in all aspects of daily life children are absorbing new information and that touching trust once synonymous with childhood fades into premature skepticism and uncertainty Preteenagers were singing Were off to see the Wizard not so long ago today their childish voices pipe the Beatles Why dont we do it in the road I watched this special on TV called Gay Power  a seventh grader relates and they showed all this stuff about sadism and how one homosexual takes another as a slave The scary thing was that it was real not actors dressing up And then in school when some girls had a sleepover everybody called them lesbians It just makes us all nervous about being touched and some kids are worried that they might turn out to be homosexual I debrief with the kids when I get home from work the way I used to with my husband while we were still talking a divorced New York mother says I guess I tell them more than I ought to about my worries but they might as well find out sooner or later that life can be complicated and unfair and infuriating I know sex isnt shameful explains a 12yearold with dignity But when my friend Louise and I looked at this magazine Hustler that her brother had You cant imagine how perverted it was At least Playboy has a touch of class Hustler was even worse than Wifey by Judy Blume which was only about sex sex sex A single parent of two preteenagers reports Once when I was out late the kids stayed up and watched Midnight Blue a sexually explicit latenight show on cable television The next day they made a big point of describing to me everything they saw on the show The thought of me telling my mother about some product used to masturbate with  my mother would have died Well I told the kids For Gods sake dont watch that awful program anymore and my older one said If youre going to stay out so late were going to watch whatever we want  When we were 12 it was very exciting to smoke marijuana a highschool junior reminisces Now the thrill is entirely gone It would be considered childish to make a big deal about smoking dope nowadays Something has changed in the general timetable of childhood and the accompanying parental anxiety is almost palpable As Joseph Heller wrote in Something Happened More and more of us dont really care what happens to our children  as long as it doesnt happen too soon The change has occurred so rapidly that it is hard to attribute it to a trend toward earlier physiological maturation Though puberty sets in at least three years earlier today than it did in the mid19th century a result most experts believe of improved nutrition the shift has been gradual a decrease of one year every quartercentury Yet even 20 years ago our idea of childhood was probably closer to that of our greatgrandparents than to the prevailing concept today Evidence of a societywide change of attitude is everywhere On television commercials 10yearolds undulate to disco music and the teenage actress Brooke Shields recites sexual doubleentendres What comes between me and my Calvins Nothing A sales pitch for a competing brand of jeans features a young girl mounted in a sexually suggestive posture on an applecheeked boys back A fullpage advertisement in a showbusiness trade newspaper flaunts a sultry female wearing dark lipstick much eye shadow and possibly nothing else It bears the legend Would you believe Im only 10 We believe it Beyond the extravagances of show business looms a population of normal children once clearly distinguishable as little boys and girls who now look and act like little grownups Lolita arrived in 1956 with a shocking impact precisely because she was only 12 and still in need of special protection It is ironic that today as we face a new era when innocence seems an atavistic relic the playwright Edward Albee has cast a 24yearold Blanche Baker as Lolita Though he auditioned hundreds of children and teenagers in cities throughout America Albee explains I was appalled by the kids I saw auditioning for the part I could see they were being pushed by their ambitious parents And I was worried about the psychic damage playing such a role might cause to a child And yet a 13yearold who did audition seemed hardly a vulnerable innocent when she said I wouldnt mind the sex scenes The books about this young girl who has this thing for an older man  but Im not sure whether its the girl who seduces the man or the other way around Nabokov did not invent childhood sophistication As the historian Philippe Aries has pointed out in his influential study Centuries of Childhood the very notion of innocent childhood as a separate phase of life did not exist until well after the end of the Middle Ages During the 13th 14th or 15th centuries in fact there were no special clothes or books or games for children and by the ages of 7 or 8 once children ceased to function as cognitive aliens in Jean Piagets terminology and acquired some of the mental patterns that characterize adult thinking children of all classes were incorporated completely into the adult world  to work and play alongside adults without special protection While it is hard to conceive of todays 8yearolds marching off to their offices with their little attache cases in hand childrens integration into adult work in the past becomes understandable when one remembers that the work in those preindustrial days often consisted of those very arts and crafts offered today by Childcraft or Creative Playthings for childrens amusement spinning weaving pottery basket making The pastimes that filled adult leisure in the medieval era were similarly suited for sharing with children Tag and blindmans buff were once played outdoors by adults as well as children indoors adults sang songs and told stories like the tales collected by the brothers Grimm Adults were undoubtedly more childlike in the simpler society of the past As we learn in Emmanuel LeRoy Laduries study of 14thcentury life Montaillou adults then possessed far simpler concepts of time space and history than they do today and seemed to function on a less complicated emotional level characterized by a greater readiness to laugh and weep At the same time children in this closeknit world were less childlike When everyone slept in one room it was impossible to hide adult sexuality There was still another cause for the close coexistence of young and old Adult instincts then were subjected to considerably less control If civilization is said to reside in manners and in the public repression of instinctive drives then there was simply much less of both in the Western society of the 13th to 15th centuries when people customarily ate with their fingers wiped their noses on their sleeves urinated in public and in general behaved the way children would naturally behave if they were not taught better After the Middle Ages and well into the Renaissance one of the most radical transformations of human relations occurred though it was largely confined to the middle class The Age of Innocence began with the thinking of Locke in the 17th century and found its major inspiration in the writings of Rousseau in the 18th After centuries of indifference to children and their special needs now adults began to take an intense interest in childrens physical and psychological wellbeing More sentimental relations and greater intimacy within the family resulted Those very aspects of childhood that had once carried a negative value  innocence trust dependence guilelessness ignorance of adult sexuality  became appealing Informed by an idealized view of childhood that inspired the Romantic poets in the l9th century the era reached its apotheosis in the virtual child worship of the Victorian period A more complex and newly industrialized society kept middleclass children out of the work force and required them to develop new skills and disciplines Children of the poor however were often cruelly exploited in that golden age Now as children began to spend greater parts of their time in schools isolated from the adult world their behavior inevitably began to reflect more truly their developmental stages  to seem more childlike It was Freud who rang the death knell for that childlike child His ideas on child sexuality filtered down to all levels of society the child was revealed and gradually understood as a creature of seething passions and sexual desires not so very different from those of adults Today with children involved at earlier and earlier ages in activities once reserved for adults  sex drugs drinking and even suicide  we see other curious parallels between our own time and the distant past Those more civilized manners that developed over the centuries creating a new distance between adults and children took only a few decades to loosen Now we learn from our therapists to feel more ashamed of our repressions than of letting it all hang out No longer do parents have dinner by candlelight while the kids eat in the kitchen Now the whole family can eat with their fingers at the Kentucky Fried place down the street Now once again young and old are united in a single great leisuretime activity watching television Once upon a time children read books about fairies and animals about other children en gaged in the innocent pleasures of childhood Today children read about different subjects A beautiful girl of 14 lives in a small town where her father is a barber and her mother a humble laundress The girl dreams of romance and fame but is obliged to spend her days in drudgery cleaning houses and babysitting At last she decides to run away from home and seek her fortune in the big city So far the story resembles the familiar tales of the past But it continues On her first day in the big city she meets a handsome man who befriends her when she is lost She falls in love with him Alas he turns out to be a pimp He compels her to become one of his prostitutes At first she is appalled She cannot believe that she has to do it with all sorts of strange men Soon out of love for her protector she becomes one of his most successful hookers which arouses the jealousy of her colleagues One of the other girls puts LSD into our heroines soft drink and she has a bad trip Finally after many adventures she finds her way into a rehabilitation center for runaway children There she gets therapy and prepares to return to her smalltown home  sadder but wiser Books such as this one Steffie Cant Come Out To Play written by Fran Arrick and published in 1978 by Bradbury Press are widely distributed and read by 10 11 12yearolds This new genre deals with subjects heretofore considered unsuitable for children George A Woods childrens book editor of The New York Times describes with amazement recent submissions for review Its not just sex that defines the change Ive got books coming in on children with harelips epilepsy and insanity as well as the usual alcoholic parents drugaddicted children child beaters divorce acne and death It is generally acknowledged that Ursula Nordstrom editor in chief of Harper  Row Junior Books from 1941 to 1973 was the primary force behind many innovations of the last 25 years The first departure came in the 1960s when she published an excellent book called Stevie by John Steptoe which strayed from the nice middleclass white patterns that had long monopolized childrens books by telling in nonstandard speech patterns of the life of a black ghetto child But the first real breakthrough as these books came to be called in the trade was a small volume for young children by John Donovan published by Harper  Row in 1969 called Ill Get There It Better Be Worth the Trip a story about a boy his friend and his dog The uproar occasioned by this book centered on a brief scene in which two 13yearold boys who are having a sleepover at one of their houses are suddenly drawn to each other and find to their surprise that they are kissing A homosexual episode in a childrens book though so subtly presented that many readers overlooked it represents far more than increased openness Donovans book and Steptoes before it were signs that a decision had been made by important cultural forces to end a period of vestigial Victorianism In the years to come books were to serve a new function In addition to entertaining or teaching about the past they would also prepare young children for future complexities in an increasingly troubled society Charlotte Zolotow who took over at Harper Junior Books three years after Ursula Nordstrom left and who is herself an author in the new style Williams Doll caused a stir in 1972 by telling of a little boy who wanted to play with a doll continued to publish increasingly daring and controversial books We cant protect our children anymore from all we would like to spare them she says We cant protect them from the war and violent death they see on television every night  All we can do is to help children see it all to form their own judgments and defenses and to be honest in the books we write for them about alcohol or drugs or immorality Even those editors who first resisted the change finally came into line There is no clearer indication that the new direction in childrens publishing is not a fad than the fact that not a single one of the major childrens book publishers has continued to limit its lists to noncontroversial material Ann Durell publisher of childrens books at EPDutton once thought that childrens books would always remain the same When I started in publishing in 1952 books were exactly like those I had grown up with and practically interchangeable with books published in 1900 Then in the 60s everything suddenly changed Everything was a cause  women blacks everyone was part of a crusade for freedom I think children became part of that Children were no longer considered a race apart  innocent and protected and terribly English in a curious way Until then all the manners behavior and language of children in childrens books were very Nannyinthe Nursery sort of English The trouble is that many adults today still think If only my children could be so happy  The popularity among children of books by Judy Blume Norma Klein Paul Zindel and others attests to the receptivity of many children to books dealing with mature subjects Yet as John Donovan currently head of the Childrens Book Council points out Judy Blume is hard for many adults to handle because she has accepted the diminishing time of childhood A lot of things happen to kids at a much earlier time these days than in the last generation A scholar studying trends in childrens literature might observe that it is not exactly a new departure to tell children stories about death and disaster rape and prostitution For while childrens books of the last two centuries may have dwelt on Lambs Frolicking and Our Friend the Policeman publications for children in early Colonial days did not shelter young readers from the realities of life A popular 17thcentury childrens book Youths Divine Pastime included a poem about Sodom and Gomorrah that did not mince words Yet when his daughters tempted him To drink wine to excess He fell into that odious vice And crime of drunkenness Which caused him likewise to commit That great and heinous sin Of incest with his daughters who Were both with child by him A woodcut illustrating this verse depicts Lot reclining lecherously on a couch while his naked daughters ply him with wine Today three centuries later grim reality has returned to childrens books Once upon a time in the Age of Innocence children really believed that all adults were good that all Presidents were as honest as Abe Lincoln that the adult world was in every way bigger and better than their own world one which children knew well was full of savagery and danger Children were expected to give up their seats in public conveyances to adults to reserve strong language for the company of their peers and in every way to treat adults with respect No single cultural force of the past 25 years better illustrates the changes that have occurred since those old days than Mad Magazine Mad began as an offshoot of comic books But while the comics of earlier years ran the gamut from cute Disney to the gruesomely violent Tales from the Crypt that aroused parental ire and even Congressional investigations they all nevertheless fell into the category of fantasy long an accepted adjunct of childhood Mad was the first satirical magazine for children a sort of an easytoread Junior Swift the first to deal with childrens reality their parents schools and the general adult culture around them  in a mocking way As Al Feldstein editor of Mad for the past 25 years says What we did was to take the absurdities of the adult world that youngsters were facing and show kids that the adult world is not omnipotent that their parents were telling the kids to be honest not to lie and yet they were cheating on their income tax We told them theres a lot of garbage out in the world and youve got to be aware of it Everything you read in the papers is not necessarily true What you see on television is mostly lies Youre going to have to learn to think for yourself While the early issues of Mad chose childcentered material to satirize the focus turned in the 1960s to more and more difficult concerns  adult hypocrisy sexuality womens liberation divorce the drug and alcohol scene One feature entitled If Babies Could Take Parent Pictures contained illustrations with this caption Heres my idiot father trying to drive and take pictures at the same time I was lucky to get home alive The phrase my idiot father does not have a jarring sound in 1981 children today are cheerfully irreverent toward their elders But the words were shocking then coming from a child A convention was coming to an end  one that compelled children to repress their natural Freud would say Oedipal hostilities forced them to mutter under their breaths perhaps but rarely to be openly abusive Mad Magazine was clearly influential in the move toward free expression among children its relentless exposure of parental hypocricies during the 1960s caused shock waves of admiration and reaction among its young readers who were not unaware of their older siblings angry accusations of hypocrisy against The Great Societys war in Vietnam By 1974 the cultural climate would allow A Mad History of Sex In 1975 there appeared the Broken Homes and Gardens Magazine parody 1976 saw Unweddings of the Future with invitations issued by the parents of the soontobeexbride Mom and I are proud of you says a parent to a teenage daughter in a typical comic feature of the 1970s We heard that you and Steve were the only students in the history of your college who didnt go to bed together on your first date The daughter answers Thats true Dad But we did make out on a couch on the floor etc Much of the material Mad satirized in its pages was first available to children in other media especially television and the films As these began to show increasingly adult material Mads pages also began to become more sophisticated The magazine grew racier but its readership grew younger In the late 50s our readers seemed to be about 15 l6 late high school early college Today the mean age is probably about 13 Al Feldstein says He attributes the change unequivocally to increased television viewing By the issue of December 1980 a parody of Little Darlings a film about two young girls at summer camp racing to see who loses her virginity first includes an outdoor salesman hawking Get your training diaphragms here and a little girl spying on a teenage couple and reporting Shes starting foreplay now It is hard to imagine 10 and 11yearolds in 1955 reading about diaphragms and foreplay But that was still the Golden Age of Innocence and one of the reasons it was far easier to maintain that special state for children 25 years ago and why it is impossible to bring it back today is precisely that movies like Little Darlings did not exist in those days When children went to a movie not so long ago their parents never gave a moments thought to whether it might contain scenes of nudity gang rape homosexuality or sadistic violence It was not because parents were more casual in the good old days but rather because virtually all American films made before the 1960s were suitable for child consumption Until then there had never been a serious need for parents to exercise any cultural repressiveness in regard to their children With all movies as pure as Ivory Snow children were free to see any movie they wished Indeed the swashbuckling costume dramas the musicals with June Allyson the Martin and Lewis comedies of the 1940s and 50s remain to this day the most suitable movies available for children Once innocence was imposed on young and old alike A rigid prudish Motion Picture Production Code in effect until the early 1960s kept all aspects of adult sexuality all strong or blasphemous language and all excessive violence out of films altogether But with the establishment of more liberal sexual standards the film world quickly sloughed off its rigid rules The floodgates were opened and sex was everywhere Parents were appalled to find that their innocent children were losing their innocence rapidly Nevertheless parents were hard put to seriously censor the movies their children went to see Such restrictiveness would have gone counter to a long strain of parental libertarianism that traces back in fact to childrearing customs of Americas earliest days Groups of parents educators and religious leaders began to protest the inclusion of sexual material and violence in films children were viewing Suddenly the film industry was faced with the alternatives of a reinstated censorship system that would remove once again controversial material from all films or some sort of classification system that would differentiate between films containing adult material and those suitable for children Unsurprisingly the industry exercised the latter option A rating system evolved that bars children under 17 from films rated X and requires children under 17 to be accompanied by an adult to films rated R Films rated G and PG allow free entry to all children although parents are warned to exercise guidance But the rating system did not carry the protective clout it promised when it was introduced It became clear that unescorted children were easily gaining access to Rrated movies either by latching onto unrelated adults or in many cases through the complete disregard of restrictions by theater owners unwilling to lose additional revenues Many parents for a variety of reasons took their children themselves to R movies In 1974 when The Exorcist opened in Washington with an R rating a newspaper critic commented on the number of children many as young as 6 and 8 who had been brought by their parents or who had managed to get an adult in line to take me in Even the X rating is far from inviolable The critic Nora Sayre reports seeing a large number of young teenagers at a performance she attended of Snuff an unprecedently violent Xrated film that purported to feature a real murder on screen And recently a number of 14 and 15yearolds known to this writer said that they had little trouble gaining admission to the pornographic movie Caligula which is being shown without any rating at all The Rating Board regardless of its effectiveness was never intended to be a protective agency for the preservation of childhood innocence Its function as described by its present chairman Richard Heffner is to reflect standards not set them thus putting them somewhat in the category of Mad Magazine which also purports to reflect rather than establish moral codes The mandate of the Rating Board is rather to try to feel the parental pulse throughout the nation and rate each movie according to how the board perceives the average parent might judge the film The parental pulse however seems to have quickened in recent years By reflecting adult standards in an era of relaxed sexual prohibitions the board has found itself becoming increasingly lenient about the inclusion of sexual material in films it dubs PG A nipple wont automatically make a film an R as it used to says Heffner Similarly the inclusion in film dialogue of some longforbidden expletives no longer serves as an automatic reason for an R rating In a brief period of 15 years we have seen a precipitate cultural change Now as children began to be influenced by their regular viewing of adult movies society was forced to confront the implications of the change Some of the lines of demarcation between childhood and adulthood were being permanently removed and children were beginning to look talk and behave in ways that no longer seemed very childlike For during the years when movies contained innocent material adults continued to know those things that the movies were not allowed to mention continued to behave in those ways that movies were not allowed to portray But children did not know those things Now everybody knows Countless children over 12 today have seen Fame which deals openly with teenage homosexual and heterosexual behavior or Kramer vs Kramer which painfully reveals modern patterns of parental abandonment or All That Jazz or scores of other movies dealing with complex adult matters Short of a radical change in current childrearing practices American children will continue to be exposed by the movies to increasingly mature materials Long after children stopped believing in fairies and Santa Claus adults continued to believe in the enduring myth of the Golden Age of Innocence Nonetheless children learn the ways of the adult world today not only through books magazines movies and television but also in their own families and homes The formerly closed door between childhood and adulthood has been pushed ajar and sometimes entirely removed from its hinges As a little girl I had very little idea of what went on in the adult world or how grownups felt they were just these remote people recalls a woman who is raising two daughters in a singleparent home Now my kids know huge amounts about every aspect of my life  emotional physical even sexual How can I keep it from them The first time a man slept over after the divorce I was nervous about the childrens reactions I got up early closed the bedroom door and went into the kitchen to make breakfast My 8yearold came in as I was busy making pancakes Mom did you know theres a man in your bed she asked in a very adult voice turned on her heel and left the room For many children today childhood is a difficult and dangerous time As a 15yearold girl who looks back on a past that included a parental divorce experimentation with marijuana from the sixth grade on and a troubling experience with sex in the eighth grade remarked All the kids I see are in a rush to grow up and I dont blame them I dont think childhood is a Golden Age at all I wouldnt want to be a child again The rapidly increasing divorce rate and the increasing number of working mothers have hastened the entry of children into the adult world by reducing the kind of close personalized and highly protective attention that a child can rely on in a motherathomeallday household The child of a working mother may derive certain strengths from his greater exposure to other adults and increased opportunities for socialization in groupcare situations But it is a fact that without daylong supervision by a parent the child will develop ways of coping with the vicissitudes of life that resemble similar strategies adults develop in the course of their experiences in a harsh world The situation is not unlike that of the preliberation wife and mother who stayed in the protected confines of the home all day and seemed to retain a somewhat more childlike and innocent image while her husband in comparison seemed manifestly more worldly sophisticated and ultimately adult as a result of his experiences in the unprotected world With the diminishing influence of parents in childrens lives a new and powerful family member stepped in to take their place the television set In frequently unsupervised homes children today fill in their free hours watching television Occasionally they watch programs designed especially for them but far more often they tune into soap operas treating of rape and abortion documentaries revealing misery suffering and death news programs sensationalizing turmoil and crime and comedies mocking and trivializing men and women much like their parents Not only do these subjects make children more cynical and sophisticated but the very act of watching for so many hours prevents them from engaging in those imaginative play activities that once formed the essence of childhood Some parents fearful of the dangers facing their children in todays society try to prolong the time of innocence by opting for a religious rather than a public or private school Daniele Lassner director of admissions of the Ramaz School a New York preparatory school that combines an academic schedule with a rigorous Jewish curriculum says an increasing number of nonreligious parents are choosing Ramaz these days Parents are afraid of their kids facing drugs and early sexuality They feel its a dangerous world and they hope that somehow we might protect their children from whats out there Not to isolate them but at least to insulate against the dangers Others feeling increasingly out of control deliberately hasten the fall from innocence in the hope that the frightening knowledge they proffer may cause their children to exercise that most adult of virt
es  selfcontrol A mother whose 12yearold son was suspended from school after being caught smoking marijuana in the lavatory describes her desperate tactics to persuade him to stay away from illegal drugs I told Phillip graphically what might happen if he were arrested and had to spend the night at Spofford a juvenile detention facility I told him he might have his eyes gouged out And I told him hed certainly be raped by the other boys because hes young and pretty and white I could see he was shocked and I think it may have done some good Childrens increasing knowledge may have unfavorable consequences for their development some experts believe Annie Hermann an earlychildhood expert is distressed by current trends that advocate sharing information about adult inadequacies with children We want our children to know very soon that adults are not as wonderful as they think she says We feel it is unfair undemocratic somehow to let children have false illusions about adult omnipotence So instead of the child believing that parents can do everything that adults will always come to the rescue in time of need we tell our children Oh were just like you We have faults and weaknesses But the child has his own timetable and is often not developed enough to absorb the realities of adult life when they are foisted on him prematurely The child needs to feel dependent on the adult has a right to this feeling If the adult is just like the child after all then the child cant really depend on him And yet that stage of childhood when children believe in parental omnipotence helps develop a basic lifegiving trust in children a trust that carries with it half of lifes enjoyment An eminent child psychoanalyst Dr Peter B Neubauer director of the Child Development Center in New York sounds another warning that reverberates with particular resonance in a time of increasing narcissism Children who are pushed into adult experience do not become precociously mature On the contrary they cling to childhood longer perhaps all their lives Nevertheless Dr Neubauer is sanguine about the present state of childhood especially when compared with other eras of the past We cannot reverse the processes that have begun the changes in the family or womans liberation And we mustnt idealize childrens happiness in the past Remember the struggle for existence the high infant mortality child labor Remember that a real understanding of how children behave didnt exist before the 20th century For all our problems today we understand more about children and care more about their needs than we did in the past Another optimistic observer of contemporary children is Michael I Cohen chairman of the department of pediatrics at Montefiore Hospital and Albert Einstein College of Medicine who says  Todays kids may turn out to be better parents than their own were because they are getting better information than their parents had When parents complain about their kids I tell them Look at your own successes first Youve blown your marriage You havent raised a kid so well What makes you think things were better in the past  Dr Paulina F Kernberg director of child and adolescent psychiatry at New York HospitalCornell Medical Center Westchester division brings the discussion full circle when she suggests that the new more adultcentered conception of children today may once again allow children to become important contributors to the society they live in not as in the Middle Ages because of their economic value but because they can serve an increasingly valuable psychological function I think the potential of children has been greatly underrated Dr Kernberg asserts Children can participate in family matters to a far greater extent than people believed in the past To share problems with children does not necessarily mean to unload I feel that children can understand that parents have problems of their own even serious ones such as mental illness If the child is told things in language he can understand by an empathetic adult he can share many problems that were once hidden from children A child needs to know that he can do something at least to listen to a parents problem People forget that children are very resilient and that theyre potentially good pals It has become fashionable to idealize the distant past to suppose that since children were once integrated into adult society they were therefore better off somehow Yet critics of the current medieval nostalgia point out evidence of widespread sexual exploitation of children child neglect and psychological damage to children in the medieval period Similarly as we make the transition from an era of separation and protection of children to one in which children are once again incorporated early into a lessdifferentiated society we cannot fail to observe that child abuse child neglect child exploitation are again on the rise and that the lives of great numbers of children have become more difficult Today parents often forget that despite the end of the Age of Innocence some children remain vulnerable longer than others In avoiding the past excesses of secrecy and overprotectiveness adults in our society often abdicate their responsibilities for dealing with childrens special needs It may indeed prove that children have become increasingly useful to adults in modern society as their roles have changed from innocent dependent special creatures to secret and notsosecret sharers of adult lifes inevitable burdens But from the viewpoint of children themselves whether the strengths they may acquire from their greater and earlier preparation for adulthood will compensate for the loss of that carefree childhood that people once believed children deserved and required remains to be seen Will our changing concepts of childhood prove beneficial or damaging to children and to society as a whole The answer to this troubling question will begin to appear in the nottoodistant future when a generation of children without childhood begin to raise children of their own,,
THE EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK; CLONING MEANS THE END OF MAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/26/opinion/the-editorial-notebook-cloning-means-the-end-of-man.html,Those reports of the first successful cloning of mice set off another round of sciencefiction speculation and doomsday warnings Some fear science will duplicate champion racehorses and renowned geniuses Others fear cloning catches society unprepared for awesome ethical and social issues Cloning is the production of offspring that are identical twins of a single parent and also of each other It is done every day with plants gardeners take cuttings and coax them to grow into new plants genetically identical to the original But the process is much more difficult with animals As animal cells mature out of the early embryonic state and begin to specialize as skin or liver cells some of their genes are apparently switched off That is why cloning adult cells is so hard Young frogs were cloned years ago Now a Swiss and an American have cloned mouse embryos the first accepted cloning of a mammal It was a major technical achievement and does move science a small step closer to cloning higher mammals The leaps of speculation are fascinating It may some day be possible to create genetic duplicates of a prize bull or racehorse And there are wilder But Theres No Other Reason For Gloom dreams reconstructing an ancient woolly mammoth from remains found in glacial ice or making another King Tut from mummified cells Dozens of Einsteins perhaps or Mozarts  or platoons of Hitlers But no one knows whether adult cells can ever be cloned And theres no fun in cloning a human embryo without knowing that it is destined to be Mozart Replicating geniuses would almost certainly fail even if the cloning were technically feasible Human development results from an intricate interplay between genetic heritage and environmental influences including the chemical environment of the womb Identical twins from the same womb and raised by the same parents in the same era have far more in common with each other than would a clone with its parent There are indeed ethical issues What does one do with unused or deformed clone embryos Would clones be harmed by the lack of a unique identity Would cloning dehumanize reproduction  and people as such Would nations breed superstars to win the Olympics and footsoldiers for the army Who would decide whom to clone Few of these questions however are unique to cloning They already arise in debates over abortion testtube procreation and selective breeding Alarmists might be comforted to know that some disadvantages of cloning would persist no matter how efficient the technology No rational planner would recommend cloning as the preferred method of human reproduction If widely used it could arrest evolution limiting humanity to past achievements and aborting the birth of greater geniuses or more adaptive types Cloning would surely take the excitement out of horse races who wants to watch ten Secretariats the variety out of life who wants ten Mozarts and the fun out of procreation It would also make males obsolete all you need for cloning are eggs nuclei and uteri  nothing from a male Let women decide whether thats progress PHILIP M BOFFEY
EVANGELICALS DEBATE THEIR ROLE IN BATTLING SECULARISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/27/us/evangelicals-debate-their-role-in-battling-secularism.html,A large national gathering of Christian evangelicals including hundreds of television and radio broadcasters was urged today to bolster the campaign by evangelical political activists to combat secular humanism which was described as the established religion of America The challenge was delivered by the Rev D James Kennedy the pastor of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale Fla and a leading figure in the recent drive by conservative church groups to help elect candidates who espoused views that agreed with fundamentalist moral principles Mr Kennedy also serves on the board of the Round Table an umbrella group for religiously conservative activists He told 2000 delegates at a joint meeting of National Religious Broadcasters and the National Association of Evangelicals that evangelicals should increase their level of political involvement because secular humanists have declared war on Christianity in this country and they are progressing very rapidly Brainwashed by Secularism Declaring that the public had been largely brainwashed into believing that the Constitution placed restrictions on churchconnected political activity Mr Kennedy asked What does it really say about what the church can do and cant do Absolutely nothing Turning to the subject of secular humanism a term often used to define a viewpoint that disregards religion as a factor in solving human problems Mr Kennedy linked its alleged rise to growing atheism and moral laxity on issues such as abortion homosexuality and pornography As the political wave among conservative Christians has grown secular humanism has been blamed for a variety of social and moral ills and represents the main focus of the conservative attack The activism by Christian political groups was considered a significant factor in the election of many conservative candidates including President Reagan who seemed to reflect fundamentalist opposition to abortion civil rights for homosexuals and the Equal Rights Amendment as well as their backing of prayer in the public schools But appeals for evangelical support for this activist movement have met mixed reactions among conservative church people The tensions among the various segments of conservative Christianity have been apparent in the early stages of the joint fourday meeting at the Sheraton Washington Hotel Divergence Among Evangelicals The frictions are mirrored in the two organizations which represent different constituencies and to a large degree distinct points of view on the question The National Association of Evangelicals the older group founded in 1941 is composed of 36000 member congregations from a wide variety of evangelical denominations It reflects many of the moderate theological and moral views that tend to include distrust of singleissue politics and it often criticizes the tendency of the new Christian right to identify certain political positions as being the only ones authenticated by the Bible Many in this group also complain of the attempt to form what they see as a quasi political Christian party Marlin Van Elderen a leading evangelical underscored this criticism in an article in United Evangelical Action the official publication of the NAE Among the dangers of the activism Mr Van Elderen said is enshrining ones own particular political and ethical judgments as the biblical viewpoint No person or organization  not the World Council of Churches nor the National Association of Evangelicals not Jerry Falwell nor Pope John Paul II speaks on behalf of biblical Christianity in matters social and political he wrote Criticism of Braodcasters The disagreements are accompanied by attacks on evangelical broadcasters The National Religious Broadcasters begun under the auspices of the NAE in 1943 as a special interest group has in many ways overshadowed its parent This rivalry is intensified by the widespread suspicion that media evangelists are causing neglect of local churches by siphoning away members and money Attacks on evangelical broadcasters came from two sources today George Sweeting president of the Moody Bible Institute warned that the parachurch movement which includes a broad scope of evangelical efforts beyond the local church among them television and radio ministries threatens to become the tail that wags the dog He appealed for a recovery of the centrality of the local church Mr Sweeting also criticized television evangelism for running the risks of extravagant spending and an elegant lifestyle resorting to unwise methods of fundraising  substituting entertainment for the word of God and adding our own culture to the Gospel
EVANGELICAL LEADERS HAIL ELECTION AND ASK CONTINUATION OF EFFORTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/28/us/evangelical-leaders-hail-election-and-ask-continuation-of-efforts.html,Conservative religious leaders who headed a recent evangelical political campaign today cheered the sizable gains by conservatives in the November elections and exhorted their followers to continue the fight for moral values The Rev Jerry Falwell head of Moral Majority which played a major role in the fall elections spoke to a Congressional prayer breakfast at a session of the National Religious Broadcasters and later told a news conference that his fundamentalist organization had experienced its most rapid growth since many of the candidates who backed its stands were voted into office two months ago The participants in the meeting of evangelicals which has become dominated by the broadcasters also heard a sharp attack on Moral Majority from an outgoing commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission Suggestion of Racism Tyrone Brown told a luncheon gathering The theme that appears to me to run through some of the polemics of the Moral Majority is the provincial notion that people are to be divided into them and us with minority Americans all too often falling into them category I fear that unless this theme in the catechism of the Moral Majority is eliminated that force could become another code word for racism in our society My parting message to you is this It probably is unwise for you in any event to permit the broad movement for religious revival to become too closely identified with any political movement Certainly it would be unwise to be identified with a movement whose contours are still uncertain and which you cannot control Mr Falwell in an ebullient mood and exuberant about the apparent recent success of Moral Majority to help many candidates expressed confidence in President Reagan and counseled patience with regard to the new Administrations ability to act on such campaign pledges as efforts to enact a constitutional amendment against abortions and legislation that would permit organized statesanctioned school prayer The damage caused by secular humanism cannot be repaired in 30 days Mr Falwell said He predicted that the 1980s would produce the greatest spiritual revival of any decade in the nations history and vowed to press the cause of passing an amendment against abortions by the end of the decade Denial of AntiSemitism Asked to describe his strategy for combating antiSemitism Mr Falwell replied Every preacher has an obligation from God to work and preach toward putting an end to hate and hate groups He cited several groups including the Ku Klux Klan and the America Nazi Party Further he attributed rising incidents of antiSemitism to a backlash against the efforts of evangelicals to teach love for Jews and for Israel There is not one antiSemite in a Biblebelieving church in America Mr Falwell said Among the other activities at the joint meeting of the National Religious Broadcasters and the National Association of Evangelicals the Roundtable which became the umbrella organization for religious political activity among conservatives conducted a strategy session Various speakers expressed rejoicing at the conservative gains in November and rallied the audience to build upon these successes in the months ahead Other participants voiced disappointment that top Reagan appointees did not include enough strict conservatives
SCHWEIKER IS CRITICAL OF PROGRAMS ON SEX COUNSEL AND CONTRACEPTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/30/us/schweiker-is-critical-of-programs-on-sex-counsel-and-contraception.html,Richard S Schweiker the Secretary of Health and Human Services said today that he did not think his department should promote sex education and that doctors treating poor unmarried teenagers under Medicaid should not be permitted to prescribe contraceptives Mr Schweikers views expressed in a meeting with a group of reporters contrasted with those of his predecessor Patricia Roberts Harris In an interview shortly before leaving office Mrs Harris asserted that the country faced disaster if steps were not taken to educate teenagers about contraceptives and she said it was an area she would have concentrated on had she been given another term in office The Office for Family Planning a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services currently helps to finance 5100 familyplanning clinics throughout the country that serve about four million women a year According to William White director of the office recent emphasis has been on providing physical examinations contraceptives and other services to teenagers In addition the office has provided sex education through films television announcements and pamphlets TeenAge Mothers Aided Another branch of the department the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs provides funds for projects that assist teenage mothers A main function of the projects according to a department official is to counsel patients on how to prevent further pregnancies The family planning office has a budget of 162 million in the current fiscal year the adolescent pregnancy office has a budget of 75 million Mr Schweiker declined to say if those programs would be abolished or if their budgets would be reduced As a Republican Senator from Pennsylvania Mr Schweiker supported appropriations for familyplanning programs He also sponsored a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion in almost all circumstances and he said today that he expected to advocate passage of that amendment in his new position He said that he believed sex education was primarily a responsibility of parents I dont think its the Feds role to do it he said and I dont think its the states role unless the local school agency does it with the express approval of the parent A No to Contraceptives Asked if he thought doctors should be permitted to prescribe contraceptives for teenage patients covered by Medicaid the Secretary responded with a curt no and turned to another subject Such prescriptions are being routinely issued according to familyplanning specialists although a few states require that parents be notified if the patients are minors In fact contraception has been given a special priority under Medicaid the Federal health program for the poor The Federal Government covers 90 percent of the cost of such services and the states pay 10 percent For most other Medicaid services the Federal Government and the states split the cost evenly Mrs Harris and other proponents of expanded sex education programs contend that pregnancy among teenagers has become epidemic especially among blacks and other minories
MOM-POP ECONOMICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/31/opinion/mompop-economics.html,As an attorney and libertarian I am besieged with the plaintive cries of average citizens who feel that some arm of the state is reducing their cherished freedom to bureaucratic dust However until recently I never had the time or the inclination to perceive one particularly insidious form of repression that awaits the dutiful citizen of the 1980s compulsory consumption For some time now I have been observing those little printed squares labeled proof of purchase seal on the sides tops or bottoms of supermarket items Naturally having been brought up on Captain Video rings and bakingsoda bathtub submarines sent from Battle Creek Mich for three boxtops and 25 cents I assumed that these seals were part of some promotional scheme for food processors Then the filigreed little seals began to proliferate and to include the variable computer lines that enable the checkout counter to determine what you owe the food conglomerate Soon it seemed like it wasnt possible to buy a box of oyster crackers or a jar of gefilte fish without feeling obliged to cut the seals from the labels just in case you might need to prove you bought the product My neighbor told me not to take life so seriously that this was just another paranoid episode like the time I locked myself in the house because I thought the heat police were on their way over to check my thermostat Being a cautious lawyer who knows that being paranoid doesnt mean no one is out to get you I started doing a little legal research Here is what I discovered The scheme has been progressing steadily and within three years every product will have a proofofpurchase seal I wondered prove to whom My son asked prove what The answers are quite simple In order to help regulate the economy and reduce inflation while maintaining adequate growth in the gross national product the Government soon will soon be controlling not only the money supply production and taxation but also consumption Its logical and its practical and heres how it works Each family or individual taxpayer must send to the ICS Internal Consumption Service each Jan 15 the proofofpurchase seals from things that it has consumed during the previous calendar year The point value of these seals must equal a previously announced number set by the Presidents Council of Consumptive Advisors Failure to cough up these proofofpurchase seals will indicate irregular or deviant consumption patterns and subject the violators to be fined forcefed or institutionalized Since the proofofpurchase seals would be subject to an active exchange in the black market and since failure to consume ones fair share is plainly unpatriotic the Proof of Purchase Police an enforcement bureau created to ferret out illegal activities in proofofpurchase seals will become an arm of the ICS It is now clear why MacDonald is constantly providing us with the advice Over 4 Billion Served It will be necessary to divide this by world population to determine how many Big Macs each of us is obliged to have digested The plan called Manipulation of Merchandising and Proof of Purchase MoM and PoP economics will be established  like restricting the import of highquality cars  as part of the effort to save the economy from the rampant common sense of consumers The legal mechanism for establishing this plan will of course be the constitutional amendment As part of an omnibus constitutional amendment now being planned an amendment will soon be introduced to clean up a lot of our flabby urban morality consumption of prayer will be required in public schools abortion will become illegal except to save the career of a politician and the Constitutions commerce clause will be amended to permit the regulation of consumption of goods moving in interstate commerce I have noticed that the seals are not dated and have begun collecting them to protect myself from overweight or overbearing debt service in the future Meanwhile the number of civilliberties problems that will be generated by MoM and PoP economices has not escaped me and I have started advertising for paralegals to expand my practice In fact I have begun lobbying the American Bar Association about legislation that would require proofofretainer seals so that compulsory consumption of services as well as goods can bolster our gross national product
HOW IT WAS BEFORE LEGALIZED ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/01/nyregion/how-it-was-before-legalized-abortion.html,JAN 22 was the anniversary of the Supreme Court decisions that made abortion legal It is easy to forget that only eight years ago abortion was illegal and unavailable in most of our United States Only when the mothers very life was threatened were doctors allowed to terminate a pregnancy Not even in cases of rape incest serious health problems or genetic fetal abnormalities was abortion legal It is easy to forget what women did back in those days But I cannot forget I am a nurse and have been for 19 years I work for Planned Parenthood of Westchester and am committed to its goals as a direct result of my experiences in the field of obstetrics and gynecology I saw what happened to women who were made desperate by unwanted pregnancy I remember the more fortunate women who survived and I remember the ones who were taken from the emergency room to the morgue Their pain their suffering and their deaths were so unnecessary and so tragic Those were the days when it was not unusual for half of the obstetric beds in a large public hospital to be occupied by women suffering the consequences of illegal abortion I remember the 17yearold who collapsed in a pool of blood at the door of the emergency room A hysterectomy saved her life I remember the 30yearold mother of four with severe burns on her legs and torso who had thought that hot baths would produce a miscarriage I remember the crazy lady in labor whose screams could be heard throughout the maternity unit She calmed after delivering a healthy baby and then told her story She had attempted to abort herself Her husband had abandoned her early in the pregnancy with three small children and little else When her abortion attempt failed she begged her own doctor for help He not only refused her plea but also refused to care for her pregnancy He told her she would probably deliver a deformed child She had parceled out her children to relatives when she lost the ability to cope with the pain fear and guilt She put the baby up for adoption and left the hospital with hopes of putting her family and her life back together again I remember the story a young husband told to a policeman abortion was a crime and the police were always called when abortion was suspected The couple had fallen in love during high school When her parents refused to let them marry they eloped He got a job in a service station they rented a small apartment and they managed They managed through three babies in three years He helped with the house and the children and she helped out at the station whenever she could I can only imagine her state of mind when she found herself pregnant the fourth time She must have been desperate for she went into the washroom of the service station and inserted two dirty wooden Qtips into her uterus She died that night leaving a husband and three children who loved and needed her I remember many others Because of these memories I work for Planned Parenthood an organization committed both to preventing unwanted pregnancies through education and contraceptive services and to keeping abortion safe and legal No amount of legislation will prevent desperate women from seeking abortion Let us not forget that

"AH, THE POETRY READING",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/01/books/ah-the-poetry-reading.html,E all love astounding statistics For example every four seconds somebody in the United States is thinking up a Poetry Reading I am confident that on the whole this is a good thing Besides nothing that has its comic side can be all bad Poetry Readings involve lots of people of all sexes and all races and many positive points of view Nobody comes in white sheets with concealed weapons Poetry Readings do not endanger sheltered species of whom the poet is one A Poetry Reading is open to the public usually free of charge drawing goodnatured crowds mainly younger people some older people often university faculty the campus skeptic the village atheist and a mildly balmy autograph hunter signing up the Reading Poet no matter how perfectly unknown Some day of course when the perfectly unknown poet has ascended to fame the balmy autograph hunter will have gained a jump on us all To the young poets surprise a flashbulb pops Politically Poetry Readings tend to be antinuclear celebrating peace and ecology In recent years the community of Readings has paid special tribute to Native Americans and to men and women in prison Many poets have been exceedingly active in teaching poetry in prisons in all parts of the country Twenty years ago the institutional joke celebrated the black Catholic nun as the ideal in the economy of obligation She was black she was female she was of a religious minority The joke brought uptodate holds that the ideal captive token is an Indian woman whos been in jail After the Reading come wine and cheese Here and there a site or a campus prohibits wine Therefore the champions of Readings congregate at a tavern or somebodys house where they think up new Readings Needless to say people thinking up Poetry Readings every four seconds are often thinking of Readings in which they themselves will be principal participants They will be the actual Poet Reading or they will invite a friend from a distance to Read and not long afterward the friend from a distance will invite them The very young Poet envisions his or her name in the campus newspaper his face upon a poster crucified to the bulletin board He is Reading All the poets he has ever seen he has seen Reading Therefore if he too can become a Poet Reading it follows that he is a poet A poet is to be seen and heard All recent models seem to go Reading The model of the poet who stays home and writes is not a model so often seen and for that reason the very young Poet may be forgiven his confusion Not long ago my turn came to strut for a short time as that powerful figure of the Poetry Reading circuit  he who decides who shall Read who shall be invited who shall therefore in some sense be certified as Poet by virtue of his giving a Reading The Poet arrives on the appointed day not by virtue of hisher longnurtured genius but by airplane to be met at the airport by a small delegation and to be driven back to the Varsity Inn in an automobile containing several excited people who have never been enclosed in such a small space with a distant Poet He will soon be surrounded by people with cocktails then carried to a leading restaurant to dine to digest and to be escorted by proud folk consulting their watches to a room or auditorium chosen in the hope that it will be too small rather than too large  that it will be crowded seeming to overflow Hell said Robert Frost is a halffilled auditorium Here the Poet will be introduced by his resident admirer Here he will read be applauded For the week gone by many people have been reading his poetry Others unable to lay hands on his work vow as they listen to do so and to read him when he has gone Perhaps they will On the other hand another Reader is coming soon Todays Reader departs His face falls from the bulletin board I had authority I had a budget My territory was a community of striving known as Arizona State University an oasis crisscrossed with palm trees When the poet Yehuda Amichai visited us he said it looked like Israel Here 50000 thirsty people have committed themselves to multiform branches of knowledge many of them to the idea of poetry A wellpublicized Reading will also draw its audience from specialinterest groups perhaps ethnic or political whose preoccupations may not be poetry but something else And yet specialinterest people sometimes transcend themselves Their politics sails upward toward the grander politics which is literature and the Reading proves to be a lovely example of education by chance In my new managerial role I received messages from everywhere from people 25 to 40 years old eager to visit our desert to Read They claimed to be poets But how could I know They confidently supplied verifying data  the magazines and the presses with whom they published the prizes they had won and sometimes the prizes for which they had been nominated They named the names of illustrious poets to whom they had dedicated their work So keen was their need for verificationbyassociation that their logic failed They offered finally as the best evidence of their reality the names of the Readings in which they had at one time or another participated not forgetting also to name the famous poets who had read from the same platform I began to feel the oddity of this  the dates and places of Readings offered as if the Reading itself were an achievement a goal an end equal to the act of writing poetry I thought it was not The work of a poet is to write Travel wine and cheese are play And the Reading itself is usually less than creative For myself perhaps other people share this experience I found that a Reading often precipitates the wandering of my mind The better the poetry the farther my mind wanders I wish I were alone with the page Poor poetry on the other hand is easy to follow because less complex its surface is livelier it makes a better show But why should I venture into the night for poor poetry Not all poets are equal One peculiar way to view them is through the prism of budget A few poets occupied a class alone I was told that I might get James Dickey at his special cutrate bargain price of only 4500 for one whole night if Id promise to conduct a threeday James Dickey Festival at the same time I passed For one Dickey I could have 15 300 poets In the middle range of cost are poets who have written work undeniably good who for feeandexpenses between 500 and 2000 will come and read and spend a day or two meeting with students Often this is the poet on tour appearing on several campuses during the course of two or three weeks and taking home with him a good deal more money than he will earn from book royalties or magazine sales Of course where theres money to be made agents rush in who may care very little for poetry or for the idea of a university When I offered one agent too little for his poet he told me I had just muffed the opportunity to confer instant universal greatness on Arizona State Another agent who would not permit me to speak to his poet stipulated that his poet was not to meet students The poet was to arrive Read and depart Wisely the National Endowment for the Arts which supported our Readings expected Reading also to be residencies Visiting poets were not to sweep through town with a single platform reading but were also to meet with students for informal talk and classroom workshop situations Most poets do this well and gracefully and if they go home anesthetized by the sound of their own voices they may also be refreshened and inspired by memories of public Readings and private analytical classroom sessions Poets by the thousands Truly America so recently barbarous only yesterday the Wild West or the sweatshop East had become a country of nobody but poets roaming the range So it felt My telephone rang For the first time in my life I required a secretary Soon I was engaged in package deals for Poets  Id pay suchandsuch percentage of a poets journey on a costsharing basis with Albuquerque Tucson Denver Salt Lake The Poetry Center at the University of Arizona conducted by Lois Shelton has been a forum and a haven for poets and I too felt that I was doing a great thing for poetry in America by acquainting poets with their potential audiences as Whitman said we should To have great poets there must be great audiences too Try it youll like it But I began to see too that what we have here is an inflation of Poets hundreds upon hundreds of Poets more or less verified credentialed with degrees and chapbooks and above all  Readings to their credit All the old records lie smashed When Robert Frost was told in New Deal days that 600 poets worked for the WPA he was scornful saying There havent been 600 poets in human history As we have hundreds of fast runners who break the 10second record for the 100yard dash hundreds who run the fourminute mile hundreds who run the 26mile marathon so do we have hundreds of men and women capable of writing literate verse We are superblessed and overqualified The first touring reciting poet I ever heard of was Vachel Lindsay of Illinois about whom I wrote a fat book 30 years ago Lindsay was a fervent idealist whose hometown Springfield looked upon him as an odd idle fellow  not dangerous yet not of the work force either He left Into his 30s he was traveling penniless and afoot as he said through the South and into the West a strange lonely figure carrying rhymes to be traded for bread He likened himself to Johnny Appleseed planting trees in the American waste When certain of Lindsays rhymes struck a national note General William Booth Enters Into Heaven The Chinese Nightingale The Congo and others he was tempted onto the lecture circuit Now he was no longer penniless and afoot On the contrary he was earning sizable fees while crossing and recrossing America on the flatwheeled Pullman car He was bearing a message of beauty and democracy which he thought would make us gentle and peaceful Our approximation to Lindsay is probably Allen Ginsberg whose poetry when chanted and sung by Ginsberg intends to arouse us to reform But the Poets now Reading do not appear to be worldsavers or worldchangers in the tradition of Whitman Lindsay and Ginsberg Their ambition is not to reform but to earn the title Poet In many cases their vision of the future may be less the vision of an improved community than the vision of themselves Reading from a podium College students no sooner enroll in their first class in Creative Writing than they clamor for a Student Reading This should not surprise us The sign of the Poet is that he flew in he drank a cocktail he dined he digested he Read Recently a very beautiful woman came to town at the invitation of her friend who was connected to a modest restaurant She carried with her her own advertising poster whose largest word was Poet which she placed in the window of the restaurant A night or two later she offered a reading to 15 captive diners I dont know if she was paid or even fed Her goal was not money or food but Reading She had written a variety of poems appropriate to whatever Readings friends could arrange feminist poems conservation poems abortion poems etc she arrived she Read and she left glowing carrying her poster with her She is a selfdeclared poet She thinks she is a poet because her poster says so And who am I to say that she is not Somebody every four seconds thinking of herself as a poet might not be a bad thing If it is true as Frost said that there have not been 600 poets in history he also said that we believe ourselves in  that we cannot exist until we believe we can Readings offer an extensive opportunity for Poets to try themselves out to test their selfbelief among strangers The Reading serves two main ends The first is the traditional presentation of mature voices offering listeners that sound of poetry not quite heard upon the page Second it offers younger selfdeclared poets a crossroads they may have mistaken for a destination For the Reading is but a stage of apprenticeship a literary rite of passage It is prologue to the work not the work itself Meanwhile pleasantly and usefully Readings multiply every four seconds Some poets arrive to Read by invitation others on wings of hope the goodnatured audience gathers and the flashbulb pops And the wine the cheese

distribution of the March issue of Penthouse magazine Judge James C Turk held that a complaint that the Rev Jerry Falwell a television preacher who founded Moral Majority had been deceived by the magazine and its interviewers was a matter for a civil damage suit Moral Majority a religiouspolitical action group founded two years ago is credited with contributing to the turnout of conservatives who helped elect Ronald Reagan to the Presidency and several conservative Republicans to the Senate last November An interview with Mr Falwell is given a large promotional play on the cover of the March issue of Penthouse which also features a halfclad woman The 46yearold Lynchburgbased preacher contends that the interview was obtained surreptitiously and by deceit and is suing the magazine and the two interviewers for 10 million The court held today that he could not bar publication of the monthly magazine Judge Turk dissolved a temporary order that he issued last Friday barring distribution of the March issue The order expired at 130 PM today Judge Turk said the injunction was designed to give both sides a chance to be heard The proper relief is to seek compensatory damages after the fact rather than prior restraint the judge said at the close of a 90minute hearing at the Federal Courthouse here A First Amednment Case It is a First Amendment case he said later referring to the protection of a free press under the First Amendment to the Constitution Judge Turks decision thus ended the latest case involving judicial prior restraint of an American publication  a restraint that apparently was moot in any event A lawyer for Penthouse said here that most of the magazines circulation of five million was already in transit and beyond our control when Judge Turk issued the temporary restraining order last Friday Lester Ellett who runs the Hill City news agency here and is the local wholesale distributor of Penthouse said he had routinely delivered about 2000 copies of the March issue here this morning and was expecting another shipment I never got any order not to he said Nobody sent me anything Mr Falwell said after the hearing that he would not appeal Judge Turks decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond But Roy Grutman an attorney for Robert Guccione the publisher of Penthouse said that a countersuit may be filed against the minister because of what he described as Mr Falwells excessive zeal in calling the magazine a cesspool Whatever the outcome of the legal dispute over the Penthouse article about Mr Falwell which was sandwiched between fullpage pictures of nude women and a report on pimps both sides remarked about the furor stirred up by the case Statement by Falwell Mr Falwell emerged from the hearing and told a jostling crowd of spectators and reporters that the Penthouse people had gotten what they set out to get  a media explosion Mr Guccione maintained that publicity over Mr Falwells court fight to halt distribution of the magazine would increase sales by a halfmillion copies adding that Penthouse couldnt afford a promotion genius like Falwell Mr Falwell testified that Andrew Duncan a British journalist and Sasthi Banta an Indianborn freelance writer had told him that the interviews would be used in a book and a London newspaper and would not be sold to a smut publication Penthouse Mr Duncan and Mr Banta dispute this contention Mr Falwell does not challenge the accuracy of the text of his interview which is basically a lament on the growth of overt homosexuality and pornography and on divorce and abortion but he objects to the interviews being published in a magazine that he has called salacious At the hearing today Mr Falwell stressed the proprietary or moneyraising harm that the Penthouse interview would cause his ministry The ministers attorney Thomas L Phillips Jr told Judge Turk that Mr Falwell who broadcasts his Old Time Gospel Hour on 385 churchrelated television stations and 310 radio stations was seeking in the suit to protect a proprietary interest in private property Founder of 2 Christian Schools Mr Falwell is also pastor of the 17000member Thomas Road Baptist Church here a mammoth brick structure that is wired inside like a television studio and is the founder of the Lynchburg Christian Academy a lower school and Liberty Baptist College a sprawling new campus on the edge of Lynchburg For himself Mr Falwell said that he would have a lot of work to do getting to all of his followers which he estimated at 15 million to tell them that he had not authorized publication of the interview in Penthouse Mr Grutman the publishers attorney told the court that Mr Falwell had brought not a lawsuit but a media event designed to explain his embarrassment to his constituency Mr Falwell said after the hearing that to make sure that a similar incident would not happen again he now required interviewers to sign a form Referring to the biblical injunction An eye for an eye the minister said the form stated that if the published material doesnt appear the way you say it will were going to have your eye

REAGAN SHOULD OPPOSE THE RIGHT TO LIFE MOVEMENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/05/opinion/l-reagan-should-oppose-the-right-to-life-movement-050183.html,To the Editor If President Reagan really means what he says about getting Government off peoples back and out of affairs which dont and should not concern it let him begin by opposing the Right to Life Amendment By what right does Government enter into the most intimate and personal relationship on this earth  that of a pregnant woman with her fetus Wondrous and joyous though dire and unforeseeable circumstances it is a catastrophe to many individual women and to whole families Indeed all society suffers and pays in one way or another Tragic births continue to occur though less often since the Supreme Court ruling eight years ago Technology and tests exist and are being refined which can and do eliminate many such disasters ofter through abortion To deny such help is a special kind of inhumanity Because of the Court ruling we are a more enlightened society Fewer unwanted children are born Fewer hopelessly deformed children are born The most fundamental right of women has been recognized togive birth or not to give birth Because of it the quality of life of our nation will improve thanks to official affirmation of individual freedom of choice Given the continued opportunity that is But the Right to Life movement wants to deny that opportunity What colossal arrogance these people have Whatever their particular religious convictions on the subject  and I believe this is the motivating force for most of them  they have no mandate from on high There are those in this country whose religious beliefs do not countenance abortion under any circumstances there are those whose religious beliefs permit abortion under any circumstances and there are those who stand somewhere in between Does our Government dare to foist one set of religious values on so diverse a nation one which prides itself on its democracy and nonsectarianism Surely this is an issue on which Mr Reagan should wish to reaffirm his oftrepeated commitment to individual responsibility and choice over Government fiat After all each of us must answer to his or her God someday Government cannot do it for us LOIS BRADLEY TOWNSEND Verona NJ Jan 23 1981
MORAL MAJORITY ESTABLISHES BEACHHEAD IN NEW YORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/05/nyregion/moral-majority-establishes-beachhead-in-new-york.html,Last autumn candidates for office throughout New York State received a twopage questionnaire in the mail The first page asked the usual questions about some of the usual issues  capital punishment welfare the equal rights amendment abortion The second page of questions went beyond the routine What is the Bible it asked Have you ever been born again and If you stood before heavens gate and were asked on what grounds you sought admission how would you reply Only a handful of these questionnaires were returned but the man who mailed them out predicts he will not be so easily ignored from now on He is the Rev Dan C Fore chairman of New York States fledgling chapter of the Moral Majority and he expects only success The fundamentalist political movement that spearheaded the new Christian right last year is now moving east to states previously mentioned in the same breath with the Bible Belt only for purposes of contrast The objective is to find new members and influence elections and legislation on what it calls prolife profamily and promorality issues Just as God judged Sodom and Gomorrah just as God destroyed the Roman Empire because of godlessness were dead unless we do something Mr Fore said recently to notetaking recruits at the Christian LIfe Center in Commack LI The meeting was a training seminar  one of several that MrFore is conducting statewide To some the idea of what detractors have dismissed as Bible thumpers establishing themselves in a state with so generally progressive a political history as New York flirts with the irrelevant To leaders of the Moral Majority whose previous triumphs have mainly been in the South and Middle West New York is just one more state moving to the right It was last year that the organization founded 19 months ago by a television evangelist the Rev Jerry Falwell first dipped into politics and had conservative impact on the Presidential race and other contests It was also last year that New York State voted for Ronald Reagan and a new Senator Alfonse M DAmato who ran as the candidate of the Republican Conservative and Right to Life Parties Many factors contributed to those victories but MrFalwell sees them as political harbingers People are the same everywhere he said in a recent interview in his Washington office The New York metropolitan area is liberal he suggested because conservatives have not been wellorganized here in the past They will be in the future he pledges The Moral Majority is focusing on 17 states that MrFalwell calls not yet mature and developed It is seeking a new members from all religious and backgrounds Among those 17 are New York New Jersey and Connecticut All three have chairmen now but little more than that The Moral Majority is not now a force in the area It views itself as a potential one  as it was elsewhere a year ago Mr Fore who was born in Texas and is pastor of the Metropolitan Baptist Church in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn does not intend to be underestimated As head of this states chapter since last spring he hopes to enlist 60 county chairmen and 100000 members paying 15 a year That will entitle them to the organizations new newspaper which will report the voting records of state and national legislators MrFore has garnered the support of a few Hasidic Jewish leaders and officials of both the Right to Life and Conservative Parties said in interviews that they were willing to work with him MrFore who seems to have made more progress than his counterparts in New Jersey and Connecticut has recruited only one county chairman and a few thousand members so far but that does not faze him I know that youve got to crawl before you walk said the 43yearold minister who came here from his last parish in California nearly four years ago The states will have to raise their own money he said but the national organization  which has built up a substantial treasury through television appeals and sophisticated directmail techniqueshelps by providing literature and holding lengthy workshops on fund raising public relations and organizing The name of the game is votes Mr Fore said in Commack First you get a local chairman Then you organize a moral action committee Then you organize your telephone tree Youve got a woman who loves to talk  and most of them do  you get a woman to be head of the telephone tree Once organized the groups members will pressure candidates and legislators on key issues They favor a constitutional amendment prohibiting abortion and favoring the death penalty prayers in schools and tuition tax credits for parochial education They strongly support Israel and oppose the equal rights amendment sex education and homosexual rights Public opinion polls show that on some of those issues the majority of New Yorkers disagree with the Moral Majority Recent history demonstrates however that socalled oneissue groups can have an effect that far exceeds their numbers MrFore argues that his lobby is no different from any other We arent doing any more than the AFLCIO or the United Council of Churches  nobodys ever said anything about them he said He is particularly exercised about the comments of some Jewish leaders Rabbi Alexander Schindler president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations stirred some controversy last fall when he said that the groups activities had helped foster a climate in which religious intolerance could flourish I love the Jewish people deeply Mr Fore said God has given them talents He has not given others They are His chosen people Jews have a Godgiven ability to make money almost a supernatural ability to make money He also said They control the media they control this city MrFalwell told of those remarks said I dont think you can stereotype any people Just as it did nationally the local organization will not formally endorse  but will oppose  candidates And in the future instead of sending out questionnaires the organization plans to interview candidates personally We are not expecting to stop all the crime all the homosexuality all the lessbianism all the harlotry explained MrFore We are simply here as a savoring influence preaching what we believe is the truth which is salvation by faith in Christ national organization  which has built up a substantial treasury through television appeals and sophisticated directmail techniqueshelps by providing literature and holding lengthy workshops on fund raising public relations and organizing The name of the game is votes Mr Fore said in Commack First you get a local chairman Then you organize a moral action committee Then you organize your telephone tree Youve got a woman who loves to talk  and most of them do  you get a woman to be head of the telephone tree Once organized the groups members will pressure candidates and legislators on key issues They favor a constitutional amendment prohibiting abortion and favoring the death penalty prayers in schools and tuition tax credits for parochial

EX-GOV. GRASSO OF CONNECTICUT DEAD OF CANCER,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/06/nyregion/ex-gov-grasso-of-connecticut-dead-of-cancer.html,Former Gov Ella T Grasso of Connecticut the first woman to be elected governor in her own right in the United States died here today She was 61 years old Mrs Grasso who fell ill with cancer halfway through her second term was pronounced dead at 603 PM at Hartford Hospital After surgery for the removal of her ovaries and radiation treatments failed to stop the spread of cancer Mrs Grasso announced last Dec 4 that she would resign on New Years Eve and she was succeeded by William A ONeill the Lieutenant Governor Successor Issues Statement In a statement tonight Governor ONeill said We in Connecticut have been most fortunate to have known worked with and been the beneficiaries of all her good works throughout her lifetime She will not be replaced because she is irreplaceable nor will she ever be forgotten My own personal heart is breaking A statement by former President Jimmy Carter praised her truly outstanding service to the people of Connecticut the Democratic Party and the nation When she was elected Governor in 1974 Mrs Grasso drew national attention as being in the vanguard of a new era in politics But her popularity in Connecticut was as a protector of the status quo who ran the state with frugality and without an income tax For many voters her election marked the ascent to political power not of women but of Americans of Italian descent All my friends in the womens movement get angry at me for saying this Mrs Grasso said during her first term as Governor but I never thought that being a woman gave me any special political problems It was only when my friends from the foreign press in New York kept coming here and writing about me as a woman candidate that I began to think I was doing something unusual Although she was the first woman to be elected governor who was not the wife or widow of a governor her political path was not unusual And while she did not seek to change the nature or the direction of government she was a pioneer in the mid1970s in giving the public access to officials and records and in leading the states efforts to help the elderly and the retarded First elected to public office in 1954 Mrs Grasso was an old hand at operating within the Democratic Party and the established political system long before she became Governor A Traditionalist in Hartford For two terms in the United States House of Representatives Mrs Grasso was an advocate of liberal social programs and the spending of money to stimulate the economy but in Hartford she was a traditionalist That became more obvious and conspicuous in her as Governor said Joseph J Fauliso who was president pro tem of the State Senate during her tenure Her philosphy Mr Fauliso said was remarkable for being tenacious in the retention of values Moderate though she was she left her mark on state government As a State Representative from her native Windsor Locks she was a moving force in the successful drive to simplify state operations by eliminating an entire layer of government  the counties  a goal she adopted in her days in the League of Women VotersIn the late 1950s she was one of the architects of a new State Constitution which took effect in 1960 As Governor she created a stronger Department of Public Utilities Control championed a sunshine law that opened many functions of government to public scrutiny and reorganized the executive branch to make it more efficient A Period of Economic Growth She also kept state spending low in part by holding increases in welfare benefits well below the rate of inflation limiting aid to the cities and in a memorable political blunder in 1975 by laying off 500 state workers just before Christmas Partly because of a favorable tax structure Connecticut enjoyed relatively low unemployment and healthy economic growth under her stewardship Austere in her personal use of state money she scrapped the Governors limousine in favor of a standard cruiser of the state police and later a highmileage compact car In a state in which more than half the voters are Roman Catholic Mrs Grasso also left a mark of conservatism on the government choosing for example to prohibit the state financing of abortions under Medicaid I do not wish to be a party to killing the children of the poor she said a formulation that dismayed feminists She also consistently opposed the extension of legalized gambling an important source of state revenue One disappointment to those who saw her primarily as a woman was the small number of women she appointed to high positions Her appointments in fact also alienated oldline politicians Her explanation in an interview was that people expect skills Question of Modern Politics Purely political appointments of persons with no credit other than party affiliation are no longer part of our modern politics she said An aura of personal concern served Mrs Grasso well in two natural disasters during her governorship In February 1978 when austerity moves had lowered her popularity a paralyzing snowstorm hit the state Mrs Grasso rushed to the State Armory in Hartford walking the last mile after her car had bogged down in the snow and ordered that the whole state be closed for three days with cars banned from the roads while the snowplows did their work On that occasion and again when a tornado struck Windsor and Windsor Locks in October 1979 Mrs Grasso appeared on television and appealed for cooperation to alleviate the hardship The image of a compassionate Governor toiling long hours during the disaster did much to enhance her popularity Perhaps to remind herself of the importance of the snowstorm in defining her relationship with the people of the state Mrs Grasso framed and kept at her desk an aerial photograph taken at the time It was of a message written in footprints in the virgin snow on an open field It said Help  Ella A legislative aide from her Washington years remembered that when a constituent came in with a personal problem you almost got the impression you were talking to your mother someone who was generally concerned about the little things that were happening to you Were you out of a job Was your family OK But with her appointees she was tough and often profane and her staff sometimes gleefully recounted colorful tonguelashings administered to upperlevel state employees She was born Ella Rosa Giovianna Oliva Tambussi on May 10 1919 to Giacomo and Maria Oliva Tambussi who were immigrants from the Italian Piedmont As Governor Mrs Grasso referred often to the hardships of her childhood to make current difficulties seems small by comparison Once when a crowd of young reporters questioned her sharply about how people in Connecticut could endure the gasoline shortage of the summer of 1979 she replied You see its easier for me than it is for you I was a child of the Depression Mrs Grasso came from a family of modest circumstances in the tightly knit Italian community of Windsor Locks an old mill town Her mother was a great reader and her father a baker pretended he could read and write Mrs Grasso once told an interviewer It took me years to learn that youse is not the plural form of you  she said Elected to Phi Beta Kappa Her diction however was flawless with an almost patrician inflection acquired after years in exclusive schools which she attended on scholarships Mrs Grasso attended the Chaffee School a girls preparatory school in Windsor Locks that later merged with the Loomis School a similar institution for boys The Chaffee yearbook predicted that she would be the first woman to be mayor of Windsor Locks She went on to Mount Holyoke College majoring in sociology and economics and being elected to Phi Beta Kappa in her junior year To supplement her scholarship she worked as a baby sitter and a laboratory instructor in statistics She graduated magna cum laude in 1940 with a bachelor of arts degree and received her masters in 1942 Later that year she married Thomas Grasso a teacher and later school principal in East Hartford For three summers early in their marriage they owned and operated the New Colony Movie Theater in Old Lyme on the shore of Long Island Sound She sold the tickets in the box office and he collected them at the door Role in League of Women Voters Mr Grasso who retired while Mrs Grasso was Governor frequently escorted his wife to her political appearances During World War II Mrs Grasso became the states assistant director of research for the Federal War Manpower Commission In 1943 she joined the League of Women Voters and as a member she said she became acquainted with the issues facing the state I think that is why I went into government because I realized early on that if I was concerned with problems the best way of getting them solved was to be part of the decisionmaking process she said She went to work for the Democratic organization led by the late John M Bailey With his blessing she was elected to the states House of Representatives in 1952 and again in 1954 when she was made assistant leader of the badly outnumbered Democrats Was Guided by Bailey In the House she became a protegee of Mr Bailey According to politicians who knew them both Mr Bailey saw in Mrs Grasso a bright aggressive yet personable figure of tremendous appeal to voters as a woman and as a member of a rising ethnic group challenging the political supremacy of the incumbent Irish After four years in the House backing such projects as the elimination of counties reorganization of the court system and development of a state office of mental retardation Mrs Grasso was shepherded by Mr Bailey to the Democratic National Committee where she served for two years and then back to Connecticut as Secretary of the State traditionally a womans post Mrs Grasso turned the office into a peoples lobby for private citizens with problems Soon she was garnering more votes than the Governors who ran at the top of the ticket In the 12 years she spent in the Secretarys post Mrs Grasso was also active in party affairs reportedly sometimes writing Mr Baileys speeches She was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1968 where she pushed for a platform plank against the Vietnam War Mrs Grasso walked out of the convention hall in Chicago to protest what was viewed as police brutality against antiwar demonstrators In 1970 again with the backing of Mr Bailey she ran for Congress from the Sixth District when the incumbent Thomas J Meskill ran for Governor Despite a general defeat for the Democrats in Connecticut that year she won It was a job she took with some reluctance because it disrupted her personal life For two terms in Congress she flew home every weekend to her husband and two children James and Susane who lived at home Both children later became teachers But Mrs Grassos introduction to Washington was not typical of the women entering the House of Representatives in that period For most of them it was their first elective office said a legislative assistant to Mrs Grasso They were coming into politics either as a result of the feminist movement or for the Democrats opposition to Vietnam It was their baptism into politics but for her it was merely a continuation of something that had been going on for 20 years The aide added She was very much the oldschool politician In the House in Washington her main concern was the economic decline of New Britain Bristol Torrington and the other aging industrial cities of her district She voted for economicstimulus bills and as a member of the Education and Labor Committee she helped draft the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act But according to colleagues who knew her at the time Mrs Grasso was frustrated by the unwieldiness of the House She returned to Connecticut and sought John Baileys help in obtaining the nomination to run for Governor in 1974 Finding a Winner In choosing Mrs Grasso Mr Bailey felt he had found a winner And with Mr Baileys help Mrs Grasso reduced her main rival Robert K Killian to being a candidate for Lieutenant Governor The campaign against the Republican candidate Representative Robert H Steele had some ugly aspects Supporters of Mr Steele printed bumper stickers reading Connecticut Cant Afford a Governess and he tried unsuccessfully to paint Mrs Grasso as a closet advocate of a state income tax anathema in Connecticut She in turn campaigned on the contention that the Meskill administration had been lax in supervision of the electric utilities which had overcharged consumers 19 million in three years the Public Utilities Commission found Found the Cupboard Bare Mrs Grasso won the election with almost 60 percent of the vote but faced serious problems on assuming office She looked into the states cupboard and pronounced it bare In a harsh budget she broke a promise that she would pass all revenuesharing aid through to the towns and cut the welfare budget and laid off state employees She also earned the enmity of state employees by trying to extend their workweek That bruising fight ended in compromise but she lost in a battle to abolish the State Gaming Commission and to merge the War Veterans Fund with the General Fund Mr Bailey died early in Mrs Grassos term as Governor depriving her of a valuable ally in the battle to control the Democratic majority in the General Assembly She cut travel by state employees and told them to use postcards instead of letters and she even returned 7000 of her 42000ayear salary But her frugality in government programs including welfare and education earned her the hostility of many legislators Staff members argued that there was little choice Who would not have loved to do all the good things build all the buildings start all the programs said Aaron Ment her legal adviser in the first term But the mood of the state  with which she was always in tune supplemented by frequent office hours around the state  was not for spending Some Frustrating Fights There were frustrating political fights too In 1974 her campaign manager was Mr ONeill an East Hampton restaurateur who would succeed her as Governor but who at the time was assistant minority leader of the House After the election she made him party chairman but in the summer of 1976 she decided someone else could do it better and sought his ouster She failed in a demonstration of the power of small towns and suburbs in controlling the Democratic Party It was a difficult time politically for the Governor whose continuing opposition to tax reform prompted some liberal Democrats to explore alternative candidates Perhaps in a gesture of reconciliation she left the choice of Lieutenant Governor to the Democratic convention which picked her old friend and then enemy Mr ONeill Meanwhile the current Lieutenant Governor Mr Killian sought the nomination for Governor and a bitter primary campaign followed But despite the political troubles she trounced her opponents in the primary and in the November 1978 election She argued that she had kept the state solvent without recourse to an income tax and even made progress in some areas not requiring money For example she made Connecticut a leader in the public disclosure of officials assets and campaign financing and opening the meetings and records of government agencies By her second term Mrs Grasso had also acquired a national reputation Periodically she was mentioned as a potential Vice Presidential candidate The 29 other state governors of her party elected her chairman of the Democratic Governors Conference in July 1979 and she helped swing that organization to an endorsement of President Carter for renomination during a time when polls showed that Democrats nationwide and especially in Connecicut favored Senator Edward M Kennedy Her campaigning for President Carter however was curtailed by her illness With Mrs Grasso at her bedside at the time of her death according to a spokesman for Hartford Hospital James Battaglio were her husband her son and her daughter A funeral service for Mrs Grasso whose body will lie in state in the Capitol from 11 AM Sunday until 11 AM Monday will be held at St Josephs Cathedral in Hartford at noon on Monday Governor ONeill said he had ordered that all flags be flown at half staff until the interment and that state flags remain at half staff for 30 days The date and site of interment were not specified  Carter Expresses Sadness ATLANTA Feb 5 AP  Former President Jimmy Carters transition office issued the following statement from Mr Carter tonight on the death of Mrs Grasso I join the people of the State of Connecticut in expressing my sadness at the death of Gov Ella Grasso Governor Grasso had a long history of truly outstanding service to the people of Connecticut the Democratic Party and the nation Ella Grasso represented all that is good and promising about politics and public service As one of the most prominent women in this country she had great strength skill and when required toughness At the same time she was as loving and compassionate a person as I have known Her devotion to the less fortunate members of our society was untiring She faced death with the same courage she faced life Ella was my close friend and had my deepest respect and admiration I will miss her dearly Statement Issued by Carey ALBANY Feb 5 AP  Governor Carey in a statement issued tonight by his office praised Mrs Grasso as a determined and devoted governor Mr Careys statement said that Governor Grasso was guided by a single principle  to work for the people and to serve them with all her heart mind and spirit That the people of Connecticut loved her in return was unquestioned She never lost an election serving as a Congresswoman Secretary of State and finally Governor I worked with Governor Grasso in the Conference of Northeast Governors Mr Carey said and I knew her to be determined and devoted to the people she served I know I speak for New Yorkers when I say our neighbor to the east shall be missed
A DAY OF LOBBYING FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/06/style/a-day-of-lobbying-for-women-s-rights-issues.html,Mary Tyler Moore Gloria Steinem and Bella Abzug went to see Representative Thomas P ONeill Jr Speaker of the House Dr Benjamin Spock talked with Senator Ted Stevens Former Congresswoman Patsy Mink met with Senators Mark O Hatfield and Robert J Dole But it was easy for the famous few to get lost in the crowd as 3000 women along with the occasional man turned out yesterday for Womens Rights Day in Congress More than 80 national labor religious civil rights educational and other organizations sent members to join individuals who came to lobby their elected representatives in support of reproductive rights Social Security reform and a host of other concerns The diverse groups included the American Womens Clergy Association Catholics for a Free Choice the United Auto Workers Mormons for ERA the National Conference of Puerto Rican Women the National Council of Jewish Women and the American Association of University Women The days lobbyists also hoped to communicate a larger message There are those who say that the womens movement is dead said Representative Margaret Heckler Republican of Massachusetts in a welcoming address to the cheering throng We are here to prove that the womens movement is very much alive No one was denying that feminists were disheartened by the results of last Novembers election and apprehensive about the impact of a more conservative Congress on their objectives Many are particularly worried about the possibility of a constitutional amendment outlawing abortions the primary goal of antiabortion groups and one that is supported by President Reagan as well as by many new members of Congress In Very Serious Trouble Several versions of such an amendment have been introduced in the past but none has ever been voted on by the House or the Senate Some lawmakers are now vowing to bring the proposal to a vote and few womens rights leaders are sanguine about the results If that amendment ever reaches the floor of the House we will be in very serious trouble because I believe it will pass warned Representative Shirley Chisholm Democrat of Brooklyn at a midday rally The socalled Human Life Amendment HLA would define a fetus as a human being with full legal and civil rights from the moment of conception thereby making any woman who had an abortion liable to murder charges According to some opponents its effect could be even more profound The Human Life Amendment also outlaws the IUD and some forms of birth control pill which act upon the fertilized egg said Eleanor Smeal president of the National Organization for Women The issue of reproductive rights was a major focus of much of the days lobbying I had to come because the issue is so important to me said Terry Meister an electronics technician from State College Pa Its absolutely preposterous that the Government could be in my bedroom every night said Ida Castro a labor educator from New Brunswick NJ controlling the decisions I might make as to whether or not I want to have children and what kind of method I might want to use to control that choice She had come to express her opposition to the proposed constitutional amendment on abortion Other hearings addressed such topics as reproductive rights and the Social Security system which was assailed as sexbiased in testimony by Mrs Smeal Social Security has left our mothers in poverty she charged In 1979 the median Social Security benefit for all women over age 65 was 2813 compared to 5479 for men over age 65 Representative Mary Rose Oakar Democrat of Ohio among others pointed out that almost threequarters of the elderly poor in America are women and that the majority of single older women receiving Social Security have no other major source of income She said that the failure of the Social Security system to meet the most basic needs of women constitutes nothing less than a national scandal Many activists are particularly worried about the impact of the new Administrations proposed budget cuts on women who constitute the fastestgrowing poverty group in America according to Representative Pat Schroeder Democrat of Denver Mrs Smeal added There are women out there right this minute choosing between food and heating oil and some will die from those choices Participants in the lobbying day hoped to demonstrate an undiminished commitment to womens rights issues Some sought to portray conservative gains as an anomaly rather than the will of the majority The ultraright wing has taken over the White House but every one of our issues is supported by a majority of men and women in this country said Gloria Steinem No Firm Pledge of Support After seeing their elected representatives some of the women were unhappy about what they had heard Carol Grossman president of the Womens Equity Action League reported that a meeting with Senator Stevens of Alaska on abortion rights had failed to elicit a firm pledge of support The Senator said that while he has not favored a constitutional amendment banning abortions in the past he is now more concerned about the dangers of a constitutional convention which would address a more wideranging array of issues she said And he said that to take the pressure off the call for a constitutional convention Congress may have to release some pending constitutional amendments such as the HLA A spokesman from Senator Stevenss office confirmed the report While many womens rights leaders were happy about the turnout for their lobbying day which was twice as large as expected most were more concerned about a longterm response with many calling for women to concentrate on

THUNDER FROM THE RIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/08/magazine/thunder-from-the-right.html,OPENER Peter Ross Range is a freelance writer based in Washington By Peter Ross Range carcely three hours after Ronald Reagan took the oath of office at his Inauguration Jesse A Helms the conservative Republican from North Carolina took the floor of the Senate to oppose confirmation of Caspar Weinberger as the new Presidents Secretary of Defense Helms  tall stoopshouldered owlish behind his hornrimmed glasses spoke for 40 minutes against the nomination concluding Mr Weinberger is not  prepared to make the clean break with the very policies  which have managed our military and international decline Weinberger was confirmed that day by a 972 vote with only Helms and his new Senate protege John East also from North Carolina in opposition The dissenting vote was Jesse Helmss Inauguration Day signal that he would oppose the new President he had helped elect on any deviation from the pure gospel of conservativism that has been the Helms hallmark since he first entered the Senate eight years ago If Helmss views had not changed in those eight years many other things had When he came to Washington eight years ago the lanky legislator was regarded as a political Quixote tilting at the windmills of change He thundered apocalyptic imprecations against everything from Big Government to the alien forces he felt were threatening America with moral decay economic doom and military disaster Even his supporters on the conservative right called him whimsically our Horatius at the bridge Helms compared himself to the wellmeaning Dutch boy who plugged the dike with his thumb There have been a lot of holes to plug said Helms at the end of the 96th Congress in December Now in the opening days of the 97th Congress all that has changed Helms possesses the asset most honored in Washington clout The Republicans majority status in the Senate handed him the powerful post of chairman of the Agriculture Committee from which position he plans an allout assault on the 11 billion foodstamp program Both his views and his new power have served to annoint him as the spiritual leader of the new bloc of ultraconservatives in Congress who are convinced that their day is only beginning to dawn Conservatives used to believe their job was to lose as slowly as possible says Howard Phillips another Helms protege and founder of the Conservative Caucus I dont just want to slow the train down I want to put it on another track The conservative rerouting of the political railroad has been in planning for at least five years Says Phillips We knew if we followed the plan we would be able to take over one house of Congress by 1980  but  and this shows how doctrinaire the New Right is  we dont have the White House yet Ronald Reagan is not conservative enough The GOP sweep in November elected l6 new Republican senators giving the party a majority in one branch of Congress for the first time since 1955 Yet it is clear that a rightwing hard core of some 15 senators led by Helms and Senator James McClure of Idaho will resist any modification of principle They are bound by broad agreement on the socalled profamily issues  antiabortion antiequalrights amendment antibusing proprayer in the schools  and a freemarket conservatism on economic issues They favor limited Government spending on social programs but more for defense They share a hawkish view of the world that favors a more assertive resistance to Soviet expansion and accepts limited humanrights abuses in the interest of supporting staunch military allies At least five of the freshman Republican senators are natural recruits to the HelmsMcClure faction many others such as Alfonse DAmato of New York and Dan Quayle of Indiana are much closer to Helms than to such Republican liberals as Charles Percy of Illinois or Charles Mathias of Maryland They will often join the right wing in issueoriented coalitions also supported by such incumbent Republicans as Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and John Tower of Texas who have now assumed powerful committee chairmanships On many votes the Helms faction can also count on sympathetic Southern Democrats who have always felt more comfortable voting with Republicans on military and social issues than with the liberal leadership of their own party Thus the hardcore of ideological conservatives around Helms and McClure are the energizing nub of a powerful coalition that can attempt to dominate domestic issues and fashion foreign policy Paradoxically this new alignment leaves President Reagan  the darling of the conservatives for almost two decades  in the unusual position of possibly facing a more damaging challenge to his leadership from the Republican right wing than anything the Democratic liberals can muster at this time Thus while only Helms and his North Carolina colleague would cast votes against an important Reagan appointment on the new Administrations first day in office the potential for defiance from the right might dog President Reagans efforts and those of the GOP to expand on the November victory and build a new political consensus in the nation The most interesting battles on the national political stage in the coming year may be between a moderating Republican President and the truebelievers on his right It will surely test the mediating skills of Tennessees Howard Baker the new Senate majority leader and GOP whip Ted Stevens of Alaska to keep the Republicans sixvote Senate majority in working order Helmss senatorial colleagues admit that part of his power lies in his freewheeling attitude toward mainstream Republicanism Sometimes its an asset that he is somewhat independent of the party says Senator McClure This independence is partly explained by the unorthodox course of the l980 Republican campaign The Republican National Committee worked brilliantly at times to orchestrate party politics from the grass roots up At the same time largely distinct from party efforts a shadow campaign was being waged nationally and locally by conservative groups They were organized into an effective alliance by television evangelists pushing moral issues such as righttolife and prayer in the classroom and by the men who have constructed an extrapolitical network of computerized mailing lists to galvanize conservative support nationally and locally By integrating these forces a new conservative coalition emerged that overcame historic regional differences linking Washingtonhaters in the Southern Bible Belt with the Middle Western Farm Belt and the Sagebrush Rebellion of the West They received political guidance through the medium of a postman or a preacher instead of a precinct captain It worked like a welloiled machine but not as a political machine with traditional party loyalties This represented a historic upheaval in American politics There were two things that hit us Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York said after the election First was money money money money  Then there was  organization and technology  We are so far behind that we  are in danger of becoming the permanent minority party Because of the New Rights relative independence of party  its hardline conservatives form a minority within the majority in the Senate  it can even bypass Continued onb Page 64 First Jump Barry Goldwater as an oldschool elder statesman This maverick style is what permits the new conservatives to take such extreme positions declaring holy wars rather than working within the known rules of political pragmatism A case in point is their attitude toward the Family Protection Act introduced last year by Republican Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada The bill condemned homosexuals prohibited information on contraception for unwed minors attacked sex intermingling in sports and other school activities removed Federal laws concerning wifeandchild abuse and generally reinstated the traditional role of women in society Paul Weyrich director of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress one of the rights most extreme yet bestorganized Washingtonbased directmail groups called Laxalts measure the most significant battle of the ageold conflict between good and evil between the forces of God and forces against God Ira Glasser national director of the American Civil Liberties Union labels the swift and sudden rise of the new evangelical groups  a grave threat to traditional civil liberties Former Senator George McGovern defeated by New Right fundraising and propaganda expertise wrote before the election Their zealotry selfrighteousness and vindictiveness  connote something radically different from the authentic conservatism of say Robert Taft or Senator Goldwater While Barry Goldwater often votes with the New Right he too regards some of its religiously committed leaders with suspicion Like less dogmatic conservatives and indeed most other Republicans Goldwater agrees with many New Right goals less social spending and heavier defense budgets less Government interference with business and more industrial freedom from environmental restrictions less school busing and fewer racial quotas in jobs and education Yet the aging Republican leader rejects the intransigence of the New Right If they disagree with you one bit youre a nogood SOB After the election Goldwater asked acerbically Who the hell is the New Right anyway Who is Paul Weyrich Hes not a leader of the Republican Party Neither for that matter is Jesse Helms  in his heart Helms and guys like Thurmond and East they are old Dixiecrats points out one Western conservative He descends from the William Jennings Bryan wing of the Democratic Party says a Goldwaterite with ties to the ReaganBush ticket in 1980 On some things hes not even a conservative How can a conservative even imagine passing laws on your private life  like abortion and prayer Today ideological labels can be as misleading as party affiliation in identifying loyalties The conservative tide running swift and strong comprises several splayed forces all of whose power centers have some claim to sharing in Reagans triumph There is the old Republican establishment tied to the GOPs traditional financial constituencies and shibboleths Then there is the Old Right strongly antiCommunist and states rights oriented and the neoconservative wing which prides itself on its intellectual leadership and which has attracted prominent Democrats like Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Henry Scoop Jackson of Washington As majority leader Howard Baker a moderate faces a difficult task balancing the factions now taking shape in the new Senate The heady unaccustomed power of majority control has sharpened differences between the hardcore Republican conservatives 11 Westerners four Southerners and one New Englander and the more moderate elements Some 15 other Republicans are firmly conservative but less doctrinaire than the far right They include the Armed Services Committee chairman John Tower Virginias John Warner New Mexicos Pete Domenici and Floridas freshman Senator Paula Hawkins who opposes the equalrights amendment The small Republican liberal wing includes the new Foreign Relations Committee chairman Charles Percy Oregons dovish Mark Hatfield and the outspoken Senator Lowell Weicker of Connecticut who vehemently opposed Alexander Haigs appointment as Secretary of State This leaves an unimposing middle ground of perhaps a dozen Senators for Baker and Stevens to count on as a moderate base in any floor fight This group includes Robert Packwood of Oregon Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas John Chafee of Rhode Island and such newcomers as Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Warren Rudman of New Hampshire Since Jesse Helms met Ronald Reagan in the early 1970s he has ardently supported the Californians Presidential aspirations Helms and his political sidekick Thomas F Ellis a North Carolina attorney helped revive Mr Reagans flagging 1976 bid for the nomination by orchestrating his upset primary victory in their home state over Gerald Ford In 1980 Helms campaigned in 22 states for Mr Reagan and other GOP candidates and his unique political machine the Congressional Club of North Carolina raised an astonishing 4 million nationwide for the Republican standardbearer In person Helms is a courtly charmer with the Southern gift of hyperbolic gab He calls the Presidents wife Miss Nancy and tells the homeliest page in a Senate elevator that she is the finest beauty in the land He drags total strangers onto the reserved seats in the Senate subway and invites liberal reporters to lunch in the Senate dining room Helms has impeccable moral credentials  the Rev Jerry Falwell says If I knew Senator Helms would take care of my family I could die happy Although he controls a total of about 50 jobs on his personal staffs in Washington and Raleigh neither office has a black employee despite North Carolinas 22 percent black population Yet Helmss staff is known for giving excellent and impartial constituent services Jesse is sui generis explains Democratic Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin who opposes most of Helmss positions I hate to compare anybody to my predecessor Joe McCarthy but in a sense Jesse is like McCarthy He is a force unto himself With the new expansion of the Senates right wing Helms is now a good deal more than the oneman show he has been since coming to the Senate in 1972 Helms and McClure also elected in 1972 are the senior members of the Senates New Right They were joined in 1974 by Paul Laxalt former Governor of Nevada who was Ronald Reagans campaign chairman today he is considered President Reagans point man on Capitol Hill where his influence rivals that of the majority leader Howard Baker Jake Garn a conservative Mormon and former Mayor of Salt Lake City was also elected in 1974 to be joined two years later by Orrin Hatch a youthful mirthless Mormon lawyer from Utah new to politics The Wyoming rancher Malcolm Wallop a poloplaying millionaire and Harrison Schmitt New Mexicos astronautgeologist were elected in 1976 too forming a small coterie of conservative Westerners whom McClure and Nebraskas Carl Curtis organized into a conservative strategy group called the Senate Steering Committee which meets over lunch every Wednesday usually in a Senate dining room Because it refuses to release a membership list Democratic Senator Robert C Byrd of West Virginia once bitterly labeled the committee a shadowy and mysterious body second jump The ultraconservatives gained more senatorial ground in 1978 William Armstrong a radiostation executive was elected from Colorado an Iowa businessman Roger Jepsen and a New Hampshire airline pilot Gordon Humphrey became the first Senators who won seats with the backing of the newly organized highly doctrinaire politicalaction committees But 1980 was the breakthrough year Aided by a Reagan bandwagon and a rightwing hit list funded by such organizations as the National Conservative Political Action Commitknown as Nickpack and Helmss Congressional Club five New Right conservatives were added to the Senate John East is a college professor from eastern North Carolina whose election campaign was managed out of the Congressional Clubs offices East is so conservative that Helms likes to joke that Im now the liberal Senator from North Carolina Senate observers expect East who never held political public office before to function almost as Helmss political clone Jeremiah Denton of Alabama a former prisoner of war in Vietnam also ran at Helmss urging Helms spoke several times in Alabama and the Congressional Club sent campaign funds Denton had clearly established his conservative credentials when he founded the antiadultery antipornography Crusade for Decency Denton today is strategically placed on the Judiciary Committee now chaired by Strom Thurmond Thurmond named Denton chairman of the newly created Subcommittee on Security and Terrorism the linear descendant of the Internal Security Subcommittee Joseph McCarthy used for his Communisthunting hearings in the 1950s Denton vows he is not reviving the spirit of McCarthyism but he is buttressed on the right side of the committee bench by John East and Orrin Hatch Steven Symmss victory over the liberal Frank Church in Idaho was one of the most bitter battles of the 1980 elections Even Jesse Helms described the tactics used to bolster Symmss campaign as cuttin and slashin During four terms as a Congressman Symms earned 100 percent ratings from several conservative lobbying groups and 10 percent from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action Symms was Helmss House counterpart in introducing the bill for an antiabortion amendment Charles E Grassley ousted the liberal John Culver in Iowa in another vitriolic campaign that was heavily supported by the National Conservative Political Action Committee A farmer from the most conservative part of the state Grassley had spent six years in the House compiling by far the most conservative record in the Iowa delegation Following in the footsteps of his predecessor HR Gross for 26 years the leading curmudgeon in the lower house Grassley manifested a conservatism that even led him to such diehard symbolic stands as voting against a Congressional pay raise Don Nickles a prosperous smalltown Oklahoma businessman stepped into the vacancy created by the retirement of Henry Bellmon to become at 32 the youngest member of the Senate Nickles is a classic New Right creation He attended the conservative candidates school run every six weeks in Washington by Paul Weyrichs Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress Seizing upon the profamily issues of abortion busing and prayer in the schools Nickles had Moral Majority support in a campaign that seemed to oppose almost everything During the primary campaign The Tulsa World wrote It is difficult to tell whether Don Nickles is running against  his Republican opponent Democratic President Jimmy Carter the Federal Government or the alphabet Im against the DOE HEW HUD EPA and OSHA Nickles tells audiences What distinguishes the New Right from the Old Right besides age is the tendency of the younger conservatives to work as a group drawing on their new network of rightwing lobbies They have introduced a new cohesion into conservative politics The New Rights strength was first evident on the day Senate Republicans chose their new leadership before Christmas Moderates Baker and Stevens were reelected to the top leadership positions as expected Then came the vote for the thirdranking position chairman of the Republican Conference which functions as the partys coordinating machine The mainstream candidate was H John Heinz 3d a wealthy Pennsylvanian regarded as a moderate by most but as a flaming liberal by party enemies on the right The Steering Committee the New Rights high command in the Senate put forward McClure and mobilized sufficient support from other factions to defeat Heinz 3320 This gave the right wing only a few years ago an intramural debating society countable on one hand a solid foothold in the Senate leadership With the retirement of Carl Curtis in 1978 McClure had become the Steering Committees chairman and Helms its vice chairman After McClure became conference chairman in December Helms took over the Steering Committee Although both are in their 50s they are a decade or so older than most other committee members The group as a whole is marked by boundless activism and determination to get things done and its members intend nothing less than to take over the Senate the House and the White House The New Right  and to an extent were like Communists in this  feels victory is inevitable says Paul Weyrich In 1975 shortly after the 1974 midterm elections Jesse Helms formulated a plan in a speech to the American Conservative Union Convention First he drew lessons from postWatergate Republican losses and 1974s abysmal 38 percent voter turnout He targeted the nonvoting 62 percent of the electorate as a kind of silent majority  he called them the conservative majority  who had only to be politicized to put the country into the hands of the right people He had flirted with the idea of founding a third party but finally opted for operating as a conservative movement affiliated with the Republican Party In his 1975 speech Helms prescribed organizing the waiting conservative masses district by district and inviting in groups not presently part of the political process a harbinger of such phenomena as the Moral Majority As Howard Phillips puts it Since Washington tends to maximize the power of the liberals we had to move the battleground  We were shifting from the politics of celebrities to the politics of issues In short let the hopelessly liberal media focus on the nations capital while the conservatives mobilize voters in the heartland THIRD JUMP Another development of the mid1970s was the emergence of politicalaction groups dedicated to replacing liberals with conservatives The Conservative Caucus for instance was born in a memorandum written to Jesse Helms by a political aide South Carolinian John Carbaugh Howard Phillips then working in Helmss office became its director At about the same time two disillusioned young political organizers John T Terry Dolan and Charles Black approached Helms with a concept for a national conservative campaignfinancing organization Helms sent a confidential memo to key people on the right and Nickpack was born In 1980 Nickpack was the organizing force that helped defeat four liberal Democratic Senators Birch Bayh John Culver Frank Church and George McGovern It was a moment of supreme victory for the Quixote of the Carolina Piedmont Fighting the archenemy of liberalism has been the crusade waged by Jesse Helms for all of his political life The son of a fireandpolice chief with a thirdgrade education Helms was raised in tiny Monroe NC 23 miles southeast of Charlotte His first serious political experience came during the notorious 1950 Senate election generally regarded as the dirtiest in North Carolina history Helms a young radio newsman did publicity for the conservative lawyer Willis Smith who ran against Dr Frank Porter Graham president of the liberal University of North Carolina In a fourweek Democratic runoff campaign still remembered in the state for its hate literature and racist tone Graham was portrayed as a Communist sympathizer and an integrationist One flier signed by a Know the Truth Committee exhorted WHITE PEOPLE WAKE UP It conjured scenes of Negroes working beside you your wife and daughters in your mills and factories It announced Frank Graham favors mingling of the races The leaflet endorsed Willis Smith He will uphold the traditions of the South The virulent campaign included newspaper ads playing to Southern paranoia The South Under Attack and radio spots stirring racial fears Do you know that 28 percent of North Carolinas population is colored The mob mood that was built up in the final days of the campaign was not unlike that preceding a lynching wrote the political scientist Samuel Lubell in The Future of American Politics Graham lost by 18000 votes with at least 18 counties that had previously supported him reversing their vote The election brought Helms together with another smart young conservative Tom Ellis a Raleigh attorney who today runs the Congressional Club and acts as Helmss political alter ego Helms served as a Senate aide to Smith until the Senator died in office in 1953 After several years as director of the North Carolina Bankers Association in Raleigh and a term on the City Council Helms bought a part interest in a conservative Raleigh television station becoming its first oncamera editorialist His fiveminute commentaries were called The Voice of Free Enterprise in RaleighDurham During the civilrights era Helms called it the civilrights uproar Helms made a reputation for himself by opposing everything the civilrights movement stood for leading what The Charlotte Observer called the rearguard action against racial equality Helmss 2700 editorials over the next 12 years made him a hero with conservatives in the villages and farming communities Helmss invective against restless Negroes and college students who indulged in riotous weekends at beaches in Florida  where orgies and mayhem are highly advertised was also carried over the 70 stations of the Tobacco Radio Network and reprinted in more than 50 smalltown newspapers At a time when many Southern whites were outraged by the sight of young blacks blocking streets in demonstrations and sitting in at lunch counters Helms encouraged resistance to change Recurring themes in his editorials were the pending apocalypse and the immorality of blacks While the Southern white constabulary was routinely mistreating and sometimes condoning the killing of blacks he contributed to further inflaming racial feelings by accusing the Rev Martin Luther King Jr of holding himself above the law Crime rates and irresponsibility among Negroes are facts of life which must be faced he said Editorials also appeared under Helmss byline in The Citizen the magazine of the Citizens Councils of America based in Jackson Miss which called Helms our favorite media master The November 1967 issue of The Citizen carried a Helms commentary which attacked the civilrights movement and outbreaks of racial street violence by asking Is survival possible when civilization reverts to the law of the jungle  The question grows more ominous by the day The hour approaches when we must decide whether we will be ruled by sanity or ruined by savagery Race however was not Helmss sole preoccupation As the voice of free enterprise he inveighed against labor unions Social Security Medicare the Rural Electrification Authority the League of Women Voters the 18yearold vote Nixons China opening Kissingers detente with Moscow the United Nations and farm subsidies Although opposed to more than he favored Helms once wrote in support of private schools so that political sociologists  would forever be unable to dictate terms and procedures for the people of America regarding their schools None of this seemed to hurt Helms when he became a Republican convert in 1970 after 28 years as a Democrat and forsook the airwaves for politics in 1972 I saw it he says as a chance to carry the freeenterprise message across the state Helms won with 54 percent of the vote possibly the first oncamera personality to ride television into the Senate Besides benefiting from Richard Nixons extraordinary 1972 coattails Helms successfully linked his opponent Congressman Nick Galifianakis the son of Greek immigrants with the unpopular Democratic Presidential nominee by erecting several huge billboards that read McGovernGalifianakis the two names run together as one His slogan Jesse Helms Hes one of us During his first term as Senator Helms concentrated on the emotional issues of school desegregation forced busing abortion prayer in the schools voluntary prayer and excessive Government spending He made a career of losing on principle almost any 991 Senate vote since 1972 has Helms casting that sole dissenting vote The Raleigh News and Observer named him Senator No Helms modeled himself on the late Alabama Senator James Allen by becoming a master of parliamentary procedure and one of the Senates most skillful obstructionists He spent more than 100 hours in the chair presiding over the Senate is considered an onerous chore by most senators during each of his first two years becoming the first Republican to win two Golden Gavel awards Helmss 1978 reelection campaign was launched in 1976 by his close political associate Thomas Ellis who ran the North Carolina Congressional Club Founded after Helmss 1972 campaign as a fundraising device to pay off campaign debts the club has since shed North Carolina from its name and become an impressive national political propaganda operation built around directmail computerization which enables conservatives to get their message to the voters minus the critical filter of the mass media It also generates enormous amounts of money  7 million for Helmss 1978 reelection race the largest sum ever spent for a Senate election most of it from outside North Carolina Concentrating on television commercials Helms outspent his weak Democratic opponent by 30 to 1 and won with 56 percent of the vote Even today the Congressional Club is operating at a high pitch perhaps in preparation for the 1984 reelection campaign when Helms is expected to face tough opposition from popular Democratic Governor James Hunt In 1980 the Club enlisted John East a conservative college professor who had never held political office he scored an upset victory in the Senate race over the Democratic incumbent Robert Morgan Easts campaign concentrated on television commercials which dwelt relentlessly on such supposed Morgan sins as the Panama Canal giveaway and the Senators position on the Occupational Health and Safety Act stances which Morgan claimed on the floor of the Senate were gross distortions of his record The East campaign which took some pains to avoid showing that he was in a wheelchair constantly featured an eightyearold photograph of his opponent Morgan with liberal Senators George McGovern and Edward M Kennedy It suggested by association that Morgan considered by many the most conservative Democrat Senator was in fact a liberal East was elected by a squeaker margin of 6700 votes Helmss role in the Senate serves a number of political purposes If Helms stakes an ultraconservative position remarks one conservative Senators aide that draws the whole spectrum to the right Helms is like a kind of insurance You might have a burglar alarm that goes off too often But at least it works when you need it Even Helmss ideological ally James McClure admits that There are times when whether its liberal Howard Metzenbaum or Jesse Helms you wish they werent out there playing their own game But you have to have the radicals of the left and the right so youll know where the center is So one of Helmss obvious roles in the New Right is to set what the columnist George Will calls the outer limit of conservative activism Helmss hand is also felt on foreignpolicy issues especially in Latin America and Africa It is in the third world that Helms sees creeping Communism presenting the gravest peril to American survival He unleashes his welltraveled aides James Lucier John Carbaugh and Richard McCormack as watchdogs of international conservatism wherever he feels Western interests are threatened This has meant lending support to the whiteminority regimes in South Africa Namibia SouthWest Africa and in Rhodesia before it became Zimbabwe Helms calls them the only footholds we had left in Africa against Communism Does he see Zimbabwe as merely a pawn in the EastWest game Right he replies Latin America too Right Any hope today for Zimbabwe We just talked Rhodesia into Page 84 the garbage dump That countrys gone Helms created an international incident in 1979 when he sent Carbaugh and Lucier to London to monitor the talks that led to the transfer of power from Ian Smiths regime to the black leader Robert Mugabe Helmss aides were accused of disrupting the negotiations by trying to give support to Smith and his black surrogate Bishop Abel Muzorewa Secretary of State Cyrus Vance stormed to Capitol Hill to lodge a protest with Frank Church chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the only time Ive ever seen Cy Vance truly angry said one person present Vance claimed that the

lained of interference by Lucier and Carbaugh which perhaps was an overstatement Helms though was prepared I called Maggie Thatcher She didnt know anything about it Jesses got his own foreign policy is how Wisconsins William Proxmire sums it up Though Helms had virtually never been abroad before joining the Senate in 1972 and has never traveled with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee since joining it two years ago he is now in a position to make his antiCommunist foreignpolicy views felt In the new Congress he has been named chairman of the Subcommittee for Hemispheric Affairs because he says If we dont start getting things straight with our own hemisphere starting with Canada Mexico and all the way south our own stability is in jeopardy Helms occasionally travels abroad at the expense of one of the four educational taxfree institutes his aides have founded in Washington Most of these trips have been to conservative countries like Taiwan or to those with rightwing military dictatorships such as Brazil Chile Argentina and Uruguay During such visits Helms operates independently of the American Embassy except for a courtesy call on the way out of town He collects data in support of the rightwing cause or to discredit such deposed  or assassinated  socialists as Salvador Allende of Chile He was a moral bum says Helms He ruined the country its economy He kept a mistress out at a country place Helms is known for having his own pipelines independent of other members of the Foreign Relations Committee to hawkish dissenters at the Defense Department and the CIA who keep him abreast of creeping moderation in the nationalsecurity establishment Sometimes the committee would meet in executive session for a topsecret briefing remembers one person present and you could tell Helms already knew the stuff It was embarrassing No matter what the issue one is almost certain to find the hand of the far rights Horatius stirring things up Hes the Ted Kennedy of the right says one detractor who nonetheless admires his political skill He gets into everything If the 1980 election was Jesse Helmss personal moment of triumph after years as a senatorial lone wolf and if the New Right generally saw it as a turning point 1981 has already had its disappointments The unswerving HelmsMcClure faction was outraged when Ronald Reagan appointed a Cabinet that only partially fulfilled conservative hopes David Stockman at the Office of Management and Budget John Edwards as dismantler of the Department of Energy James Watt as an Interior Secretary who regards many environmentalists as obstructionists General Haig at State and the Democratic neoconservative Jeane Kirkpatrick at the United Nations these were their kind of people But managerial wizard Weinberger at Defense former Wall Street broker Donald Regan at Treasury especially Terrel Bell at Education where he was making noises about maybe not abolishing the department  these were disappointments The conservatives have ways beyond opposing appointees to hold Ronald Reagans feet to the fire For example Helms constantly invokes Mr Reagans name to hold him to issues the new President may now want to avoid On the day Helms reintroduced his bill for a constitutional amendment banning abortion he told a cheering righttolife assemblage If I know Ronald Reagan hes not backing down And for what its worth neither is Jesse Helms Mr Reagan who showed himself through his appointments to be a more pragmatic compromiser than some conservatives had expected may not see it this way There isnt going to be an abortion amendment and Helms knows it explains one activist in the ReaganBush campaign Youd see lawlessness in this country to make Prohibition look like a picnic Sensing their slippage Helmss forces fought back Again there was talk of running him for Vice President in 1984 a reminder to George Bush to eschew the politics of his Eastern Establishment past This VicePresidential threat is the same tactic used to force Bushs endorsement of the hardline 1980 party platform which Helms and his allies wrote and about which Helms says he got 99 percent of what I wanted The New Rights anxiety in the formative days of the Reagan Administration may ultimately be justified by events over the coming months as the White House lines up priorities and attempts to chart a course for the nation If the records of Helms and other New Rightists are a guide they will not be content with political symbolism They insist on basic changes on the critical domestic and foreignpolicy issues that have carried them to the Senate They are convinced that the political tide is still surging to the right and they are prepared and encouraged to use the 1982 and 1984 elections to test their principles against the voices of moderation and compromise Jesse Helms as always has no doubts about it,,

TV: 'THE CHOICE' ON CBS FOCUSES ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/10/arts/tv-the-choice-on-cbs-focuses-on-abortion.html,THE subject is abortion It is being considered by a 20yearold college student who doesnt want her pregnancy to interfere with her fiances career opportunities Her 38yearold mother on the other hand finds herself unexpectedly pregnant at a point when her husband is burdened enough with assorted midlife crises Decisions decisions If this sounds like the very stuff of soap opera The Choice on CBSTV at 9 oclock tonight contains a few surprises for the patient viewer Dennis Nemecs script while clearly on the abortionrights side of things is mercifully low on easy smug generalizations Room is made for serious questions and lingering doubts Fortunately for all concerned the pregnancies of mother and daughter do not coincide Not wanting to tell her boyfriend the young woman goes home for advice Its only then that she learns about her mothers experience a year earlier The older womans story told in flashback accounts for more than threequarters of the film Kay Susan Clark who has no regrets about her marriage to Jerry Mitchell Ryan has found a job that she likes and he quitely resents He is bored with his own job as his future at the bank depends on waiting for the next guy to retire When the next guys job goes to a younger employee Jerry is forced to settle for nothing new nothing different  thats it Needing reassurances Jerry lets his eye wander to a young female coworker Meanwhile Kay not revealing her pregnancy begins visiting counseling agencies One abortion adviser turns out to be an antiabortion operation complete with horror pictures of the killed fetus At the legitimate abortion clinic Kay finds young girls who seem to think that the wrenching process is no more consequential than having ones teeth cleaned Later she will meet a young wife who desperately wants a child but because her fetus is diagnosed as carrying Downs Syndrome is reluctantly undergoing an artificially induced and painful abortion Most of the difficult bases of the subject are touched with care and compassion The final message is that only the pregnant woman can decide Kay tells her daughter I knew what was right for me You have to make your own choice Under the direction of David Greene the production has the added asset of several nicely restrained performances Miss Clark and Mr Ryan are especially effective More than anything else The Choice manages to avoid the familiar televisionmovie trap of easy or sensational exploitation

BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Books Of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/11/books/books-of-the-times-books-of-the-times.html,By John Leonard IDLE HANDS By William ORourke 435 pages Delacorte 1295 IDLE HANDS purports to be the sexual memoirs of a young man from 1965 when he is a 20yearold virgin until the Bicentennial when he is an exhausted 31 Andy Orr  the name sounds like an undiscovered manuscript by Kierkegaard  describes himself as short average lowermiddleclass Midwestern lacking drama or glamour possessed of the type of shyness I often mistake for good taste incapable of holding a grudge or of hitting anyone who is weaker than I am civilized although antiintellectual handicapped by his sincerity and very deprived Andys problem he thinks is that he wants women and women dont want him even though he spends half of his time listening to them talk We follow him around  from Missouri to New Mexico to Cape Cod to New York City and back again  for more than 400 pages hoping to be dazzled into sentience as if he were a Woody Allen inside of whom a Jerzy Kosinski character is trying desperately to escape complete with a polo pony a camera and a pair of skis High Level of Energy In the course of his travels he beds 15yearolds divorcees television journalists prelaw students clinical psychologists magazine art directors playwrights and old friends It is difficult to imagine how he finds the time or summons the energy since he is simultaneously toiling in a fish factory constructing Fiberglas stage sets standing in line for unemployment compensation going to the movies and writing a couple of plays himself one of which is produced Off Broadway and sounds dreadful Each of his sexual encounters is recalled in excruciating detail with the humor held to a minimum as we wade through the flora and fauna and sink in the swamp gas as if JeanJacques Rousseau had joined Frank Harris in a search for Henry Miller and found themselves trapped in a novel by an Upper West Side feminist Andy indeed is hard on feminists It is his firm conviction that women enjoy refusal All empirical evidence he tells us keeps affirming the fact that women consent perhaps it is changed for the young going through puberty now but I was always in a state of wanting and women were in the position of denying By the time he tells us this even Andy has to admit that I had spilled enough sperm to fertilize every woman in the state of Rhode Island He must have some other problem In between the sexual encounters which tend to emphasize fellatio Andy forms opinions Andy has more opinions than a book reviewer I wish these opinions had been somehow amalgamated into the sexual encounters show please do not tell  and that they were as interesting as the opinions of say Stendhal Nevertheless Andy sermonizes on Kansas Vietnam homosexuality the womens movement memory abortion the postwar baby boom the olfactory organ and pantyhose sausage casing Some of this sermonizing and several of the sexual encounters partake of wisdom and hilarity William ORourke after all is a shrewd and witty writer the author of one excellent nonfiction book The Harrisburg 7 and the New Catholic Left and one previous novel The Meekness of Isaac which was likeable and chilling at the same time He can leap from poetry to derision in a single paragraph Cape Cod he says is rich in highlytrained observers and so is Idle Hands For instance Women do elect object status when they first apply makeup And Monica saw more doctors yearly than many underdeveloped countries have And Men always boil more water than they need Women boil just the right amount Moreover his accounts of real work working with ones hands  are true and stinging And he can be effortlessly funny as in the screenplay he proposes for a television series called The Adjustors about a team of insurance investigators dealing with a wayward bulldozer Other Thoughts On the other hand we are asked to contemplate such thoughts as these Regret is an odd emotion because it comes only upon reflection Regret lacks immediacy and so its power seldom influences events when it could do some good This is making the obvious less obscure Too many of the sex scenes read like bad Philip Roth and too many of the women involved  of every ethnic group as if Andys bedroom were a foxhole in an old World War II movie  seem lists of ingredients full of smart chitchat instead of people with more than one dimension Andy ultimately asks himself after all these women Whom had I influenced changed enlarged One calculation I hestiated to total Yes there doesnt seem to be a total bar on his adding machine And what after 11 years of rabbitrunning has he learned Ive certainly learned that women are not drawn by the fact that a man desires them In other words he has learned nothing I take this to be Mr ORourkes point Andy is the ultimate tourist passing through the 1960s and 1970s with desire as his credit card oddly detached from serious politics and the threat of love almost parasitic In which case Idle Hands is a morality tale I certainly hope so
Mr. Schweiker's Bad Idea,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/12/opinion/mr-schweiker-s-bad-idea.html,It is particularly disheartening to find the very people who most abhor abortion also opposing any effort to provide contraceptives and family planning guidance to the poor If they really want to reduce the incidence of abortion why resist programs that help to avoid pregnancy in the first place The Federal Government has been spending about 250 million a year to counsel and assist 15 million unwed teenagers But the man now charged with administering these programs  Secretary Schweiker of Health and Human Services  says he opposes both abortion and the use of Medicaid funds for the effort to curb pregnancy Just months ago as a Pennsylvania Senator Mr Schweiker played a key role in expanding Federal family planning services The facts have not changed just because Mr Schweiker has changed jobs The sexual revolution among Americas teenagers has been sweeping Almost 70 percent of all girls have sexual intercourse at least once before the age of 20 and the rate is growing fastest among the youngest Most of these youngsters tend to rely on the least reliable methods of birth control if any A million of them get pregnant each year twothirds by accident Perhaps Mr Schweiker wants to change their sexual habits But he had better prove that he can before making birth control information and contraceptives more expensive and harder to find Perhaps he wants to encourage closer family ties and make the youngsters more dependent on parental advice But the more likely immediate effect would be to add to the number of highly unstable family units that have been forming around these immature mothers Nor does this appear to be a promising area of Government economy Young poor mothers and their children are particularly vulnerable to serious health problems And if responsible fathers are not around many of them are unlikely to get along without other forms of public support Whatever the shortterm savings might be in cutting off their access to contraceptives and family planning advice would surely be offset by higher Government costs in other areas Mr Schweikers new attitude is costly as well as cruel
SUPPORTERS AND CRITICS OF FOOD STAMPS PREPARE TO BATTLE ON SCOPE OF PROGRAM; This is the first of a series of articles to appear in coming weeks that will follow one program the Reagan Administration wants to cut - food stamps -through the legislative process.,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/14/us/supporters-critics-food-stamps-prepare-battle-scope-program-this-first-series.html,Not long ago a lobbyist for the dairy industry dropped by to see Carolyn Cheney a key staff aide of the House Agriculture Committee The topic of their talk was organizing support for the food stamp program one of the biggest targets of President Reagans planned budget cutbacks That small scene recurs dozens of times a day on dozens of different issues as battle lines begin to form over Mr Reagans proposals to cut 40 billion to 50 billion out of the Federal budget for the fiscal year 1982 Consultants and advisers lawyers and lobbyists staff members and lawmakers already are holding meetings writing reports trading rumors forming coalitions and mapping strategies They are hoping to defend the vast network of social welfare programs that they have helped to create and have protected over the last generation Food stamps is one of many programs tentatively designated for reduction by the Reagan Administration which has said it will to reveal its final decisions Wednesday But the conflicting arguments and emotions the program arouses will be echoed in other battles in coming months and the issue offers insight into the struggle just now beginning over the policies and priorities that will guide the nation in the 1980s As they prepare for that struggle supporters of the food stamp program know that the political climate has turned against them Hoping to Minimize Damage For the first time in 17 years food stamp advocates must face the fact that we wont emerge with an expanded program and thats just a total revolution said John R Kramer special counsel to the House Agriculture Committee The only question is where do you draw the line Minimizing damage is the whole goal this year The food stamp program began in the mid1960s as a way of improving nutrition by allotting lowincome families coupons that could be used to purchase groceries The program benefited 43 million people at a cost of 551 million in 1970 in 1980 some 211 million Americans received food stamps at a cost to the Government of almost 87 billion and it is now the second largest program after Social Security The rapid growth has been fueled by changes in the law that increased the range of eligibility Moreover the declining economy threw more people out of work just as inflation was driving up the cost of food Because of its enormous size the food stamp program has come to symbolize two polar views of the role Government should play in American society To Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina the coupons represent a welfare program that has run out of control Representative Frederick W Richmond Democrat of Brooklyn counters by saying We would be taking an evil backward step to ruin this program and take food from the mouths of millions of hungry Americans Mutual BackScratching In the past liberals and conservatives were generally able to resolve their differences on farm issues through mutual backscratching Food stamp backers supported Federal subsidies for such commodities as cotton and wheat while the friends of the farmers in turn either aided the food stamp program or agreed not to oppose it But this year as basic farm legislation comes up for renewal all programs face sizable cuts Therefore the potential exists for greater rivalry among all special interests and backscratching might not be so easy President Reagan leans toward the Helms view that food stamps must be sharply curtailed and tentative proposals prepared by his advisers have suggested 26 billion in trims for the fiscal year 1982 The major changes would cut benefits by about 5 percent across the board remove all families with incomes above the socalled poverty line and deduct the cost of free school lunches from food stamp allotments The reason most often given for the suggested cuts is economic When you have limited resources you have to spend them on priority matters said Representative E Thomas Coleman Republican of Missouri a leading critic of food stamps Generating a Debate But the food stamp program probably is the most visible of all social programs with people using the coupons in supermarkets every day and the program has generated a heated philosophical debate To Senator Helms for instance the program symbolizes the growing power of Washington over the states and over individuals Senator William Proxmire Democrat of Wisconsin says he is outraged that food stamp recipients use extra cash to buy cigarettes and booze Many conservatives allege that food stamps subsidize students workers on strike and others who they feel lean to the political left Above all conservatives assert that 22 million Americans could not possibly be hungry and that the growth of the program must be a result of fraud and abuse People dont like to admit that one of 10 Americans needs food stamps said Jeff Kirsch of the Food Research and Action Center a group concerned with hunger and nutrition issues The forces opposing food stamps represent a rather amorphous collection of fiscal conservatives The White House is trying to marshal public support behind the principle of budget reduction but most of the more active rightwing groups place higher priorities on such issues as increasing military preparedness and prohibiting abortions Cuts Wont Come Easily The budding coalition forming behind the food stamp program demonstrates how deeply rooted such programs have become and how difficult it will be for the Administration to push its budget reductions for social programs through Congress The most obvious supporters of the food stamp program include such public interest groups as the Food Research and Action Center and several religious and civil rights organizations concerned about hunger But food stamps also represent big money  6 percent of all retail food purchases  and the Food Marketing Institute an arm of the Retail Grocers Association recently issued a long statement supporting the program Farm groups such as the dairy producers who visited Miss Cheneys office on Capitol Hill would also like to see an increase in food purchases by consumers and a natural alliance with the program This year the White House appears to be following a divideandconquer strategy by proposing so many acrosstheboard cuts that it will force each potential member of the coalition to become preoccupied with its own territory Those who back dairy price supports may want to help the backers of food stamps but they may not have the time to spare from protecting milk prices Those who support food stamps say that their biggest problem is fighting the mythology surrounding the program and demonstrating that most of the waste in the program has already been eliminated They argue that fraud has been considerably reduced by new procedures that include photoidentification cards Most students have been removed from the rolls they add and those on strike qualify only if they have few other assets Most Recipients Are Young More than half of all food stamp recipients are under 18 years old and only about 14 percent of those receiving the coupons are able to work The typical head of a household using food stamps is a white woman with three children whom she is rearing alone As a result supporters argue if President Reagan does not want to hurt the truly needy only those kinds of families should remain on the rolls Representative Richmond asserts that cutting back on food stamps would not save anything For every dollar you dont spend on food stamps he said you wind up tapping the US Treasury for far more in wasted education in health care in infant mortality Both sides are preparing for a tough political battle Mr Richmond for instance has said that if Senator Helms went after the food stamp program he would reply by attacking tobacco subsidies a major issue in the Senators home state of North Carolina But as the battle begins the signs are very ominous for the supporters of the benefit one lobbyist said The defeat last fall of Senator George McGovern Democrat of South Dakota removed one of the programs staunchest supporters No comparable voice has been raised in the Senate and defending poor people is not a popular political position these days Its easy to push poor people around Mr Richmond said They dont count they dont have lobbies they dont vote They dont even appear in the census
NATIONAL MOOD HELPS SHAPE CONGRESS COMMITTEES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/15/us/national-mood-helps-shape-congress-committees.html,As Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr walked through the halls of the Capitol recently he was approached by two freshman lawmakers with the same request They wanted appointments to the Select Committee on Aging which considers problems of the elderly That incident illustrates how Congress reflects and responds to political trends in the country How legislators bid for committee assignments indicates which causes are popular and unpopular as the new Congress gets organized The panel on aging is a favorite this year because the elderly have emerged as a visible and powerful constituency perhaps the only group of needy Americans that continues to command widespread sympathy on Capitol Hill In general the most soughtafter committees these days handle money matters Everyone wants an economic committee now thats very clear said an aide to the House leadership Theres very much a sense that the central issue confronting Congress is how to handle the economy The main money committees Ways and Means and Appropriations are generally closed to younger members so many new legislators bid this year for the Budget Committee which will initially handle President Reagans proposed budget cuts Can Serve Political Purpose As the staff aide noted service on the Budget Committee can be suited to any political purpose Conservatives can use it to prove their fiscal austerity while liberals can win points by fighting to aid their districts For House Democrats membership on most committees such as Budget is decided by the Steering and Policy Committee a panel of party leaders Membership on special committees such as Aging is assigned by the Speaker Decisions on most committee openings were made last month but some assignments to special committees are still in progress Another committee with growing popularity is Foreign Affairs One theory holds that it is appealing to some liberals who are simply escaping the budget battles they feel they cannot win and focusing on issues they enjoy When a seat opened on the Public Works and Transportation Committee recently applicants were plentiful a sure sign that patronage legislation never loses its political appeal We do a lot of good in a very practical visible way said Representative James J Howard Democrat of New Jersey the committee chairman And we dont get involved in partisan philosophical fights Those partisan philosophical fights are the reason not one Democrat sought a seat this year on the Judiciary and the Education and Labor Committees both of which used to be popular with liberals As a result 10 members had to be recruited Judiciary Tasks Unpopular The Judiciary panel was once active in antitrust and civil rights matters but this year committee Democrats say that their main task will be blocking legislation on such issues as abortion school prayer and busing The Education and Labor panel generated some of the major programs of the Great Society era such as aid to education and child nutrition But this year it is likely to be mainly concerned with dismantling those same programs

American Sex,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/15/opinion/american-sex.html,Although many mourn a decline of quality in American goods and services two commodities are generally deemed to have improved food and sex American food used to be defined as bland American sex as uptight and both inadequacies were ascribed to the Puritan heritage True spicier stuff was always available to the few but only in the last 20 years has there been a move toward mass marketing And the sex industry as William Serrin reported in a series in The Times last week is now a multibilliondollar business The industry is usually thought of as a backroom operation exploring the wilder shores of sex with its headquarters in the nations back room  Times Square In actuality the sex industry is a crosscountry phenomenon and Times Square is only a branch office albeit a seedy and sometimes dangerous one What is really dangerous about the sex industry however is not its occasional sordid aspects but Americans refusal to acknowledge that we are all in one way or another its customers Sex sells more jeans than marital aids more slick magazines than porno comics more TV shows than Xrated movies The pursuit of better sex even has a Federal benediction sex counseling can be a medical tax deduction But hand in hand with a growing acceptance of explicit sexuality is a growing reluctance to recognize its inevitable results The man sniggering over a TV sitcom may be adamant that children not receive sex education in school the woman reading a magazine for tips on bed behavior may vehemently oppose a poor persons access to free contraception And both would be astonished to hear that they are as surely a part of the sex industry as a peepshow customer To pretend that this country has not gone through a sexual revolution in the last 20 years is to be willfully blind to what is all around us Censorship wont lower the abortion rate the VD rate or the number of unwanted pregnancies But honesty about sex and its consequences might
SCHWEIKER IS WRONG ON TEEN PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/15/opinion/schweiker-is-wrong-on-teen-pregnancy.html,Jr PHILADELPHIA Secretary of Health and Human Services Richard S Schweiker has announced his opposition to Federal programs of sex education and to using Medicaid funds for providing birthcontrol assistance It was not clear whether his news conference statement represented Administration policy or merely his personal sentiments In either case one can only presume that he believes that the Carter Administrations approach to the problem of adolescent childbearing was ineffective or as some conservatives have complained retrogessive because Government programs license sexual activity and weaken family authority The notion that the Government has launched a largescale campaign to promote instruction about sexuality is ludicrous The trickle of support provided by Washington has been used to distribute research findings to the public and to provide technical assistance upon request to local communities initating programs of their own design It is hard to portray existing programs as unwarranted intrusions or excessive expenditures by a runaway Federal bureaucracy The Government has not been manufacturing but rather responding to a growing demand for assistance by communities struggling to cope with the rising incidence of teenage sexuality and pregnancy Mr Schweikers position moreover conveys the implication that providing sex education and contraception to unmarried teenagers has undermined premarital chastity Demographic and sociological data contradict the proposition that familyplanning programs have significantly figured in the decline of premarital chastity The sexual revolution to use that phrase to refer to the breakdown of prohibitions against premarital intercourse was well under way before the 1970s when familyplanning programs first provided their services to teenagers Before the 70s it was virtually impossible for unmarried adolescents to obtain birthcontrol aid from publicly and privately funded familyplanning programs Yet it is hardly the case that teenagers resisted premarital sex In the 50s and 60s more than half of all teenage women entering marriage were pregnant and many others who became pregnant escaped notice by obtaining illegal abortions The first reliable national survey of adolescent sexual behavior in 1971 showed that almost half of all unmarried females were nonvirgins by 19 and that more than a quarter of all sexually active adolescents had become pregnant at least once Teenage pregnancy became a public concern in the late 60s not only because sexual standards were changing but also because attitudes toward marriage and childbearing were shifting As women tended to marry later pregnant teenagers became less willing to wed merely to avoid an outofwedlock birth While nonmarital childbearing in the teenage population was increasing the birth rate among married women was rapidly declining The result was that an increasing share of all births occurred among unmarried adolescents Belatedly local and state agencies with Federal assistance began to inform teenagers of the medical and social risks associated with early childbearing and to provide contraception to the growing number of sexually active adolescents Few experts believe that the availability of contraception has provided a significant incentive to have sex at a younger age Only an insignificant number of sexually active teenagers visit familyplanning clinics before starting to have intercourse Most adolescents still drift into rather than decide to have sex Their first clinical visit often occurs when they suspect they are pregnant If familyplanning programs deserve criticism it is not because they aggressively peddle birth control to innocent virgins but because they are not diligent enough in finding sexually active teenagers in need of their services Familyplanning programs have not been effective enough in educating communities about the problem of teenage pregnancy and helping to reach out to parents who need counseling Yet reliable figures indicate that if contraception were completely unavailable to adolescents 680000 additional nonmarital pregnancies would occur each year The curtailment of familyplanning services would produce a greatly increased demand for abortion and a tremendous increase in the need for welfare and social services for unmarried mothers The problem of teenage pregnancy cannot be solved by cutting back Federal funding Local communities do not have the resources to pick up the slack The elimination of services will not keep teenagers from having sex or from becoming pregnant Secretary Schweiker are we really better off putting our heads back in the sand

her generations preeminent novelist of Roman Catholic mores and manners when she published her remarkable first novel Final Payments it is dispelled by her new book In Miss Gordons vision the church seems to offer an ideal of perfection that dominates the lives of believers and apostates alike Miss Gordons new heroine is once again a defector from the church who as if doing penance for having lost her faith seems to constantly strive for a perfect act of contrition I dont want to go to bed with anyone for the next thirty years one of the characters says in Final Payments It muddles things This same wariness of lust and a yearning for clarity mark Miss Gordons new work Whatever serenity comes to its heroine lies again far beyond the flesh in the steadfastness of ardent asexual friendship But The Company of Women presents us with a quandary Is Miss Gordons craft as a novelist keeping up with the grand and virginal boldness of her vision Like her earlier novel The Company of Women deals with the only child of a widowed parent with a girl whose destiny is forged by the expectations of a celibate and despotic paternal figure Father Cyprian surrogate father of Miss Gordons heroine Felicitas is a fiercely conservative priest who has given up parish work because he detests the permissiveness of the contemporary church Rather than be polluted by the sty of the modern world he has exiled himself to his rural hometown in upstate New York where he has spent the past decade ministering to the spiritual needs of a band of five devout single women one of them Charlotte is Felicitass widowed mother whose lives are as flawed as his He believes that mans vocation is to hate the world and love God and that John Kennedy was educated by communists An ideological battle with his own institution rather than hubris has brought about Cyprians downfall He has stubbornly retained his belief in a church of eternal truth and immutable laws But these are times when the church is questioning its own immutability and dismisses traditionalists like Cyprian as arrogant eccentrics His grandeur lies in the fact that he refuses to be embittered by his outcast state and retains his capacity for love and dedication to others Miss Gordons new novel is divided into three distinct parts  set in the years 1963 196970 1977 When we first meet Felicitas named after the one virgin martyr whose name contained some hope for ordinary human happiness she is a precocious scholarly 14yearold who has been reared by her mother her mothers four closest friends and the possessive Father Cyprian Like the invalid father of Final Payments Cyprian has extravagantly high spiritual expectations for his ward He finds her too good and wise for marriage and motherhood and bestows upon her the honor of the isolate Cyprian envisions Felicitas as a bold tomboy a teacher a celibate forger of souls He wishes her to take on the mantle of his own charismatic but halffailed priesthood She wont throw her life away on some man  She has too much work to do In Part II Felicitas commits the offense of leaving a Catholic college to enter Columbia She rebels against the idols of her childhood resenting that appointed meal of bone and water that she feels has been her life with them The lives of the women she loved were bankrupt  making do with God and each other purchasing the icon of a man a tyrant who had won their veneration not through honorableness but through fear  She shacks up with a trendy philandering Columbia professor and lets her classical studies fall by the wayside Her rebellion ends abruptly when she becomes pregnant and with Father Cyprians unexpected blessing returns to her mother and her mothers friends to bear her child in privacy In Part III set in 1977 Felicitas is bringing up her daughter among her immaculate community willfully resigning herself to the fact that like Isabel of Final Payments her life will have been a long decline from having been a clever girl For the primary purpose of providing her child with a father she chooses as her husband a docile Catholic hardware dealer in whom she enjoys a slowness so complete I marvel that his hands work George Bernard Shaw once defined melodrama as a simple and sincere drama of action and feeling  allegorical idealistic full of generalizations and moral lessons Unlike Final Payments which was a sad tale told in a brilliantly comic mode the reformedreprobate plot of Miss Gordons new novel comes perilously close to Shaws definition And it is only rescued from the more mawkish excesses of melodrama by its singular and fascinating streak of monastic Amazonism It is for shelter that we marry and make love Felicitas reflects in the last chapter Only this austerity of voice this obstinate refusal to capitulate to the romantic tone rescues the novel from bathos Felicitas marries in the cool pragmatic spirit of a female warrior or priestess choosing a more comfortable government for her acolytes The obdurate Father Cyprian remains Felicitass greatest love her principal bearer of clarity and significance There is no one I revere more  for the dignity of his priestly calling  the habit of his grand impossible life Final Payments centered on the universal religious problem of the search for perfect charity The Company of Women struggles with specifically Roman Catholic issues of otherworldly vocation with that call to a priesthood of the elect which Cyprian tries to impose on Felicitas Thus Miss Gordons new work reverses the customary progress of second novels which tend to move out from the autobiographical or ethnic context of first books Instead the author turns considerably inward burrowing even more deeply into Irish Catholic orthodoxy and symbolism The suggestion for example that the young Felicitas is a Christlike redeemer figure is established in the books first chapter and the account of her youth is laced with messianic allusions The childs surrogate mothers lived in a virginity far more radical than their intact physical states Later she observed that it was her life they needed  She was the only one One could well read The Company of Women in the light of the new feminist theology that rebels against the allmale cast of the Christian pantheon Father Cyprian had been amazed by her Felicitass questions At twelve she had a better mind than most priests Charlotte could see Felicitas only among elders the child in the temple amazing the scribes with learning And Jesus advanced in wisdom and age and grace with God and men The authors insertion of this phrase from the Gospel of St Luke indicates the explicitly religious nature of her major theme  the perils of an overzealous search for a saviour in human guise In the novels somber ending Felicitas is atoning for her refusal to accept the role of redeemer by leading a prosaic life about which the best that can be said is I do less harm than good a life in part fulfilled however by the young daughter to whom her community of friends have now transferred some of their hopes for salvation Mary Gordon has offered us an ambitious feminist fable about a Christ figure manquee who ends up as the wife of a simple country man still devoted to the ailing priest who has dominated her life Unfortunately The Company of Women despite its exalted spiritual message has numerous novelistic flaws And some of them ironically stem from the very integrity and chastity of the authors vision Miss Gordon for instance has grave problems creating fully fleshed noncelibate male characters The lovers in Final Payments tended to be cardboard figures Those in The Company of Women are as flimsy as bookmarks Robert Cavendish the swinging professor who deflowers Felicitas is a deplorably unconvincing 1960s pastiche who utters inanities about lovemaking being a political act Since Felicitass maudlin obsession for him dominates the novels long central section Cavendishs silliness considerably weakens the quality of the entire book The same can be said for the other Movement grotesques who befriend Felicitas in midnovel  the potsmoking granolamunching dropout who tries to arrange for Felicitass abortion the bearded activist who must mutter Fidel Castro to avoid premature ejaculation The Company of Women is considerably more steeped in ethnic realism than Mary Gordons first novel and her new heroines bondage to a claustrophobic Catholic life is far more interesting than her attempt to break out of it Whereas the earlier novels acerbly secular and comic vignettes of welfare recipients provided some of Miss Gordons finest pages The Company of Women derives whatever power it has from the authors intimate knowledge of Irish parochialism Her involvement with paternal authority figures is obsessional and she has an almost erotic appetite for portraying the appurtenances of priests She wanted always to be there kneeling looking at his black shoes below the black cuffs of his trousers and the long white alb Her repertoire of behindthelacecurtain anecdotes seems inexhaustible Felicitass Latin teacher at her first Catholic college advises her to switch to Columbia rather than to Fordham because he is a Dominican and prefers to see her educated by pagans than by Jesuits Father Cyprian does not allow his acolytes to risk eternal damnation by swimming with Methodists or eating hot dogs with Baptists Charlottes friend Mary Rose who earns her living as an usher in a movie house must confess to Father Cyp when a condemned movie is playing Work the candy counter those days he advises Yet the cumulative effect of such ethnicity can verge on cuteness and does not rescue The Company of Women from frequent lapses into solemnity and selfrighteousness These flaws characterize several of the central characters and that may be the heart of the trouble The quivering naive Felicitas does not begin to be as complex and interesting as Miss Gordons last heroine and is sadly devoid of Isabels chaste bitchiness Whereas the wry Isabel parodied a Vogue article entitled Tops You Can Build Your Fall Around as she launched into a shopping spree at Bloomingdales Felicitas earnestly purchases sleazy black negligees on Broadway to prepare for her defloration Among the older women of the heroines tribe only two portraits are precise enough to galvanize the theme of mutual aid and redemptive friendship Felicitass spunky sharptongued mother Charlotte and Clare the refined heiress who has had so much Catholic schooling that she refers to the Incarnation as the scandal of the particular After reading the novels disastrously conceived last pages which take the form of sentimental and outoftone monologues by each member of Felicitass community one leaves The Company of Women feeling that it is a novel of marvelous parts rather than a marvelous novel and that it is held together only by the remarkable figure of Father Cyprian This charismatic despot might be the most finely rendered priest in fiction since the equally triumphalist abbot of Brian Moores Catholics Miss Gordons is at her best when she delineates Father Cyprians subtle balance of emotional violence and capacity for love the pathos of his exile the eccentric complexity of his conservatism Cyprian forces Felicitas to contemplate manure to cure her of her Protestant love of nature yet joyfully welcomes her bastard child because her pregnancy will spare her greater sin Remembering how he had once filled churches and drawn long lines to his confessional Cyprian sometimes weeps at the sight of the five lonely women who are the only following left to him yet he continues to dedicate his life to this saving remnant The chainsmoking harddrinking priest considers any form of religious liberalism effeminate and womanish It was womanish to say the rosary during Mass Gordon catalogues with her habitual delight in liturgical detail It was womanish to carry pastel holy cards and stitched novena booklets bound with rubber bands It was womanish to believe in happiness on earth to be a Democrat  to dislike curses whiskey and the smell of sweat  The opposite of womanish was orthodox The Passion of Christ was orthodox the rosary said in private it was most orthodox to prefer the sorrowful mysteries  One must finally deal alas with certain changes in the texture of Miss Gordons prose which in this novel is as prodigiously uneven as are her characterizations Particularly in the secular passages the style seems more hurried less limpid and exact less aphoristic than in Final Payments In her newly loose rhythms there sometimes lurks the influence of undigested DH Lawrence One keeps being chagrined by the brusque disparities in the quality of her language She is capable of a description as richly sparse as the beard on his face was gray suggesting ruined meat His mouth was perfectly evil and his eyes admitted no light and to follow it some pages later with such triteness as the envy of her classmates fell over her shoulders like a rich fur cloak or the assumption that they should feel joyous settled in their stomachs like a meal of dough If Ive been harsh with The Company of Women it is because of my enormous admiration for Miss Gordons earlier book for the purity ambition and grandeur of vision offered in both her books Miss Gordons vision of human fulfillment may be more germane to the philosophical tradition than it is to the novel She rebels against the idealization of romantic sexual and marital love that has inspired much of the novelistic form for over two centuries She values instead the 2000yearold notion unquestioned from Aristotles time to the Enlightenment and only dethroned by the Romantics that sees friendship as an infinitely more central ingredient of human happiness than any bonding of sexual affection And at a time when many of her contemporaries have capitulated to the chic anomie of postmodernism she continues to grapple with some of the vast issues that have given the novel form much of its grandeur What is redemption What is charity What is our specific gravity of grace Who else among her peers is asking such searing questions In literature as in philosophy the manner of the questioning can take you half the way to greatness
OPPOSING SIDES STEP UP EFFORTS ON ABORTION MEASURE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/15/us/opposing-sides-step-up-efforts-on-abortion-measure.html,This weekend for the first time in its 12year history the National Abortion Rights Action League is limiting the agenda for its annual meeting to one topic the human life amendment The human life amendment is a simple designation for a proposed amendment to the Constitution that would almost abolish legal abortion in this country But that designation embodies all the biological medical constitutional and ideological complexities that have arisen since the Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973 Such an amendment would essentially define the fertilized egg as a person entitled to the full protection of the Constitution And the antiabortion or right to life groups are pursuing its passage with the same singlemindedness that the prochoice National Abortion Rights Action League has shown in setting its agenda Both Sides Are Lobbying Strict resolutions against abortion have been drafted regularly since 1973 but until now strategists on both sides of the issue have concentrated their efforts on such questions as financing of abortions by Medicaid the healthcare program for the poor and parental consent But for this session of Congress it is the concept of an amendment that would permanently abolish or preserve abortion that has both sides lobbying their representatives leafleting from door to door and addressing grassroots groups As Dr JC Willke president of the National Right to Life Committee put it Enactment of the human life amendment is the central focus of the entire movement It would restore legal personhood and return civil rights to an entire class of living Americans The discrimination they suffer is based on the place of residence the womb If a kid could move to a new location his life would be protected Now a private citizen the mother has the right to destroy a life We would reach over the head of the state to prevent private action Opponents of such an amendment see it as forcing women to carry to term even pregnancies caused by rape and incest and perhaps those that would threaten the health and welfare of the mother They say it would violate the Constitutional separation of church and state by imposing on society at large the religious belief that the fetus is a human being Effects of Amendment Further as they see it such an amendment would have ramifications unrelated to the abortion right per se The effect on abortion  disastrous for womens lives and health as it would be  would be only one of the farreaching revolutionary consequences of the amendment said Harriet Pilpel an attorney for Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union The present Constitutional guarantees of life protect only against Government action she said The human life amendments seem for the first time to guarantee a right to life not only against government action but also against the action of any and every individual in the United States It might call into being a doctrine of Federal entitlement we have never had before she said In other words it would seem to put on the Federal Government an affirmative obligation to protect everyones right to life This could mean an entitlement for all born people to food shelter education and health care Two Versions of Amendment Two versions of the human life amendment which is supported by both President Reagan and Secretary of Health and Human Services Richard S Schweiker have been introduced in Congress The version offered by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina and Representative Robert K Dornan Republican of California says simply The paramount right to life is vested in each human being from the moment of fertilization without regard to age health or condition of dependency The version sponsored by Senator Jake Garn Republican of Utah and Representative James L Oberstar Democrat of Minnesota declares With respect to the right to life the word person as used in this article and in the fifth and 14th articles of amendment to the Constitution applies to all human beings irrespective of age health function or condition of dependency including their unborn offspring at every stage of their biological development But the GarnOberstar resolution while specifying a clause that no person shall be deprived of life by any person also says Nothing in this article shall prohibit a law permitting only those medical procedures required to prevent the death of the mother Argument Over Exceptions The latter exception has caused some argument even though supporters of an amendment without that clause say they do not want to preclude abortion for ectopic pregnancy in which the embryo develops outside the uterus or in case of uterine cancer or other lifeendangering conditions Robert Marshall legislative assistant to Representative Dornan said The people opposed to stating the exception do so on the grounds that abortion means to kill an unborn child and they dont want the law to say that you can ever intentionally kill an innocent person Those in favor of it say that without an explicit clause judges will start writing the clauses themselves For the moment the amendment seems stalled by disagreements over its language and by insufficient support in Congress A prospective amendment to the Constitution must have the support of twothirds of those voting and present in each house of Congress before going to state legislatures for ratification Dr Willke estimated that in the Senate where we need 67 votes we probably have somewhere in the low 50s and in the House where we need 291 we have close to 250 Campaign Against Amendment The National Organization for Women has organized a doortodoor educational campaign against the amendment across the country and is collecting petitions The National Abortion Rights Action League beside devoting this weekends meeting to the subject is conducting educational efforts on the state and local levels If we were to wait until it got out of Congress we would be five years too late to stop it in the states said Marguerite BeckRex a spokesman for the organization Threefourths of the states must act affirmatively on the measure for it to be ratified The prochoice groups argue that such an absolute amendment could be carried to extremes giving the legal status of murder to the use of such birth control methods as the intrauterine device and the pill which are believed to act after conception  This interpretation according to opponents of the human life amendment might lead to laws requiring murder prosecutions for women who have abortions their doctors and others who help the women obtain the abortions The amendments backers however say that such arguments are exaggerated and not legally tenable Some people involved with the issue believe that Congress will try to avoid action on an amendment by passing a bill introduced Jan 19 by Senator Helms Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois and Romano L Mazzoli Democrat of Kentucky that deems the unborn legal persons A bill requires the approval of a simple majority rather than twothirds of Congress Others believe that the amendment may provoke action because of the possibility that otherwise a Constitutional Convention may be called for the purpose of eradicating abortion rights and possibly rewriting other parts of the Constitution Nineteen states of the necessary 34 states have already passed resolutions in favor of a convention on the abortion issue
A TALK WITH MARY GORDON,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/15/books/a-talk-with-mary-gordon.html, Le Anne Schreiber is assistant editor of The New York Times Book Review By LE ANNE SCHREIBER As a child in Queens Mary Gordon imagined that she would grow up to be a very elegant writing nun I thought Id write poetry in my habit and lead a very disciplined life A very cool life As a kind of selfstyled training she wrote religious treatises with titles that ended in question marks like What is Prayer by Mary Gordon age 8 But visions of the cool life ended with childhood and although Miss Gordon at 31 still admits the allure of a life of singleminded devotion she says that she has chosen instead a life of ordinary human happiness On one recent snowy afternoon in New Paltz NY ordinary human happiness seemed to consist of a loaf of fresh bakery bread a generous supply of Pepperidge Farm butter cookies and a steady flow of heat from the woodburning stove in the kitchen of an odd neoVictorian home that reminds its owners of The House of Usher Sitting contentedly in her mothers lap was threemonthold Anna wearing what her mother calls her papal nuncio look smugly satisfied and judgmental Im giving myself six months to just live in a moronic haze of milk says Mary Gordon who also remarked that she desperately wanted her first child to be a girl Arthur Cash Annas father is giving himself a years leave from his position as chairman of the English department at the nearby state university to help his wife with the baby Like the heroine of her new novel who wants to spare her daughter the burden of being the family hope Mary Gordon wants to bestow upon Anna the most ordinary of childhoods free from the extravagant literary and religious expectations that daunted her heroines and herself And indeed there is a very standard version of Pat the Bunny on the bookshelves in the nursery Next to it however is a fivevolume set of CS Lewis that purveyor of literate Christian allegories for children The romance of religion is very seductive In the interview that follows Mary Gordon talks about this and the other concerns that are central to her fiction Q Are you still a believing Catholic A I consider myself a Catholic I have a real religious life in a framework which I think of as Catholic But I dont think John Paul II would be real pleased with it I think one of the things that helped me in life is Flannery OConnors statement that you must remember that in this day and age one must suffer because of the church and not for the church Q What is most troubling to you about the church A The issue that is the most upsetting to me is the failure to ordain women because the churchs other positions  on birth control and abortion for instance  which are quite crazy at least have some moral root if skewed But the prejudice against ordaining women has no possible moral root under any interpretation I thought that nun who stood up to the Pope was one of the bravest people I have ever heard of because I know what that weight of authority is and that weight of tradition Its one of the things I was writing about in The Company of Women the relationship between the male spiritual authority and the female Q Do you see the relation of the women to Father Cyprian as typical of relations between women and their mentors A Yes definitely It seems to me one of the things that most interested me in The Company of Women is female powerlessness in relation to male power the phenomenon of women who are very powerful with each other and very powerful in their own lives and powerful in their outside accomplishments but who will suddenly buckle to the authority of a male mentor whether its a priest or professor or a lover Women with a kind of zeal to abandon the powerfulness of their lives to a male who claims authority I think its very pervasive and I think its a big problem in relations between men and women So I did think that the relationship between Father Cyprian as a priest to these women as believers was very archetypal Q Felicitas reads and rereads Jane Eyre Was the relation between Jane Eyre and Rochester the model for the relation of Felicitas and Cyprian A Yes and I even have Cyprian at the end weakened by age in the way that Bronte really did a job on poor Mr Rochester I mean hes blind and symbolically castrated Of course hes going to be good at the end  he has no other choice And the pleasure that Jane has at the end Of coming back to a blind crippled Mr Rochester and saying Yes well now Ill take over Q And yet Cyprian though weakened at the end remains the center of your heroines life A I think for her it has to be that way because I really make her a very radical case But what I think is the positive side of people like Cyprian is that they stand for a kind of absolute standard and passion and uncompromisingness and some notion of the ideal Without which I think life is very impoverished Thats what I wanted to say  that what he stood for that wonderful crazy destructive but somehow very compelling sense of the ideal would be at the center of her life Once she had deidealized the human casing of it Q Cyprian remains mentor to Felicitas but she describes her mind as better than his more supple A Well because I think that absolutists never really have firstrate minds  theyre too rigid  but they are passionate minds And so I think that contact with that sort of absolutism tempered by experience or compassion or mercy or gorgeous common sense in the end makes the best sort of mind the best sort of soul to have Q The heroines of both your novels come to a rather sudden and absolute rejection of the possibilities of romantic or sexual love Are we to understand this as a wise choice A Both of my heroines have been in some way damaged by male authority And so theyve been rendered unfit for ordinary life I think I was clearer about that with Felicitas than I was with Isabel in Final Payments She sees ordinary life as a definite comedown from the exalted ideal that she grew up with and I want that to be seen as a kind of damage that is done these women And it is the damage of any kind of romance I think romance believed too strongly too early is damaging Whether its the romance of sexual love or the romance of religion or the romance of political purity it is damaging Q How autobiographical are your heroines A I think Id be less than honest if I said theyre nothing like me Theyre not me But there is at once the there but for the grace of God go I feeling about them and the envy of their kind of absoluteness which I have not chosen for myself and which I really try to work against And so it is a way of my having the absolute life without living it without living the kind of life which obviously upsets me Q Has there been any framework of values youve been exposed to as an adult that has the resonance for you that Catholicism does A No But feminism comes closest to it Absolutely But precisely because feminism is postulated on democratic theories it breaks down very often into a kind of infighting which is how I see the movement right now Were all going off in about 55 different directions And theres not the cohesion And the thing about the church which is why its so resonant is that it does seem there is an essential core that seems to last and to go on to retain its language to retain its ritual to retain  I like to think  some central values that are immutable Whereas anything that is modern in conception  because the modern sensibility demands change all the time doesnt have the resonance that builds up over time Q How much hold upon your imagination did notions of the Immaculate Conception the virgin birth the lives of the virgin martyrs have A Well the Immaculate Conception happens to be my birthday I think the whole notion of purity has been  and is  very important to me Now Ive redefined it from a narrow and I think wrong definition of it as sexual chastity Purity and chastity seem to me two extremely different things But I think that ideal of unencumberedness of commitment of passion is very very much with me and very much came out of those images of the virgin martyrs That notion of an unencumbered devoted directed singular life has always been very much in my imagination although I dont live that way I cant Q Did you think about your writing in terms of a vocation A Yes absolutely From early childhood I knew what I was going to be and I felt it demanded devotion and discipline and it had to have the same kind of purity as a religious vocation I think the image of the nun is something that every Catholic girl works against or with or plays off in some way Which is very different from other religious traditions You do have the notion of a woman without men living a very pure centered life which has nothing to do with the domestic Q Would you call yourself a feminist writer A Sure What is terribly important to me deeply important  and this is where I feel a sense of vocation  is to write about issues that are central to womens lives to write about them beautifully and in high style Im so aware of how I was liberated by the womens movement and I feel a sense of vocation in putting in the style of the great tradition the issues that consciousness has opened up to me Not to use Leaviss phrase because his great tradition and mine are different But to keep standards of beauty and excellence in writing to follow in that tradition but to use the insights that Ive been given because of my great good fortune in having been a young adult when the womens movement was first starting out Q Is writing about women in what you call the high style a way of bestowing value upon that experience A Yes Its a way of being faithful to the worth of that experience And its also a way of not allowing high style to become atrophied because new experiences are fed into it If this tradition which I value so enormously is going to continue to be lively it has to use its grace its elegance its precision to come to terms with experiences that are new Q To write with grace elegance and precision do you have to struggle against the temptation to be polemical to be angry A Yes For instance one of the things that I had a lot of trouble with was the character of Robert in The Company of Women In the first version he was so awful that a friend of mine said nobody would have gone to bed with him I mean its just that nobodys that horrible Felicitas had to like him there had to be something about him that made her fall in love with him for whatever skewed reasons But Im so angry with that kind of man  and that kind of abuse of sexuality and power  that it was hard for me to remember the ideals of  well what you really have to do is create a character who is neither a hero nor a villain but who makes sense in some human terms I think my temptation is not so much to polemic as to vitriol and I have to work against that Q Do you think its harder for you to create a lover than a father A Oh infinitely Im not very good at writing about sexual men The only men that I write about well I desex somehow and it is a failing of mine a way in which my consciousness what I know about the world gets in the way of my art Some of my best friends are men I do love men I have had wonderful relationships and deep friendships and things like that but I cant write about that I just cant do it Because my sense is so much that the overall structure is so perverted and that a perverted attitude toward women is so much the norm for men Q Are you going to return to the terrain of Catholic girlhood and to these issues between men and women in your next novel A In my next book Im not putting anybodys childhood in and so Im really consciously working very hard at trying to achieve the same kind of richness of texture in some other place I dont know whether I can do it yet I just started Im hoping to write something which opens out to the world a little bit more And to find a language which is less the language of memory less the language of childhood but that has its own density and its own shape I think its going to be hard But I think I have to do it if Im not going to be selfindulgent I cant keep repeating myself all the time I guess Sometimes I think I can

ABORTION RIGHTS GROUPS EXPECT HARD TIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/16/style/abortion-rights-groups-expect-hard-times.html,Opponents of the proposed constitutional amendment to ban abortion heard sobering if not pessimistic appraisals of their chances for success as the National Abortion Rights Action League concluded its twoday annual meeting today The money you raise is in danger of being if not misspent then diffusely spent Roger Craver a political consultant and fundraising specialist told a political strategy session The problem isnt raising money its finding a focus About 540000 people contributed a total of 5 million last year to various fundraising appeals on behalf of preserving the right to have an abortion The National Abortion Rights Action League has about 100000 members an increase of 10000 since the November election Some 300 state and local leaders of the group attended the session Although national surveys consistently show that a majority of the American public is opposed to banning abortion the delegates here seemed to agree that the abortion rights movement has lost ground since the Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that women have a constitutional right to choose abortion The various constitutional amendments that have been introduced in the current session of Congress would have the effect of overruling that decision by guaranteeing the right to life of a human embryo from the moment of fertilization in the words of one of the proposals Another proposal would remove court jurisdiction over state and local antiabortion measures and would declare as a matter of Federal law that a fetus is a person from the moment of conception entitled to the protection of the Constitution This proposal is in the form of a bill requiring only a majority in both houses of Congress rather than a constitutional amendment which needs a twothirds majority and ratification by threequarters of the states The crisis is upon us and the danger is clear Karen Mulhauser executive director of the abortion rights group told the session She said that the group would soon open centers in Portland Ore and Boston to train members in techniques of grassroots organizing The goal is to insure that a constitutional amendment can be defeated at the state level if it clears both houses of Congress Asked by the groups members how the political momentum had shifted toward the antiabortion forces Wes McCune the president of Group Research an organization that monitors the political right said that the alliance between the right wing and the singleissue antiabortion groups had become an effective coalition That coalition Mr McCune said has preempted the right to use the term family  He continued They stole it right away from you They got it and I dont know how youll ever get it back As the abortion rights meeting ended another conference an outgrowth of the National Womens Conference that was held three years ago in Houston got under way here today About 200 members of the Continuing Committee of the National Womens Conference met to assess developments since the Houston conference and to decide whether a second national conference should be called for 1982 The continuing committee was established by the Houston conference which was financed by a 5 million Federal appropriation and drew more than 20000 women to the threeday session The Houston conference adopted resolutions supporting abortion rights and rights for homosexuals positions that provoked bitter disagreements among the delegates The continuing committee will vote Tuesday on whether to recommend a second conference Since renewed Federal financing is highly unlikely a second conference would be paid for by private funds

ABORTION FOE IS CHIEF CANDIDATE TO LEAD BIRTH CONTROL PROGRAMS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/18/us/abortion-foe-is-chief-candidate-to-lead-birth-control-programs.html,A prominent antiabortion lobbyist here Marjory Mecklenburg is the leading candidate to head the Government office that aids teenage mothers and counsels on birth control according to Government officials A spokesman for Richard S Schweiker the Secretary of Health and Human Services said today in response to an inquiry about her possible appointment that Mrs Mecklenburg president of American Citizens Concerned for Life was under serious consideration for head of the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs but that other candidates had not been ruled out Mrs Mecklenburg said she could not discuss her personal views because her appointment had not been announced However she said that her organization had been formed to oppose abortion and to advocate alternatives to abortion Not the First Line of Defense The organization believes she said that contraception should not be the first line of defense against unwanted teenage pregnancies Rather she said adolescents should be educated to postpone sexual involvement Mrs Mecklenburg said however that her organization recognized there was little gained by withholding contraception from sexually active adolescents In general she said contraceptives should not be given to the teenagers without their parents permission The Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs was created by Congress in 1978 to finance projects around the country that assist teenage mothers One of the main functions of the projects according to a spokesman for the office is to counsel clients on how to prevent further pregnancies Differences of Opinion The consideration of Mrs Mecklenburg for the Government post is another indication of the differences between the Carter and Reagan Administrations in the area of birth control The Carter Administration opposed a move to propose a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion while the Reagan Administration supports it Moreover Patricia Roberts Harris the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Carter Administration advocated teaching teenagers about contraception while Mr Schweiker opposes Federal involvement in sex education and does not think contraceptives should be distributed to poor unmarried teenagers under the Medicaid program Mrs Mecklenburg who lives in St Paul Minn has testified often before Congress on the issues of abortion and pregnancy prevention She is a former home economics teacher

COURT REJECTS CURB ON ABORTION FUNDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/19/us/court-rejects-curb-on-abortion-funds.html,The Massachusetts Supreme Court today ordered the state to pay for all medically necessary abortions for women on public assistance even if their lives are not in danger The court in a 6to1 decision overturned the states 1979 law limiting public financing of abortion to cases where the women face lifethreatening complications by giving birth John Reinstein of the Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts which challenged the law asserted that the ruling meant the state would offer a constitutional protection of a womans right to choose whether or not to have an abortion that was broader than the right recognized by the United States Supreme Court The decision written by Justice Francis J Quirico involved the claims of three unidentified women Each had decided after consultation with her physician that she wishes to terminate her pregnancy the decision said Medicaid Payments Allowed The majority held that since the state chose to subsidize childbearing and health costs it must do so with genuine indifference to the options open to a pregnant woman by the allocation of public funds The court ruled that each of the women was entitled to nondiscriminatory funding of lawful medically necessary abortion services The ruling enjoined public officials from withholding payments under the state Medicaid program the healthcare program for the poor Gov Edward J King who campaigned in 1978 on a pledge to seek limits on public assistance for abortions said that his initial reaction was to proceed to amend our constitution so the abortion issue is properly handled Chief Justice Edward F Hennessey issued a long dissent It is clear to me that the majority thus equate a financial inducement toward childbirth with an obstacle to a womans freedom to choose abortion Justice Hennessey said The logic fails It may be an appropriate argument to address to the Legislature but it is not a valid premise for a conclusion of unconstitutionality
A Weighty Sermon,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/20/opinion/a-weighty-sermon.html,Karol Wojtyla lived 58 years as boy man priest and cardinal before he was elevated to the papacy but it is difficult to imagine him as ever having been anything but a pope The Pope Most powers and potentates are separable from their titles but in John Paul II papacy and person seem indistinguishable He fills his office as if it were his skin which is why his pronouncements carry such extraordinary weight Disliking them is of course ones option disregarding them however is close to impossible When John Paul II speaks to Roman Catholics about religious doctrine he speaks as a leader to his constituency Although millions may regret and be affected by his condemnation of divorce abortion and artificial means of contraception which he reiterated this week on his journey through the Philippines it is surely his right to preach the teachings of his church just as surely as it is the right of others to oppose them But there are occasions when John Paul IIs homilies embrace a universal truth and this same Philippine journey evoked one of them Seated beside President Ferdinand Marcos a member of his flock the Pope said One can never justify the violation of the fundamental dignity of the human person or of the basic rights that safeguard this dignity It was the perfect time the perfect place and the perfect audience for such a sermon And the sermon itself deserves the worlds attention
WELCOME FOR POPE IS BIGGEST OF TOUR,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/20/world/welcome-for-pope-is-biggest-of-tour.html,Pope John Paul II received the most spontaneously enthusiastic welcome today of his threedayold visit to the Philippines in this most fervent city of this deeply Roman Catholic nation He responded with two sermons in his most conservative vein Far from Manila and the highly organized pomp of the Government of President Ferdinand E Marcos here in the city that John Paul called the cradle of Christianity in the Philippines the Polishborn Pope found himself immersed in the atmosphere that must have recalled to him the fervor of faith native to his former archdiocesan seat of Cracow Today he flew to Davao a commercial center on Mindanao to talk with 60 representatives of Moslem tribes The island has been the scene of a long and violent Moslem separatist revolt Cebu holds itself to be a fountainhead of the Catholic faith not only in its country but in the Far East as a whole It was here that mass was first said in 1521 and the first Southeast Asians became Christians From his arrival at the airport on the island of Mactan this morning through his triumphant entry into the city his celebration of mass to a nighttime rally for youths at the archbishops residence the day was marked by an intensity of enthusiasm and prayer The streets through which the Pope traveled were jammed with crowds that made progress slow The Pope responded to the frequent stops with waves  grand gestures of both arms  and signs of the cross People cheered and wept sometimes both at once Makeshift bands in which drums predominated stationed themselves along his road and beat strong rhythms to which young and old swayed and rocked People stood on roofs prisoners at the city jail waved from the roof and from behind barbed wire Since early this morning people had been hiking to a disused airfield to wait for the pontifical mass that began at sunset During the celebration the Pope preached a strong and conservative sermon on the family Union Cannot Be Broken Marriage the Pope declared is a union that cannot be broken by any human authority Preaching against divorce and against polygamy in a country in which many men keep minor or second wives the Pope stressed that the church will never dilute or change her teaching on marriage and the family John Paul reiterated in the strongest terms the churchs opposition to abortion and artificial contraception as well as his condemnation of the selfish pursuit of pleasure sexual permissiveness and the fear of permanent commitment In an earlier sermon to priests and seminarians the Pope restated his views on the celibacy of priests which he termed by no means marginal to priestly life He criticized those who suggest that only by diminishing the importance of the priesthood can the laity be given their full place in the church

HEROINES GROWING UP,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/22/books/heroines-growing-up.html,A GOOD SPORT By Julia Whedon 197 pp New York Doubleday  Co 1095 PRISMS By Marianne Mackay 376 pp New York Seaview Books 1295 By BRINA CAPLAN Adulthood is a convenient disguise for those who have grown up but have failed to outgrow a childs desperate dependence If they wish adults can reenact incomplete childhoods simultaneously hiding selfdespair and seeking its resolution in drink a job or marriage All costume games are taxing however and this one played out in pain over years may eventually exhaust sanity Even so the double agents of childhood find quitting such games difficult because they must then face longavoided terror and dismiss forever a treasured if disappointed desire The heroines of both A Good Sport and Prisms confront this difficulty clutching their dependencies even as they relinquish them As a result these very different novels verge on answering the same troublesome question How is it possible to achieve an independence that does not feel like loss A sassy romantic comedy A Good Sport is narrated by its heroine Jan Derby Married for nine years to a television sportscaster Jan describes her marriage as an intelligent choice based on despair a bargain that guarantees her security but strands her in a New York City apartment with a macho egotist who holds patents on the formula for exploitation When she surveys her life all she can see are brandname products  Ajax Electrolux Tums  or like her husbands image on the screen the products of those products In effect she has come to rest in the flat cold commercial world of daytime television Frank didnt know but I was watching television all the time now Especially the talk shows What I heard there I passed along as my own I came to call Douglas Mike and Griffin Merv even Cronkite Walter Frank didnt notice I did Inadvertently presenting his wife with a job and a lover Frank provides Jans way back to three dimensions The volunteer job as Jan views it is essentially silly writing public relations copy for a group of celebrity wives with perfect hair and environmental interests Yet she forms a friendship with one of these women Ginny McKuen wife of the handsomest movie star in the Western world that leads her to a gala film opening and a hideaway in the Rockies among the McKuens playful illustrious friends During this busy time Jan also leaves her husband to take up with Nat Spaeth a basketball star of considerable charm and humor Not only does Nat love her he refuses to  Brina Caplan teaches in the expository writing program of Harvard University accept her excuses for inertia Stop blaming Frank he scolds and stop blaming me Maybe youre not used to being out in the open  taking chances and making mistakes  You play like a child You start whining when things dont go your way By the end of the novel his sportsmans perspective has helped Jan to transform her own In truth however Jans clearer vision results less from consistent changes in character than from radical changes of circumstance One week she is a mere attachment to Franks ego and the Electrolux two weeks later an autonomous woman she frisks in the Colorado snow with superstars of sport and cinema Although Nat insists that the courage to risk loss differentiates adults from children the novel with its tirelessly breezy dialogue and its plot racing toward romantic denouement actually speeds by opportunities to realize this difference And so by its close A Good Sport has required of its heroine only the courage to accept more comfortable conditions  Time changes nothing says the heroinenarrator of Marianne Mackays first novel We change In Prisms Miss Mackay records alterations in the life of Virginia Adams Muir who at 13 relies on scotch to supply the magic I lacked for living and who at 25 must recover from the terminal stages of alcoholism Virginias early childhood is surrounded by laughter tenderness and time to play a magical abundance provided by her loving father the pilot for an American sugar plantation in Santo Domingo World War II forever shuts her outside the gates of this tropical Eden Her parents move to the harsher climate of the mainland her father dies in a military plane crash and her mother takes on another husband an incompetent with the surly habit of punching his stepdaughter in the face Essentially on her own Virginia must complete the difficult task of exchanging prized lost pleasures for the more perplexing and uncertain rewards of adulthood In many ways she succeeds Despite her stepfathers taunts and her mothers quiet drinking Virginia leaves girlhood a complex very contained but passionate woman After prep school she spends a year in Paris painting when her money runs out she returns home and eventually makes a place for herself as a producers assistant in the hectic New York theater world Along the way men love her and women seek her friendship Repeatedly however like spasms in a weakened muscle there are attacks of fierce selfannihilation I carried the bottle and a glass to the living room and sat in the darkness watching the stairs How many times had I found my mother doing this very thing Now I understood I understood the futility my own helplessness The answer was in the bottle only it could anesthetize me  In Prisms demonstrations of competence and experiences of utter hollowness exist side by side and all too often the narrative voice that might correlate them emotionally remains instead passively descriptive enumerating moments in time like dust motes floating in the sunlight Many of these motes have the weight of boulders however Besides Virginias childhood dispossessions Prisms recounts her rape in Paris her friend Pams confession of incest followed by her alpine suicide a New York lovers sudden desertion Virginias backroom abortion and just before her own hospitalization for alcoholism her mothers cruelly prolonged treatment for toxic encephalopathy Although convincingly presented these events want analysis Even Job demanded answers Unlike that inquiring sufferer however Virginia is

SOME NEWCOMERS SOUND LIKE OLDTIMERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/22/weekinreview/some-newcomers-sound-like-oldtimers.html,So powerful were the Republicans last November that even in the liberal bellwether states of New York New Jersey and Connecticut many Democrats could offer only scant resistance As a consequence the Democratic margin in the regions combined congressional delegations slipped from a commanding 41 to 19 to a less formidable 34 to 26 Those losses must have loomed even larger last week to Democratic leaders in Congress who confronted the task of staving off President Reagans cuts in Federal aid But as they end their second month in office the regions dozen new legislators many of whom had disagreed with their predecessors on just about everything seem to have adopted some of the same views especially on such locally important issues as the environment crime and transportation Indeed if last weeks reaction to President Reagans list of budget cuts was any indication the new members regardless of party labels can be counted on for support in what will likely be the regions first major legislative challenge resisting cuts in mass transit aid The local legislative prospects were enhanced recently as Congress reorganized and several veteran members moved up to subcommittee chairmanships important to the region They include Representative Robert A Roe of Wayne NJ whose Public Works Subcommittee on Water Resources plans hearings on the areas water shortage and Representative Charles B Rangel of Harlem whose Oversight subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee will enable him to look carefully into the proposals affecting Social Security Medicare Medicaid and welfare On the Republican side Representative Bill Green has become the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies And Representative James J Howard of New Jersey became chairman of the Public Works Committee with jurisdiction over transportation programs A Surprise for the Liberals But on many of the issues likely to emerge in the 97th Congress starting with the Reagan budget the single votes of the new members may be just as important as the committee posts of the old ones and some of the new members views must come as a welcome surprise to the areas liberal leaders The exception is Representative John LeBoutillier the only new arrival who seems a Sanforized conservative And Mr LeBoutillier whose district straddles the QueensNassau line and who spent perhaps half a million dollars defeating a leading liberal in the House Lester L Wolff insists that the mood of the country is going to be just as conservative But Gregory W Carman another Long Island Republican who was elected with Conservative Party endorsement expressed some very unconservative ideas in a recent interview saying for example that he would push for Federal aid to transportation a position also pushed by the Democrat he defeated Jerome A Ambro The third Long Island Republican elected this year Raymond J McGrath succeeded John W Wydler and the change did not represent a swing in philosophy I consider myself to be a pragmatist Mr McGrath said On a lot of issues Jack was a lot more conservative on others more liberal Mr McGrath is a Roman Catholic and he referred to his religion in discussing his opposition to abortion While a member of the New York State Legislature he voted for laws guaranteeing equal rights to women but he said he now opposes a constitutional amendment with those guarantees because he fears it would lead to the drafting of women New Yorks House delegation lost one of its leading liberals when Elizabeth Holtzman gave up her seat to run unsuccessfully for the Senate It got another in exchange when Charles E Schumer won in the Brooklyn district The other new Representative from New York City Guy V Molinari of Staten Island won as a Republican with Conservative support but he has called for the Government to block a coalburning power plant the state wants to build in his district and to help in cleaning up toxic wastes Comparing himself with John M Murphy the man he beat and one of those defeated because of the Abscam investigation Mr Molinari said I am more conservative on domestic issues probably as conservative as he was on foreign affairs more liberal on environmental issues One of the new Republicans in the House from the northernmost district in the state David OB Martin said he would vote with other fiscal conservatives but isnt unwaveringly conservative in his views having for example voted in the New York State Legislature to decriminalize marijuana The other new Republican George Wortley whose district includes parts of Syracuse owns six small newspapers and he is quick to point out when asked about his opposition to the equal rights amendment that four of them have female editors In the Connecticut delegation Congress lost one of its keenest budget guardians when Robert N Giaimo retired but his successor Lawrence J DeNardis a Republican said My views are very close to his and thats what the voters indicated when they chose me The other new House member from Connecticut Samuel Gejdenson is an outspoken liberal Democrat who replaced Christopher J Dodd another liberal Democrat elected to the Senate In New Jersey another Abscamconnected loser was Representative Frank Thompson Jr one of the leading liberals in the House The Republican who defeated him Christopher H Smith was a leader of the antiabortion campaign in New Jersey He is also against capital punishment and he favors gun registration He will be a fiscal conservative he says but will support big Federal programs to clean up toxic waste dump sites a major problem in New Jersey The other New Jersey Republican in this freshman class is Marge Roukema the only newlyelected woman from the three states Mrs Roukema who defeated a liberal Democrat Andrew Maguire describes herself as a moderate She favors the equal rights amendment and publicly financed abortions for the poor and has embraced one of Mr Maguires ideas trying to force the assignment of a

BARBARA BUSH: THE PALNS IN HER LIFE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/22/arts/barbara-bush-the-palns-in-her-life.html,Whitehaired Barbara Bush wishes the great American public out there would drop the subject of her hair color She gets a stream of wellmeaning letters suggesting that she dye it a younger shade It makes me mad as the dickens she said adding ruefully If I did something like that I think all of America would fall flat on its face from astonishment Mrs Bush was relaxing with a cup of coffee in the sunny baywindow alcove of her new home the official VicePresidential residence Breezy and selfconfident with a strong handsome face devoid of makeup other than lipstick she has classic allAmerican looks Her blue eyes and fresh tanned complexion can be fully appreciated only in person not in photographs Plugged in Again As a photographer asked for a winning smile she laughed and remarked Unfortunately my winning smile makes me look as if Im being electrocuted  my kids are always looking at photographs of me and saying Look at Mom shes plugged in again  You know she said an old friend wrote me during the inaugural period and said she was glad to see I was wearing some makeup for a change and that I really looked well I thought the heck I did wear makeup I mean Born to comfortable circumstances her father Marvin Pierce was publisher of the McCall Corporation Mrs Bush has never regretted her decision at 19 to leave Smith College 36 years ago to marry George She has raised five children and followed her husband in jobs that have ranged from Congressman and head of mission in China to Director of Central Intelligence Plans to Travel Her present plans are to travel with George and be with him again I really missed him she said referring to the political campaigns of the last year that often kept them apart When there was no official residence VicePresidential wives lived in comparative anonymity in their homes in Chevy Chase Md or Arlington Va as did Muriel Humphrey and Betty Ford But no longer Since 1974 there has been the handsome official residence on Massachusetts Avenue with its pillared portecochere entrance broad veranda and staff of six The office of the wife of the Vice President now has a staff director a social secretary and a personal assistant So it is mandatory that VicePresidential wives have a project or two I have the same project in mind as I did when my aspirations for George were different she said alluding to his primary race for the Presidency I have a very simple aim  to wipe out illiteracy I am going to really encourage reading programs but its a thousand times bigger problem than I had envisioned  there are so many groups working at it She has joined the board of Reading Is Fundamental the program initiated by the late Margaret McNamara wife of the former Secretary of Defense and she is learning about other efforts The Bushes plan to entertain often she said President and Mrs Reagan among others have been there for dinner They had given a small dinner for six the night before in front of the fire and we had not one but two Grand Marnier souffles said Mrs Bush It was sinful I think the staff is trying out all of their desserts on us They held a party for old Washington friends who had helped house and feed the 150 family members who came for the Inauguration and a party for their staff and the Navy members who live and work on the grounds of the Naval Observatory where the residence is situated The Bushes new home already has a livedin look Its white walls and beige furnishings which served as a neutral background for Joan Mondales art collection have been brightened with a Western scene on loan from the Houston Museum of Art and two gold and azure Mandarin coats acquired in China have been stretched framed and hung In their years of marriage the Bushes have lived in 30 houses She knows from experience that nothing will ever get to look the way I want it  we will move just before I get it perfect she said But George wants instant moving she said When we moved to Houston he had invited the King of Jordan for dinner before we even had a house Ive done some volunteer work and some lecturing on China but Ive always thought that if I could get five children through college I would be a roaring success she said Asked About Feminist Issues During the campaign Mrs Bush was continually asked about feminist issues on which it was suspected that the Bushes differed with the Reagans It was the most insulting question she said When they wanted to know about womens issues I would say surely you mean inflation and unemployment and energy She added It is very well known that George and I are for the equal rights amendment but I have never told anybody about my feelings about abortion I dont agree with George Bush on every issue and I dont expect him to agree with me on every issue and we dont agree with the Reagans on every issue  but we are in agreement on most of the important things I was really surprised to discover that I enjoyed campaigning she said It was like being sent on a vacation Ive loved it all she said China was fascinating and when George was at the United Nations I felt as if I were being treated to a trip around the world every night only I didnt have to pack Im not terribly sympathetic with the theory that political wives have a hard time she said I think it really depends upon the husband If he shares like George Bush does then then everything is possible
Television Week,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/22/arts/television-week.html,Senora PeronAttempts at dramatizing the life of Eva Peron the wife of Argentine dictator Juan Peron who died in 1952 of cancer at the age of 33 after becoming one of the most powerful women in history have not met with critical acclaim Radley Metzgers 1973 film Little Mother was generally deemed a secondrate melodrama The musical Evita by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber although still going strong on Broadway since opening in September 1979 has been criticized by many for glamorizing a dedicated fascist Now television takes a stab at relating her story in Evita Peron a fourhour film to be presented by NBC in two parts beginning Monday at 9 PM The nearly 8million production stars Faye Dunaway in the title role with James Farentino as President Peron The script for Evita Peron was written by Ronald Harwood the British novelist and screenwriter who based his scenario primarily on two biographies by reporters for The Sunday Times of London Evita First Lady by John Barnes and Eva Peron by Nicholas Fraser I tried not to make this portrait of her sympathetic or unsympathetic Mr Harwood says There are certain things about Eva that are positively hateful The selflove The love of money The ruthlessness I believe Ive shown all sides of her But why the fascination with Eva Peron According to Selma Jaffe one of the films executive producers The real story of Evita needs to be told It is important for people in this country to know what actually happened under the Perons  their imprisoning or exiling of political opponents their closing down of most of the countrys newspapers their collaborating with German Nazis their squirreling of governmental funds in Switzerland What they did in terms of the denial of human rights represents a continuing universal problem If that is so then why cast as appealing an actress as Miss Dunaway as Eva Perhaps Monday nights opening installment will make

TELLING THE MARIA CALLAS STORY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/23/style/telling-the-maria-callas-story.html,Arianna Stassinopoulos says she has always thought of herself as a cerebral person and she has the credentials to prove it she studied economics at Cambridge graduated with honors and became the first woman to be president of the Cambridge Union the debating society Then the tall 5 feet 10 inches glamorous 30yearold native of Athens began to write what she calls theoretical books with titles like After Reason and The Other Revolution She was working on her fourth when she got a call from a London publisher who inexplicably asked her to do a biography of Maria Callas the fiery diva who died of a heart attack in 1977 Miss Stassinopoulos said no but the publisher persevered saying she was the right person to do the book because she was Greek and had been a reviewer of classical music She changed her mind and her book Maria Callas The Woman Behind the Legend a best seller in London is being published in the United States this week by Simon  Schuster Tonight the publisher will give a party for Miss Stassinopoulos on stage at Carnegie Hall where Miss Callas sang her last performance in New York Planned to Marry Onassis In her book Miss Stassinopoulos states that Miss Callas regretfully had an abortion in 1966 at the insistence of her longtime lover Aristotle Onassis and that shortly before his death in 1975 Mr Onassis was about to divorce Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis whom he called coldhearted and shallow so he could marry Miss Callas Last week Roy M Cohn the lawyer confirmed that he had been hired in 1974 to start divorce proceedings What prompted Miss Stassinopoulos to depart from her intellectual pursuits to write the sensational Callas book There were two reasons she said as she sat in the twostory living room of her rented town house in the East 60s The first is my memory of hearing Callas sing Norma when I was 10 years old it was a very exciting experience The second she said was the challenge of moving from theoretical writing to writing about human beings and emotions I was beginning to acknowledge other parts of myself the intuitive or emotional or whatever you call it I had become involved with meditation and yoga so the book sort of paralleled my own life The money she insisted was not a consideration My advance for the Callas book was only 3000 6900 she said No one expected the book to be a great commercial success myself included The first indication was when the Sunday Times of London bought the serial rights for 76000 174800  the highest theyd ever paid Since then Miss Stassinopoulos estimates that the book has earned more than 1 million in sales to 11 countries to the Book of the Month Club as a nonfiction special and to ABCTV The paperback rights have not yet been sold she said Miss Stassinopoulos said she thought that a major reason for her books success was that she had been able to speak with two sources who were unavailable to previous Callas biographers Miss Callass mother Evangelia whom the singer hated and had refused to see for more than 20 years and Miss Callass godfather Dr Leonidas Lantzounis who gave the author hundreds of personal letters from Miss Callas that the singer had asked him to destroy Miss Stassinopoulos smiled when she recalled the stroke of good luck that allowed her to meet with Miss Callass mother I arrived in Athens and she refused to see me because she was in the middle of the trial for Callass fortune she said One day I went to her house with flowers but she would not let me in At just that moment a frail old lady from next door came out and fainted We took her in and rubbed cologne on her forehead and Callass mother said to me You must need a drink After that she became almost maternal to me The auburnhaired author conceded that her Greek heritage had been very helpful in doing the book especially when I was able to speak Greek with Callass mother and godfather It also helped me understand some of Callass most primitive Greek reactions to life such as I dont mind if Onassis has affairs on the side as long as he comes back to me I dont share that sentiment but I did breathe it as a child Miss Stassinopoulos was born in Athens to a wealthy father who runs a management consulting firm Her parents are now separated and her mother Elli and her sister Agapi an actress moved with her to New York from London earlier this month While here Miss Stassinopoulos plans to finish work on her current book about the 1928 murder of a York Pa man who was regarded as a witch by the townspeople Well Known in England Miss Stassinopoulos is well known in England where she was a lecturer journalist and television personality Her first book The Female Woman drew attacks from British feminists but Miss Stassinopoulos insists the book is not antifeminist I think thats a distortion she said In my own life I have a career Im selfsupporting Im not married and I dont have children What I was saying is that you dont need to denigrate a traditional female function like motherhood in order to exalt another Among the transAtlantic guests at her publication party tonight will be Bernard Levin a columnist for The London Times to whom she dedicated the Callas book She said they had been closely involved for five years Its a very good relationship she said Theres no rivalry even though were in the same field Maybe its because hes 52 and Im 30 and he was so well established when we met that I was no threat At any rate hes always been very supportive

NEW YORK'S SENATE VOTE TO RAISE WELFARE GRANTS 15%,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/24/nyregion/new-york-s-senate-vote-to-raise-welfare-grants-15.html,After more than two hours of sometimes emotional debate the Republicanled State Senate voted today to give welfare recipients a 15 percent increase in the basic grant that they receive each month The vote was 34 to 24 Broad support from Democrats was supplemented by Republican moderates and antiabortion conservatives who heeded Senator John J Marchis call to recognize the plight not of the greedy but of the needy The bill would increase the basic public assistance grant for a family of four to 296 a month The current basic grant of 258 was fixed in 1974 to reflect the 1972 cost of living and has not been increased since then Under the Senate plan whose chief sponsor was the majority leader Warren M Anderson Republican of Binghamton the state would pay the entire cost of the increase The measure now goes to the Democraticled Assembly whose leaders have indicated they will wait for Governor Carey to negotiate his differences with the Senate before taking action The Governor wants an increase of 10 percent this year and 10 percent next year with local governments picking up part of the cost Senator Marchi a Staten Island Republican wagged his index finger at his colleagues and pumped his eyebrows up and down as he chided those who opposed an increase despite years of inflation Its not 1972 anymore he declared What do I say to little Tommy or little Mary age 8 or 9 What do I say  Buzz off small fry its 1972 because the Legislature says its 1972 But other legislators argued that increasing the welfare grant would hurt New Yorks economy by discouraging welfare recipients from looking for work or from moving to other states in search of employment Were going to drive industry out were going to drive productive people out said Richard E Schermerhorn RepublicanConservative of New Windsor Why should we work when we can get more by sitting around Slum Landlords Are Assailed That view was echoed by Senator Mary B Goodhue Republican of Mount Kisco who added that welfare recipients should be given jobs and training rather than looking at TV waiting for their children to come home  take the welfare mother out of her slum apartment She said the state should concentrate on rentgouging by slum landlords who she said were charging unconscionable rents to welfare recipients Rents are paid with a separate rent allowance Other legislators drew selfconscious comparisons as they stood in the well of the Senate chamber with its glistening goldleaf ceiling and handtooled red leather walls We take care of our own welfare here in the Legislature said Senator James H Donovan Republican of Chadwicks We make sure we dont fall behind Dont we have the same obligation to take care of those we serve He said the increase less than 10 a week for a family of four was less than most legislators would spend for dinner tonight Senator Donovan a leader here of the movement against abortion said that without higher welfare grants women would be more likely to have abortions than to bear children that they could not support If we dont care about the truly needy we promote an antilife philosophy in our state he said We ask welfare people to give up their children  dont have more children kill them  Under the Senate bill the grant increase would be regarded as an energy allowance  a move intended to keep recipients from losing benefits under the food stamp program It was unclear however how that would fare under President Reagans proposals for reductions in the food stamp program
CAREY BUDGET DRAMA UNFOLDING IN ALBANY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/24/nyregion/carey-budget-drama-unfolding-in-albany.html,The ritual theater opens with the chief actor  the Governor  standing before a backdrop of multicolored charts and promising aid for all in the coming year Enter the Finance Committee members a crew of wary legislators wearing traditional masks of disdain They sit in a long row and conduct hearings summoning before them the Governors commissioners who are chastised alternately for proposing to spend too much or too little Quickly it becomes clear who stands with the Governor and who against him The finale a marathon of noisy exchange joined by all lawmakers interested in reelection closes with the adoption of a budget for New York State This is the stylized Kabukilike ritual of budgetmaking in Albany and right now the Capitol is deep into the second act Mr Assemblyman said Health Commissioner David Axelrod your question is a very complex and thoughtful one Assemblyman James R Tallon replied crisply It was thoughtful last year Dr Axelrod chuckled Privately he agreed with Mr Tallons point  that the state was spending a great deal on care for sick people without increasing money for preventive medicine But as Mr Careys appointee the doctor was following a script that called for a convincing defense of the executive budget before the members of the legislative panel This dualism is part of the budget ritual one that Mr Tallon understands well Mr Tallon who is the Assemblys Health Committee chairman chose predictable closing lines I will try to force more money back into the 8182 budget I will be working on it as really my top priority After the hearing Dr Axelrod relaxed his official stance playfully yanked Mr Tallons tie and said You were really pulling my chain The problem is this is not the forum for resolving the issue said the doctor We have to do it in a closed room where we can yell and scream at each other You dont do it publicly In the hearing room amphitheaters set deep in the marbled halls of the Legislative Office Building Senator John J Marchi and Assemblyman Arthur J Kremer heads of their respective Finance Committees have been listening this month to friends and foes of the 161 billion Carey fiscal plan Most important in a series of 17 public hearings the legislators have been sharpening the positions they will take in next months budget negotiations The document upon which the whole drama is based  the 916page executive budget  gets no respect and neither does its author To begin with the disappearing deficit that it charts from a 790 million shortfall predicted last October to a 95 million surplus now forecast  is enough to shake anyones faith in the printed word A touch worthy of King Midas himself pronounced Mr Marchi Senator Warren M Anderson the Republican leader declared Houdini is back on stage again The fluidity of the figures concocted in the Governors secondfloor offices has served as an invitation to improvisation by the opposition Hence Senator Anderson scoffs at Mr Careys modest tax cuts and says there will be money aplenty in the states coffers for a 488 million tax cut Mr Marchi playing the chief skeptic of executive accounting has shown a gift for criticizing the Governor The Governor has been wrong before and he is about to be wrong again  and if the past is prologue deliberately said the venerable Staten Island Republican of the Governors revenue estimates Mr Marchi a gentle man who wears his thin hair in neat strands over his scalp turned in a tour de force this year by introducing as concrete evidence of what he said was the Governors misleading approach a computer model of the states economy Produced by Wharton Economic Forecasting Associates Inc the model spewed out 308 million more in tax revenues for 198081 and 198182 than the Governor had predicted Shaking the blue 14page report Mr Marchi said The Wharton econometric model is one used by the Congressional budget office the US Treasury Department its used by the Council of Economic Advisers it has resulted in a Nobel Prize It is I think the most respected approach the most sophisticated approach which has given the greatest yield in terms of reliable data This is the best in the country said Mr Marchi his voice rising and I submit that the track record on the second floor is rather bewildering Ronald Reagan wrote himself into this parochial state drama last week with his proposals for limiting the Federal share of Medicaid and support for mass transit Governor Carey had premised his 198182 budget on the states ability to pick up the billion dollar portion of the Medicaid program now paid for by the counties and New York City But Mr Careys director of policy management Michael DelGiudice vows the executive branch will stick to its original script The Federal changes he noted will not become effective until October which is the latter part of the state fiscal year Additional state expenses can be handled through the traditional escape hatches  the autumn supplemental budget or the January deficiency budget Our proposal is not going to change said Mr DelGiudice A fouryear takeover of Medicaid is still our objective An offstage huddle between Governor Carey and the legislative leaders Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink Senator Anderson and the minority leaders Assemblyman James Emery and Senator Manfred Ohrenstein  will block out the moves for the final act the adoption of the budget Will the Senate try to restore aid increases to localities or enact a larger tax cut Will the black and Hispanic caucus stand in the way of adoption until it gets more aid for the disadvantaged Will the Right to Life legislators bring the budget process to a halt by attaching antiabortion legislation to the fiscal plan The answers remain in the hands of the five scriptwriters The legislators will receive their lines within a month The reward for a smooth performance is an early and long Easter vacation

"Living Food;
MORE WOMEN IN 40'S HAVING BABIES",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/01/nyregion/living-food-more-women-in-40s-having-babies.html,PHYSICIANS say they are a new breed these women who are having children in their 40s generally women who had their first families at a much earlier age and now desire another child Part of a national trend toward later parenthood they are the first generation to reap the benefits from advanced medical techniques  among them amniocentesis  that have mitigated the risks and removed many of the fears of childbearing in midlife I believe that a main factor affecting the decisions of these 40plus women to have children is a personal desire  probably reached out of a sense of emptiness said Dr John Ayromlooi chief of the division of fetal medicine at Long Island JewishHillside Medical Center in New Hyde Park A number of Long Island obstetricians interviewed agree that the majority of midlife women they see are looking to start another family with the same husband solely for personal reasons They say that most of the pregnancies are planned and entered into with the absolute knowledge of any increased medical risk and that patients have not expressed any regrets after giving birth Statistics compiled by the Nassau County Department of Healths Office of Biostatistics show that in 1978 117 babies were born to women 40 and over In 1979 that figure in the county rose to 139 The total number recorded for all ages of women giving birth in Nassau in 1978 was 12933 and 13340 in 1979 Today women 40 years and older get pregnant with one thing in mind they want to have a baby to the exclusion of all else said Dr Vincent Mastrota physician in charge at the division of maternalfetal medicine at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset A decade ago a woman of 40 who got pregnant would hide the fact Her children were ashamed to tell their friends Now its almost a badge of honor Dr Mastrota said that generally these women make the decision voluntarily with a sense of equanimity He added Almost always this is a bilateral decision that both parents support In interpreting the trend toward later childbearing he related it to the emptynest syndrome saying that all the patients he sees over 40 have other children Some have expressed concern to him about feeling empty and unneeded Recently a 40yearold patient of his gave birth to a third child Her other children were young adults and out of the house She did not want to go to work or join the garden club the doctor said Above all she did not want to face an empty home If a middleaged woman desires a baby Dr Mastrota said he supports her as long as she understands what shes going into Raising a preadolescent in your 50s requires thought and energy he said Although he does not believe there is much increased medical risk for a healthy woman who has had normal pregnancies  the risks are primarily social and come in the future he said  Dr Mastrota recommends that amniocentesis a sampling of the mothers amniotic fluid that can identify chromosome abnormalities such as Downs syndrome and neural tube defects be performed In agreement is Dr Ayromlooi who is adamant about carefully monitoring midlife pregnancies routinely performing all kinds of antenatal testing Although Dr Ayromlooi does not believe there is a dramatic upswing in the numbers of women in their 40s having babies because of his work with highrisk patients he frequently sees pregnant women in this age group The trend he believes is quite variable in different areas Last year one of his patients a 46yearold mother of three whose youngest child was 18 delivered the most beautiful baby on earth he said This woman achieved her goal She proved to herself that she is still capable of reproduction I believe she considers this baby a gift to herself and a redefining of her own identity Dr Ayromlooi recalled that when this patient came for consultation no one liked the idea except herself Her husband was hesitant Everybody was telling her Have an abortion She defied the whole family because she wanted another baby in the house Today words such as joy and Gods will spring from Rosemary Amorusos lips when describing her family life in Dix Hills with her new daughter Maria Mrs Amoruso described the strong disapproval she faced from family friends and the medical establishment with the exception of Dr Ayromlooi I was told I was too old and was put under a lot of pressure to abort but I felt it was Gods will she said addingYou cannot imagine our joy today Describing the early days of her marriage when the family lived in a small apartment with three children who were born 17 months and 21 months apart she said I cannot remember anything about those harried days Today they own a spacious house on over an acre Tending to a baby today involves no selfdenial for her she said she did not wish to return to the old days of lunching out and going to museums According to Dr Richard S Travis an obstetrician in Woodmere whose maternity caseload averages 300 yearly Midlife pregnancies are occurring more and more and most of the women over 40 that I see are not having a first child He recently delivered a baby to a 47yearold woman who has a 9yearold daughter Dr Travis believes that one factor responsible for the trend is that women are getting married later in life While the majority want two or three children he said they plan and space them so it takes till age 40 or 42 to complete the family Speaking of contraception and abortion  in New York State he said a woman can have a legal abortion up to 24 weeks into her pregnancy  and the techniques of prenatal genetic diagnosis that are available he commented It is no longer a question of why they are having babies when they are over 40 It is why shouldnt they provided that they are healthy people Pointing out that women over 40 as a group do show a higher risk of difficult labor hypertension and diabetes he said They must know about the abnormalities that could occur Believing that a social question also is involved Dr Travis said that a woman must look beyond the decision to give birth and evaluate her attitude toward rearing a child in later life It is different when you are 40 he said than when you were 25
UNREALISTIC ADVISE TO ADOLESCENT GIRLS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/02/opinion/l-unrealistic-advise-to-adolescent-girls-025814.html,To the Editor President Reagans consideration of Marjory Mecklenburg to head the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs is unfortunate as well as ominous in its implications for the wellbeing of 11 million teenagers Mrs Mecklenburgs support of the position that contraception should not be the first line of defense against unwanted pregnancies news story Feb 18 would be inappropriate in a public official responsible for adolescent pregnancy prevention Educating adolescents to postpone sexual involvement may be a worthy goal but it is neither an alternative to contraception nor a philosophy on which the Government can base its programs to prevent unwanted pregnancy Postpartum and abortion counselors can testify to the appalling number of repeat abortions among teenagers who refused contraceptive education while vowing never to have sex again ROSALYN UDOW Great Neck LI Feb 18 1981
"REPUBLICAN PEACE PREVAILS, EVEN AT MICHIGAN SORE SPOTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/02/us/republican-peace-prevails-even-at-michigan-sore-spots.html,Gov William G Milliken told Michigans Republicans to be united if they wanted to win President Reagan sent a friendly telegram And Melvin L Larsen the Governors choice for Republican state chairman easily defeated a challenge from the right Yesterdays singularly civil activities at their state convention here illustrated the fact that these days Republicans cannot get a good conservativemoderate fight going over almost anything Ideological peace prevails even in states like Michigan where the conservatives who run the party nationally are largely excluded from state power It has often been different not only in the years of Barry Goldwaters ascendancy in the party in the mid60s but also after Mr Reagan tried for and narrowly lost the 1976 nomination Four years ago Mr Reagans followers angry at a previous Milliken choice for state chairman William McLaughlin for his allout support of President Ford in the 1976 Presidential primary here took a run at him and managed 44 percent of the vote as Mr McLaughlin was reelected to a twoyear term Only 34 Percent This Time Yesterday some of them tried again but their candidate Harry Veryser an automobile parts manufacturer who is head of the Michigan Conservative Union got only 34 percent against Mr Larsen One key reason was that last years Reagan campaign chairman in Michigan John Gnau supported Mr Larsen Leftright ideological quarrels played a part in the beginning but not the end of the only other intraparty Republican fight of note this year the Jan 31 dispute for the party chairmanship in Iowa Stephen Roberts the incumbent who was like Mr Larsen in that he had tried to stay neutral in last years Presidential nomination race was challenged by Frank Tedesco an Ames businessman and party conservative After 16 ballots at a convention of the state central committee he was beaten but not by Mr Tedesco The winner was Bennett Webster like Mr Roberts a Des Moines lawyer and party moderate Personality and 1982 gubernatorial politics mattered more than anything else in that fight There are some obvious reasons for this good temper in state Republican Party circles and the biggest ones are laid to Mr Reagans election as President The Power That Matters Most His supporters now have the power that matters most and the White House wants and needs the support of moderates like Governor Milliken or Robert Ray the Governor of Iowa That leads to cooperative moves such as the telegram read at yesterdays state convention in which Mr Reagan told Mr Larsen You may be proud as I am of your contributions to the Republicans success in 1980 That the Republican establishment did not bitterly oppose Mr Reagan in 1980 even when it had withheld its backing for the nomination also makes a critical difference Mr Gnau a lobbyist in Lansing and Washigton said that Mr Larsen had kept his word to be neutral in the primaries then worked like hell last fall Another factor is that the issues the Republicans used to fight about have receded in emotional importance as the party as a whole became more conservative The only impassioned dispute on issues at the convention here was over the best method of choosing justices for the State Supreme Court Pragmatism the New Theme F Clifton White a leading operative in the Goldwater campaign and an adviser in Mr Reagans said in a Washington interview last week that he saw several reasons for the much lower level of internal antagonism than existed previously One of the most important he said was that a lot of the new right people have developed a new theme  pragmatism Moreover the party has changed in its complexion and the waning Eastern establishment no longer considers allout conservatives as they did Mr Goldwater and his followers as a total aberration But the most important difference Mr White said was the support given Mr Reagan by establishment politicians like Mr Milliken That sort of thing tends to reduce the flow of the adrenaline from the ideologues who would otherwise be out to get them he said There were faint hints of that excitement when Mr Veryser was praised in nomination speeches for his opposition to abortion or because he had supported Mr Reagan before it became fashionable But most of the open campaigning dealt with who could better organize and run the party Isnt It Wonderful Mr Milliken himself praised Mr Reagan and his economic program at great length in his speech He must have our support the Governor said He has mine Then his Reagan credentials reasserted he warned the delegates that they were part of a minority party that needed no litmus tests to whittle down its adherents still further This party is not a secret society with elaborate invitation rites he warned cautioning the delegates against leaving the convention hall with a residue of ill will After the votes were tallied there seemed little evidence of bitterness Rannie Riecker the moderate national committeewoman whom conservatives have tried to oust recalled a conversation with a longtime party foe a real rightwinger who turned to me and said Isnt it wonderful now were all voting for the same people 
ALMOST EVERYBODY SEEMS TO WANT TO WRITE CAREY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/02/nyregion/almost-everybody-seems-to-want-to-write-carey.html,Interest groups who want to make sure their arguments are heard by the right parties write to Governor Carey So did a New York City man who needed help in resolving a trafficticket problem a couple who wanted something special to commemorate their 50th wedding anniversary and a 10yearold boy who wanted to know if Mr Carey enjoyed his job Every day hundreds of pieces of correspondence arrive in the Governors office here  requests complaints inquiries petitions and notes from wellwishers who want an acknowledgment from the man many of them claim to have elected to office Last year 228741 letters including an invitation to a Rochester womans 115th birthday party were delivered to Governor Carey up from 162830 in 1979 In the five years the state has kept tallies of correspondence to the Governor the volume record was set in 1977 when 427131 letters  132658 dealing with the landings and takeoffs of the Concorde SST at La Guardia and Kennedy International Airports  were written to Mr Carey Reduction in School Aid While such topics as gun control and abortion dominate the correspondence Mr Careys aides say his recent proposal to reduce state aid to school districts has brought him more criticism than any other topic The aides say that the Governor wants to respond to all of those inquiries personally but that it would leave him very little time to devote to his responsibilities as chief executive of the state Accordingly a staff of about 16 people in the Correspondence Control Unit sifts through the piles of letters to determine which ones need a personal response from Mr Carey which can be handled by aides to the Governor or by individual agency heads and which ones require no response Some people just want to bring something to the Governors attention mainly the petitions and letterwriting campaigns said Vincent Scalzo the units director The letter from the gentleman with a trafficticket problem would have been sent to one of the heads in the State Motor Vehicles Department Then there are people who want the Governor to attend a special function and those letters are handled by Mr Careys scheduling staff Great Variety of Motives People seem to write the Governor for almost any reason Incarcerated individuals want pardons politicians want something extra for their districts housewives and children just want to say hello A 70yearold woman appealed for help in getting a crack in the sidewalk outside her home repaired and others have remembered to send a birthday card or Christmas greeting to the head of state I would like to ask a favor began one handwritten letter If you can help us I am sure not only I but also the citizens of Dolgeville NY will be most appreciative The matter is a simple one The village of Dolgeville NY is requesting that the name of Dolgeville be imprinted on the thruway exit sign at Little Falls NY Twentyeight days after the Governors office received the letter Robert J Morgado Secretary to the Governor wrote the resident to inform him that the villages name would be added to the Little Falls exit sign at Interchange 29A by spring Requests for a Greeting Persons wishing a special greeting from the Governor are normally sent a card or in some cases a singlepage proclamation signed Hugh Carey Governor So many New Yorkers have asked for a gubernatorial happy anniversary or happy birthday wish however that only 50th wedding anniversaries are acknowledged and birthday greetings are sent only to persons 75 years old and older Children who write to ask if the Governor likes his job receive a yes reply along with a biography of Mr Carey and an outline of the Governors duties Anyone wanting a photograph of Mr Carey can get an 8by10inch glossy just for the asking Except for what Mr Scalzo called certain special cases the Governor does not sign all the mail personally the Correspondence Control Unit uses a signature machine which Mr Scalzo said does an excellent job in signing the Governors name Nothing Taken Lightly Painstaking efforts are taken not to dismiss or take lightly any piece of mail the Governor receives I remember one 20page handwritten letter that took me forever to decipher Mr Scalzo said But the letter raised some legitimate points Even the letters that ramble on and on without making any apparent specific point must be read You never know when they may contain a threat to the Governor or have something legitimate to say Mr Scalzo said In his 13 years in the correspondence unit Mr Scalzo conceded he has opened personal letters to Mr Carey But after a while he added you get to know the names of relatives close friends and so forth and they go directly to Mr Carey Because the unit does not maintain a breakdown of the types of letters sent to Mr Carey it is difficult to determine from the mail whether New Yorkers believe the Governor is doing a good job They dont say so that often Mr Scalzo said But if they didnt believe he could help them they wouldnt write
SMITH ORDERS STUDY ON VIOLENT CRIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/06/us/smith-orders-study-on-violent-crimes.html,Asserting that violent crime had increased 59 percent in the last decade Attorney General William French Smith appointed an advisory committee today to tell him what the Federal Government should do about it Mr Smith said former Attorney General Griffin B Bell and Gov James R Thompson of Illinois would be cochairmen of the group the Attorney Generals Task Force on Violent Crime It will offer a prelimary report in 60 days and final recommendations this summer Members of the panel besides Mr Bell a Democrat and Governor Thompson a Republican are James Q Wilson professor of government at Harvard David L Armstrong Commonwealths Attorney for Jefferson County Ky Frank G Carrington a Virginia Beach lawyer who champions the rights of crime victims Robert L Edwards of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Police Chief William L Hart of Detroit and Wilbur Littlefield the public defender for Los Angeles County Crime was studied by several Presidential commissions in the 1960s Some Justice Department surveys suggest crime may not have increased as dramatically as Mr Smith says it has He insisted that the Federal Government would be neglecting an obvious public sentiment if it did not place more emphasis on the problem Last year 30 percent of all households in the United States were touched by some serious crime Mr Smith said today at his first news conference Since 1970 the incidence of violent crime in this country has increased 59 percent while the population has increased less than 10 percent In the single year from 1978 to 1979 violent crime increased 11 percent and the preliminary data for 1980 indicate that violent crime increased an additional 10 percent Gun Control Opposed He said however that he opposed gun control often suggested to combat violent crime The Reagan Administration he said feels very strongly that this problem can be better dealt with by more stringent enforcement and more strict sentencing Reversing his recent predecessors Mr Smith said Congress could legislate exceptions to the appellate review powers of Federal courts to remove particular issues from the jurisdiction of Federal judges There have been proposals to divest the Supreme Court of its review power on school prayer school busing and abortion Without commenting on the merits of any specific proposal Mr Smith said Thats a prerogative of Congress Mr Smith would not confirm reports that a Federal grand jury was investigating Frank Sinatra and some of his close associates in a case involving the alleged skimming of money from a theater in Tarrytown NY Mr Smith said that he would not make public his official telephone logs as his most recent predecessors Mr Bell and Benjamin R Civiletti had Such openness he said was an overreaction to Watergate His conclusions about violent crime were based mainly on the Uniform Crime Reports of the Federal Bureau of Investigation The validity of those statistics has been debated over the years In 1973 the Justice Department developed an alternative method of measuring crime based on household interviews Reporting on its latest household survey the departments Bureau of Justice Statistics announced last September Serious crime rates remained essentially unchanged between 1973 and 1979
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT DRIVE ON BALANCED BUDGET PUSHED ANEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/06/us/constitutional-amendment-drive-on-balanced-budget-pushed-anew.html,The drive to call a constitutional convention to propose a constitutional amendment requiring the Federal budget to be balanced has started up again and two State Legislatures narrowly failed to adopt the measure today In Missouri and then in Washington State foes attached amendments to the proposal that kept their states from completing action and immediately joining the 30 states that have already asked Congress to call a convention The Constitution stipulates that such a call must be issued after 34 states request it although some authorities have argued that the fact that the 30 resolutions are not identical is a fatal defect in this neverbeforeused method of constitutional change But in both states proponents contended that they could get those amendments deleted in HouseSenate conferences and could then get the basic proposal passed The National Taxpayers Union an organization that attacks what it considers excessive Federal spending and is leading the effort nationally said it believed that four more states could be found to pass the proposal this year David Cohen president of Common Cause said that his public affairs lobbying group was still working against the plan in the states He said that opponents should not rely on technical differences in the texts of different states proposals since their similarity of purpose was clear but rather should oppose a convention because it might seek to tamper with other elements of the Constitution Congressional Move Seen George Snyder president of the National Taxpayers Union who is a former majority leader in the Maryland State Senate said he believed that a convention could be limited to the budget issue But in any case he said he did not believe a convention would be held because the pressure from two or three more state requests would cause Congress to propose such an amendment on its own He said that had happened in the case of the amendment requiring popular election of senators All the amendments that have been adopted or even considered by the states have been proposed by Congress A spokesman for the Senate Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on the Constitution said today that hearings would begin next Wednesday on such an amendment He also said the subcommittee would soon begin work on a bill to detail procedures for a convention if one is ever held A spokesman for President Reagan said that the Administration did not have a position on the convention issue Larry Speakes a deputy press secretary said of Mr Reagan As a general policy he supports a requirement that the Federal Government balance its budget His preference is that the balanced budget be implemented legislatively The measure got its greatest impetus in 1979 when eight states passed it but none were added in 1980 Mr Snyder said today that his side had seven or eight states to work on with some hope of success Delays in Ohio and West Virginia In both Ohio and West Virginia the State Senate has passed the measure But the Speakers of both State Houses are seeking to keep the issue bottled up and off the floor Mr Snyder said that other states where the measure might be pushed this year were California Montana and Alaska Today the Missouri House on an 85to76 vote deleted the State Senates provision calling for a constitutional convention leaving only a call for Congress to balance the budget One foe State Representative Joe Holt of Fulton argued that a convention might result in efforts to write provisions on abortion gun control busing and equal rights for women Lets not tamper with the document he said State Representative Guy Sharpe of Hannibal backing the convention call insisted If were ever going to balance the Federal budget now is our chance The State House Speaker Bob Griffin of Cameron said later that while he had been surprised by todays vote he still expected to get the original version out of a HouseSenate conference and get it passed But todays action caused him to cancel plans to fly from Jefferson City to Washington for a press conference In Olympia Wash the State Senate added an amendment to a Housepassed measure in order to require a statewide referendum on the convention call House sponsors attacked that move as chicken and said they would try to get it removed in conference

REAGAN SAYS BAN ON ABORTION MAY NOT BE NEEDED,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/07/us/reagan-says-ban-on-abortion-may-not-be-needed.html,President Reagan who in his election campaign strongly supported a constitutional amendment prohibiting abortions said today that such an amendment would not be necessary if Congress determined that a fetus was a human being because then its life would already be protected Now I happen to have believed and stated many times that I believe in an abortion we are taking a human life the President said in answer to the last question of his news conference today But if this is once determined then there isnt really any need for an amendment Because once you have determined this the Constitution already protects the right of human life The President noted that the question of when and what is a human being was before Congress To get around the difficulties of passing a constitutional amendment some of the antiabortion groups on Capitol Hill are supporting legislation introduced in January that would have Congress declare that human life begins at the moment of conception Possible Birth Control Curb Seen The bills were introduced by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina and Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois Opponents say that the legislation would also prohibit the use of birth control methods that stop the fertilized egg from developing President Reagan said that he was not opposed to the use of contraceptives Karna Small deputy White House press secretary said that President Reagans remarks did not indicate a shift in position Thats a great big huge if she said referring to the pending legislation adding that it was unlikely that Congress would make such a determination In the meantime he still backs a constitutional amendment Mr Reagan passed up a chance to cut end his answer to abortion question by accepting a Thank You Mr President the sign that a Presidential press conference has ended He continued No as I say I think the idea of human life once it has been created and establishing that fact  and maybe I shouldve just taken your thankyou and left here on this  is the whole issue that we have to determine
"REAGAN AIMS TO CUT 37,000 FEDERAL JOBS, SAVING $1.3 BILLION",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/07/us/reagan-aims-to-cut-37000-federal-jobs-saving-1.3-billion.html,President Reagan announced today that he was replacing his temporary hiring freeze with new permanent ceilings that were to reduce Federal employment by 37000 jobs by Sept 30 1982 at a twoyear saving of 13 billion Administration sources said later that the reduction meant an undisclosed number of workers now on the Federal payroll would lose their jobs although attrition would account for most of the employment cutback In his second news conference since taking office Mr Reagan cautioned that it could be several months and perhaps Transcript of news session page 10 over a year before the nation saw more than beginning signs of improvement from his economic recovery program Mr Reagan also hinted that he might use the veto power to protect from Congressional alteration the threeyear 10 percent annual tax cut that is a key element of the program announced on Feb 18 Defends Decontrol of Oil The President defended his decision to decontrol the price of oil ahead of schedule saying that his Administration could be blamed for only 3 or 4 cents of the recent increase of 10 to 14 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices That increase would have reached consumers in October anyway Mr Reagan said In a jovial halfhour session in which he took questions from reporters who had drawn lots for the right to address him Mr Reagan also did these things  Appeared to back away from his previous endorsement of a constitutional amendment banning abortion by saying that clarification of laws defining human life could make such an amendment redundant Page 11  Said he would offer a national drugabuse program that would put its main effort into warning young people about the dangers of drug use rather than into attacks on narcotics smuggling  Defended his 445 billion in budget reductions against the charge that the cuts take essential services from the poor  Asserted that his proposal of 10 percent annual tax cuts for three successive years would stimulate savings and investment instead of feeding inflationary spending  Assailed the curtailment of grain sales to the Soviet Union as unfair to farmers but added that it could not be lifted because of foreign policy considerations Mr Reagan appeared relaxed and in a good mood when he met reporters at 2 PM in the old Executive Office Building and with obvious pleasure he reverted to a habit of his campaign days of diverting hostile questions with humor For example Sarah McClendon the longtime correspondent who represents a string of Texas newspapers asked Mr Reagan if his rule for dissident Republicans was off will go their heads Mr Reagan smiled cocked his head paused for effect and said How can you say that about a sweet fellow like me In response to another question critics allegations that he is warlike the President feigning amazement cracked Ive been here more than six weeks now and havent fired a shot He also drew a big laugh by referring to the lottery system in which he drew the names of his questioners from a jellybean jar as Reagan Roulette Employment Figures Revised The White House press office disclosed after the news conference that the President had been incorrect in stating that the new employment ceilings mandate a cut of almost 100000 jobs below the employment levels projected by the Carter Administration for the 1981 and 1982 fiscal years The actual number of the reductions in such authorizations should have been 63100 said Karna Small the deputy press secretary The reduced authorizations mean that there will be 27000 fewer employees on the Federal payroll by September 1981 and 37000 fewer by the end of September 1982 Right now there are about 21 million Federal civilian employees exclusive of the Postal Service Mr Reagan said the reductions show his determination to put Washington on a diet but neither he nor Administration spokesman contended as they had in presenting other budget cuts that this action was evenhanded Mr Reagan exempted civilian employees of the Department of Defense from his order Pentagon civilian employment is scheduled to rise by 49600 to a total of 1025000 by October 1982 Variations by Departments Mrs Small said later that employment in some other departments and agencies would increase as well while other divisions of Government would be hit especially hard by the employment reductions Some of the dismissed workers may be protected by Federal reemployment rights that will enable them to find jobs elsewhere in Government The imposition of the ceilings to be made official next week follows a Federal court ruling last week that Mr Reagans hiring freeze was legal However Mrs Small said the freeze prevented the shuffling of employees within or between departments and the Administration favors the ceilings announced today as giving greater flexibility in assigning workers In cautioning against exaggerated expectations for his budget actions Mr Reagan said I hope that the public would understand this  that one of the things that must be realized is were not promising any instant cure We dont believe that in the matter of several months or probably even in the first year were going to see more than beginning signs of recovery He added that we should begin to see some effects I would think by the end of the 82 year  a reference to Sept 30 1982 the date ending the next fiscal year
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESIDENT'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/07/us/transcript-of-president-s-news-conference-on-foreign-and-domestic.html,MATTERS Following is a transcript of President Reagans news conference in Washington yesterday as recorded by The New York Times OPENING STATEMENT President Reagan How do you do I have a brief opening statement before turning to your questions Today Im instructing the Office of Management and Budget to include in the budget package that we will send to Congress next Tuesday a plan for the reduction of nondefense personnel in the Federal Government Under this plan we will replace the temporary hiring freeze with new permanent ceilings that will reduce Federal employment by nearly 33000 this fiscal year and another 63100 in 1982 compared to the personnel projections of the last Administration In just two years these reductions will save the taxpayers 13 billion Millions of Americans today have had to tighten their belts because of the economic conditions and its time to put Washington on a diet too Gaining control of the size of Government getting our economy back on track will not wait Well have to act now and well continue to search for ways to cut the size of Government and reduce the amount of Federal spending and to achieve a trimmer more efficient more responsive Government for all the people And now we shall get on with our first attempt at Reagan Roulette QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Coup in El Salvador Q Mr President your Secretary of State has said that you would strongly oppose a rightwing takeover of the Government in El Salvador while your own White House spokesman has been less definite Just how strongly would you oppose such a coup And would it result in a complete cutoff of American aid both economic and military A Well I think what were all intending to say is that we would have to view very seriously such an attempt and such a coup Were there at the request of the Government were supporting a Government which we believe has an intention of improving the society there for the benefit of the people and were opposed to terrorism of the right or left And so we would have to view very seriously  I cant answer the last part of your question as to exactly what we would do But it would be of the gravest concern to us if there were such a thing Helen Veto of Tax Bill Q Mr President we know you dont like to tip your hand on legislation before the documents on your desk are dead but Mr Stockman who speaks with great authority for the this Administration and others who talked to you recently say that you are considering a veto of the tax bill if it is changed substantially Do they know whereof they speak A Well the veto is a tool of Government that belongs to the President and Ive never been reluctant to use it but you were right in your first statement I never talk about in advance whether I will or will not veto First of all I think I should say that I am reasonably optimistic Im not looking for a confrontation with the Congress and I have I think sufficient reason to believe that there is great bipartisan support for our program in the Congress And Im going to try to keep trying to work with them so that we wont face that particular problem Precautions in El Salvador Q Mr President Id like to ask you a twopart question on El Salvador First is a naval blockade an option you are considering And second isnt it a fact that several Americans have been murdered in El Salvador in the last several weeks and the advisers youre sending there could well be a special target for terrorists How do you intend to provide for the personal safety of those advisers And do you envisage the need for American troops as any sort of a security force for those advisers A Well it almost was three parts to your question so let me say the first part is I wont comment on anything we might be considering in the line of an action With regard to the safety of our personnel were taking every precaution we can We realize that there is a risk and a danger None of them will be going into combat none of them will be accompanying El Salvadorian troops in missions of that kind They will be in what has to be considered as reasonably safe a place as there can be in that country in garrison They are there for training of the El Salvador personnel We cant Im sorry to say make it risk free but we shall do our utmost to provide for their safety Q Just a followup Do you  do you not see the need for American troops as security forces in other words A No we  that is not in our reckoning at all We think were abiding by what it  nor has it been requested Weve had requested the people that we have sent there already and we dont foresee the need of any American troops Inflation and Jobless Q Mr President several of your advisers say that youre going to be in deep political hot water if the public doesnt get conclusive evidence at least by the end of the year that your economic program is leading to a slowdown in inflation and in reducing unemployment How long do you think Americans should wait before making a judgment on your program And to win a good mark from the public in your mind what specific progress must be made on the economic front A I think that one of the  and I hope that the public would understand this that one of the things that must be realized is were not promising any instant cure We dont believe that in the matter of several months or probably even in the first year were going to see more than beginning signs of recovery Because remember we have inherited one budget that still has never been passed  the Government is operating without a passed budget  but in a year that is pretty well gone So our first savings in this year are going to be reduced by that fact Oct 1 the 82 fiscal year begins I think it would be premature and I think no one should indicate that were promising an instant cure of these problems These problems have built up over several decades and theyre not going to go away overnight But we do believe that as the  if the economies are passed which  and they should be  and the tax program we should begin to see some effects I would think by the end of the 82 year First of all we would see a drastic reduction in the deficit that will take place in the fiscal year 82 But those things as they take place it takes some time before the effect of those is then felt out in the economy El Salvador and Vietnam Q Mr President Id like to get back to El Salvador for a second The United States role there is being compared with its role in Vietnam 15 to 20 years ago Do you think thats a valid comparison And also how do you intend to avoid having El Salvador turn into a Vietnam A I dont believe it is a valid parallel I know that many people have been suggesting that The situation here is you might say our front yard What were  it isnt just El Salvador What were doing in going to the aid of a government that asked that aid of a neighboring country  and a friendly country in our hemisphere  is try to halt the infiltration into the Americas by terrorists and by outside interference and those who arent just aiming at El Salvador but I think are aiming at the whole of Central and possibly later South America and Im sure eventually North America But this is what were doing is trying to stop this destabilizing force of terrorism and guerrilla warfare and revolution from being exported in here backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba and those others that weve named And we have taken that evidence to some of our allies So I think the situation is entirely different We do not foresee the need of American troops as I said earlier in this And were sending what some 50odd personnel for training Well we have such training squads in more than 30 countries today So this isnt an unusual thing that were doing Prospects for the Poor Q Thank you Mr President Despite what Budget Director Stockman says about sharing the burden of the proposed budget cuts I dont understand how the nations poor are going to survive this almost acrosstheboard cut in social programs Can you explain this since your proposed economic plan is not an immediate quick stitch A Yes I think I can Were not cutting into the muscle of a program where it is going to require taking aid away from those people that must have it First of all by putting many of the programs that are now categorical grants into block grants were getting rid of a rather expensive administrative overhead which will account for part of the savings Part of the savings also is going to be the manner in which these programs tend to expand And then government loosens the regulations a little bit and says Well we ought to include these people over here or these people over here and we find that we are giving the benefits of the program to people who do not have real need and for which the program was not originally intended I speak with some confidence of this because this is very much what we did in California with our welfare reforms We never had a single case turn up after our welfare reforms and some 350000 people in that one state disappeared from the welfare rolls We never had a single case of anyone suddenly appearing and saying I am destitute Ive been cut off welfare As a matter of fact most of those people disappeared of their own free will which led us to believe under the regulations which bound us in our administrative ability we were unable to really pin down how many people might be getting more than one welfare check And they just disappeared as the spotlight began to be turned on  possibly out of recognition that they were now going to be caught  the rolls just shrank And its this theory that is behind what were doing Our safety net of programs  the seven programs we spoke of  is intact And Im quite sure there will be attempts by those in the bureacracy who are involved in some of these programs to suggest that there is great distress being caused by them And we had the experience in California of seeing them actually attempt to penalize some of the truly needy until we could intervene simply to create cases of that kind And well be on guard for that Private Aid to Reagans Q The White House has taken the somewhat unusual step of asking private groups to raise money to promote your economic program and to refurbish the White House Could you tell us why the names of contributors to these programs are not being disclosed Wouldnt disclosure of the names be a way of assuring the public that there is no conflict of interest A Well there cant be any conflict of interest because we didnt have anything to do with it We know that such a program is going forward and we have no contact with it at all But these are people that were so enthused after the presentation was made of the program that apparently they are enlisting support just as those who are opposed to it are massing their forces together to oppose the program Curb on Japanese Autos Q Mr President there appears to be a debate within your Administration over whether to have mandatory or voluntary limits on Japanese auto imports Have you decided which you would recommend going with A We havent reached a decision on this We have a task force under Secretary of Transportation Drew Lewis Weve had one meeting with the task force a Cabinet meeting and the second meeting is scheduled for next week And until then no decisions have been made Such things are part of the considerations as well as whatever special things we can do mainly in the lifting of regulations that have made it more costly to build American cars and so forth All of this is going to be discussed and the decision made when we have the final report in from the task force And I think also that again we get back to our economic program I think that in itself is one of the first steps in helping not only that industry but other industries Prospect of War Q Mr President Id like to ask this question in context of the campaign One of the major issues was what was called the war issue at that time in fact the question whether you would lean more toward war than Mr Carter And in fact exit polls showed that some of those who voted did feel that you might get us into one faster The first major issue in foreign policy has been El Salvador which has been called risky and reckless by some and which the allies who you have shown many times that are very important and key to any question have not jumped on the bandwagon supporting you in El Salvador In fact in Canada theres some controversy Arent you worried about that fact especially since you go to Canada this week A Not really when you stop to think that I didnt start the El Salvador thing I inherited it And the previous Administration which probably was as vociferous in talking about my threat to peace they were doing what were doing  sending aid to El Salvador of the same kind of aid that were sending So I dont think that Im doing anything that warrants that charge Well I didnt think I warranted it before And Ive been here more than six weeks now and havent fired a shot Rights in El Salvador Q Mr President in addition to your decision to miliary aid and advisors to El Salvador what specific steps have you taken to insure that human rights violations there are not repeated A What steps to be sure that human rights violations will not be repeated As you know an investigation was going forward with regard to an episode that happened before I took office But in addition to the military aid we are also supplying general aid And they know our position with regard to the reforms the Duarte Government has been trying to implement  the land reform creating of farms for the former tenants and all  and we support all of that And one of our reasons for the support of this Government is because we believe that they do hold out the best hope for improving the conditions of the people of El Salvador So were mindful of that and we think that when the terrorists themselves the guerrillas boast of having killed  and they give a number somewhere above 6000 people in the last year and thats their own claim of what theyve accomplished  we think that we are helping the forces that are supporting human rights in El Salvador FTC Nominee Q Sir in the case of Mrs Patricia Bailey who was supposed to be named chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and who 12 hours beforehand had the ill fate to make a speech criticizing the cutback in money for her agency you participated in changing the papers on that supposed appointment which had been promised to Senator Baker and others and you went along with your money czar Mr Dave Stockman in pulling her back This involved money for an agency that would protect consumers Did you mean to give a signal to other Republicans that if they dont conform that off will go their heads A How can you say that about a sweet fellow like me No Sarah No Miss Bailey was one of the names under consideration and she did have the backing of Senator Baker and some others on the Hill But we also had forces that were supporting other candidates and we hear everyones case who recommends someone for a position and then comparing them all we just make our decision based on who we believe should have the job And there had been no decision made one way or the other until we named  made the final decision Canada Fishing Treaty Q Mr President sir in advance of your trip to Ottawa next week the most serious bilateral tensions between Canada and the United States remains the unratified East Coast fishing and boundaries treaty Are you committed to finding a solution acceptable to the Canadians Or are you prepared to see the fishing portions of the treaty at least put into diplomatic limbo A No I dont want to see them in diplomatic limbo and I want to see a settlement of this whole issue and have so informed our people on the Hill of that But this meeting there is going to be the first meeting Its going to be one of kind of establishing a base for future negotiations I dont know whether we will get down to hard issues and make any settlements in a first meeting of this kind but well certainly lay the groundwork for trying to eliminate anything that could divide us or remain a stumbling block to better relations Im  this is part of what I talked about all during the campaign from my first announcement on And that is to start here in the Western Hemisphere with building an accord between the three great countries of North America  Canada the United States and Mexico So Im sure that all of these things will be out on the table when we get there But well set an agenda for trying to resolve them Canadian Oil Policy Q Mr President the Canadian Government has an energy plan calling for 50 percent Canadianization of oil interests in that country and also added taxation of their production Its a plan that has caused some shift of production from Canada  I mean of exploration from Canada  to the United States What will you be advising Mr Trudeau next week when you visit with him on that plan And how is it going to affect US investments in that country A Well again I think  I wish you were asking me this after wed had the meeting Things of this kind  I would rather not state a case in advance These are things that I would rather take up when I get there and see how we can as I say set an agenda for getting them resolved With regard to energy I am determined that the proper goal for us must be energy independence in the United States  not that we would take advantage of either of our neighbors there with regard to energy supplies Q To follow that up would you advise Mr Trudeau to follow in your footsteps and speed up decontrol of oil and gasoline in that country as you have done here A Well theres a little touchy ground in a first meeting to try and advise somebody how to run their country I dont know that Ill do that I might talk about what weve done Policy on Drug Abuse Q Mr President in light of what appears to be a growing concern about the drug abuse problem especially among teenagers what will your priorities be and specifically do you expect to have a White House policy on drug abuse A Yes I do and in fact it can be stated as clearly as this I think this is one of the gravest problems facing us internally in the United States Ive had people talk to me about increased efforts to head off the export into the United States of drugs from neighboring nations With borders like ours that as the main method of halting the drug problem in America is virtually impossible Its like carrying water in a sieve It is my belief  firm belief  that the answer to the drug problem comes through winning over the users to the point that we take the customers away from the drugs not take the drugs necessarily  try that of course you dont let up on that But its far more effective if you take the customers away than if you try to take the drugs away from those who want to be customers We had a program in California again I call on that  we had an education program in the schools we had former drug users who had straightened out We found that they were most effective in talking to young people You could go in and I could go in and anyone else and try to talk to these young people and tell them the harm in this and get nowhere But when someone stood in front of them who said Ive been there and this is what it was like and this is why Im standing here telling you today we found they listened And I envision whatever we can do at the national level to try and launch a campaign nationwide Because I think were running the risk of losing a great part of a whole generation if we dont Aid to Turkey Q Mr President as you well know Turkey has been hit hard during the threeandahalf years arms embargo from the United States Do you consider to increase aid to Turkey on and above the amount President Carter suggested for fiscal 1982 which is 700 million And also would you favor military grant to Turkey A I  this is an awful thing to confess  I cant really out of all the programs remember where that figure stands Q The figure stands Mr President that the 400 million is the military aid and the 300 million is economic A But I mean I cant recall where our figures stand in comparison to that But I know that basically our philosophy is one of continued aid And knowing the problems that have existed between Turkey and another friend and ally of ours Greece were hopeful that whatever we can do in resolving any of the differences there we want to do But both countries are vital to us I consider them the southern plank of the NATO alliance And yes I think there will be improved relations Use of Tax Savings Q Mr President if you get the personal income tax cuts that you want and if people use their tax savings to just simply pay their bills as many of them may do and make down payments on consumer goods instead of investing the money in things that increase productivity where does that leave us Wouldnt inflation then be worse than it is now A It might be if that happened And we have done as much studying as we can of that including a thorough study of the twoyear program of tax cuts under President Ke  well President Kennedy started them and they went into effect following his tragic death and we have been very interested to note because there is a parallel between that type of tax cut and what it is were proposing At the bottom of the ladder spending la  yes There were people pressed as they are by inflation who found that they needed that money for purchases But as you went up the scale of earnings there was a great savings in  following those  that twoyear program during the program and following  a great increase in personal savings and investment by the American people Now we have what I think has to include the total middleclass of this country from 10000 to 60000 a year pay 72 percent of all the income tax They are going to get 73 percent of all of the benefits And it seems to me that in there maybe at the 10 level or below but as you begin to go up that ladder that is where there is going to be savings and investment And every indication we have from the past and from what weve been able to project now indicates that will take place again under this plan And that wont be inflationary that will be helpful to the business cuts were promoting in stimulating investment to increase productivity Decontrol of Oil Prices Q Mr President this mornings wholesale price figures seem to indicate that the fuel prices are still one of the prime motivating forces behind spiraling inflation In light of this are you having any second thoughts about your decision to decontrol the price of domestic oil especially in light of some estimates by economists that it has caused the price of gasoline to rise as much as 14 cents a gallon A No because decontrol was  we only advanced decontrol it was supposed to take place in a few months anyway And the increase in the price of gasoline today is only partly due to that decontrol Part of it was due to the decontrol that had begun under the previous Administration the major part of it was the latest increase in OPEC prices and we  our decontrolling now only amounts to 3 or 4 cents of the increase in the price of gasoline And that would have taken place in October anyway  that same decontrol We do believe that as time goes on that were going to see increased exploration and development of oil in this country and that is the road toward lower prices when supply begins to match demand more So we dont see any reason and I dont have any regrets about the change we made I think the increase in drilling that has taken place the wells that were unprofitable to pump  in 1976 we had some 400 wells in California that were closed down simply because at the price that the Government would allow them to charge they could not bring the oil to the surface for that price and sell it Well wells like that now under decontrol can go back into production Soviet Grain Embargo Q Mr President at your first press conference you were asked about the Soviet grain embargo and you said there were really only two options  either to abandon it or to broaden it Can you tell us which its going to be and if you havent reached a decision yet can you tell us what factors are still at play here A We havent reached a decision I think all of us would like to lift the embargo I still think it has been as harmful to the American farmer as it has been to the Soviet Union But the situation has changed from the time when it was first installed I was against it at the time I didnt think it should have been used as it was that if we were going to follow that road we shouldve gone up acrosstheboard and had a kind of quarantine We didnt But now we have to look at the international situation the way it is and see what would be the effect not just on the use of grain but the whole effect and what would it say to the world now for us to just unilaterally move Now were hopeful that we can arrive at a settlement and a decision on this and one that will benefit our farmers Start of Human Life Q Mr President since youve become a strong supporter of the righttolife movement whose leaders in Congress have introduced an amendment that human life begins at conception rather than birth how can parents or election boards determine a persons date of conception for purposes of registration and eligibility for running for public office A Well I think with a matter thats in the  before the legislature now there is going to be testimony by medical authorities theologians possibly legal authorities also and I think what is necessary in this whole problem and has been the least talked of in the whole question about abortion is determining when and what is a human being Now I happen to have believed and stated many times that I believe in an abortion we are taking a human life But if this is once determined then there isnt really any need for an amendment Because once you have determined this the Constitution already protects the right of human life Stand on Contraception Q You said during the campaign you noticed that all the advocates of abortion are already born Since this also applies to all advocates of contraception are you opposed to contraception which also denies the right to life A No I am not Q Are you going to explain it A Helen you just got even No as I say I think the idea of human life once it has been created and establishing that fact  and maybe I shouldve just taken your thankyou and left here on this  is the whole issue that we have to determine It seems strange to me that we have a law for example in California a law that says that if someone abuses or mistreats a pregnant woman to the point of causing the death of her unborn child that individual will be tried for murder We know that the law of the land gives an unborn child the right to inherit property and the law protects property rights Isnt it time we determined if there was some question if you found a body on the street and you didnt know whether it was dead or alive wouldnt you opt on the basis that it was alive and not start shoveling dirt on it This is what I feel about the other Until we determine and make to the best of our ability a determination of when life begins weve been opting on the basis of that well lets consider theyre not alive I think that everything in our society calls for opting that they might be alive Now thank you

BALLET: 'SYLPHIDE' UPSTAGED IN TORONTO,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/09/arts/ballet-sylphide-upstaged-in-toronto.html,The vagaries of a live performing art are such that the unexpected can be counted on even when it is least expected When the National Ballet of Canada announced that its fourth annual gala in Torontos OKeefe Center would consist of a few divertissements and a full program of August Bournonvilles La Sylphide with Carla Fracci Ib Andersen and Erik Bruhn as guest artists there was no doubt where the chief interest lay All three dancers are international stars and La Sylphide in the beloved 19thcentury Danish version of the Romantic classic seemed a perfect vehicle for them The Italian ballerinas great Sylphide has identified her closely with the title role for nearly 20 years Mr Bruhn once her incomparable James had recently transferred his artistry from his heros role to an outstanding dramatic character portrayal as Madge the witch and Mr Anderson now a shining light with the New York City Ballet but formerly a principal with the Royal Danish Ballet was making his North American debut as James Although Mr Anderson had danced the part for the first time only last week on a return visit to Copenhagen he was remembered as superb in other roles at the Royal Danish Ballets Bournonville festival The stage seemed set then last night for one of the grand ballet evenings of recent times As a matter of fact this Sylphide turned into a minor disaster Unexpectedly the high point of the evening became the first half with its bits and pieces danced excellently by principals from the three major Canadian ballet troupes  the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and Montreals Les Grands Ballets Canadiens as well as the home team from the National Ballet of Canada Not the least surprise in this strange but fascinating evening was the National Ballets willingness to serve up a collection of neurotic themes to a blacktie gala Yet when Judith Lander a Canadian cabaret singer belted out her confessional songs about adolescent prairie love abortions and multiple affairs  with Karen Kain and Frank Augustyn emoting on stage the audience lapped it up The prairie representatives themselves were the hit of the evening Evelyn Hart and David Peregrine of the Royal Winnipeg received a standing ovation after slithering through Belong Norbert Vesaks familiar sensual softrock duet For devotees of La Sylphide all this may sound as if mediocrity must have triumphed over a masterpiece Nonetheless what the first part of the evening displayed was a kind of overall commitment in performance that was absent in the second half The program opened with Plus One to Rachmaninoffs Vocalise The Nationals Clinton Rothwell devised a smoothly danced duet for himself and Mary Jago The craftsmanship was impeccable  so much so that one sensed the paradox of a romantic duet without any feeling Three pieces were created for the gala Sylvie KinalChevalier of Les Grands Ballets was an absolute delight in the quirky disjointed movements of Spring Dances Judith Marcuses Mozart solo She wore toe shoes but they were irrelevant to her blend of charming impudence and coquetry The Nationals Constantin Patsalas created a reverie for the comanys Nadia Potts dancing sweetly to Debussy in Reflections The only real major talent among the occasional pieces was revealed in James Kudelkas All Night Wonder to music from Benjamin Brittens Peter Grimes Torontos Veronica Tennant in a red dress and Raymond Smith in his underwear danced this lovewithaperfectstranger duet with terrific thrust It was full of both sinister menace and sustained dance interest Mr Kudelka confirms that he is a choreographer who will go places Miss Hart and Mr Peregrine deserved every iota of their ovation for Belong Both dance with the fluency the National Ballets style discourages  as seen in a correct but tame Corsaire pas de deux with Vanessa Harwood and Tomas Schramek When Diary Miss Landers songs as interpreted in Lynne TaylorCorbetts jazzmodern choreography was given by the Theater Dance Collection in New York the result seemed laughable Miss Kain and Mr Augustyn more balletic but also powerful offered more credibility This leaves La Sylphide There is no point in dwelling on what seems to have been a huge international misunderstanding Mr Andersen is too inexperienced in the role to parachute with minimal rehearsal into an alien production And Mr Bruhns production was very different in Act I from the current Danish version The result was an act with many dead spots no characterization from Mr Andersen and no rapport between him and Miss Fracci or Mr Bruhn Deprived of a hero the Miss Fracci and Mr Bruhn proceeded to give fine performances in splendid isolation With good corps work the next scene bore some resemblance to Act II Mr Andersen came alive in his dancing Miss Fracci more concerned with outline than with detail in hers still cast her spell as a mercurial and delicate sylph
"Constitution, Look Out",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/11/opinion/constitution-look-out.html,The legislatures of Missouri and Washington are close to petitioning Congress for a national convention for the purpose of amending the Constitution to require a balanced Federal budget They would be the 31st and 32d states to join the call only two short of the required twothirds of the state legislatures before Congress would have to respond That number 32 like every other aspect of this method of constitutional change is disputed But one thing is clear a constitutional crisis may be imminent An exaggeration If Congress deflected the call and proposed its own amendment instead the greatest danger might pass But if the drive for a convention persists it would open a path to wholesale even reckless revision The familiar way to amend the Constitution is for Congress to propose a change by twothirds vote and for threefourths of the states to ratify But the Constitution allows a second method by convention on call of twothirds of the states That route has never been traveled to the end though a convention drive did spur Congress to offer at least one amendment  the 17th providing for direct election of senators Even now some of the state resolutions express a preference for Congressional action Once begun theres no telling where the convention process might lead Scholars differ about every aspect of it Could Congress ignore petitions for a convention that are not identically worded or confined to precisely the same subject Could Congress dictate the method of delegate selection and limit the convention agenda The National Taxpayers Union which leads this campaign contends that a runaway can be prevented But the leaders of other causes  against abortion for the death penalty for prayer in public schools  will be tempted to enlarge the conventions business Congress should long ago have written rules for this process But even that task requires passing through a constitutional minefield How can Congress prevent a convention that runs away votes to repeal sacred constitutional rights and invites the states to ratify Its often said that many uninformed voters nowadays would reject even the Bill of Rights Does anyone want to test that proposition Theres mischief enough in the idea that propels this convention call A mandated balance of the Federal budget could tie the Government into fiscal knots or at best clutter the Constitution with easily evaded fiscal pieties No one prizes a balanced budget more than President Reagan but even he could not now run the country in such a straitjacket The Administrations current budget slashing for all its pain is a minor annoyance compared to the dislocations that such an amendment could provoke If foolish fiscal goals cannot be kept out of the Constitution they should at least be carefully devised over time with prudent escape clauses The convention method is so fraught with uncertainty and controversy it should be used only in the direst and most unlikely emergency  one that the nation recognizes but Congress and the President do not There is no justification for it now Todays tax revolt could not ask for a better friend in the White House and budget amendments stand to receive all the attention they deserve and more from Senator Thurmonds Judiciary Committee Citizens and legislators in 18 states mostly in the Northeast and Middle West should recognize this sudden threat to orderly constitutional processes West Virginia and Ohio are tomorrows battlegrounds Fresh attempts are expected in Wisconsin and Vermont They should hold the line
THOUSANDS JOIN IN QUEST WHEN IT'S LOBBYING DAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/11/nyregion/thousands-join-in-quest-when-it-s-lobbying-day.html,Thousands of constituents in search of state funds came teeming through the Capitols hallways today jamming the elevators clogging staircases and fairly bowling over legislators in their pursuit This is money time said Enid Schor from the State Parent Teachers Association as she jabbed a yellow association button into the lapel of Assemblyman Jon S Fossel of Katonah On the Tuesdays before the April 1 deadline for adoption of the state budget the yearround professional lobbyists are washed aside by a wave of amateurs people who would be directly affected by budget cuts The New York Library Association said it had 700 members here today including Ruth A Fraley director of the Hawley Library at the State University who had two students in tow as she climbed a staircase in the Legislative Office Building Were going for Nolan she said making her way to the office of Senator Howard C Nolan of Albany The Holders of Power Do you two have business cards she asked her neophyte charges Youre in his district It means you can vote for him or dump him if he doesnt back you up The key is he realizes youre part of his constituency Thats the place where you have power Then she added If you dont smile at the staff you wont get anywhere But at Senator Nolans office there was no room for Mrs Fraley Fifteen other librarians had arrived ahead of her and were listening to Joyce Roman the Senators administrative associate explain that the Senator was at committee meetings and had too full a schedule to see them Mr Nolan had already met today with two parentteacher association groups another group of librarians and the New York State Tenant and Neighborhood Coalition Its really sort of a zooey day Mrs Roman explained If you have handouts   The lobbyists choose these Tuesdays to make their pitch because virtually all the lawmakers are here early in the morning for committee meetings and for formal afternoon sessions of the Legislature Slowly Moving Traffic That makes Tuesday traffic patterns dense in the Legislative Office Building Movement was so sluggish today in fact that the consumer protection committee which meets in the eighthfloor office of Senator Joseph L Bruno of Brunswick had to postpone its 1130 gathering for 15 minutes while awaiting members caught in the elevator crush Mr Bruno who represents nearby Troy finds himself host to many more lobbying groups than the typical senator They usually come in larger numbers he said as he closed a meeting with a PTA group and sidestepped through a core of consumer lobbyists into the committee meeting They can just hop in a car and get here They dont have to fly in from New York or Buffalo As the consumer protection committee considered a short slate of five bills librarians began to mass outside Senator Brunos office and numbered about 25 by the time the committee broke up Ushered into Mr Brunos office the librarians asked him to support a library aid bill Francene Costello director of the Mahopac Library in Putnam County said she had ordered a book four months ago at 1295 but when it came in recently the price had shot to 1895 Vote for Libraries As someone stuck a Vote for Libraries pin on Senator Brunos lapel he exclaimed How did I get this far into the day without one of these Then he told the group softly and with a smile Our record shows we have always supported your work Does anyone want to challenge that Assemblyman Victor L Robles was visited by Planned Parenthood members from his Brooklyn district who asked that the state continue to finance Medicaid abortions Have you done your homework he said You have no problem with me Then he advised them that when dealing with their opponents in the Legislature Youre going to have to become as political as they are and go to their constituency The whole game up here is where the pressure of lobbyists is the greatest The Planned Parenthood representatives nodded their presence in Albany attesting to the fact that they had already learned the lesson
MORE TEEN-AGERS ARE PREGNANT DESPITE RISE IN CONTRACEPTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/12/garden/more-teen-agers-are-pregnant-despite-rise-in-contraception.html,EVEN though teenagers are using contraception more conscientiously increasing numbers are becoming pregnant because more are sexually active That was one of the primary findings of a report entitled Teenage Pregnancy The Problem That Hasnt Gone Away published yesterday by the Alan Guttmacher Institute The report projected that 4 of every 10 girls aged 14 would become pregnant at least once during their teenage years 2 of 10 would give birth and more than 1 in 7 would have an abortion The report a compilation of recent research was designed by the institute a Planned Parenthood affiliate specializing in research and education as a sequel to a 1976 study 11 Million Teenagers What Can be Done About the Epidemic of Adolescent Pregnancies in the United States Richard Lincoln senior vice president of the institute and author of the report said it was an amalgam of probably 100 studies each of which involved thousands of teenagers The assessment of adolescent sexuality was issued at a time of confusion and controversy over sexrelated issues Richard S Schweiker Secretary of Health and Human Services has said that he supports a proposed amendment to the Constitution that would abolish abortion that he believes that physicians should not be permitted to prescribe contraceptives to teenage Medicaid patients and that he advocates a strong voice for parents in determining whether sex ought to be taught in school He has also said I do not think the Federal Government should be in the sex education business The appointment of Marjorie Mecklenburg to head the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs a department branch that provides funds for teenage mothers and counsels them on the prevention of subsequent pregnancies is expected soon Mrs Mecklenburg is president of the American Citizens Concerned for Life an organization opposed to abortion One contention of the report is that the availability of abortion and contraception have helped reduce births among teenagers The report appears to offer little evidence that the problem is going away for with more teenagers becoming sexually active more of them are becoming pregnant despite an overall decline in the rate at which teenagers are having babies Of the 29 million people aged 13 to 19 12 million  7 million boys and 5 million girls  have had sexual intercourse according to the survey statistics The report estimates that the number of sexually active teenagers increased by twothirds in the 1970s a figure that while considered reliable is approximate because it is based on a series of studies of girls in metropolitan areas conducted in 1971 1976 and 1979 A similar survey of boys was conducted only in 1979 so there is no basis for comparison The increase was most dramatic among whites  especially those aged 1517 whose rate of sexual activity doubled the report says Between the middle of the decade and the end the increase in teenage sexual activity was entirely accounted for by unmarried whites Although age for age the proportion of black teenagers who are sexually active continues to be higher than that of whites the gap between them has closed considerably The report continues In the early 1970s race socioeconomic status residence and religious affiliation were all related to age at first intercourse But many of these distinctions are beginning to disappear as premarital sexual activity increases among all elements of the teenage population  The average age at the time of first sexual experience is 16 By the time age 19 is reached only a fifth of the males and a third of the females have not had intercourse Social economic and religious factors no longer seem to be deterrents according to the report What does matter in consideration of pregnancy is the fact of youth itself While teenagers constitute only 18 percent of sexually active women considered capable of becoming pregnant they account for 46 percent of outofwedlock births and 31 percent of abortions Although the pregnancy rate is rising a smaller proportion of teenage girls are giving birth  with the exception of those under 15 whose rate has remained stable in recent years Despite the decline which is attributed to use of contraception and abortion the American birthrate is still one of the highest in the world In 1978 there were 1142000 pregnancies and 554000 births among teenagers 17 percent of them conceived after marriage Thirtyeight percent of the pregnancies were terminated by abortion 22 percent resulted in outofwedlock births and the rest were miscarried The findings on birth control among adolescents exemplify the partly hopeful partly alarming picture drawn by the report On the one hand the level and consistency of contraceptive use increased impressively during the 1970s 7 in 10 teenagers questioned in 1979 said they had taken precautions at the last instance of intercourse compared with 6 in 10 in 1976 and 5 in 10 in 1971 Just 27 percent of the sexually active teenagers reported in 1979 that they had never used a birth control method On the other hand nearly twothirds of teenage women said that either they never used contraception or did so erratically Asked why they had failed to do so 4l percent of the group said they were convinced they would not become pregnant because their encounters occurred at the wrong time of the month Teenagers who use contraceptive devices tend to wait until they have been sexually active about nine months the report said That delay often proves risky more than half the pregnancies were conceived within six months of the first act of intercourse and a fifth during the first month The choice of specific birthcontrol methods changed markedly during the decade The proportion of teenagers using methods judged medically most effective  the pill and the intrauterine device  almost doubled between 1971 and 1976 but declined by 8 percent at the end of the decade probably because of publicity about adverse effects In comparison the proportion of teenagers using the least reliable method  withdrawal  declined about 16 percent between 1971 and 1976 and then increased by 46 percent between 1976 and 1979 The number of abortions performed on teenagers in 1978 434000 was almost double those in 1973  246000 Teenagers accounted for 3 of every 10 abortions in the 1970s However the report said that in 1978 about 3 in 10 of the teenagers estimated to want and need abortion services were unable to obtain abortions a total of 160000 teenagers who as a result had unintended births It said these represented about 60 percent of unintended births among teenagers Discussing preventive measures Mr Lincoln said Highest priority ought to go to preventive services to reach teenagers before they become sexually active certainly by junior high school and the development of contraceptive methods that are appropriate to the episodic relationships of teenagers
BUDGET AMENDMENT BACKED AT HEARING,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/12/us/budget-amendment-backed-at-hearing.html,Citing pressure from public opinion and legislatures backers of a constitutional amendment that would require the Federal budget to be balanced took their proposal optimistically into hearings before the new more conservative Senate today One senator after another said opinion polls showed that up to 80 percent of the public wanted the budget balanced and contended that a constitutional amendment was the only way to get it done Senators Dennis DeConcini Democrat of Arizona and William L Armstrong Republican of Colorado urged Congress to propose an amendment to head off calls for a constitutional convention which some opponents contend could offer a wide range of constitutional changes Senator Orrin G Hatch chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a sponsor of the proposed amendment said that we see on this committee no more important constitutional amendment than this one The subcommittee also has jurisdiction over proposed amendments dealing with abortion busing and prayer in public schools Senator Strom Thurmond chairman of the Judiciary Committee also urged adoption of the balanced budget amendment saying Weve got to stop spending more than we take in in order to survive as a government Chances of Passage Improved The South Carolina Republican added that proponents of the amendment had a fine chance to pass it in the full Senate Last year the measure died on a 9to8 vote in the Judiciary Committee But changes in the committee membership like those in the full Senate appear to have improved its chances of passage Moreover supporters believe that the diminished Democratic majority in the House may provide reduced support for efforts to keep the measure bottled up in the House Judiciary Committee Senator Hatch a Utah Republican said later that he expected the Judiciary Committee to approve an amendment by the end of next month after opponents of the proposal were heard on April 9 Winning the twothirds Senate vote required for adoption of a constitutional amendment will be difficult Mr Hatch added But with the political climate the way it is I think any senator who doesnt vote for this very moderate very constitutional amendment is in danger of not sitting in the Senate again 30 States Back Convention Plan The subcommittee today heard only from supporters of the amendment including State Senator James Clark Jr of Maryland leader of the National Taxpayers Unions effort to get the required 34 state legislatures to ask Congress for a constitutional convention on the issue Thirty legislatures have already done so Nobody really wants a constitutional convention Mr Clark said but I for one am willing to risk it He also noted that several of the state resolutions already passed made their convention call an alternative to having an amendment proposed by Congress If you all act he said that will nullify the need for a convention and the states will be very happy The proposed amendment considered today would require Congress to adopt a budget in which expenditures did not exceed receipts By threefifths majorities of those present and voting in each house the ban on deficit financing could be overridden Moreover It would not be in effect when war had been declared TwoThirds Approval Needed To become part of the Constitution the proposed amendment would first have to be approved by a twothirds vote in each house of Congress and then ratified by the legislatures of 38 states President Reagan has taken no position on a proposed amendment to require a balanced budget or on a constitutional convention but the amendment was portrayed today as a way to assist him in his efforts to balance the budget Senator Howell T Heflin Democrat of Alabama said the amendment would make it easier for wellintentioned Presidents to succeed in such attempts

"SAVIOR OF THE JOB CORPS WAS HATCH; HE LIKES IT, AND IT'S BIG IN HIS STATE",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/13/us/savior-of-the-job-corps-was-hatch-he-likes-it-and-it-s-big-in-his-state.html,When the Labor Departments Job Corps program joined a select list of projects in escaping the path of Budget Director David A Stockmans spending scythe the savior of the program was not a liberal Democrat but one of the Senates leading conservative Republicans Orrin G Hatch of Utah chairman of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources Why did he save the 16yearold Job Corps Because this program works Mr Hatch said his voice rising Its pennywise and pound foolish to cut funding for a program that can literally save thousands of unemployed and unemployable young people from being locked into a ghetto locked into a life of poverty without hope in what amounts to a form of slavery Received Telephone Appeal According to senior Reagan Administration officials Mr Stockman agreed to spare the Job Corps from budget reductions this year after a telephone appeal by Mr Hatch on Feb 27 The Job Corps was among eight or nine Labor Department programs we were eying for reductions a senior budget official said But this Administration wants to work very closely with Mr Hatch and the committee he heads Lets just say that we weighed his views very carefully Mr Hatch readily acknowledged his role I called as many people in the Administration as I could he said in an interview I lobbied as hard as I could because I believe in this program Mr Hatch and Job Corps officials cite statistics that they say demonstrate the agencys success With financing of 560 million in the fiscal year 1981 the program has 41500 students 16 to 21 years old enrolled in 102 training centers All are poor 85 percent are high school dropouts 15 percent are functionally illiterate 70 percent are members of minority groups and twothirds are male Studies by consultants indicate that 90 percent of the students who complete the training programs of up to two years are successful in finding jobs or gaining further education According to a recent analysis by Mathematica a New Jerseybased consulting company the Job Corps paid for itself in only two years Officials of the Office of Management and Budget argue that it costs more to send a student through the Job Corps with a cost of 12000 a year than it would to send him to Harvard Thats a ridiculous argument Mr Hatch snapped Were talking about functionally illiterate kids who stand no chance whatsoever of going to Harvard or any other university for that matter Were talking about saving kids from a lifetime on the public dole Center in Hatchs State One of four Job Corps centers with an enrollment greater than 1000 is the one in Clearfield Utah Mr Hatchs state It has 1450 students Senator Hatch denies however that its presence accounts for his ardent support Because he is highly critical of welfare programs and individual subsidies for the poor his staff aides argue he is committed to improving programs aimed at reducing welfare rolls Im a conservative and proud of it but Im a compassionate conservative Mr Hatch said Im not some kind of ultra rightwing maniac despite some portrayals in the press Mr Hatch is opposed to abortion and gun control he supports capital punishment a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and many conservative foreign policy positions But he has also taken positions that have angered fellow conservatives Last year for example he was a sponsor of legislation that enables Federal prosecutors to initiate lawsuits to protect the civil rights of institutionalized persons Revolts like Mr Hatchs against prospective budget cuts concern senior Administration officials whose primary mission is to steer the politically distasteful budget reductions through Congress Of course we have to be pragmatic said one official But too many Republican raids on the Reagan economic program to save pet programs will lower our chances of success And that wont help the President or those Republicans Mr Hatch is running for reelection in 1982 Political analysts believe that he may face a tough challenge in Utah
VATICAN ASSAILS FETAL DIAGNOSIS IF USED TO ENCOURAGE ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/13/world/vatican-assails-fetal-diagnosis-if-used-to-encourage-abortions.html,The Vatican issued a document today that said modern medical diagnostic techniques that enable a pregnant woman to determine whether her child will be born deformed should not be used to encourage abortion The document said doctors should use the techniques to further scientific efforts toward a remedy for birth defects The ninepage document criticized medical techniques such as ultrasound scanning amniocentesis and chromosome analysis which are used to diagnose potential handicaps in fetuses if their results are used to encourage abortion Developments in science and medicine have enabled us today to discover in the fetus some defects which can give rise to future malformations and deficiences the document said The impossibility at present of providing a remedy for them by medical means has led some to propose and even to practice the suppression of the fetus Attitude of Pseudohumanism This conduct springs from an attitude of pseudohumanism which compromises the ethical order of objective values and must be rejected by upright consciences it continued Furthermore the deliberate failure to provide assistance or any act which leads to the suppression of the newborn disabled person represents a breach not only of medical ethics but also of the fundamental and inalienable right to life Amniocentesis in which a small amount of amniotic fluid is extracted from the womb of a pregnant woman to diagnose chromosome disorders in the fetus is recommended by many obstetricians for women 35 or older The process is also used to determine the sex of the fetus to diagnose hereditary diseases such as hemophilia Ultrasound scanning allows physicians to trace the shape of a fetus and determine malformations Both techniques are usually used in the third month of pregnancy when the fetus is large enough for diagnosis and an early abortion is still possible if deformations are detected The Vatican document called Document of the Holy See for the International Year of Disabled Persons said therapeutic abortions in cases where fetal diseases or deformations are detected are not permissible in the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church
ABORTION BECOMING A TOP PRIORITY ISSUE IN CONGRESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/13/us/abortion-becoming-a-top-priority-issue-in-congress.html,A campaign by conservatives to end legalized abortion coupled with the appointment of prominent antiabortion figures to key jobs in the Reagan Administration has turned the delicate and potentially volatile abortion issue into a priority item in Congress ranking just behind the economic issue Key antiabortion forces led by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina and Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois are predicting that the mood in favor of legislation to prohibit abortions has swung sharply in Congress because of the influx of conservative senators from Novembers election President Reagans antiabortion stance and perhaps most significant a new legislative maneuver to bar abortions We now have the votes and what President Reagan has said gives us great encouragement said Mr Hyde who predicted a vote on antiabortion legislation by early summer Senator Strom Thurmond Republican of South Carolina who heads the Judiciary Committee is tentatively set to start hearings on the abortion issue April 10 Eleanor Smeal president of the 125000member National Organization for Women said What were now facing is an allout attack not only on abortion but on birth control People are shocked Its going way beyond the abortion issue Appointments of Abortion Foes Compounding the concerns of feminist and social welfare groups are several key appointments of antiabortion figures to the Department of Health and Social Services including Dr C Everett Koop a Philadelphia surgeon who is scheduled to be named Surgeon General in a departmental reorganization Dr Koop whose responsibilities will include the National Institutes of Health the Centers for Disease Control and the Institute of Alcohol and Drug Abuse is a fundamentalist Christian who toured 20 cities in 1979 with a multimedia presentation that deplored the antifamily trends in our society The presentation designed to show that American society was crumbling included an animated cartoon showing nine Supreme Court Justices hammering elderly people in wheelchairs into the ground while Cole Porters Anything Goes played in the background What most concerns the people who favor permitting abortions are the identical bills introduced by Senator Helms and Representative Hyde that would ban abortion without a constitutional amendment The measures which declare that actual human life exists from conception would effectively allow states to enact laws outlawing abortion If the legislation passes abortion would be the taking of a human life and thus a crime Neither rape nor incest is mentioned in the legislation presumably compelling the victims of these acts to carry out their pregnancies Problems on Constitution Mr Hyde acknowledged in an interview that the legislation had been introduced because a constitutional amendment barring abortion which antiabortion forces have sought since 1973 would be difficult to pass A constitutional amendment must be approved by a twothirds vote of the House and Senate and then ratified by 38 states A legislative bill needs only a simple majority of the House and Senate It is enforced after the President signs the measure Mr Hyde strongly denied one of the key arguments made by those who favor permitting abortion that the legislation could be carried to extrrmes and make illegal such birth control methods as the intrauterine device and the pill which are believed to act after conception It is my intention to make surgical abortions illegal Mr Hyde said It is not my intention to deal with matters concerning the pill and the IUD Its not feasible practical or attainable But Karen Mulhauser executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League said These people have got to be held accountable They say they want to outlaw abortion from fertilization which would prevent the use of the pill and the IUD which hundreds of thousands of people use They realize that the American people once they realize whats going on will not go along with this BackDoor Effort Seen Miss Mulhauser and others say that the legislation is a backdoor attempt to infringe constitutional rights and seeks to circumvent the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that voided most laws against abortion This is only an interim measure said Miss Mulhauser They will never lose sight of the ultimate goal  a constitutional amendment The antiabortion lobby  is uncertain about if not opposed to the HelmsHyde legislation These forces include such groups as March for Life run by Nellie Gray a 56yearold Washington resident as well as the American Life Lobby and the Life Amendment Political Action Committee Washingtonbased organizations that are run by a husbandandwife team Paul and Judy Brown Mr Brown said that the legislation was deflecting attention from the ultimate goal of the antiabortion lobby which is a constitutional amendment abolishing legal abortion in the nation Its foolish to go to Capitol Hill with a new bill when we have a golden opportunity for a human life

LEADER OF 'MARCH FOR LIFE' SEES ISSUE AS APOCALYPTIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/13/us/leader-of-march-for-life-sees-issue-as-apocalyptic.html,For Nellie Gray abortion is an apocalyptic issue I find it the most odious thing that could happen that Americans have to fight for the right to live said Miss Gray a 56yearold lawyer who is in the forefront of the antiabortion movement Every elected official is going to be held responsible for they are the ones who have the power to resolve it today she said They will be held accountable just as the Nuremberg trials found individuals personally responsible for crimes committed against humanity Nellies March in Capital The March for Life which is held in Washington each year on the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion is known as Nellies March because of her efforts to organize it She is also president of March for Life Inc an antiabortion lobbying group in Washington Miss Gray opposes abortion under all circumstances When a mothers life is in danger she says the fetus should be given equal consideration As for the victims of rape or incest she says Abortion cannot cure the aggravation of rape by committing another felony which is homicide She has also campaigned against offering birth control advice to teenagers Those who preach population control and so forth have brought on the high sexual activity and abortionists are using teenagers she said They have become the fodder for the abortion mills Headquarters in Basement Miss Gray operates March for Life from the cluttered basement of her home a few blocks from the Capitol The basement is filled with rows of file cabinets cartons of campaign buttons and banners and stacks of newsletters She has devoted eight years to the antiabortion movement leaving her career as a Labor Department lawyer to march and campaign In January 60000 people took part in the annual March for Life according to estimates by the police It was the largest turnout yet and for the first time the rally was addressed by a Cabinet member Richard S Schweiker Secretary of Health and Human Services A delegation from the march was received at the White House by President Reagan We were very pleased with Secretary Schweiker Miss Gray said He told us that we had a prolife friend at the Department of Health and Human Services Wanted Reagan to Speak Although Miss Gray refused to attend the Oval Office meeting because she felt President Reagan should have addressed the rally she said that the important thing was to have the prestige of the office of the Presidency supporting the proposed antiabortion amendment to the United States Constitution The amendment defines human life as existing from the moment of fertilization Congressional hearings are to be held next month on another antiabortion measure a bill that seeks to ban abortions without resorting to a constitutional amendment We have to look at the provisions very closely Miss Gray said You have to understand that we dont care whether it be by an executive order or by statute or by a constitutional amendment as long as it stops the killing But it cant be temporary or provide exceptions or permit states to exempt themselves from it Miss Gray was born June 25 1924 in Big Spring Tex She remembers her childhood as economically debilitated Attended College Under GI Bill She worked as a secretary for a year before raising enough money to attend Texas State College for Women in 1941 After Pearl Harbor she joined the Womens Army Corps After the war she returned to college under the GI Bill and received a bachelors degree in business administration and a masters degree in economics She received her law degree in 1959 from Georgetown University which she attended at night In Washington she worked as an economic research assistant at the State Department before moving to the Labor Department as a specialist in manpower legislation
IDEAS & TRENDS IN SUMMARY; CONTINUING TRAGEDY OF TEEN PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/15/weekinreview/ideas-trends-in-summary-continuing-tragedy-of-teen-pregnancy.html,While the controversy on what to do about it rages all around them American adolescents are getting pregnant in prodigious numbers and with unhappy consequences according to a report published last week by the Alan Guttmacher Institute a Planned Parenthood affiliate A compilation of recent research Teenage Pregnancy The Problem That Hasnt Gone Away concluded that the number of sexually active teenagers increased by twothirds during the 1970s to 12 million and the number of adolescent pregnancies rose to 11 million annually by 1978 But the rate of teenage births has declined partly because of the availability of contraceptives and abortion Three quarters of teenage pregnancies the findings indicate are the unintended result of ignorance or accident The risk of infant death is twice as high for teenage mothers as for those in their 20s and women who become mothers before the age of 17 are half as likely to graduate from high school as their contemporaries Discussing remedies Richard Lincoln the reports author said Highest priority ought to go to preventive services to reach teenagers before they become sexually active certainly by junior high school and the development of contraceptive methods that are appropriate to the episodic relationships of teenagers These proposals contrast sharply with positions espoused by Richard S Schweiker Secretary of Health and Human Services who has said he opposes abortion prescribing contraceptives to teenage Medicaid patients and Federal involvement in sex education 
"LEGAL AID FOR THE POOR DID WORK, AND THAT'S THE RUB",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/15/weekinreview/legal-aid-for-the-poor-did-work-and-that-s-the-rub.html,The Administrations proposal to wipe out the 321 million Federal program that pays the salaries of most of the nations 6000 legal aid lawyers was submitted to Congress last week as a budgetcutting measure The proposal which would take the Government out of the business of providing poor people with free lawyers in noncriminal cases marked a renewal of an old feud between President Reagan and legal aid lawyers Supporters of the Administration plan see it as a way of striking a blow against activist lawyers who in their view stir up unnecessary trouble Mr Reagan and other critics from time to time have accused legal aid attorneys of being too quick to pursue their own vision of the public interest Defenders of the Federal program say the Administration plans amount to a denial of the nations commitment to equal justice under law  putting a price tag on justice just like a Cadillac or a yacht in the words of F William McAlpin Mr McAlpin is chairman of the board of the independent Legal Services Corporation which administers the program and secretary of the American Bar Association which has long supported it The debate echoes one that raged 10 years ago when Mr Reagan then Governor of California wanted the Nixon Administration to cut off Federal support for California Rural Legal Assistance The California group had forced the state to increase Medicaid and other social welfare payments and had annoyed many influential farmers with its efforts on behalf of farm workers Mr Reagan lost that fight when a panel of three retired justices from different state supreme courts dismissed almost all 135 accusations of misconduct filed against the organization as totally irresponsible and without foundation Now Mr Reagan is obviously in a better position to have his way Even if Congress doesnt abolish the Legal Services Corporation the corporations activities may be reduced sharply The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee last week voted to cut its funding by 66 percent And before the year is out Mr Reagan will be able to appoint successors for all 11 members of the corporations board Congress first authorized the Federal Government to underwrite legal aid for the poor in civil cases in 1965 The program part of President Johnsons war on poverty got under way after a period of destructive urban riots and was designed to encourage the poor to take their grievances off the streets and into the courts Another factor in the Federal involvement was the United States Supreme Courts ruling in 1963 in Gideon v Wainwright that a criminal defendant who cannot afford a lawyer has a constitutional right to have one appointed to represent him at Government expense No such constitutional right for poor people to have free lawyers in civil cases has been recognized But Federal funding for legal aid was regarded by many conservatives as well as liberals as necessary to add a degree of fairness to a complex system of justice One prominent supporter of the program was Lewis F Powell Jr who was president of the American Bar Association in 1965 and was later appointed to the Supreme Court by President Nixon A Controversial Legacy The Legal Services Corporation was created by Congress in 1974 to insulate funding for legal aid which had previously been handled by the Office of Economic Opportunity from political pressures The corporation now supports lawyers in more than 300 locally administered programs with more than 1200 offices around the country It supplies more than six times as much financial support for legal aid as all state local and private grants combined The starting salaries of legal aid lawyers average about 15000 far less than many of them could presumably earn working for private firms and their case loads are heavy They tend to be young and liberal The program has been at least a partial solution to the problem of unequal justice Rich people and corporations still get highpriced lawyers some poor people now get free legal aid lawyers and the middle class gets taxed The legal services program has been one of the more controversial legacies of the Johnson era largely because its detractors and supporters seem to agree it has made a difference Although they spend most of their time on such routine matters as family disputes landlordtenant problems and disputes over installment sales contracts legal aid attorneys have also brought and won many class action and law reform suits Activism Encouraged These have included efforts to force Federal state and local officials to pay benefits mandated by social welfare legislation improve hospital services for poor people admit children of illegal aliens to public schools provide free abortions for women who cant afford to pay for the procedure and improve jail conditions Legal aid lawyers have also filed suits against business and farming interests to enforce state and Federal laws regarding wages hours and working conditions Critics of the Legal Services Corporation say that it has encouraged activism by legal aid lawyers who seek to stir up litigation to force judicial resolution of matters that should be left to elected officials For example one Administration aide suggests legal aid attorneys who use the law to prevent school officials from punishing disruptive students make it all the more difficult for those students classmates to get an education Many legal authorities contend that the majority of the 15 million cases handled by legal aid lawyers annually are routine matters that may be of considerable importance to their individual clients but very little importance to anyone else Legal services supporters argue that any lawyer who is doing a good job representing the poor will often collide with business interests or government officials because he will have clients who are being illegally exploited or denied benefits to which they are entitled And the supporters note a lawyer wins such disputes only when a judge finds that his clients rights have been violated These lawyers do not write our nations laws legislatures do these lawyers do not hand down court decisions  judges do says Howard B Eisenberg executive director of the National Legal Aid and Defenders Association
AROUND THE NATION; Georgia Halts Payments For Most Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/16/us/around-the-nation-georgia-halts-payments-for-most-abortions.html,The Georgia Department of Medical Assistance has eliminated state payments for abortions as of today except in cases in which the mothers life is endangered or for victims of rape or incest Helen Ford administrator at Atlantas Center for Reproductive Health said that her clinic would offer free abortions Wednesday for Medicaid recipients because some women are going to wake up the next day and suddenly realize they can no longer get an abortion under Medicaid The Hyde Amendment passed by Congress in 1976 outlawed paying for abortions with Federal money except under specific circumstances The law gave the states control over whether to assume the costs of the operations Georgia tried to follow suit and prohibit public payments for abortions for lowincome women but a Federal District Court ruled that the state must bear the costs The state appealed and last year the Supreme Court ruled that states should not have to pay for medical treatment under Medicaid if Federal reimbursment was unavailable
THE CONGRESS VS. THE COURTS; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/16/us/the-congress-vs-the-courts-news-analysis.html,An effort by conservatives in Congress to strip the Supreme Court and lower Federal Courts of jurisdiction in cases involving school prayer busing and abortion could lead to a fundamental shift in Government checks and balances in the view of concerned legal experts If the bills pass and are upheld by the Supreme Court against constitutional challenges they would also apparently lead to enforcement by state courts of conflicting interpretations of the same provisions of the Federal Constitution For the first time since it was established the Supreme Court would be powerless to review and resolve conflicting state court rulings A proposal by Senator Jesse Helms Reublican of North Carolina to take away Federal court jurisdiction over state plans for school prayer passed the Senate in 1979 but died in a House subcommittee last year Opponents fear that it may be difficult in this years more conservative Congress to stop this proposal and others that would take away Federal court jurisdiction over busing of school children for desegregation and abortion Subcommittee hearings in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees may begin next month on more than a dozen bills to impose restrictions on Federal court jurisdiction The constitutionality of these and similar proposals has been debated by scholars as well as members of Congress for decades There is no definitive precedent Although Congress has broad powers to regulate the kinds of cases that may be decided by the Federal courts it has refrained for more than a century from enacting legislation designed to prevent them from enforcing constitutional rights declared by the Supreme Court Marshall Asserted Court Suprem acy As the checks and balances system evolved Chief Justice John Marshall in the early 1800s asserted the supremacy of the Federal judiciary over Congress and the states in matters of constitutional interpretation This year according to Carl Anderson and aide to Senator Helms there will be a serious effort by conservatives to enact legislation restricting Federal court jurisdiction over school prayer and busing areas in which he said the Supreme Court had usurped powers not granted to it by the Constitution Were a lot stronger this year on these issues Mr Anderson said He said that Senator Helms and other conservative leaders would probably not push so hard for jurisdictional restrictions with respect to abortion because they are concentrating on a bill that would ban abortion The impetus for the bills restricting Federal court jurisdiction comes from many conservatives outrage over Supreme Court decisions over 20 years The Justices have prohibited prayer in public schools as an unconstitutional establishment of religion have required busing to desegregate public schools and have struck down state laws restricting the right to abortions Unlike pending proposals for constitutional amendments legislation restricting Federal court jurisdiction would not directly overrule these precedents But it would remove the authority of the Federal Courts to enforce them Would Leave It to State Courts This would leave it to state courts to enforce their own interpretations of the Constitution in these areas applying previous Supreme Court precedents or ignoring them The primary attraction of these bills to conservatives is that they would be easier to enact than constitutional amendments which must be approved by a twothirds vote in each House of Congress and ratified by 38 states The court jurisdiction bills would become law if passed by a simple majority of each House and signed by the President subject to judicial review of their constitutionality Although Congress has no power to overrule by legislation Supreme Court interpretations the Constitution states that the Supreme Courts jurisdiction over most cases is subject to such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress shall make The lower Federal courts were established by Congress not by the Constitution itself and Congress has traditionally determined what kinds of cases may be brought before them Conservative legislators and scholars such as Prof Charles E Rice of Notre Dame Law School read these provisions as giving Congress power to strip the Federal courts of jurisdiction over just about any constitutional issue View of Yale Professor Opponents of the bills consider them unwise and probably unconstitutional as Prof Robert H Bork of Yale Law School put it Profesor Bork a conservative who served as Solicitor General under Presidents Nixon and Ford criticized the Supreme Court for exceeding its mandate in its decisions on abortion and busing But he opposed congressional attacks on jurisdiction as a cure that may set a precedent more damaging than the wrong Supreme Court decisions Liberals who applaud the Supreme Courts decisions on school prayer busing and abortion are all the more alarmed at what John Shattuck a Washington lobbyist for the American Civil Liberties Union calls the attacks on the independence of the Federal courts by conservatives in Congress If Congress does pass laws attempting to strip the Federal courts of their power to enforce specific constitutional rights Mr Shattuck said the Supreme Court should strike them down as violating both the constitutional provisions on which those rights are based and the provision making the Constitution the supreme law of the land
THE EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK; THE FIARNESS DOCTRINE IS DYING,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/16/opinion/the-editorial-notebook-the-fiarness-doctrine-is-dying.html,Is the fairness doctrine in television like the rooftop antenna headed for oblivion For decades Congress and the Federal Communications Commission have believed that broadcasters should cover public issues and be evenhanded about it Why Because the broadcast spectrum has been historically a scarce resource The Government saw a public interest in requiring fairness from those it licensed as broadcasters But technology has overtaken that uneasy doctrine of Government involvement in program content With cable television reaching more and more homes and direct satellitetohome transmission still to come many programmers bypass the conventional broadcast spectrum And the multiplicity of channels will soon make it difficult to argue a scarcity of broadcast information It seems doubtful that the fairness requirement can survive practically and constitutionally Congress would be wise to look into the matter before the courts do its job The Communications Act of 1934 imposed the fairness obligation by requiring broadcasters to serve the public interest convenience and ne Cables Many Channels Make TV Regulation Hard to Justify cessity As gradually defined by Congress and the commission this came to mean an obligation to air controversial and diverse viewpoints Broadcasters have been able to satisfy the requirement by carrying news public affairs and documentary programs that purport to deal in factual matter and by giving dissenting views a chance to be heard But this fairness doctrine has always worked in strange ways To their chagrin advertisers were occasionally required to submit to dissenters which is why cigarette manufacturers were happy to leave the air The doctrine does not reach fictional entertainment shows no matter what outrageous views an Archie Bunker may express The Communications Commission contends that cable broadcasters are bound by the doctrine but its jurisdiction has not been tested in court Unlike overtheair broadcasters cable operators and programmers are not licensed by the Federal government And now that broadcast channels are no longer scarce it is far from clear that the courts would allow even a licensing power to be used to prescribe program content Someone is bound to trigger an early court test of the situation by asking whether a consumer cable show may criticize a product without giving the manufacturer a right of reply or whether a religious program may lobby against abortion without rebuttal from the opposing side To extend the fairness doctrine into cable will surely raise grave issues of free speech especially if the channels one day distribute news and opinion from say The New York Times Yet if cable is exempted overtheair broadcasters will surely argue and with good reason to be exempted also The question then will be whether the viewer as he twists the dial will really be able to receive a sufficient number of competing images to result in a fair balance of public affairs coverage HUGH PRICE
LET THERE BE LIFE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/17/opinion/let-there-be-life.html,Sometimes its hard to keep up First it was life created in a test tube Then patented life forms And now were told that all Congress has to do is pass a statute redefining life  by declaring fetuses to be persons from the moment of conception  and presto Roe v Wade the United States Supreme Courts 1973 decision preventing legislative interference with abortions until late pregnancy will disappear No muss no fuss and most important no struggle for all the votes it would take to amend the Constitution the oldfashioned way The two of us have been on opposite sides of the debate over the constitutional legitimacy of Roe virtually since it was decided But we have no trouble at all agreeing that this formula for overturning it is badly misguided It wont work and its a good thing it wont Even if it were offered in the form of a constitutional amendment it would be at best an unpredictable vehicle for overruling Roe If fetuses really are to be regarded as persons from the moment of conception that would seem to require states to punish rape victims who get abortions as murderers and the druggists who provide them morningafter pills as accomplices to murder If on the other hand as certainly seems likely the statutes proponents assure us that they dont mean that that some distinctions between the extinction of fetal life and the extinction of other life can still be drawn  it could then become at least arguable that the goal of overruling Roe had not in fact been realized Lets suppose though that the Supreme Court would uphold a ban on abortion on the strength of a fetal life amendment to the Constitution It doesnt follow that a mere act of Congress could accomplish the same result The point of Roe v Wade was not that the Supreme Court had too little scientific information about when life began or what a fetus was but rather that the Government merely by adopting one theory of life could not override the rights of the pregnant woman For Congress to proclaim the theory that a fetus is a person from the very beginging would leave this constitutional calculus unchanged It was a question of rights not an issue of biology or a matter of definition that Roe resolved Congressional power to rescue an otherwise unconstitutional law by the expedient of redefining the terms of the 14th Amendment would have dizzying implications well beyond the abortion controversy Should we make it as easy for Government officials to sue for libel as it was before The New York Times v Sullivan which barred damages for defamation of public officials in the absence of deliberate or reckless falsehood Thats simple enough Congress need only announce that ones liberty of reputation demands that any publisher of libelous matter about an official be strictly liable for every falsehood How about bringing back the racially restrictive convenants that were common before the Supreme Court in 1948 held them to be unenforceable No problem Just have Congress define judicial refusal to enforce racial restrictions on realestate sales as a deprivation of property Yearn for the halcyon days when coerced confessions were admissible as evidence Easy Congress proclaims that from here on releasing any defendant on the ground that his rights were violated will be deemed to deprive all members of the public of their liberty from fear Indeed why not skip all the bother and just let Congress redefine due process of law to include any law Congress or a state legislature approves It hardly matters  once Congress can defeat liberty by definitional fiat Reducing the Constitution to whatever those in power want it to mean is an awfully high price to pay for making Roe disappear Were all lucky  supporters and opponents of Roe alike  that such a gambit wont work Senator Jesse A Helms wasnt conceived yesterday and his constitutional advisers undoubtedly have explained to him why an attempt to overrule Roe v Wade by statute must fail Obviously the idea is to score points with the prolife constituency at the expense of the courts which as the senator well knows will have no choice but to strike the statute down When Roe was decided many screamed including one of us Mr Ely  that the Court was playing politics With treatment like this at the hands of the Congress what else can we really expect  John Hart Ely and Laurence H Tribe both teach constitutional law at Harvard Law School

OBSERVER; CIGAR-SMOKE SCIENCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/21/opinion/observer-cigar-smoke-science.html,Two leading Congressional scientists Senator Helms and Representative Hyde anticipate the Nobel Prize for their researches into the nature of life These have given birth to the HelmsHyde theory which states that scientific fact can be established by a majority vote of the United States Congress Unfortunately Doctors Hyde and Helms appear to be timid about pressing their theory to its limits Is there any earthly reason for example why Congress should not pass a law declaring that 7 times 9 is 67 For years we have had a barrage of propaganda calculated to make us believe that 7 times 9 is actually 63 Forty years of coping with the ninetimes table has left me unpersuaded When a pedagogue pounces out of the shadows demanding to know How much is 7 times 9 I instinctively reply 67 Wrong he says its 63 My proposal long ignored in Washington is that Congress pass a law declaring that 7 times 9 is 67 and specifying that severe penalties be imposed for pedagogues who hold otherwise Professors Hyde and Helms are moving toward my point of view but only very gingerly At present they would apply Congresss power to legislate scientific fact only to issues on which scientists themselves are in a muddle Specifically they propose a bill under which Congress would solve the knotty question of lifes origin by voting that life begins at the moment of conception These pioneers of new scientific method deserve a salute for trying to solve this troublesome question with a democratic show of hands Nevertheless the slightest reflection will show how absurdly wrong they are in asking Congressional science to discover that life begins at conception The scientific fact  and I urge the professors to amend their bill to recognize it  is that life begins long before conception The flaw in the HelmsHyde hypothesis results from their myopic concentration on the parents of the impending child In their view one male and one female participate in a biological transaction and presto life begins with nine months of citizenship in the womb followed by an indeterminate term of exterior activity If dear reader you ponder your own existence for a moment you will see how shortsighted this view actually is Are you here merely because of two parents Of course not Each of those parents required two parents which is why you have four grandparents To obtain the necessary four grandparents you needed eight greatgrandparents And how in the world are you going to scrape up eight greatgrandparents without the cooperation of 16 greatgreatgrandparents Well you can get 16 greatgreatgreatgrandparents if you are lucky enough to have 32 greatgreatgreatgrandparents but of course you are not going to get 32 unless you are lucky enough to have 64 greatgreatgreatgreatgrandparents If you are youngish right now back around the time of the American Revolution six generations ago you had 64 greatgreatgreatgreatgrandparents all of whom were engaged  not simultaneously of course  in producing you If you hadnt you would now be in a condition of unlife Is it necessary to point out that any number of persons are at this very moment unexisting because in 1776 there were 63 people perfectly willing to cooperate in producing life by the late 20th century but were unable to find a 64th In these cases life in the 1980s failed to begin in 1776 because one member of the 64person committee said To hell with the 1980s If you are fortunate enough to be here of course it is because back around 1750 there were 128 people willing to cheer when somebody said Why dont we all get to work on a greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandchild In legislating the beginning of life Congress will probably be unwilling to go back to 1750 since it would be treading on the territory of King George III but legislating science from the date of the Declaration of Independence is perfectly constitutional The obvious scientific fact which Professors Hyde and Helms should be urging the Congress to enact is that life for each American begins with greatgreatgreatgreatgrandparents in the last quarter of the 18th century Even with this starting team of course the threat of unlife lurked all along the route to 1981 I had many a narrow escape myself One of my grandmothers apparently weary of birthing after ten accouchements paused for a terrifyingly long time before proceeding with my father If she had said To hell with it you would have to look for me out there in the unlife My grandmother went on to twelfth and thirteenth children but never produced a fourteenth Hence I probably have a couple of unexistent cousins which would have sorely irritated the 64 people who back in 1776 started them on the road of life The goal of Professors Hyde and Helms is to punish people who end life once it has started My grandmother is beyond the power of Congress these days and hence

No Constitutional Shortcut on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/21/opinion/no-constitutional-shortcut-on-abortion.html,The Right to Life movement which has sought for several years to ban abortions by constitutional amendment now claims to have found an easier route Encouraged by no less a personage than President Reagan the antiabortion forces are pressing Congress for a law declaring that human life begins at conception and that the unborn are legally persons That sounds simple yet it is aimed at change of constitutional magnitude As things stand now under Supreme Court decisions since 1973 the Fourteenth Amendment protects a woman from state interference with her freedom to choose an abortion early in a pregnancy According to its sponsors the new bill would bring the unborn within the protection of the same Fourteenth Amendment which says that states may not deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law or deny any person the equal protection of the laws States would then be free the idea runs to forbid abortions in keeping with their duty to protect life The scheme is intriguing  but unconstitutional The Supreme Court has firmly held that the unborn are not persons as that term is used in the Constitution Congress could no more override this interpretation than it could now pass laws declaring that separate but equal satisfies the Constitutions command for racial equality The proponents may nonetheless try Even if the Supreme Court should ultimately strike it down the proposed law would encourage new state antiabortion laws and sow confusion for years That could make the effort seem worthwhile to some To us it makes resistance important An integral part of the plan is to strip lower Federal courts of their power to stop the enforcement of state antiabortion laws Here is an open invitation to state legislatures and state courts to disregard Supreme Court abortion decisions This too is of doubtful constitutionality in keeping with the killtheumpire theme currently popular among critics of the federal judiciary The Right to Lifers are quite right that amending the Constitution is cumbersome The Founding Fathers made it so and for good reasons  reasons that apply to the current opponents of the right to an abortion announced by the Supreme Court in 1973 A forthright amendment although it would take the country in the wrong direction is the only legitimate avenue open to those who would now take shortcuts
Politics; NEW BARANELLO POST REFLECTS SUBURBS' ROLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/22/nyregion/politics-new-baranello-post-reflects-suburbs-role.html,DOMINIC J BARANELLO has probably reached the pinnacle of his political career with his recent election to the executive committee of the Democratic National Committee Already the Suffolk County Democratic leader and the State Democratic chairman Mr Baranello has obtained party rank that no other Long Island Democrat has  another signal of growing suburban influence in New York State politics But the 58yearold Democratic leader  who incidentally lives next to Republican county headquarters in Blue Point  is still frustrated by his dealing with Governor Carey and his administration which look more to David Garth the advertising specialist than to party leaders such as Mr Baranello for advice and even major patronage recommendations Privately Mr Baranello has often complained of his difficulties with the Governor Theyre not at all comfortable with each other said a Democrat who is close to Mr Baranello Publicly Mr Baranello is more circumspect about his relations with the Governor I dont go bowling with him he said with a laugh I dont socialize with the guy But Mr Baranello philosophizes that such strained relations between party leaders and public officials that they have helped elect are not unusual Ill show you the scars on my belly from Lee Dennison said Mr Baranello referring to the Democrat who was the first elected Suffolk County Executive Mr Baranello had been one of the few county leaders to support Mr Carey in the gubernatorial preliminaries in early 1974 Indeed he put Mr Careys name in nomination at the Democratic State Committee designating meeting Despite repeated rumors that he might jump  or be pushed  out as state chairman Mr Baranello said he intended to serve out his second twoyear term which will expire in September 1982 just before Governor Carey will presumably be seeking a third term Knowledgeable politicians doubt that Governor Carey would push him out of office for two reasons A competent successor might be hard to find in view of the Governors wellknown disdain for the party organization Secondly such a move might antagonize ItalianAmericans who will be a very significant group in the gubernatorial election The Governor in effect signaled his satisfaction with Mr Baranello  even if grudgingly  by appearing at the annual Suffolk Democratic dinner 10 days ago at the Huntington Town House Mr Carey doesnt appear at many county organization dinners Mr Baranello and another former state chairman Joseph F Crangle the Erie County Democratic leader are the only New Yorkers on the 33member executive committee of the Democratic National Committee Mr Baranello said he intendd to use his new position as a forum for his repeated demands that the Presidential primary system be changed Its a lengthy complicated and untidy process said Mr Baranello who is not known as a very tidy administrator himself Past close ties between the Conservative Party and the RighttoLife Party in Suffolk may be strained under the new Suffolk Conservative chairman Neil A Greene of North Babylon Unlike his predecessor John Andrew Kay Mr Greene is not a fan of the new party There is no relationship with the RighttoLife Party he said They have to be more in tune with us on issues other than abortion He cited the RighttoLife Partys opposition to Ronald Reagan for President as an example of the cleavage between the Conservative and RighttoLife Parties on issues other than abortion Both parties oppose legalized abortion Mr Greene is also not too happy with Suffolk County Executive Peter F Cohalan who won his post without Conservative Party endorsement and has given the party short shrift in the patronage department The Conservative chairman criticized Mr Cohalans appointment of several Democrats to his administration and his deference to Democrats in putting together the County Legislative Reapportionment Commission Noting that Mr Cohalan has ambitions for statewide office Mr Greene said that as of now Suffolk Conservatives will lead the fight against endorsing him for any state office Mr Greene is obviously putting a bargaining chip on the table
WASHINGTON; MYSTICS ON THE POTOMAC,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/22/opinion/washington-mystics-on-the-potomac.html,One insiders joke making the rounds here these days among the top Reagan officials is Dont just stand there undo something And when Murray Lew Weidenbaum the new chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers is asked how he feels about the future of the Administrations recovery program he says Im not pessimistic Im not optimistic Im a mystic He is kidding of course but a mystic is defined as one initiated into a mystery remote from or beyond human comprehension and this may help explain some of the odd happenings around here in recent days For example the Senate Budget Committee just undid the Carter budget cutting it by 364 billion We have undone 30 years of social legislation in three days announced Senator Daniel P Moynihan of New York But after complaining that these cuts would hurt the poor the sick the elderly the Northeast and the Middle West all 10 Democrats on the committee voted for them including Mr Moynihan As everybody knows austerity is the watchword of the Reagan program but the Secretary of Defense Caspar W Weinberger not satisfied with the biggest peacetime hike in the history of the Pentagons budget is now suggesting that the first 20000 of military salaries should be free from Federal income taxes According to The Washington Post this would mean that a lieutenant colonel would have more takehome pay than Mr Weinberger On the housing front the news is not all bad For example Nancy Reagan decided with good reason that the White House looked a little shabby and called for about 200000 in private contributions to touch it up As of this week she had promises of 73591191 from 209 private contributors many of them friends of the Reagan family Aha said suspicious Democrats The selling of the White House But not at all While the Presidents old California buddies were kicking in for the decorators and organizing a committee to raise funds to propagandize the Presidents recovery program the President ordered them to forget the committee and even kicked them out of their Executive Office headquarters across the street from the White House Some prominent Republicans are luckier Jesse Helms the conservative foghorn from North Carolina led a fight in the Senate Budget Committee to save for the tobacco farmers Federal price supports totaling 63 million He then went to Raleigh NC for a rousing reception from his tobacco growers Repeat after me he shouted there is no tobacco subsidy So much for the tobacco front On the labor front things are much the same transit strikes in Philadelphia fire department strikes in Milwaukee and next week a coal strike which the Mine Workers threaten will be longer than the 111day work stoppage last time In the auto industry faced with high interest rates even higher gas prices and declining car sales wages and fringe benefits are now 60 percent above the general manufacturing level and the remedy proposed by both the auto makers and the auto unions is restriction on the import of Japanese cars This has been rejected so far by the Reagan Administration for it fears that the wage pattern set in upcoming negotiations plus import restrictions on Japanese cars could as Charles L Schultze former head of the Council of Economic Advisers says in The Wall Street Journal add to both inflation and unemployment and defeat the objectives of the Reagan recovery program On the foreign front Under Secretary of State Walter J Stoessel Jr has told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the Administration has a wide variety of options under consideration including military plans to halt the flow of arms from Cuba to the insurgents in El Salvador Meanwhile Secretary of State Haig has told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the United States would respond with the full range of its power to a change in the status quo in the oil fields of the Middle East and he implied that United States ground troops might be stationed next spring in the Sinai Peninsula to replace Israeli forces in that sensitive area The Administration also wants authority to send aid to the insurgents in Angola and is trying to improve relations with South Africa and send arms to Argentina and Pakistan despite opposition from neighboring countries On the ideological front however the Administration is sternly antiCommunist but proPoland antiabortion and proschool prayers Because ours is a consistent philosophy of government Mr Reagan told the conservative Political Action Committee here the other night We can be very clear We do not have a separate social agenda a separate economic agenda and a separate foreign agenda We have one agenda    The Marxist vision of man without God must eventually be seen as an empty and false faith     The President added that obviously we are not going to be able to accomplish all this at once In some ways it is a consoling thought
'BIG BROTHER' IS RACING '1984' DEADLINE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/22/nyregion/big-brother-is-racing-1984-deadline.html,GEORGE Orwells novel 1984 exploded onto the American scene in 1949 The war was over People were getting reestablished Troops had come home Readjustment to a normal life was the prime objective 1984 hardly the type of book demanded of the times  was hardly written to satisfy folk wishing to forget living under wartime government controls The books chilling vision of life in a totalitarian society was startling It stunned millions who could not believe such a way of life would ever develop It shocked thousands who saw that such a society was possible but thought it would never come about in their lifetime Since that time 1984 has made an extraordinary impact on the American literary scene It has had 64 printings Upward of 10 million copies have been published in the United States alone After 32 years it is still on the recommended reading list of Westchester County Schools 1984 pictures in disturbing detail a regimented society totally beholden to a single benefactor Big Brother Before the reader reaches page seven he is haunted by a compelling thought Yes maybe it could happen here Lets look at the possibility The year 1984 is but 33 months away That we could realize in three years the loss of privacy described in 1984 is impossible However the fact remains that we have already been subjected to extraordinary invasions into our private lives by government and industry How could this have happened Because our benefactor our Big Brother has been very busy He has been able to invade our onceinviolate areas of privacy with frightening success Lets face it Each year we have been compelled to disclose more and more personal data to this ubiquitous guardian Many of us do not realize fully the inroads this faceless character has made in our private lives But he has made them Just how far have we come Invasions of our privacy have been going on openly and covertly for years Data banks are cropping up all over They are being fed information gathered by known accepted methods as well as by unacceptable methods We all expect to be asked for certain personal information when applying for a drivers license or for a charge account at Bloomies No problem What is asked of us in these instances is reasonable enough But what is not asked of us is the problem How many of us realize that for every reasonable solicitation there are dozens of systems collecting information about us systems about which we know nothing  Did you know that every hospital in the state is required by law to report to Albany details of every treatment of every inpatient regardless of whether the medical service given was openheart surgery or the removal of an ingrown toenail Did you know in giving this information the hospitals are required to identify the patient and the doctor to record the diagnosis and to give the cost of the treatment Although the data are coded and safeguards have been established with a view to insure confidentiality the information nevertheless is available to to someone  Did you know that many of the 38 public libraries in the county have been approached by Government agents seeking access to card files Had a single one of these attempts been successful our reading record could have been computerized for strange eyes to see We could have been labeled as being what we read  Did you know that your local druggist is required by law to give to state authorities details of every sale of certain narcotics and barbiturates And in so doing he must provide the name of the customer and the name of the doctor who wrote the prescription  Did you know that every employer in the state is required by law to report the wages of every person in his employ to a data bank established for the New York State Department of Labor and Social Services This reporting is in addition to the reporting employers must make to the United States Treasury Department by the W2 form Given the political realities it is conceivable that a commissioner of either Labor or Social Services might at some point be tempted to illegally trade this information for information a sister agency might have on us  Did you know that banks are required by law to make a photocopy of both sides of checks you write be they made payable to your padre your bookie or to your favorite butcher And that your same friendly banker is obliged to keep for five years a record of all transactions made in your account Why For whose benefit The originals are returned to you  Did you know that since abortion was legalized the name of every woman having a legal abortion in New York is sent to Albany to be added to Big Brothers list of women who have had legal abortions  Did you know that to obtain personal information on you and on me the State of New York uses more than 2000 different dataaccumulating systems When data banks were first established the information collected was stored in one place This is no longer the case There are now many data banks established by dozens of agencies and organizations Data that isnt stored in one data bank may well be stored in another Taken by itself the memory of any one data bank need not necessarily be a worry to anyone Taken together the composite could be damningly dangerous to many That persons would have unauthorized access to raw data is a valid concern To think that it is impossible for someone to gain unauthorized access to data banks and withdraw information surreptitiously is to think incorrectly It has been done  easily  even by schoolboys in a New York prep school The main key to extracting related information from different data banks is a persons Social Security number Would you believe it This innocuous designation this innocentlooking number assigned to us almost at birth to protect our oldage benefits until death is now a threat to our privacy The fact cannot be denied Our Social Security number is now The Universal Identifier Big Brother has everyones Social Security number He has also the number of every data bank  in Albany  in Washington and in Little Rock Ark Big Brother could plug into the system and ask data banks the country over for whatever information they may have on say Jonathan Livingston Seagull having the Social Security number of say 234567890 That is all he would have to do The dumb computers would respond immediately without thinking However maybe we need not be concerned about who knows what about us When campaigning Ronald Reagan vowed that if elected he would do something about this business of needlessly accumulating data about an individual Dozens of times throughout the campaign Mr Reagan said I want to get the government off your backs and out of your private lives A Presidential aide said last week that Vice President Bush had been assigned the task of reducing unnecessary government regulations affecting American life It sounds good if you can believe it Ill believe it when the Internal Revenue stops asking me the names of the customers taken on expense account lunches and what subjects we discussed
IN THE KINGDOM OF VIDEO UNCERTAINTY REIGNS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/22/arts/in-the-kingdom-of-video-uncertainty-reigns.html,HOLLYWOOD You might not go to Hollywood looking for trouble but these days it seems that trouble is the only show in town Of course what Hollywood terms a crisis might not play that way in Peoria A community that earns its living by creating and merchandising fantasies cant help but acquire a certain dreamy insularity a concept of crisis all its own Still theres no doubt that Hollywood  and the television industry in particular  has its share of genuine problems There is confusion and uncertainty about the potential competitive impact of the new technologies chief among them cable television There is real concern about the rapidly escalating and seemingly uncontrollable costs of production particularly at a time when the major television networks share of the viewing audience continues to decline There is the chilling prospect of strikes by directors and writers which could shut the industry down just as the actors strike did last fall And there is the specter of the Moral Majority and other organized groups who have vowed to boycott any sponsor of a show that they deem too sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable Even as unlikely a doomsayer as Lee Rich whose company Lorimar Productions produces Dallas the most successful show on television sounded a gloomy note Speaking before fellow members of the television industry last month Mr Rich ran down a list of crises before concluding There is uneasiness in every sector of our industry Michael Ross sounded exasperated Mr Ross is one of the creators and producers of Threes Company ABCs immensely successful comedy series and he was talking heatedly about why he flatly refused a demand by Suzanne Somers one of the stars of the show that she receive a share of its eventual profits in addition to her salary Indeed producers throughout Hollywood are bridling at the escalating salary demands made by actors as Mr Rich did with Dallass Larry Hagman But is it true Mr Ross was asked that Threes Company will ultimately earn at least 100 million by syndicating its reruns to television stations around the country No Mr Ross said itll probably be closer to 80 million and thats taking the optimistic view Moreover Mr Ross pointed out 40 percent of those revenues will go to the distributor The remainder he explained must be divided between six partners Its not so much by the time you split it all up Mr Ross said in a voice so ingenuous it seemed impolite to disbelieve him A bit of quick math after the conversation had ended Based on Mr Rosss figures if the six part ners in Threes Company split the profits evenly they each stand to earn about 8 million Grant Tinker was steering his sleek creamcolored Mercedes toward a restaurant near his offices on the CBS lot in Studio City Mr Tinker is not the sort of person one imagines talking to about crisis and uncertainty If anyone seems to typify the very essence of the easygoing good life southern Californiastyle Mr Tinker is the one He is 55 years old but even with his silver hair he looks much younger and he invariably dresses in an opennecked sport shirt tennis shoes or loafers and a crewneck sweater For all that casualness he also happens to be the president of MTM Enterprises one of the most successful and widely respected independent television production companies in Hollywood Until recently Mr Tinker was married to Mary Tyler Moore they are now seperated and MTM Enterprises was formed to produce Mary Tyler Moore Show on CBS Under Mr Tinker MTM subsequently produced such series as The Bob Newhart Show Rhoda and Phyllis Mr Tinker has long since become a very wealthy man And while none of MTMs current crop of shows  Lou Grant Hill Street Blues The White Shadow and WKRP in Cincinnati  are as successful as the original group theyre all among the most acclaimed programs on television For this lunch Mr Tinker has invited along Arthur Price the executive vice president of MTM Mr Prices style seemed somehow more suited to downbeat talk He is a small man with a black beard and on this sunny afternoon he was wearing black trousers and a black mandarincollar shirt The restaurant we had come to La Serre was airy filled with plants and evidently accustomed to entertaining Mr Tinker On our table there was an engravedbrass plaque that read Reserved for Mr Grant Tinker After wed been greeted and seated Mr Tinker began to talk about television What were facing in this industry he said is the prospect that it simply isnt going to be a money machine anymore but a business Were stumbling on the golden goose Were up against the fact that the costs of production are rising much faster than the size of the viewing audience which is what the advertisers pay for Without that growth in audience the licensing fees that the networks are willing to pay us to produce their shows are leveling off We have to deficit finance as it is and the only way you make a profit is if the show succeeds stays on the air for at least four years and recoups the investment through syndication Mr Price foresees significant changes in the production business With this great escalation in the costs here he said what youre going to see is a resurgence of entrepreneurial activity outside of Hollywood a lot of production in other places like the Osmonds are doing in Utah or that guy in North Carolina whos built a studio And by Mr Prices reckoning the jockeying is just getting started I see a lot of strikes here during the next five years as the new technologies come along The big issue in the actors strike last fall was how much they ought to share in the revenues from the new technologies and its the same issue now with the writers and the directors The prevailing myth is that the new technologies will generate huge new revenues and everyone wants a piece of the action The problem is that to this day I dont think anyone knows whether the new technologies as a business are going to prove good bad or indifferent There is a funny myth about Hollywod that life here is relaxed and frivolous full of short work days and allnight parties Actually the communitys attitude toward work more often borders on the puritanical A visiting New Yorker is invited to a small dinner party Its a convivial affair and several bottles of wine are consumed The clock strikes 10 The hostess announces that shes going up to bed to read scripts Another guest a manager says he must leave too for the same reason The New Yorker turns to the only remaining guest his friend and suggests they go out and have a drink The friend looks at him quizzically No one goes out at night for a drink here he says The evening comes to an end By 730 the next morning the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel is filled with agents and producers lawyers and managers They are huddled together over fresh orange juice and pocket calculators making deals Norman Lear the man who created such shows as All in the Family Maude and Mary Hartman Mary Hartman isnt producing shows for primetime television these days but he has his hands in nearly every other aspect of the video world He has done a pilot for a show aimed at the cable market based on average people talking intimately about their lives he is one of the partners in a company that owns subscription television services around the country he is doing a series for children titled No Adults Allowed and he is developing two movies one based on the bestselling childrens book A Wrinkle in Time the other on Heartsounds Martha Weinman Lears book about her husbands death But Mr Lear is spending most of his time these days on the organization he founded last summer as an answer to the growing power of the Rev Jerry Falwells Moral Majority Mr Lears group is called People for the American Way The organization grew out of an idea for a movie Mr Lear signed a deal in 1979 with Universal to write and direct a satirical film about the phenomenon of the evangelicals I spent a year researching it but by last July I realized that the whole thing had taken a more serious turn Mr Lear explained between bites of a lunchtime chefs salad at the conference table in his spacious office overlooking the Century City complex I felt that something had to be done about the growing climate of confusion and obfuscation Mr Lear continued People were having views forced on them through the evangelical television shows and their mail campaigns They were being led to believe that they were bad Christians if they didnt have certain views about gay rights abortion the recognition of Taiwan the ERA We addressed our organization to the climate not the issues We wanted people to believe that they had a right to their own opinions regardless of what they were What Mr Lear did was to enlist religious leaders including the Rev Theodore Hesburgh the president of Notre Dame and Dr Colin Williams former dean of Yale Universitys Divinity School in an effort to counter the fundamentalist thrust He also went out on a fundraising campaign and produced a number of short commercial spots aimed at promoting the right to free expression which ran on stations across the country between October and January Filmmaker Jonathan Demme has agreed to produce the organizations next set of television spots What weve discovered said Mr Lear is something that Reverend Falwell and the new right realized a long time ago The way to peoples heads these days is through their hearts Its hard to touch people with rhetoric but theres still an avenue open  through their emotions and their viscera Mr Lear has been successful enough to inspire a counterattack In a recent fundraising letter the Rev Falwell described Mr Lears organization as probably the most dangerous and vicious effort ever launched against the use of television and radio for the propogating of the Gospel of Jesus Christ Stars still make their own rules in Hollywood The publicist at ABC reports that Henry Winkler the star of Happy Days would be happy to talk about his new life as a producer Three days later the publicist calls back to apologize Mr Winkler wont be able to make the date after all but try calling his personal publicist in Los Angeles to reschedule the appointment Unfortunately Mr Winklers personal publicist is out ill Two days pass A call to Mr Winklers personal publicists secretary She promises to make the arrangements Three days go by A call to Mr Winklers private secretary No problem in scheduling an interview she says reassuringly Shell talk to Mr Winkler directly Three more days pass No news from Mr Winkler Suzanne Somers was explaining her demand for a high salary and profit participation on Threes Company There is no pension plan for actors no security in the cocktail hours of their lives she said in a voice so ingenuous it seemed impolite to disbelieve her A little further math Based on her current salary of 30000 an episode Miss Somers currently earns nearly 1 million a year from Threes Company based on less than six months of work Its all relative to the norm in the industry Miss Somers explained and in an odd way thats precisely the point Miss Somers life style virtually precludes having any reference point beside the industry Right now she lives with her husbandmanager Alan Hamel in a house overlooking the Pacific Ocean 30 minutes outside of Hollywood She chose the house at least in part because it borders a street so narrow that the tour busses cant get down it She also chose it because she likes the beach The catch is that if she were to go out and lie on the beach or take a walk along it shed be mobbed So she has to settle for the view But recently Miss Somers purchased a home nearer Hollywood which she is in the midst of renovating The new house will permit her considerably more isolation Miss Somers and Mr Hamel have yet to even see their nextdoor neighbor Theyve been told that his name is Daniel Ludwig reputedly the richest man in the world but theres no way to know for certain Even their pool man who also does the pool next door has never set eyes on Mr Ludwig Michael Fuchs was standing in a hallway in the Beverly Hills Hotel putting out his laundry The Beverly Hills Hotel has a kind of intimacy that Beverly Hills with its eerily unpeopled streets does not It is a hotel filled with New Yorkers who rarely run into each other back in the city but become almost preternaturally chummy when they meet 3000 miles from home Mr Fuchs is the head of programming for Home Box Office the largest of the movieoriented pay television networks Like other such networks HBO is fed by satellite to cabletelevision systems around the country who make it available to subscribers for a seperate monthly fee Mr Fuchs is based in New York but spends much of his time in Los Angeles since feature films are the major source of programming for HBO and Hollywood is where the major film studios are located Mr Fuchs was looking a little beleaguered which was scarcely surprising HBO is not very popular in Hollywood these days Although the company is providing a new source of revenue to the movie studios studio executives feel they are not getting their due In part this is mere invidiousness The studios were by their own admission slow to realize the potential of pay television as a lucrative ancillary market for their films HBO itself struggled along for five years until 1975 when a decision was made to put the service on a satellite thereby making it available nationwide Now HBO has turned into one of the most successful divisions of its parent company Time Inc What galled studio executives was that their films were responsible for HBOs burgeoning success Moreover they became convinced that HBO was using its dominance in the paytelevision industry  HBO currently has 65 million subscribers compared to 15 million for Showtime the second largest network  to set the prices it paid for licensing films Studio executives complained that they either accepted what HBO offered or sacrificed paytelevision revenues altogether Steve Roberts the president of 20th CenturyFox Telecommunications argues that the studios are caught in a bind All motion picture producers are faced with the same frustration he said The dilemna is that the cost of producing films has tripled over the past three years  from about 3 million to 9 million plus a proportional rise in marketing costs  while the theatrical market has remained flat We need the revenues from the new markets but its been difficult to obtain a fair share of the paytelevision pie even though the pie is growing These concerns prompted four of the largest film studios  20th CenturyFox Paramount MCA and Columbia  to band together last April with Getty Oil to form their own paytelevision service Calling it Premiere they promised to offer their own films on their own pay network nine months before any other pay network got them The Justice Department promptly brought suit charging Premiere with antitrust violations and pricefixing In late December just days before Premiere was set to be launched a Federal judge ruled the venture illegal So Mr Fuchs had come out to California this time to mend fences and to reopen negotiations with the four studios that had stopped selling any movies to HBO while awaiting the outcome of the Premiere case We were hopeful that the trial would be a catharsis Mr Fuchs said sipping a Perrier in the hotel suite that serves as his makeshift California office But so much emotion was built up that once we got back to negotiating  well it isnt quite like dealing with the Iranians but it isnt all love and peace either Its still very charged Just that morning Mr Fuchs and two associates had concluded a deal with Columbia  one of the four Premiere companies  to license its major 1980 films HBO has since negotiated a deal with Paramount but agreements have not yet been reached with the other two Premiere partners On the one hand HBO is adopting a more conciliatory posture these days Ill concede that we may have been too tough in our negotiations at one point Mr Fuchs said We acknowledge that movies drive our business I cant take the dollars we have budgeted for movies put them into specials and expect to succeed We need the Kramer vs Kramers  But Mr Fuchs argues HBO is being unjustly accused of greediness He says that the paytelevision industry will spend as much licensing films in 1981  about 300 million  as the three television networks combined And he maintains that 45 percent of HBOs gross revenues go to the movie industry During the last year said Mr Fuchs our budget for buying movies increased 80 percent and our subscriber count only went up 50 percent Our pretax and aftertax profits are right in the ball park with the movie studios in a good year A major studio executive who declined to be identified for fear of antagonizing HBO took issue with Mr Fuchs HBO represents 70 percent of the pay market the executive said but the dollar amount theyve offered us for our films ends up being no more than the total we were offered by the combination of Showtime and Warners Movie Channel which together account for less than than 30 percent of the market We still dont feel were getting a fair deal from HBO So for now there is something of a tense standoff HBO is suffering because without many of the major studios films its schedule has been leaner and less alluring to subscribers in recent months The studios that arent licensing films to HBO are losing out because they are sacrificing the substantial revenues theyd otherwise be getting This is an industry that needs to be stabilized said Mr Fuchs What Im afraid of now is that with all this emotion were in danger of killing the golden goose Two weeks have passed Henry Winklers East Coast publicist calls Henry is coming to New York Would it be possible to arrange an interview
LAW ON CREATION THEORY PROVES BOON FOR GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/22/us/law-on-creation-theory-proves-boon-for-governor-of-arkansas.html,Facing a stack of about 450 bills churned out by the Arkansas Legislature in the closing days of its session Gov Frank White plucked a creationscience bill from the bottom and signed it By signing and praising the bill within hours of its reaching his desk Thursday and without even reading it as he admitted at the signature ceremony Mr White reinforced his standing with conservative and evangelical religious groups that supported him last year in his upset victory over the incumbent Bill Clinton The Republican Governors image had been sullied a little two weeks earlier by the disclosure that at the request of the Governors office lobbyists had been supplying whisky for Mr White to serve to legislators at social functions at the Governors mansion It was not so much the solicitation of favors from lobbyists that offended religionists as the notion that the Governors den had been turned into a bar He was denounced by the Arkansas Christian Civic Foundation Mr White a member of a small evangelical Bible sect announced the day after his election that his victory was a victory for the Lord Registration efforts by Moral Majority and other religious groups had helped his campaign Still Mr White did nothing during the legislative session this winter to help the religious groups with their legislative goals the major one being an unsuccessful bill to discourage abortions The evolution bill which requires that public schools give equal weight to creation science and the evolution theory in the classrooms was introduced in the last days of the session and breezed through both houses 22 to 2 in the Senate and 69 to 18 in the House of Representatives Called a Terrible Bill Many legislators who voted for it were dismayed This is a terrible bill but its worded so cleverly that none of us can vote against it if we want to come back up here said Representative Bill Clark of Sheridan The American Civil Liberties Union plans to challenge the law in Federal court Supporters of the legislation insist that it would not inject religion into the classroom because instruction would have to be on the basis of the scientific case for the instantaneous creation of man and the universe and not on the basis of the Bible However the legislation also says its aim is to prevent establishment of theologically liberal humanist nontheist or atheist religions Mr White was unaware of that purpose and similar provisions until reporters read them to him at the signature ceremony Arkansas enacted a law in 1928 barring the teaching of evolution in the schools but the law was struck down by the United States Supreme Court in 1968

Roni Handler last Halloween as her first baby a boy The doctors and nurses didnt think the baby would come out in one piece says Mrs Handler 25 who went into labor in the 26th week of her first

hemorrhage in his brain a bout with a serious intestinal disorder and episodes of dangerously depressed breathing and heart rates But he was luckier than many other 1000gram babies He survived each crisis and he grew By Jan 24 he weighed nearly five pounds and the hospital sent him home Zachary is a miracle baby His survival represents one of the proudest advances in neonatology the subspecialty of newborn care formally recognized by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1975 But it also represents neonatologys Achilles heel As everyounger babies with evermorefragile organ systems are saved more are leaving the intensivecare nursery with medical and psychological problems left in part by the very technology that saved them A recent raft of lawsuits  parents suing doctors for malpractice children suing parents for the handicaps with which they have had to live  raises questions about how far this technology can take us How aggressively should doctors treat very premature infants when little more than half of them are destined to live  and when a sizable minority of the survivors may end up physically or mentally impaired Should the parents unwilling to face a lifetime with a damaged child be allowed to call a halt to the heroics And as the age at which a fetus is considered viable continues to drop will we reach a point at which late abortion is not considered abortion at all but euthanasia Questions arise too over how much psychological damage may be caused by a premature birth What does the baby lose in terms of sensory as well as physical growth when he is wrenched too soon from the womb What does the mother lose when she is deprived of the last several weeks of pregnancy a time she would have used to prepare not only a nursery but also her own psyche for the arrival of the new family member And what does the family as a whole lose when the parents must grow attached to a scrawny sick infant instead of the fat responsive baby who would have been born several months later As recently as the mid1970s such questions were rarely asked At that time most babies of Zacharys size some 80 percent  died and 15 percent of those who lived suffered severe physical and mental handicaps With such odds obstetricians often asked only one question Is the baby worth resuscitating But today the odds of survival  and intact survival  have shifted to Zacharys side The best neonatology units in the country including those at Childrens Hospital in Washington ColumbiaPresbyterian Medical Center and New York Hospital and the Rainbow Childrens Hospital in Cleveland can save 80 to 85 percent of the infants born weighing 1000 to 1500 grams 22 to 32 pounds Even more remarkable 50 to 60 percent of the babies weighing 750 to 1000 grams at birth 16 to 22 pounds survive too Because neonatologists can keep alive about half the babies born weighing less than 1000 grams  a feat unimagined even 10 years ago when a preemie was defined as any newborn weighing less than five pounds  they are creating everlarger numbers of severely handicapped individuals The number of abnormal survivors of neonatal intensive care who weighed 1000 grams at birth has roughly doubled in the last 20 years according to Dr Peter Budetti of the University of California at San Francisco But during this period he says the number of normal survivors with birth weights under 1000 grams has increased nearly 20fold Of the 39000 infants born each year weighing less than 1500 grams about 1 percent of all live births roughly 13000 die and 3000 are seriously damaged with problems like epilepsy blindness mental retardation and cerebral palsy Another 4000 are moderately impaired Is this too high a price to pay for the concurrent salvaging of 19000 healthy normal babies As the babies they treat get smaller and smaller doctors in the nations leading intensivecare nurseries there are some 600 today are faced with tougher choices Dr Gordon Avery chairman of the division of neonatology at Childrens Hospital foresees improvements in the treatment of preemies younger than 28 weeks that will raise survival rates and reduce the proportion of damaged babies He also predicts that doctors will be able to keep alive fetuses as young as 24 weeks gestational age babies born four months early But no younger he says Twentyfour weeks is the point beyond which even refinements of current technology cant take us because of the extreme immaturity of the lung says Dr Avery Before that stage the fetal lungs are too disorganized too undefined to respond even to mechanical ventilation The technology needed to keep such a being alive he adds would be so extraordinarily expensive and effortful such a wild invasion of the babys physiology that it would be reductio ad absurdum even to consider it Ten years ago neonatologists might have said the same thing about keeping alive babies under 28 weeks In the past what killed most preemies was the profound immaturity of their lungs the last organ to develop in utero Respirators were cumbersome and failed to compensate for the lungs inelasticity and most premature infants  like President Kennedys son Patrick in 1963  died of hyaline membrane disease Today steroids are often administered to women in premature labor to stimulate the fetus into an accelerated lung maturation before it is delivered After birth the babys acidbase balance an indication of lung and kidney function is continually monitored through a catheter placed in the umbilicus And the new machines used for artificial ventilation equipped with the most modern methods for delivering air to fragile lungs seem less traumatic than their predecessors As a result hyaline membrane disease though it still affects some 30 percent of babies under 1500 grams today has a mortality rate of 20 percent down from almost 70 percent in 1970 Neonatologists have learned that an infant born after 26 or 27 weeks of gestation is not just a smaller version of a fullterm infant born after 40 weeks He is for all purposes a fetus A look into the intensivecare nursery at Childrens Hospital is like a look into the womb Many of the youngest babies still are covered with the downy hair that usually disappears in the last weeks of pregnancy Their skin is paperthin and brittle the color of aged parchment and it tears easily Fat has not yet been deposited beneath the skin and the babies have a wrinkled drawn look Their movements seem disjointed and their responses bear little relation to the activities going on around them To these immature infants even as routine a procedure as drawing blood can be incredibly stressful One surgical resident says trying to insert a needle into the vein of a 27weeker is like trying to insert a garden hose into the vein of an adult Not only do these infants look like fetuses  or sometimes more like newborn puppies  but in many cases their internal workings are quite literally fetal The lungs of a 27weeker cannot expand and contract properly since nature did not intend them to function for another three months The heart may pump blood poorly bypassing the lungs almost entirely  a vestige of fetal circulation when blood received its oxygen not from the lungs but from the placenta And the brain its own bloodvessel system not yet fully developed is highly subject to hemorrhages when the lungs malfunction As all these systems hover in delicate balance neonatologists are always at risk of toppling one while treating another Their goal is to recreate using drugs and machines the ideal growth environment of the uterus In many remarkable ways they can mimic the placenta supplying nutrition respiration even circulation for infants too immature to perform such tasks alone But theres something we cant do says Dr Rudy Foy a fellow in neonatology at Childrens Hospital We cant stop the bleeds Intracranial bleeds occur in 40 to 45 percent of preemies under 1500 grams The bleeds can range in severity from a localized tiny bleed in the fluidfilled ventricles of the brain which eventually dries up and disappears to a more massive bleed that seeps from the ventricles into the brain matter itself and may leave permanent scars Ordinarily the more massive bleeds as detected by computerized Xrays lead to more severe motor and mental difficulties later on and the mild bleeds leave their survivors neurologically intact But individual babies often defy general expectations and the staff at Childrens is no longer surprised when 2yearold survivors of large bleeds return for followup visits toddling happily behind their mothers Its so hard to predict which babies will do well and which ones wont says Dr Anne B Fletcher director of the nursery at the Neonatology Unit at Childrens Hospital The bulletin board in her office is crammed with snapshots of grinning brighteyed children who were treated at Childrens as infants Most of them especially the bigger ones are doing quite well she says But of those under 1000 grams were seeing very few without problems of some sort though usually the problems are mild and reversible Generally the babies with bleeds are the ones who run into problems But some of the ones without bleeds arent turning out that well either How much damage is too much damage How vigorously should doctors fight to save a baby who sustains a massive bleed Because the longterm effects of bleeds are not known doctors are careful not to give up on these babies too soon We put a ventricular drain into some babies with big bleeds to prevent hydrocephalus the buildup of fluid in the brain Dr Fletcher says But if the bleed is massive which usually means the baby suffered a severe lack of oxygen soon after birth we may decide not to continue ventilation Some babies survive massive bleeds with little assistance however and doctors cannot predict whether they will develop normally Whos to say whats normal asks Willie Campbell 45 His son Christopher born at 28 weeks gestation weighing 2 12 pounds had a major brain bleed and spent his first seven months in the nursery at Childrens Hospital Maybe he will never be right adds Christophers mother Tillie who at 37 had had two miscarriages and one therapeutic abortion before Christopher was born last July 10 But hes already a special child hes shown it in his magnificent will to live Whatever happens to him from now on if he can manage with it we can manage with it Before they took Christopher home on Jan 19 the Campbells had to learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation a firstaid technique to be used in case Chris stops breathing Among the many problems Chris went home with was bronchopulmonary dysplasia or concrete lung one of several conditions known to result from a long bout of artificial ventilation Doctors think it is reversible after three or four years Chris should have grown enough fresh pliable lung tissue to replace the damaged lung But in the meantime anything that affects Chris will hurt his lungs first and he can expect more than his share of upperrespiratory infections chronic bronchitis croup and pneumonia The complications of prematurity now seen in the intensivecare nursery were almost unheard of 10 years ago because infants rarely lived to develop them One such problem is necrotizing enterocolitis NEC a serious intestinal disorder that affects some 20 percent of the preemies under 1000 grams at Childrens Hospital and usually strikes just when the baby seems out of the woods  at an average age of about two weeks The cause of NEC is unknown but doctors believe it begins when blood supply to the babys intestine is decreased because of early breathing difficulties This leads to a burnlike sloughing of the delicate intestinal lining that predisposes it to invasion by the infants own bacteria Formula or breast milk provides a growth medium for that bacteria and as a result the bowel stops functioning Doctors at Childrens Hospital are constantly on guard for NEC in tiny very premature babies they check the babys abdominal size stomach residuals and bowel movements several times a day They suspected NEC in Zachary Handler when he was eight weeks old and passed a bloody stool and they treated him successfully with antibiotics and cessation of oral feedings for 14 days Sometimes though NEC develops insidiously and for all their vigilance doctors are not aware a baby has it until the bowel has ruptured and its contents are spilling into the abdomen Such was the case with little Sherika Shepard Sherika was born on Nov 18 weighing 794 grams 1 pound 12 ounces after 27 weeks gestation She was doing well for so small a baby breathing unfortified air on her own by the time she was four days old At first Sherika was fed only intravenously but by Nov 24 she was drinking some sterile water and later formula and breast milk through a tube She was regaining some of the weight she had lost right after birth all babies experience a slight dip in weight in the first week and on Dec 4 she weighed 860 grams But that morning her bowel ruptured and she was rushed to emergency surgery The doctors said she had a 5 percent chance of even surviving the operation recalls Delphine Shepard 30 who had had two late miscarriages before Sherika was born by Cesarean section I guess a lot of parents would say Well then dont bother its not worth taking her through all that pain But this was the closest we had ever come to finally having our child and I just thought that if the doctors did all they could to save her then Id feel as if I had done all I could Sherika lost 50 percent of her large intestine and 43 percent of her small intestine in the operation She was given a colostomy  a hole in her abdomen with a bag attached to empty her bowels into Much of her intestine will probably grow back  one of the great benefits of performing surgery on newborns is that they still have the ability to regenerate certain organs And when she is bigger her colostomy will be closed The chances are that the only reminder Sherika will have of her nearly fatal bout with NEC will be her abdominal scar As one fragile organ system after another breaks down neonatologists often find themselves putting out fires that they themselves started  many times by the very act of keeping alive such immature babies Iatrogenic or doctorcaused problems bedevil these tiny babies at each turn in their rollercoaster hospital stays  once again because many are simply too immature to withstand the hightechnology medical care they need One of these problems retrolental fibroplasia  oxygeninduced blindness  is becoming more prevalent because of the extreme immaturity of tiny babies eyes The fragile blood vessels of the retina of a 27weeker are vulnerable to damage from any amount of oxygen however small even 30 percent oxygen room air is 21 percent administered for a few days may lead to visual problems if the baby is premature enough In a recent Canadian study onethird of the babies under 1500 grams who survived were found to experience some degree of retrolental fibroplasia Many cases reversed themselves but about 10 percent of the survivors studied were permanently blind At Childrens Hospital last year 17 babies with birth weights under 1000 grams graduated from the intensivecare unit two of them were blind In the last several years retrolental fibroplasia victims who were blinded in the early 1950s when standard medical treatment of preemies involved administering high doses of oxygen in the incubator have been awarded large malpractice settlements Last month Daniel Burton Jr 27 of Union City NJ was awarded 29 million in a suit he brought against the doctor who raised the oxygen level in his incubator Today oxygen is used sparingly and is monitored scrupulously in its travels through the babys system but neonatologists must still sometimes choose between blindness and death In the absence of other serious abnormalities they usually choose blindness The parents of course have some say in making such choices  but not much Since neither parents nor doctors can have enough information to make truly informed decisions Dr Fletcher says she tries to spare parents the decision to give up on a child If such a course is warranted she says she will usually make it first and then approach the parents for their consent But though the decisions may be shared the consequences are not I go home at night says Dr Rudy Foy I dont have to live with a 5yearold who isnt walking or talking Other iatrogenic difficulties can be caused by prolonged intravenous feeding It may lead to liver damage and the skin where the intravenous line is inserted may be damaged by the concentrated solution Frequent blood sampling  required to keep close watch on the babys blood gases electrolytes and nutrients  creates the need for blood transfusions every few days which in turn raises the risk of transmitting infections or damaging the babys fragile circulatory system Umbilical catheters inserted to make blood sampling easier can breed clots that may break away lodge in the kidney and potentially cause kidney damage Exposure to other sick babies puts preemies at high risk of infection and most nurseries report two or three viral or bacterial epidemics a year And the drugs used to correct all these problems both those resulting directly from prematurity and those caused by the treatment itself usually have side effects of their own The least understood iatrogenic problem in the intensivecare nursery is not physical but psychological No one yet knows the longrange effect of raising a fetus whose only stimulation should be the sway of his mothers body and the sound of her voice placenta and heartbeat in a world of nonstop light and noise Neither does anyone know the effect of prolonged isolation on something that psychologists now recognize as important  the parentinfant bond When a healthy fullterm infant is born new parents have time to bond with their baby as they respond to his wellvocalized demands interacting with him eyetoeye and skintoskin This period of attachment which lasts for the first months of an infants life has been shown to influence the way parents feel about  and treat  their children for years to come Indeed bonding seems to begin even before birth in the last trimester of pregnancy when the fetuss forceful kicks announce its presence to both mother and father During that time some scientists believe the mother manufactures hormones that will make her especially receptive to the baby in its early weeks at home These plans are shortcircuited when a baby is born too soon Months before she is ready the mother is forced to love a small scrawny creature who might die or suffer great damage in the days to come and whose very presence is a rebuke According to Carole Kennon a social worker with the neonatalcare unit at Childrens Hospital All mothers of preemies feel guilty to some extent Part of being a woman is to produce a fullterm healthy Gerber baby and in this theyve failed At Childrens as at most good intensivecare nurseries parents are encouraged to interact with their preemies no matter how small or how sick When the infants are in isolettes covered transparent bassinets supplied with purified air the nurses urge parents to reach in through the portholes and touch an arm a leg any spot not covered with tape tubes and monitor leads Later when the babies are stronger the nurses turn over to the mothers and fathers as many of the caretaking chores as the parents feel ready to perform Some parents are quite good at handling babies who are no bigger than their forearms Roni Handler for one giggled whenever she gave a writhing screeching Zachary his bath Mrs Handler could hold him squirms and all in just one hand while she soaped him with the other Delphine Shepard was a bit more cautious with her baby at least at first Sherika had more tubes than Zachary plus her colostomy bag and Mrs Shepard worried that she might dislodge something As long as the nurses wrap her up first to make sure the tubes are in the right places then Im OK about holding her she said three weeks after Sherikas surgery But she admitted that she didnt quite feel like a mother yet partly because Sherika was still too weak to cry And Im not doing anything yet about setting up the babys room or letting people buy presents for her she said I dont want to do anything until were sure shes coming home Because of the prolonged early separation between parent and child and because preemies often are not cuddly or responsive many parents feel awkward when they finally have their babies home alone When the parents have been deprived of caring for their child for so long they get him home and want him to show his babyness says Dr Juarlyn Gaiter the neonatal psychologist at Childrens Hospital But a preterm infant whos been sick is still different even when he reaches 40 weeks gestational age from a fullterm infant born after 40 weeks in utero Hes delayed in his ability to respond to social stimulation and when he gets home he still has a lot of work to do to get his psychological and behavioral state organized These babies are not visually alert they have low levels of irritability They cant cue their parents about what they want and some even avoid eye contact The result a poor fit between parents expectations and babys behavior from which the parent hurt and disappointed may withdraw An alarmingly high proportion of disorders of mothering ranging from mild anxiety to physical abuse occurs in children who were premature In studies conducted in the 1960s and 1970s 19 percent of the cases of child abuse and 28 percent of the cases of failure to thrive involved premature babies who made up less than 5 percent of the infant population We have already arrived at a point where the medical heroics that can keep alive everyounger newborns raise some nettlesome questions The Supreme Court legalized abortion up to the age of viability but that age has changed greatly since the Roe v Wade decision of 1973  and continues to edge back a week every few years As smaller and smaller fetuses are considered viable  that is able to live outside the womb albeit with prolonged medical support new problems arise For example prenatal genetic screening may be in for trouble since it is often tied to late abortion if the fetus is found to be deformed Amniocentesis the sampling of intrauterine fluid for chromosomal damage cannot be performed until the 16th to 18th week of pregnancy and test results which are returned four to six weeks later are sometimes equivocal and must be repeated What will happen to this timetable when survival of 24weekers becomes a commonplace It is possible that the ability of neonatal care to reduce the age of viability may have an impact on societys attitude toward abortion says Dr Kenneth Ryan chief of obstetrics and gynecology at the Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston As research progresses an obstetrician who even slightly miscalculates the age or size of the fetus can  during an intended abortion  deliver a live baby who must be rushed to the intensivecare nursery Maybe the best way to deal with this issue is to keep the two activities separate with gynecologists to terminate pregnancy and neonatologists to handle premature care says Dr Ryan who was chairman of the nowdefunct National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research An ethical gray zone now exists in which the same event may be considered either a late miscarriage or a premature birth depending on circumstance As neonatologists continue to improve survival rates for secondtrimester fetuses that gray zone is sure to widen The question When is a fetus capable of independent potentially intact human life will be asked with evermore frequency and urgency And neonatologists will be forced to consider at what cost and at what risk of damage they should try to salvage a fetus which has already been deprived of almost half its alloted time in the womb
Pope Says Catholics Have a Duty To Fight Legalization of Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/23/world/pope-says-catholics-have-a-duty-to-fight-legalization-of-abortion.html,Declaring that abortion is the killing of an innocent creature Pope John Paul II said today that Roman Catholics had a duty to work against laws legalizing the practice Speaking to about 25000 people gathered in St Peters Square for his weekly blessing the Pope praised a statement by the Italian Bishops Conference last week that called for abortion laws to be overcome with all legitimate means and opportunities The image of God is present in every human creature from the first instant of conception the Pope said reaffirming traditional Roman Catholic teaching It is in this context that one places the effort to inscribe divine law in the daily life of the earth so that beyond any equivocation the value of motherhood and the full defense of human life is guaranteed

COURT BACKS LAW TO NOTIFY PARENTS BEFORE AN ABORTION ON A TEEN-AGER,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/24/us/court-backs-law-to-notify-parents-before-an-abortion-on-a-teen-ager.html,The Supreme Court ruled today that a state may require a doctor to inform a teenaged girls parents before performing an abortion on her or face criminal penalties at least when the girl is still living at home and dependent on her parents The 6to3 decision turned back a constitutional challenge to a Utah law that requires a doctor to notify the parents if possible before performing an abortion on a minor The challenge was brought by a 15yearold pregnant girl whose doctor agreed with her that it would not be in her best interests to tell her parents But he refused to perform the abortion she requested because of the criminal liability In another case the Court upheld the constitutionality of statutory rape laws that punish men but not women for sexual relations with a minor of the opposite sex Page B10 Right to Privacy Cited In the abortion case the girl argued that the Utah law violated her right to privacy and that its failure to exempt mature or emancipated minors from the notice requirement made it unconstitutionally broad She lost in the Utah state courts Todays decision stopped considerably short of upholding the Utah law in its entirety Writing for the majority Chief Justice Warren E Burger said that because the girl identified only as HL was still living at home and did not claim to be either emancipated or mature she was not entitled to challenge the law on behalf of other minors who might fall into those categories Emancipated minors are those who are married selfsupporting or in other ways independent of their parents Mature minors are those whom the law regards as capable of making informed decisions about their own health and welfare Because HL was not in either category the Chief Justice wrote the Court was limited to considering the constitutionality of the Utah law only as it applied to an immature dependent minor like HL Despite the relative narrowness of the ruling it is at least a symbolic victory for the antiabortion forces and is likely to have political as well as social ramifications The Court has twice struck down state laws requiring parental consent to a minors abortion The Utah law enacted in 1978 was an effort to circumvent the earlier ruling on consent by substituting the notification requirement A handful of states have taken the same approch and other state legislatures are now likely to be under pressure to follow the Utah model New York New Jersey and Connecticut have no such notification requirement Prochoice groups fear that the notice requirement will deter pregnant teenagers from obtaining safe legal abortions There are more than 400000 abortions on teenagers a year in the United States and an estimated onequarter of those teenagers do not tell their parents about their pregnancy The enforcement of a notice requirement might force these girls to try selfabortion to delay an abortion or to have a child they were not prepared to care for Rate of TeenAge Pregnancy A recent study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute estimated that four out of every 10 girls now 14 years old would become pregnant before their 20th birthday Teenagers constitute 18 percent of sexually active women but have 46 percent of the illegitimate births and 31 percent of all abortions in this country In todays case HL v Matheson No 795903 Chief Justice Burger wrote that for girls such as HL the statute plainly serves the important considerations of family integrity and protecting adolescents He continued The medical emotional and psychological consequences of an abortion are serious and can be lasting this is particularly so when the patient is immature The Utah statute is reasonably calculated to protect minors in appellants class by enhancing the potential for parental consultation concerning a decision that has potentially traumatic and permanent consequences Quotation From 1980 Ruling The Chief Justice rejected the argument that the notice requirement would deter some minors from seeking abortions The Constitution does not compel a state to finetune its statutes so as to encourage or facilitate abortions he said To the contrary state action encouraging childbirth except in the most urgent circumstances is rationally related to the legitimate governmental objective of protecting potential life  The quotations were from last years Supreme Court decision that upheld the refusal of Congress to pay for most abortions under the Medicaid program One of the six members of the voting majority Associate Justice John Paul Stevens refused to join the Chief Justices opinion because he said the Court should have found the Utah law valid as applied to all minors Two others in the majority Associate Justices Lewis F Powell Jr and Potter Stewart joined the Burger opinion but also wrote separately to emphasize that the majority decision applied neither to mature minors nor to a minor who demonstrates as HL apparently did not that parental notice would not be in her best interests Girls in those categories they said have a constitutional right to an independent decisionmaker presumably a judge who could exempt them from the notification requirement Associate Justices Byron R White and William H Rehnquist joined the Chief Justices opinion without comment The Dissenting Opinion Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Associate Justices William J Brennan Jr and Harry A Blackmun Justice Marshall said that the Utah law was unconstitutional as applied to all minors The law burdens the minors fundamental right to choose with her physician whether to terminate her pregnancy Justice Marshall wrote adding Rather than respecting the private realm of family life the statute invokes the criminal machinery of the state in an attempt to influence the interactions within the family
JUSTICES BACK RAPE LAW PENALIZING ONLY THE MALE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/24/us/justices-back-rape-law-penalizing-only-the-male.html,The Supreme Court today upheld the constitutionality of statutory rape laws that punish males but not females for intercourse with an underage partner of the opposite sex By a vote of 5 to 4 the Court rejected a challenge to Californias statutory rape law brought by a 17yearold male who was charged with having sexual relations with a 16yearold female He argued that the law violated his right to equal protection The California law is similar to the law in New York and nine other states in placing criminal liability only on the male partner for a sexual act in which one partner is a minor New Yorks highest court upheld that states law last December Connecticut New Jersey and 35 other states have statutory rape laws that punish the adult partner of either sex While five Justices agreed with the California Supreme Court that the law was constitutional there was no majority opinion Associate Justice William H Rehnquist writing for himself and three other Justices concluded that the law permissibly furthers the states interest in preventing teenage pregnancy Sexual Risks Distinguished We need not be medical doctors to discern that young men and young women are not similarly situated with respect to the problems and the risks of sexual intercourse Justice Rehnquist wrote in an opinion joined by Chief Justice Warren E Burger and Associate Justices Potter Stewart and Lewis F Powell Jr Only women may become pregnant Justice Rehnquist continued and they suffer disproportionately the profound physical emotional and psychological consequences of sexual activity The risk of pregnancy he said is a substantial deterrence to young women who might otherwise be sexually active but no similar natural sanctions deter males Justice Rehnquist concluded Because virtually all of the significant harmful and inescapably identifiable consequences of teenage pregnancy fall on the young female a legislature acts well within its authority when it elects to punish only the participant who by nature suffers few of the consequences of his conduct Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun while in agreement with Justice Rehnquists conclusion refused to sign his opinion Justice Blackmuns separate opinion appeared to reflect bitterness over the result of recent Supreme Court decisions on abortion including todays decision that upheld a requirement that parents be notified before a doctor performs an abortion on a teenaged girl Justice Rehnquist was in the majority and Justice Blackmun in dissent in that case Consequences of Pregnancy It is gratifying Justice Blackmun wrote with evident sarcasm that the Rehnquist opinion recognized the serious consequences of teenage pregnancy There have been times when I have wondered whether the Court was capable of this perception he said There were two dissenting opinions Associate Justice John Paul Stevens dismissed as fanciful Justice Rehnquists assumption that the risk of pregnancy had effectively deterred young women from participation in the riskcreating conduct and that women therefore did not need the additional deterrence of criminal liability The fact that a female confronts a greater risk of harm than a male is a reason for applying the prohibition to her he wrote not a reason for granting her a license to use her own judgment on whether or not to assume the risk Associate Justice William J Brennan Jr in a dissenting opinion joined by Associate Justices Byron R White and Thurgood Marshall said that the majority had not properly applied the Courts precedents for sexdiscrimination cases Justification of California Law Justice Brennan said that the case Michael M v Superior Court No 791344 required California to justify its law by proving that it could not have achieved the same result preventing teenage pregnancy with a law that treated both sexes equally The state has not produced such evidence in this case Justice Brennan said adding that the law which dates from the mid1800s had not been enacted to deter pregnancy but to further outmoded sexual stereotypes about female chastity In upholding the state law the California Supreme Court found that the sexbased distinction was justified by a compelling state interest the strictest level of scrutiny which the United States Supreme Court has typically reserved for laws that make distinctions on the basis of race or national origin The Justices today subjected the law to the socalled middlelevel scrutiny that the Court has developed for sexdiscrimination cases Under that standard the distinction must bear a substantial relationship to an important governmental objective Equal Rights Amendment If the proposed equal rights amendment became part of the Constitution laws that treat women and men differently would presumably always be subject to strict scrutiny and would have to be justified by a compelling state interest Whether that analysis would have made a difference in the outcome of todays case is problematic Action at the Court today was heavily concentrated in the area of family law and relations between the sexes In a unanimous decision the Court declared unconstitutional a Louisiana law derived from the Napoleonic Code that gave the husband the unilateral right to dispose of property jointly owned by husband and wife The decision Kirchberg v Feenstra No 791388 affirmed a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which held that the law violated the wifes right to equal protection Justice Marshall wrote the opinion which is of somewhat abstract interest because Louisiana has repealed the law in question New York Custody Law The Justices agreed to rule on the constitutionality of the New York law that provides for permanent termination of parents custody of their children The law similar to that in many other states allows the state to obtain a judgment of permanent neglect against the parents if the child has been in the custody of a childcare agency for more than a year and if the parent has repeatedly failed to evince interest in the childs welfare Proof under the law is by a fair preponderance of the evidence The question in the case Santosky v Kramer No 805889 is whether the state must prove its case by a higher standard clear and convincing evidence The Court had expected to decide this issue in a case from Delaware but it dismissed that case earlier this month because Delaware had revised its law The issues in the New York case are somewhat narrower than those in the Delaware case

CAREY MAY BACK ABORTION RULE ON NOTIFICATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/25/nyregion/carey-may-back-abortion-rule-on-notification.html,Governor Carey said today that he might consider a change in state law that would require doctors to notify a teenage girls parents when she sought an abortion The Governors remarks followed a decision yesterday by the United States Supreme Court that upheld a Utah law requiring such parental notification at least when the pregnant teenager was a minor still dependent on her family and living at home If a procedure is going to be performed on one of my children I want to know about it notwithstanding consent the Governor told a meeting here of the National Organization for Women What Im addressing is notification The remark brought some murmuring from the audience which had given the Governor a standing ovation when he vowed to continue support of Medicaid financing for abortions Mr Carey then said If thats the law of the land go quarrel with the Supreme Court Might Improve on Utah Bill Asked later by reporters if he would sign a bill modeled on the Utah law the Governor said Maybe we can improve on the Utah bill Lets say that if that kind of bill were to pass Id certainly give it very careful and reasonable consideration Barbara Shack the chief lobbyist for the New York Civil Liberties Union said the Supreme Courts ruling upheld parental notification only in a narrow range of cases and did not mandate that other states adopt parental notification statutes But State Senator Frank Padavan Republican of Queens who last year encountered opposition to a broader parental notification bill primarily on constitutional grounds announced plans to reintroduce the bill A Supreme Court ruling last June upheld the Hyde Amendment which limits the circumstances under which an abortion is eligible for Federal Medicaid reimbursement Since the ruling the number of states providing Medicaid funds for most abortions has dwindled to nine among them New York Assistance Budget Due Debate over whether New York should continue to pay for poor womens abortions will begin this week with the introduction in the State Senate of a local assistance budget from which Medicaid funds for abortions are excised According to the State Social Services Department New York State and its local governments combined to pay 123 million in 1980 for Medicaid abortions enough to cover an estimated 50000 abortions New York law does not require a physician to notify parents before performing an abortion on a teenager However according to Alfred F Moran executive director of Planned Parenthood of New York most doctors attempt to involve a parent or another related adult in the case of an emotionally immature female Mr Moran added that we will not provide and I think no physician in the state of New York would provide an abortion service to any youngster who he believes cannot give informed consent Abortion Figures Cited He said about 35000 New York teenagers under the age of 18 became pregnant in 1979 with 20000 of those cases ending in abortions According to the State Health Department 1732 teenagers aged 14 and younger became pregnant in 1979 with 1225 having abortions On the question of Medicaid funds for abortions Senator James H Donovan a Republican from Chadwicks who is the central abortion foe here is likely to find enough votes in the Senate to amend the local assistance budget to delete that financing But unlike other years this year Mr Donovan hopes to shift the focus of the controversy from the Senate to the Assembly by sending the more liberal house two versions of the assistance budget one without the Medicaid abortion funds and one with the funds That way Mr Donovan said the Senate could not be accused by advocates of Medicaid abortion reimbursement of blocking agreement on a state budget Richard J Roth a spokesman for Senator Warren M Anderson of Binghamton the Senate majority leader observed however that Mr Donovan would be risking Assembly approval of the bill that abortion foes do not favor

MORAL MAJORITY STARTS AD CAMPAIGN TO COUNTER CRITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/26/us/moral-majority-starts-ad-campaign-to-counter-critics.html,Moral Majority Inc has begun a campaign of fullpage newspaper advertisements insisting that it is not antiSemitic or opposed to equal rights for women and that the groups concerns are moral rather than political The advertisements also state that the conservative group is not a religious organization attempting to control the Government The advertisements which charge the organizations critics with unfairly attacking it to raise funds for themselves were described by Ronald S Godwin vice president and chief of operations of the organization as part of a major effort by us to dispel some of the misinformation and misimpressions about us The advertisements say that state affiliates of the group may from time to time hold positions not held by Moral Majority Inc the national organization But Mr Godwin said in an interview that the national organization was seeking through educational and training efforts to exert greater leadership over the local groups and avoid embarrassments Since it burst into political prominence last year Moral Majority has been widely denounced by Democrats as antiSemitic and generally narrowminded and has been a helpful though sometimes embarrassing political ally to Republicans Gained Credit in Campaigns Many political professionals credited the group with registering enough new voters to swing several close Senate races to Republican candidates last year and its favorites have also been successful in House campaigns including yesterdays Republican primary in Michigan But the sweeping comments of its president the Rev Jerry Falwell have sometimes been challenged President Reagan for example disclaimed Mr Falwells contention last fall that God did not hear the prayers of Jews The group is likely to remain controversial with an official of the Democratic National Committee saying today that the committee would make Moral Majoritys efforts a political issue in the belief that most Americans did not want their private morals dictated by special interest groups Mr Godwin contended that his organization had been used by its critics as something of a synonym for New Right and has been blamed for the actions of other organizations Ads Appear in Newspapers The advertisements which have appeared this week in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times strongly stated this point After listing the groups opposition to abortion drug traffic and pornography and its support for the traditional family the state of Israel and Jewish people everywhere a strong national defense and equal rights for women without the proposed Equal Rights Amendment the advertisements continue Moral Majority Inc informs American citizens regarding the vital moral issues facing our nation We have no hit lists Some members of the media attempt to group Moral Majority Inc with all socalled New Right organizations While we fully support the constitutional right of any special interest group to target candidates with whom they disagree Moral Majority Inc has chosen not to take this course We are committed to principles and issues not candidates and parties Many organizations called the New Right by the media are doing a noble work addressing political domestic and economic issues not addressed by Moral Majority Inc We congratulate them on this contribution to Americas renaissance However Moral Majority Inc restricts its involvement to the moral issues defined above For example Moral Majority Inc has no official position on the Panama Canal Treaty Taiwan or South Africa  as we are often falsely charged by our critics Estimate of Ad Costs Mr Godwin said the advertisements would cost a total of from 50000 to 100000 The advertisement noted recent criticisms by Norman Lear the television producer George McGovern the former Senator from South Dakota and the American Civil Liberties Union It said that they were attacking it with McCarthylike fear tactics and seeking to raise funds for themselves The Lear McGovern and ACLU messages did include appeals for funds So does the Moral Majority advertisement

FEMINISTS ATTACK REAGAN ADMINISTRATION PLAN TO CURB AID FOR ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/26/us/feminists-attack-reagan-administration-plan-to-curb-aid-for-abortion.html,The Reagan Administrations proposals to seek new curbs on Federal spending for abortions obtained by poor women were sharply criticized by feminist groups today as callous and outrageous The proposal to Congress drafted by Richard S Schweiker Secretary of Health and Human Services would eliminate Federal financing of abortions in cases of rape or incest Funds for abortions would be permitted only when a womans life was in danger Women dont seek rape or incest they suffer from it said Iris Mitgang head of the National Womens Political Caucus a lobbying group for womens rights One crime should not perpetuate a second crime against the victim Mr Schweikers executive aide David Newhall said that the proposal was consistent with the positions of President Reagan and Mr Schweiker The feeling is that the life of the mother should be the only exception in cases involving Federal funding for abortion Mr Newhall said Proposal Is Praised The move which is expected to meet some Congressional opposition especially in the Senate was lauded by Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois a leading opponent of abortions It makes a great deal of sense he said in an interview If you accept the proposition that life begins at conception and the only tradeoff for terminating another human life would be to save another human life then the exceptions of rape and incest are not appropriate In assailing the proposal which would largely affect poor women on Medicaid Miss Mitgang the womens caucus leader declared Its outrageous The perception of this Administration is to blame women for rape or incest The Administration looks at women through Victorian eyes as the causal factor Jane WellsSchooley vice president of the National Organization for Women which with 125000 members is the countrys largest feminist group said What were talking about here is incest and rape forcing women in some cases young girls to bear children Its callous and totally without compassion States Would Decide The Administrations proposals are listed in an appendix to the proposed Health and Human Services budget for the fiscal year 1982 It states None of the funds made available shall be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term provided however that the states have the right not to fund abortions An official at the Department of Health and Human Services said that the language of the proposal left it up to the individual states to decide whether or not to finance any abortions at all including in cases where a womans life is in danger The use of Federal funds to provide abortions for Medicaid recipients has been drastically diminished since 1977 by a set of amendments sponsored by Mr Hyde that have been attached to appropriations bills In the fiscal year 1977 the last year before abortion financing was cut back the Federal Government financed 294600 abortions according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute a Planned Parenthood affiliate The number dropped to 3985 in 1979 Few Women Are Affected Although Mr Hyde and others have argued strenuously and emotively against including rape and incest in Federal abortion financing the numbers of women affected are relatively small In 1979 about 80 women received federally paid abortions after rape or incest The Administrations move on Federal financing of abortions coincides with a conservative attack on legalized abortion that has turned the potentially volatile issue into a priority item in Congress Legislation proposed by Mr Hyde and Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina seeks to bar virtually all abortions including cases of rape and incest
ANDERSON SAYS SENATE WILL PASS BUDGET LARGER THAN CAREY'S ON MONDAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/26/nyregion/anderson-says-senate-will-pass-budget-larger-than-carey-s-on-monday.html,The majority leader of the State Senate said today that the Republicancontrolled house would pass a budget on Monday that was 450 million more than Governor Careys 162 billion proposal The Senate budget would increase local revenue sharing and add 190 million to the Governors schoolaid package In what has become an annual gambit in the budget process here the majority leader Senator Warren M Anderson of Binghamton called a news conference today  one week before the new state fiscal year begins  to accuse Governor Carey and Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink of stonewalling negotiations and acting in an irresponsible manner The Governors director of policy management Michael J DelGiudice countered by calling the Senate plan a monstrosity that overspent revenues Speaker Fink a Brooklyn Democrat said the Senators staff had failed to show where cuts to the Carey budget proposal would be made  and thats irresponsible Carey Called Irresponsible Later the Senate minority leader Manfred Ohrenstein of Manhattan added his voice to the Democratic chorus and called Mr Anderson irresponsible At his news conference Mr Anderson declined to say how he would cover the additional local aid or the 500 million in tax cuts the Senate has already approved If they look at revenues and expenditures as we do they would see those tax cuts could be accommodated he said Senator Anderson said the barrier to agreement on a budget was the Democratic leaders insistence on dealing now with a series of initiatives like masstransit aid and the state assumption of local Medicaid costs that said he believed could be put off until after the April 1 deadline for adoption of the budget That deadline was breached without dire consequences two years ago and the talk is that April 10 the scheduled start of the legislators spring vacation will be the real budget deadline this year Mr Anderson believes that a move to pick up the billiondollar local share of Medicaid  which the Governor proposes to do over a fouryear period  should await the fate in Congress of President Reagans plan to place a ceiling on Federal Medicaid reimbursement Says Transit Funds Are Available The Senator also said a masstransit package was not an emergency He said he believed there remained 50 million in unused 1979 transportation bond funds that could tide over the Metropolitan Transit Authority The chairman of the authority Richard Ravitch said he did not know what 50 million Mr Anderson was talking about The Senator proposes to pass five basic budget bills on Monday to cover local assistance state purposes capital construction legislative and judiciary costs and debt service He said his local assistance bill would not include Medicaid funds for abortions  about 5 million The five bills do not take into account Governor Careys plans for a ceiling on state and local spending nor the local Medicaid pickup but would show assumption by the state of a 15 percent increase in welfare grants Thats the game plan Mr Anderson said I dont want to do it Id much prefer we work right now on trying to get bills that would be generally acceptable
At the Edge of Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/26/opinion/at-the-edge-of-abortion-law.html,An unwanted pregnancy forces a woman to an agonizing choice between childbirth and abortion The Supreme Court has made clear that this terrible decision is for the woman and her doctor free from governmental or even in the case of teenagers parental interference But now the high court says that states may require the doctor to notify parents before performing an abortion for a teenager who lives at home and depends on parental support A 6to3 majority finds that Utahs notice law meets legitimate concerns for family values and at least from the available evidence is not a parental veto in disguise As a matter of constitutional power that may be so But the decision cannot and does not vouch for the wisdom of such laws It is no warrant for the stampede of state legislatures that antiabortion forces would like to see New Yorks Governor Carey was rash to encourage such a drive in his legislature before the decision was a day old On careful reading the Utah decision seems less than a categorical endorsement of mandatory notification The case concerned a 15yearold girl who claimed no particular hardship from the rule Several justices predicted that a notice law could never be enforced against doctors dealing with mature minors or those who have left home At least five justices seemed ready to exempt minors who show that parental notice would turn a family hostile and obstructionist Mandatory notice is a crude instrument likely to shatter as many families as it brings together Even without such laws many abortion agencies press pregnant minors to consult their parents or other adults Laws like Utahs even if intended to rally support for girls in trouble could well intimidate them and doctors and deny necessary medical support The Court felt obliged to credit Utah with a benign purpose but the pattern of state resistance to abortion rights is clearer Since the 1973 abortion ruling states have tried laws granting parents a veto denials of funds for abortions and demands that doctors display pictures of fetuses to women pondering abortions The Courts unwillingness to condemn one such law is no endorsement of the policy Significantly to us though not to the Court Utahs solicitude for family cohesion or pregnant women did not move its Legislature to require notice of a pregnancy as well as an abortion The high court majority said the Constitution did not demand that much evenhandedness But that should not prevent others from questioning the states sincerity The most disturbing feature of the case is the Courts willingness to tolerate intrusions on the pregnant womans decision Legislatures and courts now have to guard against the use of state power for anything but the avowed purpose of easing the distress of pregnant teenagers
"IN AN ABORTION CLINIC: AMBIVALENCE, GUILT AND RELIEF",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/nyregion/in-an-abortion-clinic-ambivalence-guilt-and-relief.html,Some arrive in blue jeans and worn sneakers others swathed in furs Some leave small children in the waiting room to while away the fretful time with husbands or friends others are children themselves Some apprehensive and uncertain have never been there before others smile and greet staff members by name But whether they are junior high school students or middleaged mothers all of the women who go to Parkmed do so for the same reason they are pregnant and they dont want to be A couple of hours and 235 later their pregnancies have been terminated Antiabortion groups around the country are preparing for a major effort to overturn or restrict the 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion Among those who support a constitutional amendment banning abortions is President Reagan But despite the increasing political furor over abortion rights abortion has become a fact faced up to by millions of women More than 15 million abortions are performed in this country every year according to Dr Ward Cates chief of the abortion surveillance unit at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta 300 Patients a Week Since the legalization of abortion the number of abortionrelated deaths has fallen sharply An early abortion is now 10 times safer for a woman than carrying a fetus to term Dr Cates reports Each week around 300 women undergo early abortions at Parkmed a private outpatient clinic at 32d Street and Park Avenue South Approximately onefourth of Parkmeds patients are teenagers and some patients have been as young as 11 according to staff members Staff doctors say that most younger patients are accompanied by their mothers On Monday the United States Supreme Court ruled that states may require a doctor to notify a teenaged girls parents before performing an abortion on her Because New York State has no notification requirement the clinic will not be affected by the ruling The clinic does not require parental consent from minors but does ask that they give a good reason if such consent is not provided The day after the Supreme Courts ruling Governor Carey said he might consider a change in state law to require that parents be notified Five days a week Tuesday through Saturday scores of women ride the elevator to the top floor of an unremarkable office building and enter Parkmed The clinics waiting room is impersonal and businesslike it might be that of an insurance company or a dentist Pregnancy Test Required Before being accepted at Parkmed a woman must undergo a pregnancy test and a pelvic examination If she is more than 14 weeks pregnant she will be rejected if she is between 12 and 14 weeks pregnant she will be accepted but charged 350 instead of the standard fee for a shorter pregnancy She will not be accepted if she suffers from respiratory or cardiac problems obesity pelvic inflammatory disease or other conditions that could complicate an abortion In such cases the clinic will refer her to a hospital Parkmed which is owned by two doctors and an accountant takes Medicaid patients as well as those who pay the fees themselves Despite yearly battles in Albany over the public financing of abortions New York is one of nine states that continue voluntarily to finance Medicaid abortions Four other states do so under court orders After being examined a staff member explains to the patients what will happen next They are generally pretty much reconciled by the time they get here says Linda Maddocks a counselor Most of them have the attitude I dont like it  I wish I didnt have to make this choice but I do have to make this choice They just want to take care of business But were watching out for someone who looks weepy or frightened she continues If they say I dont want to do it at any point even if they change their minds later well give them their money back and encourage them to come back another day Disturbing for Some Even for those who wholeheartedly support abortion rights having an abortion can prove deeply disturbing When I found out I was pregnant I knew right away what I was going to do but the decision got more complicated the more I thought about it says one patient a 22yearold actress Last night I was crying and pacing and smoking like crazy I thought about going ahead and having a baby and giving it up for adoption but I think that would be much more traumatic And financially and emotionally my boyfriend and I just arent up to the job of having a child now Patients are given a choice of general or local anesthetic most choose the former The abortion takes only about five minutes after which the patient is taken to the recovery room where she will spend an hour emerging from her grogginess Later dressed once again in their street clothes the patients gather in an adjacent lounge Having fasted since the previous midnight they wolf down the chicken soup and crackers cookies and hot chocolate that they are offered Aside from hunger their reactions to what they have just been through are as diverse as their backgrounds Some are almost giddy with relief others are quietly tearful I feel very relieved says a ponytailed young woman between bites of a cookie Im having trouble raising a puppy I know Im not capable of raising children I Dont Feel Guilty She is Asked about guilt and she shakes her head No I dont feel guilty about this she says I just feel angry when I think about the people who want to prohibit abortion Tell them to keep their laws off my body Others are more ambivalent I cant afford to have a baby right now so I had to terminate it says a 26yearold woman But I think its murder Its part of you its like a child Some women find that abortion exacts an unexpected toll I had an abortion last summer and afterward I had terrible terrible nightmares of being a child murderer and having to chloroform babies recalls a 29yearold businesswoman who has just undergone her second abortion But I think abortion is a necessary option she adds and I thank God that its legal and possible I feel its much better this way for me and for what would have been my child Before a patient is released a counselor discusses methods of birth control with her urging their use Finally amidst a flurry of admonitions to come back for their free twoweek checkups the patients depart 8 Abortions for One Woman The staff members talk about their days work On the next days agenda is a patient who will be receiving her eighth abortion she is 22 years old and has two children Upon hearing that she is coming back again staff members shake their heads and sigh Asked about such patients Dr William Rashbaum chief of family planning services at Beth Israel Medical Center and one of the doctors at Parkmed shrugs There are a certain small percentage of patients primarily a small fragment of the

FEMINIST GROUPS ATTACK REAGAN BUDGET CUTBACKS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/feminist-groups-attack-reagan-budget-cutbacks.html,A coalition of womens groups assailed President Reagans budget proposals today saying that Administrations policies will destroy or severely impair many of the programs and endanger the rights for which women have struggled over the last several years The coalition of two dozen womens groups joined by childrens welfare and other organizations urged Congress to move carefully and slowly in its examination of the Presidents budget To do otherwise would be irresponsible shortsighted and possibly catastrophic the coalition said in a statement issued here Political expedience cannot be allowed to jeopardize programs which protect the most vulnerable members of our society The coalitions criticism was part of a continuing chorus of opposition to the Administrations budget cuts expressed by a wide range of social welfare civil rights and labor groups What made the criticism today somewhat unusual was the broad spectrum of womens groups that joined the attack on the budget proposals First Victims of Inflation The groups included the League of Women Voters the Young Womens Christian Association Bnai Brith Women and the Federation of Business and Professional Womens Clubs Women understand all too well the spinoff effects of inflation we are its first victims the coalition said Since more than 67 percent of those living below the poverty line are women the statement continued since one out of every seven households is now headed by a woman and since the bulk of those with income of less than half the poverty level are women women are the poorest of the poor We are deeply concerned about a national fiscal policy that will lock women into the cycle of poverty and offer no relief for the future The groups cited specific cutbacks bound to impact disproportionately and harshly on women and said that these included proposed reductions in Federal assistance for child care facilities forcing working mothers to choose between leaving her child unattended or quitting her job to care for her child thus supporting her family through welfare In addition to cuts in education social services and health programs of approximately 24 percent the Administration has proposed consolidating programs into a few block grants the statement said noting that the states would control such programs as child welfare child care and family planning This would shift responsibility for these services over 15 billion to the state and local governments the statement added The block grant approach would create wide disparities in the services available and allow little or no accountability of Federal tax dollars The groups that signed the petition are American Association of University Women Americans for Demoratic Action Bnai Brith Women Center for Women and Work Center for Women Policy Studies Childrens Defense Fund Childrens Foundation Federally Employed Women Federation of Organizations for Professional Women Food Research and Action Center League of Women Voters of the United States National Abortion Rights Action League National Association of Social Workers National Association of Women Business Owners National Coalition Against Dometic Violence National Coalition for Older Womens Issues National Council of Jewish Women National Council of Senior Citizens National Employment Law Project National Student Education Fund National Womens Party National Womens Political Caucus Native American Rights Fund NETWORK New Democratic Coalition Planned Parenthood Federation of America Project on Equal Education Rights NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund Rural Coalition United States Student Association Wider Opportunities for Women Women Employed Women Strike for Peace Women USA Womens Action Alliance Womens Equity Action League Womens Equity Action League Educational and Legal Defense Fund Working Women Young Womens Christian Association of the USA National Board

HELMS SAYS SENATE MAY CONSIDER SOME SOCIAL MEASURES THIS YEAR,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/28/us/helms-says-senate-may-consider-some-social-measures-this-year.html,Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina said today that Senate conservatives had accepted that President Reagans economic program was the legislative priority but he asserted that they might not wait until next year to bring up social legislation The comments by Mr Helms a leader of the conservative group in the Senate came after Howard H Baker Jr the Senate majority leader asserted that he had the concurrence of Senate Republicans without exception for postponing Senate floor action on social legislation until 1982 Today Mr Baker said that he had been mistaken He said that such a stand was taken Tuesday by the Senate Republican Policy Committee but that it was adopted by just 13 members who were present rather than by all 53 members of the Republican majority in the Senate According to committee records the body unanimously approved a motion asserting that new legislative proposals and constitutional amendments be put off until 1982 although Senator John Tower of Texas the committee chairman emphasized that individual senators would not be bound by the resolution nor does it apply to offering amendments No Rift in Strategy Seen Both Senator Helms and Senator Paul Laxalt Republican of Nevada two of the most influential conservatives in the Senate asserted today that they had no basic differences with Mr Bakers legislative strategy and priorities Mr Helms was asked if that meant that conservativebacked legislation on such issues as bans on abortion and school busing would be put off until 1982 he replied No not if we get the legislation where we want it lets say the school prayer issue or abortion We will have sympathetic committee chairmen handling that legislation It may develop that we wont press and wont want consideration this year he continued But if theres some need for faster action Ill go the rider route as I have in the past He referred to adding an amendment to a bill already on the floor for consideration Mr Baker acknowledged that he could not control such amendments offered by Senate Republicans and that he did expect committee consideration of social legislation this year

Article 064786 -- No Title,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/28/us/article-064786-no-title.html,After a bitterly partisan debate Senate Republicans upstaged the Democrats today by leading a successful move to restore 200 million that President Reagan had proposed cutting from the school lunch program The funds were made available at the expense of foreign aid Before the votes as the Senate debated the Administrations proposed 364 billion reduction in the budget submitted by President Carter for the fiscal year 1982 Republicans and Democrats exchanged accusations of cruelty indifference and exploitation concerning the poor Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts who has been Excerpts from debate page 9 leading the Democratic effort to restore funds for social programs charged the Republicans with taking away the crusts of bread from starving children in Africa and Southeast Asia in their pious attempts at fiscal austerity Response From Senator Baker The majority leader Senator Howard H Baker Jr Republican of Tennessee responded I believe the poor of this country are being cruelly used in an attempt to restore to the budget full funding for programs that have failed The measure to restore 200 million for school lunch programs was proposed by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina chairman of the Agriculture Committee It was an acknowledged effort to head off Democratic moves to restore 400 million to the program and to keep foreign aid intact And it was also an effort to maneuver the Democrats into the politically awkward position of voting against restoring school lunch funds since they were obviously unhappy with the smaller amount Votes on Amendments The vote was 87 to 9 on Senator Helmss proposal to restore the money for school lunch aid and 70 to 26 on his amendment to shift the money to the nutrition program by cutting 200 million in foreign aid The Carter Administration had proposed spending 3918 billion on school lunches in the fiscal year 1982 President Reagan wants to reduce that amount by 1575 billion to 2343 billion Somewhat more than 33 billion will be spent on the program in the fiscal year 1981 Senator Helms said today that while Senate conservatives had accepted the legislative priority of President Reagans economic program they might not wait until next year to bring up social legislation Senator Baker said yesterday that he had the concurrence of Senate Republicans without exception for postponing action on such controversial social issues as abortion and school prayer until 1982 Page 9 The maneuvering on the school lunch aid today was much like the action in the Senate yesterday when Democrats were able to get the Republicans to vote against restoring funds for veterans Veterans groups were caught unawares by yesterdays action and they mounted a strong lobbying effort today as Senator David L Boren Democrat of Oklahoma made a renewed effort to restore financing for veterans programs by taking 104 million from foreign aid His effort failed 48 to 44 But the major debate today occurred over restoring the 200 million to the school lunch program It was exacerbated by Senator Helmss declaration that his committee would take 100 million additional from Food for Peace and put it into aid for school lunches to restore a total of 300 million to the program Since both Food for Peace and the lunch program are within his committees jurisdiction no Senate action was needed on shifting the 100 million Mr Helms told the Senate that the purpose of his amendment to restore the 200 million for lunches was to reassure those who think the President may have cut nutrition too deeply But asked later if he had sought to forestall a Democratic move to increase the program by a larger amount the Senator said Ill have to confess yes Senator Jim Sasser Democrat of Tennessee who later sponsored an unsuccessful effort in behalf of the larger increase said of the Republicans They stole a march on us politically Assailing Senator Helms Senator Kennedy said The Senator from North Carolina doesnt have the right or legitimacy to say hes defending the school lunch program Even with the additional funds Senator Kennedy said child nutrition programs would still be reduced by 13 billion Cost Called Unacceptable The Massachusetts Senator pounded his desk as he said I think its a sad day indeed when we pit the poorest starving children of the world of Africa and Asia against American children in coming up with a pious answer that were doing something about the budget If that is the cost of fighting inflation its unacceptable he added But Senator Robert Dole Republican of Kansas who is chairman of the finance committee said Were hearing the same tired liberal voices that got us into this mess in the first place He added I dont know anything in this amendment that says were going to take food out of the mouths of children Breakdown on Foreign Aid Senator Kennedy countered that only a small amount of foreign aid was not earmarked for military and governmental purposes and that of the remainder food for the poor was the most vulnerable Senator Howard M Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio who led the unsuccessful liberal fight in the Budget Committee also opposed taking away funds from the foreign aid program What kind of concern what kind of crass attitude is that he asked The Senator instead urged his colleagues to find money by revising provisions of the tax law involving commodities and industrial redevelopment bonds As the debate neared its end Senator Helms said paraphrasing Winston Churchill Theres nothing more satisfying than to be shot at and missed Strategy Sessions on Both Sides Senator Donald W Riegle Jr Democrat of Michigan replied I feel youve been shooting at the school children of America and you havent missed Senate Democrats meanwhile continued to hold strategy sessions in an effort to restore funds for social welfare programs The Senates moderate Republicans also held a similar meeting Although few in number they hope to enlist the aid of the Democrats and form a majority The Senate is expected to complete consideration of the budget package early next weekIn another matter the Senate today acceded to the House version of the bill suspending an April 1 increase in dairy price supports and sent the measure to the President The only difference between the two bills was that the Senate had included nonbinding resolutions urging an end to continued restrictions on grain sales to the Soviet Union
REAGAN'S MIXED SIGNS; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/28/us/reagan-s-mixed-signs-news-analysis.html,When Attorney General John N Mitchell was challenged in 1969 by a delegation of black leaders who were unhappy about some of the Nixon Administrations public statements he retorted Watch what we do not what we say That advice was being recalled this week as political Washington gathered clues to President Reagans brand of conservativism The President warmed the hearts of some of his most loyal rightwing followers in Washington a week ago when he and several advisers served up the strongest burst of fervent conservative rhetoric yet to come from the Administration But almost simultaneously the White House was taking steps to clip the wings of influential conservative activists and to their dismay bringing Vice President Bush into the forefront of foreign policy A Test of Willingness A certain political ambivalence is not entirely new for Mr Reagan but at this stage it raises questions about just how far he intends to press the Russians and just how hard the White House will push the agenda of social legislation dear to conservatives Mr Reagans performance as Governor of California has produced divergent assessments Some noting his pledges to cut taxes and hold down the growth of government and his verbal sallies at students on California campuses have typed him as a conservative ideologue But others who followed his legislative compromises and watched him promulgate tax increases larger budgets environmental controls and increased aid for higher education consider him a far more pragmatic politician As President Mr Reagan has not had to show how he will react to strong opposition in Congress With his economic package he has signaled a desire for farreaching changes in the role of government in American life as well as the scale of government spending But he trimmed the package to make it more salable and may have to trim it more especially in the area of tax cutting to get it passed More Doctrinaire Remarks But the tenor of Mr Reagans speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference last weekend and the remarks of some of his aides sounded more doctrinaire and less flexible almost as if he wished to invite rightwing pressures to deliver on such controversial emotional issues as abortion and school busing and prayer in public schools There were conservative echoes too in the speech of Richard V Allen Mr Reagans national security aide who decried Europes outright pacifist sentiments and the revival of the contemptible better red than dead slogan and in a Sunday television appearance of David A Stockman Director of the Office of Management and Budget I dont believe that there is any entitlement any basic right to legal services or any other kinds of services Mr Stockman said defending spending cuts in social programs and the idea thats been established over the last 10 years that almost every service that someone might need in life ought to be provided financed by the government as a matter of basic right is wrong We challenge that We reject that notion The President provided the keynote sounded the battle cry Fellow citizens fellow conservatives  our time is now our moment has arrived he declared to the conservative conference Because ours is a consistent philosophy of government we can be very clear we do not have a separate social agenda a separate economic agenda and a separate foreign agenda We have one agenda A Listing of Goals He went on to mention opposition to abortion advocacy of prayer in public school improving national defense and putting our financial house in order It was the kind of signal that conservatives had been waiting for But alert listeners picked up the Presidents hint that the White House wants to put off legislative struggles over controversial social issues until after the Reagan economic package passes Obviously we are not going to be able to accomplish all this at once Mr Reagan cautioned his followers The American people are patient Now Howard H Baker Jr the Senate Majority leader has disclosed that the Senate Republican Policy Committee agreed to the desirability of putting off the big controversial social issues until 1982 Among the 13 policy committee members who went along were such conservatives as Strom Thurmond of South Carolina Jake Garn of Utah and Jeremiah Denton of Alabama But there was a quick outcry from the right Richard Viguerie the staunchly conservative mail order campaigner denounced Mr Bakers mistaken notion of delaying the social agenda Foreign Policy Role for Bush What also disturbed conservatives was that just as the Presidential entourage was preaching philosophical conservatism the White House was moving Mr Bush a less ideological figure into a foreign policy role and curtailing some of Mr Reagans most loyal supporters Edwin Meese 3d the Presidents counselor told Mr Reagans old friends in the kitchen cabinet who had been promoting conservative appointments to give up their space in the Executive Office Building Some felt so discouraged that they wanted to let the group disband Almost simultaneously the Coalition for a New Beginning spearheaded by wealthy conservative friends of the President who were mounting a public relations campaign for his economic package was ordered disbanded reportedly by James A Baker 3d the White House chief of staff This is the classic Give them the rhetoric and hope they dont watch what we do observed John Lofton editor of Conservative Digest Good luck but it isnt going to happen The game is being followed closely One of the things that will tip the hand of the White House is whether they will take the initiative on the conservative social agenda or whether they will make conservatives in Congress push them into battle

THE TOAST OF PARIS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/29/books/the-toast-of-paris.html,NAKED AT THE FEAST A Biography of Josephine Baker By Lynn Haney Illustrated 338 pp New York Dodd Mead  Company 1795 AS depicted in Lynn Haneys brisk and brassy biography Josephine Baker was headstrong and precociously independent from the very beginning Born out of wedlock in 1906 Miss Baker was the daughter of a domestic and a flashy drummer who played in St Louiss black nightspots Her father deserted the family after the birth of a second child She had only a fifthgrade education but she was determined to get what she wanted out of life At the hardened age of 12 she left home after a quarrel with her mother and moved in with the proprietor of a local icecream parlor a man in his 50s The incident foreshadowed a pattern that would emerge in her later life and that reflected both her sheer assertiveness and her attraction to older men When her family protested the situation and outraged neighbors complained to the proprietor Josephine moved in with her grandmother and took a job as a waitress in a black nightclub At the age of 13 she married for the first time  a local foundry worker but very soon she separated from him and according to her brother she appears to have had an abortion About a year later stagestruck but without training or any obvious talent she joined the Dixie Steppers a songanddance troupe that was touring the South Ethel Waters who traveled the same circuit remembered the tough but appreciative black audiences Rugged individualists all they did whatever they pleased while you were killing yourself on the stage If they liked a performer however theyd scream stomp and applaud until the whole building shook In that demanding atmosphere Josephine Baker acquired a taste for glory and the adulation of the crowd At 15 she married again  this time a railroad porter Willie Baker whose name she kept throughout her career The couple lived for a while in a theatrical boardinghouse in Philadelphia but at 16 leaving her husband behind she begged and badgered her way into the road company of Shuffle Along the hit Broadway musical of the early 20s She became a protege of Eubie Blake one of the shows authors Disliked by the lighterskinned chorus girls she made herself even more unpopular by milking her end spot for every bit of comedy she could contrive crossing her eyes mugging sabotaging the dance steps She stole the show and was subsequently given featured spots in Mr Blakes next Broadway musical Chocolate Dandies Her real success however came in 1925 when she was 19 and not in New York but in Paris where she appeared in a makeshift vaudeville production titled La Revue Negre at the Theatre des Champs Elysees She had by then acquired other energetic promoters an American theatrical agent Caroline Dudley and the French posterartist Paul Colin who became her new lover within days of her arrival in the French capital On opening night wearing only a strategically placed pink flamingo feather and feathery frills around her neck and ankles slithering about on the back of a muscular black dancer Josephine became the overnight sensation of the revue and the toast of Paris During her ensuing 50year career in France she starred at the Casino de Paris and the FoliesBergere it was there in 1926 that she appeared in her most famous costume a girdle of rhinestonestudded bananas and was the proprietor of a series of popular nightclubs Throughout those years she remained an international celebrity one of the undisputed legends of the jazz age Her career followed a course that is not unusual for entertainers from rags to riches to rags again In her heyday however the rags were designed by Schiaparelli Balmain Balenciaga Dior Although she was unremittingly ambitious according to Miss Haney she squandered her wealth and her life was filled with unsatisfying relationships at every level She died in Paris on April 14 1975 in the course of another spectacular comeback and just five days after a glittering celebration of her 50th anniversary in show business Thousands of mourners attended the national funeral at the Madeleine she was accorded a 21gun salute It was a grand finale and she was as she had always insisted on being the main attraction But beneath the sequins and exotic plumage there was a less alluring Josephine Baker Judging from her biographer  who seems to have interviewed the survivors of her disastrous private life  she never forgot a slight on her way up the ladder and she was not particularly sentimental about the people who had helped her climb Both her magnanimous gestures and antic political activities were apt to be spurred by her keen sense of publicity She considered herself an astute political observer and wrote letters of advice to Khrushchev de Gaulle and Robert Kennedy when she received no replies she was hurt She was full of praise for Mussolini and later for the widowed Juan Peron He showered her with gifts during a 1952 tour of Argentina she praised his dictatorship as an example of enlightened democracy Yet the French Government had awarded her the Medal of the Resistance for her services as an entertainer and sometime spy for the Free French during World War II Miss Haney is somewhat vague about Miss Bakers Mata Hari activities And during her triumphal tour of the United States in 1951 she was an outspoken critic of American racial policies and a pioneer advocate of civil rights She refused to appear in cities where she would not be given firstclass accommodations in firstclass hotels or in theaters that did not hire black stagehands Unable to have children she adopted 13 with great fanfare in the public press Each child was of a different nationality and religion and she intended to establish an international village of brotherhood on her estate Les Milandes in the Dordogne She went bankrupt trying to finance this utopian tourist attraction which included a farm an amusement park a wax museum with exhibits depicting scenes from her own life a statue of herself as the Virgin Mary surrounded by children and a showcase hotel with rooms decorated in honor of such famous French courtesans as Mme du Barry and Mme de Pompadour She was a glamorous but hardly effective mother preoccupied with her failing career and her failing business venture she often left the childrens care discipline and education to others Lynn Haney handles this farrago of grand gestures and questionable motives in very readable fashion Naked at the Feast gives one a distinct feel for the time and the people and unlike many celebrity biographies serious social issues occasionally rise above the gossip and the name dropping Still it is

REPORT SAYS AMERICA'S LEADER MAY UNDERRATE ROLE RELIGION PLAYS IN LIFE OF,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/31/us/report-says-america-s-leader-may-underrate-role-religion-plays-in-life-of.html,PUBLIC By CHARLES AUSTIN Americas leaders may underestimate the role religion plays in American life because they are themselves less religious than the public in general according to a report released yesterday Dr John Crothers Pollock who completed the study for Research and Forecasts Inc said the gap was wide enough that nontraditional leaders possibly even charlatons and demagogues playing on religious sympathies might successfully win public support Religious commitment more than age race sex education geography political conviction or income level determines how people respond to a wide variety of questions on moral and political issues Dr Pollock said Less Than Half Respond The study was commissioned by the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company About 4000 people were questioned for the public sample but only 1610 completed the onehour interview The completion rate is considered low by some polltakers but Dr Pollock said that he had found the results acceptable because it was more important for us to get complete interviews than to interview the entire sample For the leadership sample 4383 people in nine different fields were sent questionnaires by mail and about 40 percent responded The report defined as religious those people who said they prayed attended worship services felt that God loved them read the Bible participated in church activities and encouraged others to turn to religion The study said that religious people in the public sample were far more concerned about the morality of such issues as abortion homosexuality national defense and womens rights than the leaders who responded Dr Pollock said the report identifies a cohesive and powerful group of Americans approximately 45 million strong as intensely religious and demonstrates that religious Americans are likely to vote often and to become highly involved in their local communities 73 Pct Say God Loves Them Seventythree percent of the public said they felt that God loved them Dr Pollock said but only 54 percent of the leadership sample held that belief The leaders also reported less frequent participation in religious activities than the general public Business and religious leaders are more attuned to public values than others according to the study which was taken last fall Asked which professional groups they most admired 36 percent of the public named clergy about twice the combined total of the second and third groups teachers and scientists The attitudes of the clergy and business leaders more closely parallel the publics attitudes on religious and moral issues than do the beliefs held by government or other leaders according to the report
STATE STARTS NEW FISCAL YEAR WITHOUT ACCORD ON BUDGET,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/01/nyregion/state-starts-new-fiscal-year-without-accord-on-budget.html,The Republicancontrolled State Senate passed one budget today and the Democratic leaders here agreed on an entirely different version That left New York State adrift without a revenue and spending plan for the new fiscal year beginning at midnight But there was hope for a tardy resolution A budget agreement between the Democratic legislators and Governor Carey reached early this morning seems to be much closer to the Republicans position showing increases in aid to schools and to small cities At a noon news conference the Governor disclosed a substantially altered version of his original budget proposal totaling 1651 billion It represented a 286 million increase attributable mostly to more school aid and covered by revised revenue estimates Stanley Fink the Assembly Speaker said his house would not approve the Democrats budget proposal until tomorrow or Thursday Carey Assails Anderson Meanwhile the Senate spent the evening passing its own budget bills totaling 306 million more than Mr Careys original plan  primarily because of the unfreezing of local revenuesharing On a day when tempers flashed under pressure of the midnight deadline Governor Carey assailed Warren M Anderson Republican of Binghamton and the Senate majority leader at the news conference and also criticized the Senators chief fiscal aide James L Biggane charging him with failing to negotiate and proposing expenditures that were not supported by revenues The Senate Finance Committee whose secretary is Mr Biggane today released an analysis of Mr Careys budget showing a surplus of 816 million due to what it said were underestimated revenues and overestimated expenditures Weve been waiting since Tuesday of last week for word from the Governors people Mr Biggane said I dont go into his office unless Im invited What does this guy want from me I dont work for him As Mr Anderson presented the Republicans budget to the Senate he said Im all alone by the telephone but it doesnt ring Meanwhile the State Comptrollers office issued 47 million in scrip  essentially an iou accepted by a limited number of banks  to complete tomorrows state payroll for 83800 institutional workers The lack of a budget for fiscal 198182 would not begin affecting the state drastically until the state administrative payroll of 84 million  payable every two weeks  falls due April 8 and when schools start feeling the pinch without a 925 million local aid payment scheduled for April 15 according to the State Comptrollers office In moving toward a more central budget position the Democrats dropped mass transit operating subsidies from the budget proposal a sticking point with all parties saying in Mr Careys words that they would continue pursuing the idea Also gone from the Democrats budget was the controversial proposal to put a cap on local government spending In arguing for passage of the Senate budget Senator Roy M Goodman Republican of Manhattan and a Finance Committee member said that the two houses were 733 million apart in the following ways  The Democrats would not unfreeze local revenue sharing but would now give 29 million to 55 distressed small cities that would not be helped by the proposed state takeover of local Medicaid costs The Senate would like to give 231 million more than that in local aid  The Democrats are proposing an extra 100 million in school aid for a total of 253 million The Senate Republicans would like the aid increase to be 140 million  The Republicans have proposed nearly half a billion dollars in personal and business tax cuts The Assembly has approved about 26 million of those cuts all in aid to small businesses and has said it does not plan to approve any more cuts this session The budget approved by the Senate Republicans specifically excluded funds for Medicaid reimbursements for abortions
Hers,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/02/garden/hers.html,Kay my mother has a manila folder of articles Ive written  an addemdum of sorts to the burgeoning collection of a committed scrapbook enthusiast She saves these clippings partly because shes still consumed by a mothers passion to see all of her childrens papers But in the complicated evolving adult relationship we have theres another reason for the file folder We want to understand each others ideas Ive always loved talking to Kay but never more than now A visit home is a great disappointment if there isnt time for at least one long hearttohearter  usually brewing through a gallon of tea usually at the kitchen table usually after everyone else in the house has gone to bed Sometime after midnight we get to the real stuff thats on our minds We read each others expressions with the fascination of Lewis and Clark reading a map of the Louisiana Territory  we know each other well I didnt always send my work home  she didnt always want to see it Before being graced with the dignity of its own file folder my writing was kept in a plain brown wrapper under the piano bench Initially Kays response to a daughter active in the womens movement was the same as it would be say to an invitation to join a neighborhood vigilante group She regarded the first book I published as if it were slightly radioactive secreting it away in the back of the bookcase protecting sensitive friends from overexposure Before we had much experience debating each other she approached my writing with the same resigned tolerance reserved for embarrassing relatives at a family reunion Through years of taking our the kitchen table we frequently faced each other from opposite sides of the picket line Our discussions and disagreements were a pinball game of conservative bumpers and radical boundaries  we tilted on issues like abortion and religion She raised her daughter to be kind and respectful qualities notably absent when a subject like Congressman Hyde came up She winced reflexively when the President of the United States came out in less than solid gold caps A column about birth control restrictions left her in conflict She felt slightly immodest but chuckled in spite of herself when the issue of breasts popped up under my byline She felt and sometimes still does  that there was something immoderate about what I say but especially the volume so to speak with which I said it It was useless to try to spare her  for one thing friends would send her my articles anyway Her neighbor Ramona would get them from a Fort Wayne who knew I used to live down the street from he  Now Kay would prefer to get them directly from the daughter in question head on a determination she developed when we met during more turburlent years in the high school deans office A surviving mother of five adoledcents shes had her gilded cage rattled Rather vigorously There were frustrated tearful sessions between us  she has mother hankerings for a Good Daughter I have daughter yearnings for Mother Approval We try to withhold our ideas from each other avoiding conflict and settling for the narrower territory of our common grounds But it was always a temporary truce because for all the right and complicated reasons we required more than a peaceful coexistence with each other Weve made heavy payments for the conversations that now flow through our tea bags I vividly remember a scene from a few years ago when several friends and I were invited to indulge in Kays inimitable hospitality during a Womens Studies Conference in Chicago The first evening we gathered around the kitchen table for a high spirited discussion of the days happenings My normal witty articulate friends were at an intellectual zenith after the conference full of energy and life Kay forgot to be wary of us catching the staccato beat of the conversation While she passed the platters of canapes and tortes she listened and laughed and sometimes joined in She enjoyed the company of these fascinating women And my friends liked Kay Instinctively they recognized her quick intelligence her warmth and affection Theres an automatic benevolence granted to all mothers among my friends but theres a particular affinity just sort of gratitude for the mothers of feminist daughters Kay was enthusiastically invited to join us the next day In the morning we briefed Kay on the conference schedule as we piled into her car There was a kinetic energy barely contained in the twodoor compact It was only after we drove clear across town and unloaded in the campus lot that we noticed the bumper sticker on the back of the car  the Right to Life slogan Next to the sentiments expressed on the rest of the bumpers Kays was the lone minority report In some ways that typified the day as Kay and I wove our way through the conference agenda She listened to ideas that fascinated her to discussions that disturbed her to strategies that furrowed her brow She was alternately admiring and tentative about the women she met dressed in every imaginable outfit  long wild hairstyles next to polyester suits full professors on panels with students women raw from harsh experience women fresh with hopeful discovery We regrouped on carpets in lounges with our sack lunches nibbling our way through our apples and our random reactions Kay wasnt at all anxious to go home At the end of the day a happy fatigue surrounded our little band as we headed back tothe car We were so tired in fact that nobody remembered to mention the bumper sticker Since then weve shared other field trips other thoughtful conversations Theres no joy like having my mother join me at womens conferences and celebrations Its a common theme among women writers the universal longing to bring our mothers with us into liberation I loved sitting next to her in seminar classrooms as much as I loved sitting next to her on the train trips during downtown shopping trips holding white gloved hands eating lunch at Marshall Fields riding home together on high double deckers the warm happy tired moments of loving her I dont have a daughter to share this remarkable decade of women with but I have an extraordinary mother We could no more choose to live in the 1950s again Besides the support weve come to revel in wed miss each others jokes too much Thats why when Im working I sense Kays figurative presence reading over my shoulder pointing out sentences gently advising discretion Her actual criticisms are infrequent but the influence of my mother is rarely more than a paragraph away I understand why she sometimes withholds her agreementbut I never like to risk her disrespect So when the girl who used to live down the street from Ramona rolls a subject into her typewriter shes happiest when she can come out with a piece that will alienate as few retired mothers burning a nightlight at the kitchen table as humanely possible And if its eventually filed away in a certain manila folder so much the better

WELFARE CUTS AIMED AT PREGNANT WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/04/us/welfare-cuts-aimed-at-pregnant-women.html,The Reagan Administrations budget includes welfare cuts for pregnant women and those who get aid under the program for the aged the blind and the disabled Government officials said today A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said the the proposed changes were incorporated in the Administrations draft legislation for welfare The bill would prohibit states from making welfare payments to pregnant women with no other children except in the last three months of pregnancy Thirtyfour states including New York now make such payments Two states already limit the payments to the last trimester of pregnancy The change could save 15 million to 35 million but Linda McMahon associate commissioner for the Office of Family Assistance said the change was more philosophical than budgetary Other Programs Available Medical and nutritional needs of pregnant women are covered by existing Government programs such as food stamps maternal and child health programs and food programs for women and infant children In fact there are other programs available she said adding that one reason for the proposed change was that women had registered for Aid to Families with Dependent Children a major welfare program and then used the money to get abortions and continued on AFDC after they had terminated the pregnacy until someone discovered the fact The elderly the blind and the disabled could be hurt by a proposed change to lift a prohibition against states cutting the total amount paid to recipients from their funds if the Government increased payments through costofliving raises The current law does not require states to maintain the same amount of benefits for each recipient only that the total benefits paid not decrease A total of 16 million people receive 21 billion in supplemental payments from the states CETA Dismissals Challenged In a related development today a Ralph Nader group filed a suit in Federal District Court here to block the Administration from cutting 840 million from two Comprehensive Employment and Training Act programs The suit was brought by the Naderoperated Public Citizens Litigation Group which asked the court to issue an immediate restraining order against dismissing seven CETA workers from California Florida and Massachusetts The group hopes to prevent the Labor Department from slashing the money from two CETA programs affecting 300000 people from lowincome families who cannot find work even under good economic conditions and those from higherincome families who are victims of the recession
SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN: A PROBLEM NOT TO BE IGNORED,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/05/archives/sexual-abuse-of-children-a-problem-not-to-be-ignored.html,THE experience of childhood sexual abuse is probably the secret most often kept by an adult woman from her family her friends and even her doctor therapist or minister Despite the ease with which we are beginning to talk pubicly about domestic violence abortion rape homosexuality and other previously taboo subjects incest remains shrouded in silence Little research has been conducted about incest and even less has been written about it The taboo against incest has been more effective in preventing disclosure than in preventing the act itself One girl out of every four in the United States will be sexually abused in some way before she reaches 18 A 1967 study by the Childrens Division of the American Humane Association estimated that at least 80000 to 100000 children are sexually molested each year In the majority of these cases the offender was well known to the child and in about 25 percent of them the aggressor was a relative These estimates were based on New York City police records and the experience of social workers in a childprotection agency They are therefore projections based on observing poor and disorganized families who lack the resources to preserve secrecy There is reason to believe however that most incest in fact occurs in intact nuclear families and never comes to the attention of social agencies One consistent finding in all existing surveys is that about 92 percent of the victims are female 97 percent of the aggressors are male and there is a predominance of fatherdaughter sexual molestation Molestations by a stranger are generally onetime occurrences but in the case of incest by a known aggressor the victim may be trapped in a relationship for years Incest is almost always a devastating experience for the victim It is emotionally and psychologically destructive not only because of our cultural reactions to it but because the child is thrust into an adult role for which she is unprepared Most tragically the aggressors betray the childs trust and dependence The price we pay for neglecting the issue is becoming apparent In one study of adult female drug users it was found that 44 percent had experienced incest as children In a study of 200 prostitutes in Seattle 22 percent were found to have been incestuously assaulted as children In treating 160 women for sexual dysfunction one doctor found that 90 percent had been raped during childhood 22 percent of them by fathers or stepfathers And we are beginning to learn that a large percentage of runaway teenage girls leave home to escape a sexually abusive situation Incest victims reach adulthood bearing the burden of their secret The child reacts by feeling powerless and betrayed She senses she has been used but is unable to express rage at her aggressor who is usually someone she has been taught to obey and from whom she may long for attention and affection The anger goes underground and following the timebomb principle ticks away for years often to erupt later The victim may be in her 40s before she starts to deal with the delayed psychological effects of her experience Such women often suffer from a fundamental lack of selfconfidence and selfrespect and almost always from tremendous guilt If we are to understand incest better we must guard against accepting the myth that places blame on the child Investigators trying to determine the guilt or innocence of the participants often cite the seductiveness or the charming personality of the child Or there is an attempt made to move the blame from the female child to the female adult  to blame mothers either as silent partners unable or unwilling to protect their daughters or as spouses who have neglected their wifely duties More insidious is the idea that male aggressors are created by cold uncaring mothers ignoring facts regarding fathering or other family situations An awareness of societys tendency to blame the victim or her mother does not mean to deny womens real role whatever that may be in the tragedy of incest We must accept the fact that regardless of how seductive or provocative a child may act or how silent or powerless a mother may or may not be the ultimate responsibility for any sexual encounter between a child and an adult lies with that adult The adults greater age experience knowledge understanding supposed maturity and generally accepted role in society dictates responsibility A child simply does not have an adults ability to make choices and decisions about sexual behavior Sexual abuse of a child may involve a father a grandfather an uncle or a brother Although usually only the child and one family member are sexually involved incest should be viewed as a family problem In these families it appears that the members have a pattern of emotional neediness poor communication fear of loneliness and poor selfesteem Yet so little is known that we can only make generalizations However it appears common that the child victim as all children craves love and attention but often gets caught in a double bind paying the high price of pain fear and shame The mothers are often trapped in a disappointing marriage and are financially dependent on and physically fearful of their husbands Often mothers have been victims of childhood sexual abuse themselves and their bad feelings about themselves lead them to marry men who are likely to become abusers Their early difficult experiences may contribute to problems in relating to their husbands And when a mother learns of incest she is caught in a conflict between her husband and her daughter The fathers are often seeking tenderness and understanding covering up feelings of inadequacy Sometimes they are authoritarian and violent men Heavy drinking is frequently a significant factor What is common to all aggressors however is that they have been unable to control their impulses But sexual abuse is also an issue to be addressed beyond the individual or the family In a broad sense we need to examine our attitudes toward women children and sexuality Do we see women and children as property of men and females as objects for sexual pleasure Do we too readily accept the myth of an uncontrollable male sexual drive that men cannot take responsibility for control of their sexual impulses Prevention of sexual abuse of children is part of the larger need for developing both a healthier attitude toward sex and responsible sexual behavior And we need nononsense sexeducation programs that provide information about sexual abuse and teach children that they have a right to say no And very critical indeed is the need to take a stand against children in pornography and the adult sexualization of children we are beginning to see even on television commercials Awareness of the problem of sexual abuse of children in the county is growing but there is still no formal program to help families The countys domestic violence program is learning that in homes where there is violence there is often also sexual abuse and reports of suspected child sexual abuse are investigated by Child Protective Services County agencies are beginning to explore what kind of treatment programs are needed for the child victims The Southern Westchester National Organization for Women is considering support groups for women who were incest victims We must also seek and support measures that strengthen the family unit and that strengthen the motherdaughter relationship for it seems clear that daughters often feel prey to their fathers abuse when their mothers are too ill weak or intimidated to intervene We need more shelter facilities for teenage runaways and for mothers in crisis We need more adequate and dignified financial support and community services for husbands or wives who need to leave their spouses to protect their children We need to develop confidential counseling programs for families in trouble And finally we need to integrate men into the world of children as well as to create parenteducation programs for our young men and young women
WHOSE SESSION IS IT?; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/06/nyregion/whose-session-is-it-news-analysis.html,Why the Legislature was ordered back to Albany in special session to act on bills that did not exist  a question many legislators asked this weekend  has less to do with the Governor than with the Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink Technically it was Governor Carey who issued the call for the session But he was backed into it by Mr Fink whose intention was not so much to get the Legislature to act  the usual purpose of these unusual sessions  as to force the Governor to begin longdelayed direct bargaining with the Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson Mr Carey could not resist without appearing publicly to be playing down the urgency of the state budget situation Mr Fink a Brooklyn Democrat has told colleagues that he feared a continuing impasse over the budget coupled with recent miscues by Mr Carey could endanger the Governors position in next years election enough to bring down the Democrats majority in the Assembly A Forgotten Deadline The fact that an extraordinary session was needed to resolve the budget was extraordinary in itself Until four years ago the Assembly the State Senate and the Governor with rare exceptions relied on the April 1 deadline  when the states fiscal year begins  to create enough pressure to resolve their differences In the last four years the Legislature and the Governor delayed by such tough issues as Medicaid financing for abortions found they could ignore that deadline without a major impact on the state With the only pressure for a budget agreement coming from the Legislatures scheduled twoweek break and Mr Careys impending marriage there was no crisis atmosphere So Mr Fink decided to try to create one The Speaker had been determined until last week to lie back and wait for the Governor and Mr Anderson a Binghamton Republican to reach an agreement of their own Earlier in the budget negotiations Mr Fink said he was aggrieved over what had happened last year when he and Mr Anderson negotiated their own budget only to have the Governor veto 240 million from it including many politically popular local aid programs This year Mr Fink and Mr Carey announced agreement on a 165 billion budget which the Assembly promptly passed As the special session dragged on this weekend Mr Finks aides explained that the idea behind the Speakers switch in strategy was to present a united Democratic front in the face of the failure of negotiations so far with Mr Anderson The theory said a top aide to Mr Fink was that if we didnt show the Democratic Governor could get along with the Democratic house of the Legislature it would be another minus for him The aide said it was not substantive things that caused Mr Careys political problems Instead he cited recent offthecuff comments by the Governor As examples the aide cited the Governors reference to Kleenex cars in Detroit  use them for three years and then throw them away and his declaration that he would drink a glass of PCBs to prove that there was no danger from PCB pollution in a state office building in Binghamton Buffalo where many auto workers live and Binghamton are critical areas for Democratic success in both Assembly and gubernatorial races Although Mr Fink has been heard tosay that his break with the Governor served his interests last year by proving the independence of Assembly Democrats he was determined this year to force Mr Carey into active negotiations Last year the Assembly exercised leadership in one direction said an influential Democratic legislator Now were exercising it in another We are orchestrating the Governors victory A Productive Relationship Besides making political gains Mr Fink and his allies believe this years strategy has enabled the Speaker to build at least temporarily a productive relationship with Mr Carey  the sort of relationship both men have found elusive since Mr Fink became Speaker in 1979 Both Democrats and Republicans here suggest that Mr Finks initiative in forcing a special session was a riskfree venture for him For merely getting all parties back to the bargaining table he is likely to get some credit both for himself and the Democratic Party And because a special session becomes the property and problem of the Governor the moment it is called if it falters that will be the Governors loss One top Republican here noted that if the negotiations completely break down Mr Fink having proved his loyalty to the Governor would still be able to go as a free agent to negotiate his own deal with Mr Anderson This however is something Mr Fink still hopes to avoid In all of this the individual legislators have a limited but important role Their increasing frustration at being stuck in Albany with nothing to do as the days drag on is likely to build pressure on their leaders to work out some settlement Mr Carey has his own pressure point While the planning for his marriage to Evangeline Gouletas may have distracted him earlier the approach of his wedding day this Saturday is likely to give him an added incentive to get the budget out of the way quickly Id have to say it has affected him said one legislative aide If you were about to get married would you want to think about budgets
REAGAN NOMINEE FOR SURGEON GENERAL RUNS INTO OBSTACLES ON CAPITOL HILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/07/us/reagan-nominee-for-surgeon-general-runs-into-obstacles-on-capitol-hill.html,The Reagan Administrations plan to appoint as Surgeon General a Philadelphia physician who has spoken out forcefully against abortions has run into Congressional opposition and stirred criticism from several medical groups unions and feminist organizations To the chagrin of officials at the Department of Health and Human Services the appointment of Dr C Everett Koop an evangelical Christian who has been a board member of at least two groups opposed to abortions has been delayed indefinitely by a House subcommittee chairman Representative Henry A Waxman Democrat of California Dr Koop frightens me Mr Waxman remarked today He does not have a public health background hes dogmatically denounced those who disagree with him and his intemperate views make me wonder about his and the Administrations judgement What especially annoyed Mr Waxman and his panel on Health and the Environment a subcommittee of the Committee on Energy and Commerce was Dr Koops refusal to testify at hearings Friday that were designed to clear the way for his nomination It makes me wonder what he has to hide Mr Waxman said Laura Genero an aide to Richard S Schweiker the Secretary of Health and Human Services noted that Dr Koop needed only Senate confirmation Mr Waxmans subcommittee she said was dealing with an amendment that would allow the appointment of a Surgeon General over 64 years of age Dr Koop is about six months over the age limit The amendment was added to a credit card bill by Senator Jesse A Helms a South Carolina Republican who is an outspoken opponent of abortions Mr Waxman has described the amendment as a surreptitious attempt to clear the way for Dr Koops appointment Dr Koop formerly chief of surgery at Childrens Hospital in Philadelphia and virtually the entire first and second tier leadership at the Department of Human Services have declined press inquiries Miss Genero said that Dr Koop was busy and added Hes only been on board about two weeks Although Dr Koops nomination is not expected to be rejected by the Senate the House dispute has embarrassed officials in the Health and Human Services Department because of the disclosures about the surgeons past statements and publicity given to a number of people opposed to Dr Koops appointment One of those opponents Dr William H McBeath executive director of the American Public Health Association said that although Dr Koop was a distinguished pediatric surgeon he was otherwise almost uniquely unqualified to be Surgeon General Dr Lorin E Kerr director of occupational health for the United Mine Workers of America told the subcommittee that the union opposed Dr Koops nomination because he has no experience or training in preventive medicine or public health The Women and Health Roundtable an association of health professionals and womens organizations cited Dr Koops antiabortion stands including his opposition to amniocentesis a screening procedure to detect whether an unborn child has significant congenital disorders Dr Koop has described the process as a search and destroy mission
Hers; by Mary Kay Blakely,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/09/garden/hers-by-mary-kay-blakely.html,THE priest and I are having lunch together to plan a program in which Im to be the main speaker He is telling me as tactfully as possible to be prepared for some hostility in the audience The hostility will come from the local prolife groups It is 1981 in Fort Wayne Ind where words like prolife and hostile can show up in the same sentence to modify the same people The priests warning is similar to the advice given to Birch Bayh then Senator before the polls opened last November Expect some hostility Here the lions have good reason to be terrified of the Christians While he is drawing the battle lines between the prolife and prochoice sides of the abortion issue I retreat into my salad reminded of the uselessness of words Prolife is the euphemism chosen by the people whose definition of life is purely fetal Life for them is a concept that stops dead at birth They are the people who hang around the back doors of the clinic on Webster Street hoping to catch a picture of undeveloped fetal tissue in the garbage cans in the alley They have no compassion for the fully developed lives on the other side of the building the women whose circumstances have brought them to the front door Those are the prochoice people another misnomer The choice they face is either an abortion  a decision none of them will celebrate  or a range of bleak alternatives from martyred motherhoods to unrelenting poverty There are no pleasant choices in the range of possibilities Moving his coffee cup to the middle of the table the priest inquires about the possibility of common ground Cant either side move an inch toward agreement compromise concession I seriously doubt it I tell him because this is not a chickenandegg argument about when life begins The proposed human life amendment implies a value judgment about whose life has priority an eitheror decision between a woman and a fetus I choose to side with women because they will have the responsibility for the results of that decision and I trust their ability to weigh the alternatives carefully The prolife side picks fetuses because they judge life to be innocent and because they have little confidence in the moral judgment of women These women have after all gotten themselves pregnant as one state legislator put it They have obviously sinned and are deserving of punishment A fetus on the other hand is virginal and pure What is truly regrettable the priest says with a shake of his head is the lack of respect between opponents on the abortion debate Is there a sense of disapproval in his voice at my own ungenerous attitude Its true my respect for my adversaries wears thin The zealous local chapter of the Nurses Concerned for Life taunted and harassed the clients of the Webster Street clinic They blockaded the entrance and intimidated a young woman into the public bathroom facilities of a neighborhood McDonalds where these nurses administered their pregnancy test Two summers ago the prolife picketers at the clinic blocked the exit during a bomb threat preventing the evacuation of the patients within In the controversial suit that followed these incidents one of the defendants asserted that she would stop at nothing to prevent abortion The prolife profamily proGod lobbies are often against against any legislation that insures individual rights above family authority even child protection laws because as one minister said it interfered with a fathers right to discipline his children against Indiana Senate Bill 118 which called for prenatal care to pregnant teenagers because it was offered without parental consent against programs for child care and sex education and adolescent counseling because those responsibilities belong to the family not the state against funds for a local shelter for battered women because as one township trustee said he would break down any door placed between his wife and him And now the prolife and prochoice armies will clash on the floor of the 97th Congress and Im worried about a decision made in a climate of emotional and intellectual fatigue The legislators are weary from the onslaught of antiabortion lobbies tired of looking at the pictures of fetuses Im afraid Congress will vote the amendment off Capitol Hill and send it to the states for ratification because as the prolife leader Connie Marshner hopes they want the monkey off their backs But if they vote to stop the development of that photograph the one they dont want to look at any more and do nothing about the sequence of monstrous pictures leading up to it the frames of ignorance and abuse the monkey on their backs will grow to apelike proportions There is no neat antiseptic solution to the pain of abortion There will be no end to the scenes of human misery without sincere effort to change the conditions of life that produce them My luncheon companion nods his head agreeing that abortion is a humane alternative But he cant understand the great number of abortions each year why so many women choose that option Such a question really asks if women are making flippant moral decisions  do they really agonize enough over their choices The statistics suggest to him that they dont that women choose abortion for their own convenience Its convenient for him not to believe that behind the gross number there is that much poverty that much dispair that much rape that much incest that much womanbattering Its easier to believe that the number of abortions each year attests to the immorality of women thus shifting the responsibility from the culture collectively to women alone This is a good conversation he says enjoying it He hopes that we can conduct the discussion at the coming program dispassionately logically like this without anger and emotion Lets be sports about the war declared over your body I hear under his statements The anger wells up in me now the lava dome rising inside me the white hot intensity I cant will away I coexist with that anger fearing its explosion paying for its containment I swallow more ice water The priest confesses that he doesnt personally endorse an absolute position against abortion either He understands that life has a multidimensional meaning Maybe he even understands what the poet Marge Piercy meant when she wrote A woman is not a pear tree that human reproduction involves much more commitment and nurturance than a ninemonth gestation period He cant support me publicly of course  there would be unpleasant repercussions The man who has been asking me to think kindly of the prolife groups now asks me to accept his ostrich position on the issue Their intolerance could cost him his credibility his future I understood didnt I  I understand that one of us can get pregnant and one of us cant One of us is threatened with an amendment that would usurp the most profoundly personal decision of a lifetime and one of us isnt One of us will face a venomous assault from the prolifers and one of us wont One of us can get up from the table and not give the abortion issue another thought and one of us cant forget it at all Yes I understand One of us can afford to be dispassionate and apolitical and purely cerebral and one of us cant
PARTY CHIEFS IN ALBANY: POWERS BEHIND VOTING,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/09/nyregion/party-chiefs-in-albany-powers-behind-voting.html,It was one of those moments a legislative leader dreads Warren M Anderson leader of the Senates Republican majority was committed to passing his version of a bill to aid mass transit and the bill was going down to defeat Senator Anderson conferred hastily with his counsel John F Haggerty Mr Haggerty pointed his finger at one Republican Senator then another and they quickly changed their votes from the negative to the affirmative The bill was still one vote short of passage when Mr Haggertys gaze fixed on Senator Martin S Auer a Syracuse Republican Senator Auer rose from his red leather chair Mr President he said it has been called to my attention that there is 16 million in there for central transportation Due to that I am going to change my vote to yes The measure passed The incident which took place a few months ago was a rare public display of the extraordinary power wielded by the leaders of the Senate and Assembly usually in subtle and private ways to control legislators and thus the flow of key legislation here Much Activity Hidden In the New York State Legislature as in most other political bodies the activity that is seen in public is a faint shadow of the activity that has come before it in private And while each of the 210 legislators has one vote on legislation when it reaches the floor of the Assembly and Senate there are four legislators who have remarkable power to determine whether most pieces of legislation get to the floor at all They are Mr Anderson of Binghamton Stanley Fink of Brooklyn Speaker of the Democraticled Assembly and to a lesser extent Senator Manfred Ohrenstein of Manhattan and Assemblyman James L Emery of Geneseo the minority leaders of their respective houses The role of the leaders has been particularly evident in the last week as they try to negotiate the states new 16 billion budget with Governor Carey while rankandfile legislators stand idly by waiting for the outcome Wide Opportunity to Rule It is the leaders say a perfect example of why this type of centralized structure is necessary as fractious as the bargaining gets with four leaders imagine how it would be with 210 legislators each representing his personal point of view This concentration of power in turn increases the leverage of the leaders of the majorities in the two houses for they are the ones who have the power to deliver the votes needed to pass a bill It will be up to them to rally their colleagues to endorse the deals they strike at the end of this grueling budget process The power of the leaders is rooted not only in seniority respect and charisma as they like to portray it It is rooted also in the ability to grant and deny committee assignments provide staff allowances finance pet projects and newsletters wangle favors from the Governors office and  most important  send a legislators bill either to the floor of the house or into oblivion These pressures do not have to be exerted often it is usually enough for the rankandfile legislators to know they are there Ive never had to say You do this or Im going to cut your staff allocation  said Assemblyman Emery the minority leader I just might do something and they come in and ask me why Most of the time they dont have to ask The power of a legislative leader ultimately rests with his ability to hold the loyalty of the members of his party But the methods that are used to hold that loyalty are seldom seen and the places where that power is exercised are ones that news reporters and the public virtually never may enter The major policies that are debated in public meetings of the legislative committees are first thrashed out in private conversations among a leader his top staff members and perhaps a handful of highranking legislators Conference Methods Differ Assembly Speaker Fink hashes things out informally with his colleagues in his spacious woodpaneled office just off the Assembly chamber or in his more modern suite in the Legislative Office Building or at home with his counsel Kenneth Shapiro in an apartment they share when they are here Senator Anderson holds discussions in a Capitol office lined with portraits of his predecessors or he may take his advisers to lunch at the Fort Orange Club a comfortably stuffy menonly club a block from the Capitol The important bills that are debated on the floor are first debated  often in far less civil fashion  in separate Democratic and Republican party conferences also inaccessible to the public The conferences according to legislators and aides have three purposes to gauge the reaction of party members to build a consensus for a piece of legislation and allow legislators to let off steam and make outrageous suggestions in private to avoid damaging the party position in public and when necessary to enforce party discipline It is not unusual for example for those who misbehave to be warned that the leadership has the power to block their legislation from consideration Reporters usually cover legislators as theyre coming out of the conference or on the floor said Michael J DelGiudice who was for four years the Assembly chief of staff Those are really afterthefact processes Harmony Sometimes Elusive Even so the mood of a conference is occasionally so disparate from that of the leader that it cannot be overcome This is what Senator Anderson insists is happening now with the Governors plan to take over local Medicaid costs the Senates upstate members Mr Anderson has explained privately view it as a moneygrab for New York City and simply will not support it no matter how hard he tries Today its very difficult for a leader to try to impose his will on a conference said Senator Ohrenstein If youve got to do it because its responsible government thats when you have to apply some pressure The appearance of even a minor bill on the calendar of the Assembly or Senate according to legislative aides may owe more to its earlier appearance on a secret trade list than to the outcome of a deliberative legislative process The leaders of the majority parties of the two houses use these trade lists  particularly at the end of the legislative session  to barter the needs of their marginal legislators These are the legislators whose districts can swing Democratic or Republican in any particular election If the majority parties cannot satisfy their needs they are in danger of losing the majority and that is something a leader must avoid at all costs to remain in power The two houses are controlled by different parties and they operate by different rules but each has an elaborate system for monitoring the legislative process and controlling which bills come to the floor and which do not The Power of Starring Under the Senate rules Mr Anderson has the ultimate power  the ability to star a bill on the floor of the Legislature removing it from consideration no matter how many committee approvals it may have behind it and no matter how many legislators might want to vote for it According to the Democrats Senator Anderson used this power 149 times last year It sometimes is used to delay action on bills until amendments can be made or technical defects are cleared up and sometimes to keep the majority from having to cast public votes on potentially embarrassing issues Its a rule that really has no parallel in any other deliberative body said Senator Franz Leichter a Manhattan Democrat as he led this years unsuccessful effort to repeal the power In fact I checked into it and the Ayatollah Khomeini doesnt even have power to star bills in the Iranian Parliament Leonid Brezhnev doesnt have the power to star a bill in the Presidium of the Russian Parliament Senator Anderson in an interview shrugged off the criticism Thats just one means of calendar control he said asserting that it was better to star a bill on the floor in public view than not to let it get there That Senator Anderson and others said is what happens in the Assembly where the Speakers power to star bills was eliminated in a major overhaul of the rules in 1975 Subtle Controls in Assembly Right after the Speaker lost the power to star said Senator John B Daly Republican of Lewiston and a former Assemblyman he found other ways to deep six certain bills You never knew where the bill was going to go after it came out of committee Weve got one advantage here  we know where it is In the Assembly Senator Daly said a bill would pass the committee and lo and behold it would disappear into the cracks of the Assembly floor only to come up God knows where Speaker Finks power is exercised no less effectively than Senator Andersons although more subtly through the Assembly committee system The Speaker asserted that he does not exercise direct control over the committees saying I have yet to have to call in a committee chairman and say Look do it this way  period  the end  But the structure of the committees generally makes that unnecessary Committee appointments  which are under the Speakers control in the Assembly  are sometimes made to structure the committees so as to give almost certain outcomes on difficult legislation It is not by coincidence legislative aides say for example that the Health Committee has a high number of legislators known to oppose limits on abortion  a view held by the Speaker and most members of the Democratic majority Control Via Committee And if earlier controls fail there is the Ways and Means Committee the powerful group that must pass on any legislation that has a fiscal effect on the state The committee has 18 Democrats and 10 Republicans and most of those Democrats hold committee chairmanships or leadership positions that they owe to the Speaker Higher salaries and extra staff members accompany these positions Ways and Means is his star  Senator Anderson said of Speaker Fink And although the Senator has the same power of committee appointments he added I think theres much tighter control in the Assembly on what happens in committee Other tactics known to have been used in both houses to delay a vote on a measure include sending a bill out to the printer and not having it return for weeks or putting it on the calendar and simply not calling it for consideration for an extended period You remember the charts  a bill is introduced it goes to committee and so on asked Mr DelGiudice Well its not like you learned in high school
Dr. Unqualified,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/09/opinion/dr-unqualified.html,Although Dr C Everett Koop deserves his reputation as a fine pediatric surgeon he is not deserving of the role in which the Reagan Administration hopes to place him  Surgeon General The Surgeon General whose responsibilities include the National Institutes of Health the Center for Disease Control and the Institute of Alcohol and Drug Abuse has been almost without exception someone with significant experience in the special field of public health Many Surgeons General in fact have come out of the Public Health Service Dr Koop has neither worked in the field nor during his years at Childrens Hospital in Philadelphia shown any interest or influence in it Since he lacks the professional qualifications for the appointment and is in fact older than the law routinely permits his attractiveness to the Administration must lie elsewhere That elsewhere may be his antiabortion crusade Two years ago he toured 20 cities with a film whose message was that abortion led inexorably to euthanasia for the elderly And he has described amniocentesis a procedure used to detect congenital disorders like Downs syndrome and TaySachs disease in fetuses as a searchanddestroy mission Dr Koop is of course entitled to his opinions but opinions should not be construed as qualifications We hope Congress will reject the appointment recognizing as the Administration chooses not to that it would be an affront both to the public health profession and the public

DOCTORS-TO-BE PONDER ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/10/style/doctors-to-be-ponder-abortion.html,In other classes they learn about anatomy and biochemistry physiology and histology But when firstyear medical students at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine meet each week for their Introduction to Medicine course the issues discussed are more elusive an individuals moral responsibility to act according to his or her own conscience versus a doctors professional responsibility to serve his patient honesty in the name of truth versus dishonesty in the name of compassion patients rights versus doctors rights This weeks topic was abortion and the subject was as controversial in the classroom at Mount Sinai as it is around the nation these days The speakers included a doctor who performs abortions Dr David Sherman one who refuses to perform them Dr Charles Bacall and a 30yearold woman who had just undergone her third abortion Agreed on One Thing One of the few things almost everyone agreed on was that abortion can be a difficult issue for both patients and doctors Abortion is not something that is taken lightly by women its almost always something thats sad said Dr Sherman a gynecologist in private practice and an attending physician and faculty member at the school at Fifth Avenue and 100th Street and is part of the Mount Sinai Medical Center I believe that even an early pregnancy is a form of life But I also believe that a great deal of what I do as a physician is to provide service and I have chosen to consider the bearer of this life to have my priority In part Dr Sherman added this decision was formed by his years in training at a large urban hospital before abortions were legalized At that time he saw untold numbers of women who died of illegal abortions as well as many others who suffered a great deal of anguish because they could not get abortions and were forced to proceed with unwanted pregnancies Unlike Dr Sherman Dr Bacall weighted a doctors right to refuse to perform an abortion more heavily than a patients need to have one I dont believe that abortion is purely a womens issue said Dr Bacall who is also an attending physician and a faculty member at Mount Sinai I do not regard the imposition of my value system on the patient as my role But a particular patients choice cannot compel me to provide a service if it violates my own moral code Later Dr Bacall explained that his decision not to perform abortions was based on moral ethical and religious reasons and that it was purely personal  not a moral declaration that someone else shouldnt do it just that I dont feel I can comfortably do it Then the students heard from the woman who had just terminated her pregnancy I have a right to control my own life and to control my own body she said But despite that belief she described her decision to undergo an abortion as a very deep personal crisis Both before and after the fact of abortion you cant help but go through profound feelings of guilt depression anxiety fear even panic she said But every woman knows that its her life  she is the one this decision will always affect for the rest of her life and shes the only one who can make that decision For many women it really is a question of economic survival It can be a question of having a career or living the rest of your life or a substantial part of it on government welfare And unless youre in that position yourself you really cant understand that prospect Then the students had their opportunity to comment Under questioning both doctors acknowledged that their positions on abortion werent always consistent Dr Bacall said that when a patient requested an abortion he referred her to his partner who does perform the procedure A student asked whether the doctor was not thereby participating in abortion as an accessory to the fact Dr Bacall conceded that that was one way to look at it but added Once the decision has been made I feel I must do something to facilitate the proper medical care and followup He was also asked whether he would perform an abortion if the patients life were in danger and conceded that in that situation he would feel compelled to do so because his primary responsibility would be to the patient rather than to the fetus Nor was Dr Shermans position without loopholes If you regard abortion as a service do you perform one even if its for a reason you regard as frivolous asked one student What if a couple comes in the woman gets amniocentesis and finds out that the fetus is female and they ask for an abortion because they dont want a girl In other words where do you draw the line  or do you Dr Sherman said he would refuse to perform the abortion in such a situation Its probably very hypocritical he said but I would tell them that while its their right to have an abortion because its within the law I would not myself do it because I need relative justification in my own mind Reaction of Students After the class students said they thought it had raised some interesting questions I think that its both the patients choice on whether to have an abortion and a doctors choice on whether to perform one said Ted Friedman The option should be open to both Some felt that the discussion revolved too much around the perspective of a white middleclass male One of the students said she found it hard not to get upset when men began making pronouncements about how women should handle their lives I believe in choice and whenever I hear anyone against it I get really incensed that someone wants to take away a womans choice explained Jane Zucker Another student noted that little more than half the class had shown up for the days discussion People dont feel this kind of thing is important because its not tested in the curriculum said Paul Wax Theyll lose out but unfortunately theyll also be the physicians of tomorrow

RELIGIOUSLY-ORIENTED RIGHT-WING GROUP PLANS DRIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/us/religiously-oriented-right-wing-group-plans-drive.html,The immediate issues ranged from pinball legislation in Nashville and abortion legislation in Washington to as the guest speaker put it fighting the universal church of the latterday New Dealers The occasion for the evening of religiously oriented politics was the founding meeting of the Memphis chapter of the Religious Roundtable with Paul Weyrich the Washingtonbased director of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress as the main drawing card in a motel dining room near the Memphis Metropolitan Airport The efforts here last night exemplified a major part of the activities of the Christian right wing in 1981 building a structure around the country to back up the national attention it got last year in the Presidential campaign Edward McAteer national president of the Roundtable told the meeting that he hoped to have state organizations in all 50 states by the end of this year He also said that he wanted to have local chapters in 300 communities by the end of 1982 so that his group would be able to influence public policy concerning moral issues on a broad scale Other groups have similar plans For example Ronald S Godwin vice president and chief operations officer of Moral Majority an organization of politically active conservative Protestants said in a recent interview One of our top priorities is to move from what I call the media period to the organizational period By 1982 Id like to have 50 selfsustaining functioning state affiliates active down to the county level The enthusiasm generated by the 1980 election victories is an important organizing tool as the leaders of last nights meeting acknowledge But the expectations that those victories raise present at least a potential for disillusion and conflict with the Reagan Administration and its Republican allies in Congress Tennessee Senator Criticized Mr Weyrich a Roman Catholic from the Middle West drew a steady drumfire of amens when he attacked Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the Senate majority leader for saying recently that such social issues as abortion and prayer in the schools should be subordinated this year to Congressional action on the economy Mr Weyrich said that he did not believe that Senator Baker had asked his constituents Do you think that killing over one million babies is more important than the inflation rate Answering his own question Mr Weyrich said You cannot put murder on the back burner while you work on some kind of numbers He urged the Tennessee audience to educate Senator Baker on what he saw as the need for prompt Congressional action on social issues For the next few months however Mr McAteer said that he wanted this chapter to concentrate on building up its membership and on holding educational meetings rather than planning direct action projects such as trying to defeat a bill to legalize gambling on pinball machines even though everyone at the dinner was urged to write his or her lawmaker to defeat that bill That means more meetings with speakers like Mr Weyrich and sending out Roundtable material on various issues with the use of mailing lists provided by the churches Several ministers offered to provide such lists last night Few weeks of work went into arranging the meeting in Memphis Mr McAteers hometown and his base when he was the Southern sales marketing manager for the Colgate Palmolive Company a few years ago Even so the fried chicken devotion and inspiration did not complete the work last night He is still sifting through a list of potential members of a governing council of 56 persons  a number equal to the signers of the Declaration of Independence because our theme is patriotic Until it was Mr Weyrichs turn to speak last nights meeting dwelled more heavily on the spiritual than the political The dinner music featured a lyric proclaiming the cross is my Statue of Liberty The Rev Greer Garrett Roundtables national field director insisted that the best thing that weve got going for us in the Roundtable is God Himself That was not the only alliance of which the 200 persons present 40 more than had been expected were assured The Rev Charles Mims Jr of Louisville Ky Roundtables minorities chief told them that blacks shared their views Divisions between the races he said came because the diabolical enemy humanism has built fences between races Mr Weyrich encouraged those present to bring their religious principles into political action He told them not to worry about complaints of mixing religion and politics because liberal church people had never been bothered by that problem Shared Beliefs Called Vital Besides expressing opposition to officially sanctioned prayer in schools and support for choice on abortions he said liberal church people have testified for every cuckoo social welfare program that comes down the path Nor Mr Weyrich said should they worry about charges that people like him from the New Right were using Christians Neither side is using the other he said but they share beliefs that are important in the fight of values going on in Washington That fight has not yet been won he said because moderates still hold the balance of power in Congress and liberals are waiting for an opportunity for a comeback while temporarily putting on the cloak of conservatism But he assured his audience that conservative Christians could be proud that their kind of effort had helped to create a different kind of atmosphere in Washington

DEDICATED TO DOPE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/books/dedicated-to-dope.html,HIGH IN AMERICA The True Story Behind NORML and the Politics of Marijuana By Patrick Anderson 328 pp New York The Viking Press 1395 MARIJUANA has now won middleclass respectability as have blue jeans long hair look at David Stockman feminism health foods group therapy The Rolling Stones and sexual practices of various kinds The American counterculture once viewed as extremely threatening has become the overthecounter culture and lots of people in business and politics  many of them bearded longhaired dope smokers  have shown that American capitalism is nothing if not adaptable High in America is a fascinating portrait of one those folks Keith Stroup who did for marijuana what Calvin Klein did for blue jeans As a young Washington lawyer in full rebellion against his conservative Republican Middle Western background Mr Stroup admired the tactics of Ralph Nader but wanted to find his own cause A dope smoker he decided on the marijuana issue With a little and then a lot of financial help from Playboys Hugh Hefner the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws NORML was born in 1971 As a concession to public opinion Mr Stroup and his friends opted for reform not repeal even though the latter is what they had in mind Patrick Anderson runs through the adventures of the lawyerasyoungrebel with a combination of glee and worry over just what Mr Stroup did to himself and his movement through his unorthodox style As Mr Anderson portrays him Mr Stroup was clearly an attractive dissident A natural politician he knew how to use the press and how to bring pressure on his political adversaries But he could never manage to play the game entirely straight one sees in him all the conflicts of the upwardly mobile rebel who wants influence but has a Peter Pan attitude toward growing up For one thing his dedication to dope was genuine He once managed to get himself arrested for drug possession on a speaking trip in Canada When he went back later to defend himself he got a lot of good publicity and a light fine and then was arrested again en route to his plane back to the States Mr Stroup was also sympathetic to drug smugglers especially if they gave NORML financial help His attitude toward smuggling in fact was consistent with his vision of a world in which dope was cheap and legal In a twist on Eugene Debss maxim about his not being free while a single soul was in prison Mr Stroup believed that no marijuana smoker was truly free if a smuggler could be arrested Mr Stroup knew how to give a party as well and at one gathering in 1977 Dr Peter Bourne Jimmy Carters drug adviser decided to use cocaine Or seemed to Dr Bourne denied that he actually used the stuff even though Mr Anderson reports that he took a spoon being passed around the room Later when Mr Stroups anger at the Carter Administrations lack of sympathy for oppressed drug users got the better of him he leaked the story to the press Dr Bourne went down but Mr Stroup eventually went down with him His allies in the druglegalization movement could not forgive him for violating the code of not informing on another user And Mr Stroups action also helped destroy what was left of the relationship he had built with the Carter Administration He was thus forced to resign in late 1978 as the director of the organization he had built The larger story of the Carter Administrations attitude toward the drug issue is especially interesting and Mr Anderson as a speechwriter for Mr Carter during the 1976 campaign was in a good position to see it unfold In a sense the issue exemplified the cultural contradictions of Mr Carters politics He could see that the penalties for marijuana use seemed vastly out of proportion to the dangers involved Whatever one thinks of marijuana it seems clear from Mr Andersons reporting that a lot of people have suffered under the remarkably onerous penalties many states have imposed for marijuana possession And Mr Carter saw as well that a large youth constituency might be sympathetic to a Presidential candidate who supported decriminalization So he did But Mr Carter won in 1976 because he also embodied the cultural conservatism of many Democrats who had strayed from their party because of its alleged commitment to acid amnesty and abortion in the early 70s So he was never really enthusiastic about the drug issue and did not do too much about it in office And he eventually came under pressure from the other side with groups such as Families in Action organizing an antipot lobby as intense in its fears as NORML was in its hopes Like the country he led Mr Carter was caught in the middle of a cultural war between traditionalists who saw their values being trampled and the tramplers who believed they were struggling for freedom On the whole the efforts of Mr Stroup and his allies have been a success in less than a decade 11 states have decriminalized marijuana possession and in all but two of the remaining states it has been reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor While sympathizing with Mr Stroup Mr Anderson clearly understands that conflicts over values are rarely simple matters and that the new and enlightened view is not automatically the right one On the other hand Mr Anderson also makes clear what only a few conservatives  he cites William F Buckley Jr and James J Kilpatrick  are willing to admit that Mr Stroups private war was fundamentally about personal liberty With all the talk in Washington about the deregulation of entrepreneurial ventures Mr Stroup who is now in private practice might try to sneak the marijuana trade onto the list  and hope that the Moral Majority doesnt notice
CATHOLIC BISHOP URGES A HALT TO MX MISSILE SYSTEM,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/us/catholic-bishop-urges-a-halt-to-mx-missile-system.html,Less than five months ago the Rev William K Weigand was a parish priest in Homedale Idaho population 2078 on the banks of the Snake River near the Oregon border He had recently learned he would become Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City and he said he wanted to make his church in Mormon Utah as visible as possible Yesterday he took on the Pentagon In a strongly worded chastisement of the arms race published yesterday in a diocesan newspaper here he said he morally opposed the MX missile system not only its proposed deployment in Utah and Nevada but also the system itself I think this stance is the logical application of the teachings of the Church and our Holy Father Bishop Weigand wrote in the Intermountain Catholic in a column headed Feed Our Lambs The article quotes Pope John Paul II and the late Pope Paul VI as saying the poor were the victims of the arms race In an interview he said the 100 billion the MX system might cost over 10 years should be spent eradicating world hunger and social injustices He has also told Catholics that he opposed military aid to El Salvador Protestant religious leaders in Utah like the Episcopal Bishop E Otis Charles have said they oppose MX deployment in the Great Basin desert of Utah and Nevada but until now the Catholic Church has been silent on the landbased missile network that the Air Force proposes for the West The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints the Mormon Church in a Christmas message from its leadership expressed dismay about huge and threatening nuclear weaponry but the church refused to confirm that it was a reference to the MX Break From Traditional Bishop Weigand is the seventh Bishop of the Catholic diocese here There are 60000 Utah Catholics Although Catholic priests helped the Mormon leader Brigham Young find his way west from Illinois to Salt Lake City in 1847 the Catholic Church here has been largely quiet on public issues with the exception of asserting its opposition to abortion since the first Bishop the Most Rev Lawrence J Scanlon was appointed in 1886 The Catholic Church until a few years ago was regarded as a mission here by Rome and church leaders historically have been quiet administrators who rarely appeared at public events Bishop Weigand 43 years old was installed in a regal ceremony here in a civic auditorium Nov 17 It lasted four hours primarily because he insisted that the ceremony be translated into Spanish saying he wanted to establish close ties with the Hispanic American community Bishop Weigand was a missionary in Colombia from 1968 to 1977 The Pentagon had no comment on the Bishops denouncement of the MX But religious leaders did and at Manhattans Protestant Riverside Church which coordinates a nationwide disarmament program the project director Cora Weiss said Three cheers for the bishop Catholics in Salt Lake City had mixed reactions He seems to be more frequently speaking out on social issues as a representative of the Catholic Church and I applaud that said John McGean 35 who is an active parishioner at Our Lady of Lourdes Church However at the Cathedral of the Madeleine the diocesan headquarters there were several telephone calls of protest including one from a man who said Communists have infiltrated the Catholic Church and use their collars as camouflage to express extreme leftist sentiments
WHITE HOUSE STAFF SEES REAGAN RETURN AS BEST RX FOR PROGRAM,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/weekinreview/white-house-staff-sees-reagan-return-as-best-rx-for-program.html,Before President Reagan checked out of George Washington University Hospital and returned to the White House yesterday the First Lady received a letter from someone who has experience with convalescing chief executives Lady Bird Johnson wrote Mrs Reagan a White House aide recalled that she should remember that after Lyndon Johnson had his gall bladder out he took basically a month off Mr Reagan can ill afford such a lengthy convalescence his aides believe His economic recovery program has lost momentum on Capitol Hill since he was wounded March 30 in an assassination attempt they think While Mrs Reagan might like to shelter her husband in the thirdfloor White House solarium she hastily redecorated as a convalescent center his speech writers were working on a brief address plugging his budget and tax cuts that it was hoped Mr Reagan might feel strong enough deliver on Wednesday the deadline for paying Federal income taxes Nobody said one adviser can replace the President as a salesman for his package How much salesmanship can the President manage What will his schedule and list of priorities be like in his first days back in the White House The answers to these questions are not altogether clear for Mr Reagans top advisers are aware of the conflicting pressures squeezing them and the President Michael K Deaver the deputy chief of staff who has authority over Mr Reagans schedule is trying to balance Mr Reagans medical needs with the political necessity that the President as he himself put it last week suit up and come off the bench as soon as possible For anybody coming home from the hospital Mr Deaver said its going to be a taxing experience Such acknowledgements have been rare from a team that has in public at least seemed slow in adjusting to the reality of Mr Reagans injury It was almost as if the staff had been beguiled by the publicrelations strategy planned by the communications group whose emphasis on the Presidents good spirits fostered the impression in many that he was almost ready for wood chopping when as recently as Thursday his temperature climbed above normal Mr Reagan is recovering nicely But he is a 70yearold who had a bullet deep inside his lung had his ribs pried apart in a major operation and now feels quite stiff when he walks In the past two weeks he has spent a lot of time sleeping and only after nine days of announcements about the paperwork and official visitors flowing through his hospital suite did reports seep out that he has felt like working only two hours a day and was not even reading all the documents he signed on the advice of his staff White House pictures showed that Mr Reagan had lost weight and looked drawn Mr Reagans appearance however will not affect the impact of the first speech he gives if the White House follows through with its tentative plans to broadcast the speech over radio instead of television Mr Deaver said yesterday that that speech would probably be delayed beyond the original Wednesday target date The Reagan Touch Was Missed The staff is taking a cautious approach to planning his limited number of working hours But it hopes he will be able to lobby Congressional figures by telephone or in person Clearly his first priorities are going to be some votes coming up in Congress on his economic program said another key adviser The importance of Mr Reagans personal effort on such votes was brought home to the White House staff on Thursday when the Senate Budget Committee rejected by a 12 to 8 vote an austere budget proposal similar to Mr Reagans Had he been in a position to talk personally with a couple of senators that could have gone another way the aide said Frankly that vote surprised us We thought we were going to win It was something of a setback Mr Reagans advisers believe the pressure of public opinion on the Congressmen during the twoweek recess that began this weekend will influence the key budget votes later this month The shooting of Mr Reagan deepened the affection and respect for him in the country added one Presidential adviser Mr Reagans pollster Richard Wirthlin agrees that people were able to see Ronald Reagan in a different light a man under extreme trauma and pressure and to assess how he reacted But he cautioned that doesnt necessarily translate into higher probability of passage of his economic program Such a translation of course is exactly what the White House staff wants to bring about While cautious about sounding callous Mr Reagans advisers acknowledge that the attempt on his life may enable them to capitalize on what one called the affectionate quotient Mr Reagans brush with death and his diminished ability over the next few weeks may have another benefit beyond that of solidifying support behind his economic program There are signs these factors may serve to tamp down increasingly rambunctious conservatives who had been threatening to divert attention from the budget offensive by demanding that Mr Reagan join them in some symbolic crusade on antiabortion legislation or a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget There is a general feeling of luckiness at the White House these days  that the President was spared that the Russians did not invade Poland during his hospitalization that the shooting if it had to come did not take place before the economic program was fairly launched The expectation is that the economy will be the Presidents almost exclusive interest barring international crisis Another unresolved question is what steps if any will be taken to protect Mr Reagan in the future The arrest in a bus terminal in New York City of Edward M Richardson of Drexel Hill Pa underscored the fact that whatever sickness motivates potential assassins will not heal as quickly as Mr Reagans wound Mr Richardson armed with a pistol was on his way to Washington According to authorities he believed John W Hinckley the man accused of shooting Mr Reagan had ordered him in a prophetic dream to finish what he started As for Mr Hinckley he is now thought to have stalked Jimmy Carter in Washington in the fall The pace at the White House slackened a bit during the second week of Mr Reagans absence Now one official predicted it will pick up again in response to the novel experience of operating for a while with what is of necessity a parttime President Its good to be realistic about this he said Hes not going to come bouncing out of there like Superman The thing that ought to be added though is that his spirits are good
A ROYAL DEFENDER OF DEMOCRACY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/magazine/a-royal-defender-of-democracy.html,THIS FOOTNOTE GROWS OUT OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF STORY The royal dynastic family imported by Spain from France in the 18th century The repetition of the Spanish spelling in Juan Carloss name reflects the lineage of his father Don Juan Borbon y Battenberg and mother Dona Maria de las Mercedes de Borbon y Orleans James M Markham is chief of The Timess bureau in Madrid By James M Markham rivately Juan Carlos de Borbon y Borbon confides that he would like to be the kind of constitutional monarch Britains Queen Elizabeth is high above the fray of politics an ultimate but rarely appealedto referee a living symbol of the unity of the nation History however has cast him in a more exacting and perilous role and recent events thrust him center stage On the night of Feb 23 with the Government and Parliament held hostage by a band of rebel Civil Guards Juan Carlos I almost singlehandedly halted a surprise golpe de estado a coup against the state its aim nothing less than reimposing the reactionary conditions that existed under the late Francisco Franco and the destruction of the frail democracy instituted by his successor Juan Carlos to insure the survival of the restored Bourbon dynasty In the nervous hours that followed the coup attempt the powerful ironies of Juan Carloss fiveyearold reign came full circle The King saved quite literally the skins of politicians who at Francos death in 1975 had predicted that a republicanminded people would topple the Caudillos handpicked dauphin with the history books remembering him as Juan Carlos el Breve the Brief After he had scuttled the coup and rescued the captives in the Cortes the Spanish parliament Juan Carlos summoned the nations leading politicians to the Zarzuela Palace the modest royal residence on the outskirts of Madrid and told them bluntly that by thwarting the coup he had forfeited the sympathies of the military and that the civilians should not count on him to pull any more of their chestnuts out of such fires The Crown he told the haggard sleepless politicans is proud to have served Spain with firmness and in the conviction that democratic life and the strict respect of constitutional principles is the overwhelming will of the Spanish people However we should be aware that  the King cannot and should not repeatedly confront with his own responsibility circumstances of such great tension and gravity After the taut drama had played itself out the biggest demonstrations in the history of Spain acclaimed a truly popular King Mayors of the Socialist Party the repository of Spanish Republican sentiment went so far as to propose that Juan Carlos be given the Nobel Peace Prize But by throwing his enormous prestige behind a beleaguered democracy that has much less prestige Juan Carlos may have as he forcefully suggested to the politicans irrevocably alienated an army that still dreams of regaining the power it had under Franco Many influential military officers no longer regard Juan Carlos as they did before the attempted coup as Francos heir and thus worthy of their support To them he is now the chief pillar of a system they would like to overthrow Therefore a second coup  aimed at the throne  is more than a possibility If it comes it is widely believed that the next putsch will probably be more decisive and thus bloodier than the last one The plotters will not want to repeat their errors and so will err on the side of excess rather than restraint To succeed they would have to imprison or kill the King whose enormous popularity inside Spain would make him too dangerous a foe to be permitted to live in exile The implications of a successful coup or a civil war would be discomforting for the United States and Western Europe which hope that a democratic Spain will soon be able to join both the Common Market and NATO The Reagan Administration would find itself caught between its strategic interests in retaining important American bases in Spain which come up for renegotiation this fall and its desire not to offend its NATO allies by seeming to condone or recognize a shaky military dictatorship As it is the Spanish ultra right in the pages of El Alcazar a tabloid daily that still beats the drums for Franco has been assiduously cultivating the idea that the Reagan Administration would not really oppose a rightwing antiCommunist dictatorship in Spain And the first American reaction to reach Madrid even as the Cortes was being held hostage was an offthecuff comment by Secretary of State Alexander M Haig Jr to the effect that the coup in progress was an internal matter Aimed at dodging a question Haigs answer left the indelible impression that Washington was indifferent to the future of Spanish democracy Just as El Alcazar had said Subsequent effusive words of praise from President Reagan to Juan Carlos have not erased this view Spaniards believe what they want to believe about the United States which firmly supported the Franco regime and these days is friendly with similar regimes in Argentina and Chile The Secretary of State however considered the negative reaction to his remark serious enough to schedule a stopover in Madrid last week on his way home from the Middle East to meet with Juan Carlos and his Foreign Minister Jose Pedro Perez Llorca and to signal to the restive Spanish generals that Washington would like them to stay in their barracks For months the generals had been coming to Juan Carlos complaining that the then Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez Gonzalez was a disaster that harsher measures had to be taken against the ravages of Basque terrorism that the granting of autonomy to Catalans Basques and others was leading to the disintegration of the patria the fatherland The King had been hearing this sort of thing from them for years Serving at times as a father confessor he always listened patiently to their gripes and angry outbursts making them feel better for the moment at least But in February their resentment could no longer be placated and when they mounted a rebellion against the Government they did so in the Kings name There was more than cynical opportunism here Many of them had convinced themselves that Juan Carlos a soldier one of them  could not or would not disagree with the traditional military remedy for the anarchy of civilian rule by one count this was the 22d uprising in Spain since 1814 After all wasnt he Francos heir On the night of Feb 23 Juan Carlos was at the Zarzuela Palace listening to a live radio broadcast of the balloting for a prime minister to replace Suarez who had recently resigned because he felt he no longer had the confidence of his party or the King Just as deputies whose names began with an N were calling out their votes the excited voice of the announcer riveted the 43yearold monarch as it did millions of Spaniards A man in the uniform of a lieutenant colonel of the Civil Guards is aiming his pistol at the speaker of the house   He is aiming it at us Then came the sound of gunfire as mutinous guards squeezed off warning bursts into the domed ceiling of the Cortes Moving quickly Juan Carlos ordered the organization of a rump government of under secretaries to function while the real Government was being held at gunpoint Although the scope of the plot was not immediately clear the King knew the situation was grave when only three of the nations 11 powerful regional military commanders called to express their loyalty All through the night using his private communications system the King talked wavering generals back into line assuring them that he had not condoned the coup as the rebel leaders were claiming One seditious general who did call the King was the the armys Deputy Chief of Staff Alfonso Armada Comyn General Armada who would have become president of the junta had it succeeded boasted to his former pupil  he had been Juan Carloss military tutor and secretary of the Kings household that he had in his office 10 generals who agree with me I also have the third second fifth and seventh military regions Juan Carloss angry reply was The rebels will have to shoot me before I will let them pass When Lieut Gen Jaime Milans del Bosch military commander of the Valencia region who had masterminded the plot obstinately refused to come to the phone to explain why he had illegally proclaimed a state of emergency in the area under his command Juan Carlos sent him a telex that said I will not leave Spain nor will I abdicate nor will I deliver power to you Many Spaniards did not sleep in their homes on the night of the coup After burning possibly incriminating papers some readied themselves to flee the country should the coup succeed In rural Andalusia farmers whose fathers had been slaughtered when the last civil war exploded took to their fields and slept with shotguns by their sides In the roiled Basque region the entire leadership of Herri Batasuna a radical formation close to the Basque separatist organization ETA slipped across the frontier into southern France Their collective fears were not unfounded In Madrid and other cities paramilitary Fascist groups had been mobilized ready to take their vengeance if the junta became a reality But the Kings decisive actions prevented the military from implementing its plans When all is said and done however it is the military that will judge the military for their rebellion against civilian authority And given the track record of military justice in postFranco Spain it is most improbable that the full network of complicity in the February plot will ever become known This may be just as well as it appears that a significant number of the 11 captainsgeneral who command powerful regional divisions knew early on that some sort of plot was afoot and would almost certainly have joined had it appeared to be successful Aware that a wholesale purge might instantly provoke another coup Juan Carlos has warned politicians and the press not to launch a witch hunt Though incarcerated while awaiting trial the plotters are hardly roughing it General Milans del Bosch one of the many Spanish officers who were awarded Hitlers Iron Cross for serving on the Russian front during World War II has been given the commanding officers suite at the military headquarters at Getafe near Madrid and permission to entertain guests Lieut Col Antonio Tejero Molina the officer who held Parliament at gunpoint in February also has guest privileges At his military prison east of Madrid he has been giving lighthearted interviews to the press The neoFascist right has converted the mustachioed colonel into a patriotic hero Walls all over Spain are being spraypainted preferably in green the color of Civil Guard uniforms  with Vivas for the colonel and demands that the guidance of the state be turned over to his sure hands Under Franco an embittered general recently told his son there were 36 million Spaniards who lived happily and several hundred unhappy ones and they were in jail Today 36 million Spaniards are miserable and a few hundred are happy They are the politicians The general did not consider his statement an exaggeration His searing disdain for the political class a prevalant attitude among the military is rife with social and financial grievances Franco in fact mistreated his army paying its officers badly giving them secondrate equipment and above all dividing the officer corps to rule But under Franco the Spanish officer though not wealthy had respect History had vindicated him on the winning side of the Civil War That precious thing his honor was intact Juan Carloss democracy changed all that The dark evil of political parties which Franco had so resolutely denounced was reintroduced to Spain The losers of the Civil War the Socialists and the Communists were reinstated even vindicated The unity of the fatherland was endangered by the granting of autonomy to Basques Catalans Andalusians and Canary Islanders Terrorists killed policemen and army officers with impunity Pornography and crime took root in the cities Some politicians readied a divorce law Others spoke of abortion For the elderly soldier veterans of the Civil War all of this was scandalous enough It rankled even more with the younger officers a different and perhaps more dangerous breed Aristocrats and welltodo monarchists can be found in large numbers in the upper echelons of the officer corps However when Spains economy boomed in the 1960s a signficiant number of them urged their own sons to stay out of the military to take advantage of changed circumstances to make money Today many of the upandcoming officers now are offspring of the lower middle class little inspired by monarchist doctrine They are thinly educated and frustrated men resentful of their civilian brothers and friends who even in todays wounded economy live in a certain prosperity while the officers have to moonlight to put their children through good private schools Their festering anger is compounded by the sluggish upward mobility in the officer corps which has a professional traffic jam of 1000 general officers enough to command an army several times the size of Spains 255000 men threefourths of whom are conscripts To cement their black intransigent views which reflect the values of 19thcentury agrarian Spain the younger officers read the alarmist El Alcazar an unabashedly neoFascist publication As professional military officers they have pledged loyalty to the twoyearold Constitution They know however that if for any reason they become overly identified with the civilian regime they face ostracism even retaliation by their peers Such was the fate of Lieut Gen Manuel Gutierrez Mellado a reformist soldier close to the King who became Deputy Prime Minister Guti as he is widely known moved a few likeminded officers into the newly created Defense Ministry Franco had kept the three branches of the armed forces separate and into importantsounding institutions such as the Joint Chiefs of Staff Guti was the one person physically assaulted by the Civil Guards who invaded Parliament But he was later lionized by the press for refusing to duck when the rebels started shooting For every Gutierrez Mellado there are many more inflexible ultraright officers who moved by an almost metaphysical patriotism uncompromising Roman Catholicism and festering social grievances believe that it is their duty to save Spain The word salvation with its clear religious overtones crops up with alarming frequency in military discourse Heroism particularly in defense of a democracy which few could have imagined at the time was not predicted for Juan Carlos when he became King of Spain on Nov 22 1975 two days after Francos death For democrats many of whom had been living underground or in exile Juan Carlos was fatally compromised by having sworn allegiance to the Fascist principles of the Franco state for partisans of the dynastic rights of his father Don Juan de Borbon y Battenberg Count of Barcelona the son was a usurper still others considered him a playboy and an intellectual lightweight Born into the Bourbon family in exile in Rome in 1938 Juan Carlos had something less than a happy childhood bumped around from Italy to Switzerland and Portugal At the age of 10 at Francos insistence he left his immediate family to study in Spain Eight years later while visiting in Lisbon with his family Juan Carlos was involved in the accidental death of his younger and only brother Alfonso while the two were playing with a 22caliber pistol For a year afterward the solemn Prince spoke of going into a monastery But he returned to Spain where Franco who had no sons showed a fatherly interest closely overseeing his education In 1969 beginning to sense his own mortality Franco finally named Juan Carlos as his successor frustrating decadesold maneuvers by Don Juan to become King of Spain The dictators decision strained relations between father and son and only in 1977 on the eve of Spains first free elections in four decades did the liberalminded Don Juan formally renounce his strong claim to the throne Sensing that things would have to change after his death Franco refrained from giving the Prince advice on how to govern Why should I tell you anything the aging dictator replied to repeated inquiries from his young understudy You are not going to govern the way I did The last years before the Caudillos death were especially difficult for the Prince His foes within the regime militants in the Fascist Falange and some ambitious military men saw to it that disagreeable incidents marred Juan Carloss travels around Spain On one trip a heckler hurled a tomato at the Prince splattering his pants leg with thick red juice With an amplomb worthy of the office for which he was destined Juan Carlos dipped a finger into the instant tomato paste tasted it and then loudly complained Hey this isnt even ripe The Caudillos death finally permitted Juan Carlos to reveal to his countrymen and the world that he was not a tame stooge of the old regime Maneuvering skillfully with only a handful of trusted aides and friends notably Torcuato Fernandez Miranda who taught him constitutional law the King reached out immediately to an opposition he felt was in touch with the modern industrial society Spain had become He even sent a secret emissary to Rumania to ask President Nicolae Ceausescu if he would serve as a conduit to Santiago Carrillo leader of the banned Spanish Communist Party to tell him that Juan Carlos intended to bring about a new order in which Carillo his party and his underground trade unions would eventually have a place In the summer of 1976 Juan Carlos pulled off his biggest surprise by picking Adolfo Suarez Gonzalez an obscure apparatchik of the Franco administration as successor to Carlos Arias Navarro a former security chief he had inherited from Franco Together Juan Carlos and Suarez mapped out a scheme that called for the old order to commit political suicide in order to make way for a constitutional monarchy The aim was to avoid a legal break with the Francoite state to do everything by the book Incredibly their plan worked A referendum endorsed democratic elections Nominally retiring to an ornamental role Juan Carlos in fact remained the most powerful monarch in Western Europe traveling widely abroad as a symbol of the new Spain and at home keeping a grumbling army in line Aware of the deep streak of republicanism that runs through Spain  in the last century and a half every Bourbon monarch has spent time in exile Juan Carlos has cultivated the image of a populist monarchy shorn of pomp and devoid of scandal and controversy He has learned from his brotherinlaw and friend Constantine the former King of Greece what can happen to impetuous rulers who lose the confidence of their people or their armed forces When he was proclaimed King Juan Carlos refused to move into the marble Palacio Real traditional residence of Spains monarch using it only for state receptions Juan Carlos and his Queen Sofia whom he married in 1962 also upset Spains titled aristocracy by refusing to establish a royal court A woman of considerable charisma and determination Sofia has proved a big asset in bringing the revived Bourbon monarchy closer to the Spanish people Juan Carlos though a gregarious extrovert in private tends to be somewhat wooden in public but Sofia has a warm smile that captivates Spaniards who remember earlier royal consorts as having been cold and remote On skiing holidays in the Spanish Pyrenees the King and Queen and their three children  Elena 17 Cristina 15 and Felipe 13  wait in line for lifts along with everyone else Hola the King once called out to a stunned skier who had met him years before I dont know if you remember me but Im Juan Carlos Telephoning a newspaper to rectify a story about himself Juan Carlos told the receptionist that it was the King who was calling If youre the King Im Napoleon the receptionist replied and then hung up on the monarch A kind of cult of personality has grown up around the tall 6 feet 3 inches head of state whose spontaneous often solitary sorties from the Zarzuela Palace behind the wheel of his blue Mercedes or on a motorcycle delight his subjects but distrub his security guardsWhen a recent visitor to the Zarzuela asked the King if he didnt take too many physical risks by circumventing security measures the King responded I cant change my style of life just because someone might like to kill me A fatalist Juan Carlos likes to recall that his grandfather Alfonso XIII survived a number of assassination attempts He himself is known to have survived at least one attempt on his life in 1977 Motorists out of gas have told of having been given lifts by a helmeted motorcyclist who turned out to be the ruling descendant of Philip V From all over Spain ham radio operators tune in to chat with the man who transmits under the call letters EAOJC Fluent in French English and Portuguese the King surprised and enchanted the people of Barcelona in 1976 by addressing them in Catalan their own language which had been banned by Franco On a controversial visit to the Basque sanctuary of Guernica this year Juan Carlos made a point of speaking a few words in Basque which had also been suppressed by the dictator Carefully Juan Carlos is grooming his only son Felipe to succeed him one day As heir to the throne Felipe holds the title of Prince of Asturias and has already made two official visits to the northern mining region whose name he bears Some 27000 Asturian children wrote to the young Prince on the occasion of a visit he made last January giving him a sample of the importance and power some Spaniards attribute to their monarchy I ask you wrote one girl from the choking industrial city of Gijon that there shouldnt be so much pollution because that way so many plants die and also a lot of people get sick Another child solemnly asked Felipe to prevent the closing of a bankrupt steel mill A bright athletic and at times irreverent youth Felipe sometimes in a smart miniaturized military uniform appears by his fathers side on various ceremonial occasions The young Prince receives his academic instruction at a private coeducational day school in suburban Madrid where he mixes easily with his fellow students His mother once surprised and thrilled the mother of another student by asking if Felipe could attend her sons birthday party In the worldly tradition of his family Felipe has already learned to speak fluent English the preferred tongue for dealing with the Bourbon cocker spaniel Juan Carlos has always vigorously rejected suggestions that he create a formal body of advisers His wife is probably the nearest thing he has to a regular adviser When a friend once asked the King who really had influence over him he replied You should know that I have only married Sofia Although she shuns any public identification with a policymaking position Sofia has demonstrated sound political instincts In the early stages of the February coup before his seditious role became clear she is said to have voiced suspicion of General Armada whose two decades of personal service to Juan Carlos were thought by others to have placed him above suspicion Aside from the secretary of his household Gen Sabino Fernandez Campo a few trusted aides and a press secretary Juan Carlos does not have a real staff to keep him apprised of developments He relies on wideranging contacts  he receives a thousand official visitors a year  to keep abreast of what is happening in his country and abroad He likes to pick up the phone and chat with other monarchs and heads of state notably Queen Elizabeth and Frances President Valery Giscard dEstaing who himself is not without royal pretensions A telephone conversation with Ronald Reagan just before the February coup is said to have encouraged Juan Carlos to believe that he could count on Washingtons support for the monarchy and democracy in Spain When he heard that President Reagan had been shot during an attempted assassination last month Juan Carlos immediately telephoned the White House to determine the Presidents condition and to denounce the criminal attack which disgracefully proved that terrorist violence today is generalized Though his actual powers are no greater than those of other European constitutional monarchs Juan Carlos meets more frequently with all of his countrys political leaders than most of his fellow rulers do He also has the traditional weekly sitdown visits with his Prime Minister and during the years of Suarezs tenure Juan Carlos spoke almost daily with him In the world of kings Juan Carlos admires the existential Hussein of Jordan a friend and like him a survivor who governs a powder keg at least as explosive as Spain Juan Carlos will need the guts and luck of Hussein to ride out the storm that is brewing in Spain While the countrys political superstructure has changed dramatically since Francos death its other principal institutions  the military the police and the Roman Catholic Church remain for the most part aggressively wedded to the past The church in Spain has been a lukewarm convert to democracy and to the new Constitution which disestablished its official position in the state But the King an unconspicuously practicing Catholic enjoys the support of most bishops on many issues Since the thwarted coup the King has been working quietly to see if his politicians and soldiers cannot find common ground The backdrop is difficult Spains experiment with democracy coincides with a persistent economic crisis in Western Europe which has had a devastating domestic effect 16 million Spaniards or more than 12 percent of the work force are jobless one of the highest unemployment rates in the industrial world Spains current rate of inflation is 16 percent Prosperity is associated with Francos dictatorship not with Juan Carloss democracy The shock of the coup has given foreign investors pause and deeply disturbed Spanish businessmen most of whom have yet to adjust to such novelties as free labor unions The Common Market remains an elusive goal Western Europe ostracized Francos dictatorship but Spaniards tell themselves bitterly democratic Spain still waits for acceptance The new Prime Minister Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo  who like his predecessor is a member of the Union of the Democratic Center  has rejected a call from the Socialists for a grand coalition to consolidate democracy knowing that the generals would not like to see the left in power The Socialists fear rightly that the military might constitute a permanent obstacle to their ever coming to power and that Spaniards will now be inhibited from voting for the left out of fear of triggering another coup A surefooted operator Calvo Sotelo seems to favor curtailing autonomy to certain regions and insisting on the dominance of Madrid in most matters Some politicians and journalists observe that while the coup failed in military terms it succeeded politically Already there are abundant signs that the politicians have gotten the soldiers message The word Spain which had been displaced by the federalistsounding phrase Spanish State has come rapidly back into fashion even in the mouths of Basque nationalists Flanked by a gigantic Spanish flag Carrillo the Communist chief ended a recent rally in Madrids Plaza Mayor with the patriotic cry Viva Espana The invocation of nationalist rhetoric by the nominal leaders of the countrys proletarians reflects the respect with which Spains traditional forces must be treated by all sectors of Spanish society One fundamental problem has no easy solution Several hundred Basques locked in a life style of violence and driven by a misty messianic vision of a free Basque nation pose the greatest threat to democracy in Spain today The terrorists of the Basque separatist organization ETA appear to have launched themselves into an allout murder campaign aimed at military men Their cynical calculation is that if ETAs assassins can kill enough colonels another coup is inevitable They believe that military repression of Basque autonomy would drive ordinary Basques presently disenchanted with ETA back into the revolutionary fold More than any other single issue Basque terrorism brought Colonel Tejero into the Cortes and General Milans del Boschs tanks into the streets There have been important political victories in the uphill struggle against ETA notably in isolating it from the mainstream of Basque opinion but an inept police force and the lack of consistent cooperation from France where the terrorists hide and plot their killings have made it difficult to uproot the guerrillas Prime Minister Calvo Sotelo has recently given the army a limited role in the antiterrorist war in the north to appease the generals anger and give them a sense of striking back at ETAs faceless killers who specialize in shooting policemen and soldiers in the back Troops will now watch frontiers and coastlines But the trick is to deploy them without alienating the Basque population As long as the ETA keeps killing the threat of another coup is not far off The people of Spain are frightened and all eyes are on the King A routine announcement that he would pay a longscheduled state visit to Italy at the end of this month sent shudders throughout the country The smallest occasion involving the King and the army is studied with neurotic attention A nimble politician Juan Carlos has begun painstakingly to rebuild bridges to the army where he can still draw on a certain pool of respect And no matter how bitter some ultraright generals may be today they know that no one in their ranks could command national or international esteem or if they could look at it dispassionately govern Spain any better than the politicians are doing today General Milans del Bosch who faces the possibility of a stiff prison sentence was the closest thing to another Franco the army had So the soldiers may be forced to bide their time But their diminished status rankles and no one can predict what the military will do should their frustrations once again mount to crisis fever There have already been some disquieting signs Just after the coup attempt Juan Carlos attended his 25th reunion at the Zaragoza Military Academy ending a stern speech with the rousing exhortations Viva el Ejercito Viva Espana Long Live the Army Long Live Spain It is customary at such gatherings for the assembled officers to shout back Viva el Rey Long Live the King But this time there was an ominous hostile silence

WOMEN IN MEDICINE FIND A NEED FOR SUPPORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/13/style/women-in-medicine-find-a-need-for-support.html,In what was believed to be one of the largest gatherings of women in medicine ever held in this country female doctors were advised in New York over the weekend to become more assertive  both at work and with their husbands  to shed their traditional reluctance to join medical societies and to help stamp out the queen bee syndrome in medicine The queen bees will begin to be undermined by meetings like this Dr Ruth Moulton a Manhattan psychoanalyst for 35 years yesterday told the nearly 600 women in medicine who were meeting at Rockefeller University The queen bee syndrome has been defined by leaders of the womens movement as referring to those women who achieve success in their careers and then refuse to help women in lower positions to move up The doctors including medical students from as far away as California New Mexico and Washington State came to the city for a conference called Women in Medicine Tomorrows Goals Today It was sponsored by the American Medical Womens Association and several other medical groups A Network of Support Our purpose is to establish a network to support each other said the conference director Dr Lila A Wallis associate clinical professor of medicine at the Cornell University Medical College in New York Men doctors have their old boy network but women up until now have not had one After each medical meeting she expanded in an interview you always see groups of male physicians go off together to discuss the important things like promotions and appointments in medical academia They get together in bars and clubs and a young male doctor can get ahead by inviting himself to have a drink with them But if a woman were to ask a male physican to have a drink he would interpret it in a very different way The conference had a strong feminist tone  the doctors yesterday endorsed a resolution supporting the right of women to obtain safe legal abortions It included lectures panel discussions and workshops at which the following statistics of women in medicine were disclosed  Although 25 percent of todays medical students are women only 10 percent of the nations 40000 practicing physicians are women  In United States medical schools only 35 percent of full professors and 15 percent of department heads are women  There is not one full dean in any of the 122 medical schools in the United States  Only 18 percent of female physicians belong to the American Medical Association Over and over at the conference the female doctors were urged to join medical societies and other professional groups in order to influence policy In her keynote address Dr Alexandra Symonds a Manhattan psychiatrist criticized those female doctors who deliberately choose not to get involved in policymaking groups because they consider them to be maledominated and maleoriented and then attack women who do achieve power or influence calling them elitist This process of women attacking and cutting down women called trashing has caused considerable turmoil and fragmenation in the womens movement she said In almost every workshop the female doctors and medical students were urged to be more assertive in dealing with sexual harassment from male doctors in trying to work out an equitable distribution of household chores with a husband and in choosing medical specialties once thought to be closed to them such as surgery At a workshop on Women in Surgical Specialties Dr Christine E Haycock an associate professor of surgery at the New Jersey Medical School in Newark said that one of the problems that still remained for a female surgeon was the lack of referrals from male physicians When I came into practice in the 50s she said it was almost impossible to get referrals from my male colleagues Its still a problem to some extent but fortunately there are more and more women going into internal medicine these days who will give you referrals Dr Francesca Thompson a resident in orthopedic surgery at the Hospital for Special Surgery listed what she called myths about orthopedic surgery which she said were perpetuated to discourage women from entering the field Orthopedic surgery is practiced by jocks for jocks and You have to be big or have big hands or be strong to go into orthopedic surgery None of them are true said Dr Thompson 37 years old who was a social worker married and the mother of two children before she decided to go to medical school She did concede however that many male surgeons had macho qualities that sometimes turned women off to the specialty In one of the more controversial panels Medical Management of Menopause Dr Wallis took a stand in favor of estrogen replacement therapy for certain menopausal patients The therapy has been widely criticized by some feminists and doctors in recent years on the grounds that it causes an increased risk of endometrial cancer Dr Wallis said she thought the replacement therapy could be made safe by using the hormone progesterone along with the estrogen and she quoted from studies showing that women treated with this combination of hormones actually developed fewer cases of cancer than women who received no treatment at all Her views were disputed by Barbara Seaman the author and cofounder of the National Womens Health Network who said In light of whats known about estrogen Id stay away from it as long as possible Teresa Goetz a 25yearold medical student from Michigan State University said one of the reasons she had driven nonstop to the conference with six other students was to find ways of solving the conflict between work and family Indeed the lectures and workshops dealing with the family problems of the female physician were among the bestattended Since an estimated 65 percent of female doctors marry doctors one of the more popular workshops was MD Marriages led by two Boston psychiatrists who are married to each other Dr Carol Nadelson and Dr Theodore Nadelson They were asked questions about professional jealousy child care and the tradeoffs a female doctor had to make once she decided to have children  such as hiring a housekeeper who might become the childs central focus of affection rather than the mother Of course professional jealousy exists Dr Theodore Nadelson said But you try not to make it a big thing Its best to try to deal with it on a situational basis whenever it occurs In her keynote address Dr Symonds told the doctors that there was much more stress in the life of a female physician than there was in the life of her male counterpart One of the reasons The female physician has a divided sense of identity when she combines profession and home A man does not have this divided sense of identity when he becomes a doctor she added On the contrary his identity and sense of self is now fulfilled Men in our culture are able to fuse their work identity with their personal identity while women cannot
PRIDE ON THE MOJAVE; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/15/us/pride-on-the-mojave-news-analysis.html,To the millions of citizens who watched the space shuttle Columbia glide to its flawless landing today the newest space exploit was sweet vindication of American knowhow The automobile industry may be beset by Japanese competition and the military establishment may feel that Moscow has gained the advantage of momentum in the strategic arms race but the nifty twowheeled touchdown in the Mojave Desert provided a quick jubilant lift for a nation that has been suffering from technological selfdoubt After the shuttles many frustrating delays the successful flight was something to cheer about President Reagan caught that mood when he told the two Columbia astronauts Through you we all feel like giants again A Shot in the Arm This flight added H Guyford Stever chairman of the engineering assembly of the National Research Council proves that in spite of the ups and downs of international public opinion about our technological capabilities we know how to do some things very well Our technology isnt falling to bits Mr Stever said Our technology is strong and thats a shot in the arm In Washington Government planners calculate the spinoff benefits from the Columbia mission in terms of scientific exploration or military competition with the Soviet Union in space But to others a potentially more important impact is psychological even if it is only temporary No matter what its doing scientifically and technologically which is enormous the strongest impact of the space program is in the psychological arena observed Patrick Caddell the pollster who served former President Carter Its certainly going to help the public mood We havent done anything like this in quite a while This gives us very positive feelings But while other social scientists acknowledge the immediate sense of elation and achievement stirred by the missions broad publicity they contend that these effects will be fleeting The fervor will die down in a few days said Amitai Etzioni director of the Center for Policy Research here Our polling and interviews indicate that it is not a genuine deep emotion that has been tapped here  as the abortion issue does or the civil rights movement did in the 60s This is remote and not consequential to peoples lives Even with all the excitement generated by the pinnacle of public interest in American space achievements the landing on the moon in July 1969 Dr Etzioni and others saw no convincing evidence that the Apollo missions of that era had lasting impact on the nations mood perhaps because the bitterly divisive issue of Vietnam overwhelmed other concerns Nor did incumbent Presidents like Lyndon B Johnson or Richard M Nixon harvest significant political dividends from the space achievements then Now political scientists are doubtful that President Reagan will benefit greatly either for he merely happens to be in office when a project begun years ago has come to fruition The tangible message that Mr Reagan drew from the mission dealt more with the nations ability to compete with Moscow and with friendly Western nations Our friends and adversaries are reminded that we are a free people capable of great deeds he said to accolades from abroad Back to Practicalities But some others question how the obvious success of such highly specialized equipment as the Columbias computers instrumentation and propulsion components can have a practical effect on an economy hobbled by flagging productivity in many fields and a widespread public frustration with inflation It is a rather remarkable achievement Carl N Degler a social historian at Stanford University remarked But I think the whole space effort has waned as an achievement and become more commonplace and people wonder what impact it has on their daily lives Technology as an answer for revitalizing the American economy is not going to be affected by the achievement of Columbia Along with the shortterm alarm or euphoria that has greeted various Soviet and American space exploits there has been a national uncertainty toward space adventure since the dawning of the space era In 1957 Neil H McElroy who was Secretary of Defense under President Eisenhower dismissed the Soviet sputnik as merely a neat scientific trick though the nation was to be shocked into pouring money into scientific education in an effort to catch up Nuts to National Prestige Mr Eisenhower himself remarked after leaving office that anybody who would spend 40 billion in a race to the moon for national prestige is nuts But President Kennedy turned the moon race into the moral equivalent of war using it to rally the nations spirits and deliberately defining space as one of the principal vistas of his New Frontier We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things Mr Kennedy declared not because they are easy but because they are hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept one that we are unwilling to postpone and one which we intend to win Millions may feel a similar sense of pride and determination in the wake of the Columbias successful mission but political Washington is too hardheaded today about budget cuts and fighting inflation for any leader to sound a ringing echo of Mr Kennedys clarion call
PERSISTENT MYTHS ABOUT SEX EDUCATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/16/opinion/l-persistent-myths-about-sex-education-086362.html,To the Editor Concerning your March 18 on the mark editorial on sex education the presumption of the argument that is consistently propounded by the opponents of school sex education programs that the less teenagers know about sex the less likely they are to experiment with it is in light of the thorough research in the field of sex education in recent years quite mythical Current research has indicated quite consistently that those who participate in college sex education programs are not likely to increase the frequency or change the nature of their usual sexual behavior Other research also supports the view that accurate knowledge about human sexuality is associated with responsible sexual behavior Finally even though I believe that abortion has no place in the Christian community I never cease to wince at the logic of those who while they oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever at the same time oppose any and all sex education by either the parochial or the public schools as if there were not at least an indirect cause and effect relationship between the two These opponents of school programs in human sexual development offer that such matters should be left to parents who by their very vocation have the appropriate right and I would add the obligation also to educate their children in matters sexual There is myth contained in this statement also since it is well known through many a national poll that approximately 85 percent of all parents are unaskable by their children concerning sexual matters Msgr LEO A KELTY Director Family Life Bureau East Brunswick NJ March 24 1981
"JUST ANOTHER BUDGET DEADLINE, ALBANY SHRUGS",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/19/weekinreview/just-another-budget-deadline-albany-shrugs.html,The boundaries of delay already indistinct here seemed to dissolve completely last week as Governor Carey and Warren M Anderson the Senate Republican leader refused to yield on their respective plans for New Yorks fiscal future As a result today marks the states 20th day without a budget At issue is Mr Careys proposed sevenyear state takeover of local Medicaid costs The chief beneficiary of the Governors plan is New York City and the majority leader has been adamant in his refusal to grant aid to the Democrats stronghold for more than one year at a time Because of the impasse the entire budget has been held up This years budget delay is only the latest evidence that calendars no longer hold any dread in Albany It is the fourth consecutive year New Yorks budget has not been settled by April 1 the start of the fiscal year and lawmakers have discovered that failing to meet budget deadlines causes few problems immediately The 198182 budget was eight days overdue before anyone started to complain The first SOS came from hospitals and nursing homes in the city that had not received their Medicaid money and could not pay their workers Then the school districts complained that they had to borrow money on their own while waiting for a billion dollars in local assistance due them from the state Finally the legislators worried that they were going to miss their spring vacations and negotiations began to move on a spending and revenue plan for the new fiscal year But with Mr Carey and Mr Anderson still deadlocked the Legislature dispersed for Easter and Passover The lawmakers could leave town without taking action on the budget because no New York statute forces adoption of a budget  the law merely proscribes spending money without one The state treasury has been locked up since April 1 but the ship of state sails on Missing Deadlines Gets Easier Legislators missed the budget deadline in l978 when a battle over Medicaid funds for abortions resulted in a sixday delay in final passage Having breached one deadline with no untoward effects the Legislature passed the budget six days late again in 1979 after another abortion fund dispute The 198081 budget was 17 days late as the Legislature attempted unsuccessfully to override vetoes of some items Observed Lieut Gov Mario Cuomo You do it once its a shock you do it twice its not such a big shock you do it three times you think why didnt I do this before  In 1979 the lawmakers revived a daring gambit first tried in 1965 that made it even easier to be late with impunity  state workers were issued scrip an iou from the state to banks instead of their first paychecks in April The legislators waited for complaints but the state workers accepted the scrip and did not carry out a threatened strike In 1980 budget procrastination not only went unpunished but the Legislature actually found itself rewarded for its protracted dispute There was a twoweek delay in completing the annual spring borrowing and during that time interest rates plunged in a volatile credit market The state saved 50 million in interest charges as a result according to the State Comptrollers office The April 1 budget date is not the only Albany deadline that has faded to insignificance The 90day limit on legislative sessions and the necessity attached to passing a supplemental budget within a few weeks of the main budgets passage have been exposed as arbitrary Now sessions last until June and the supplemental budget is routinely delayed for months Assemblyman Arthur J Kremer chairman of the Ways and Means committee and a legislator for 16 years remembers when disrespect for deadlines was thought to have dire consequences It was a legend that the state would go into default if you did not make a budget by April 1 he said It was a legend that if you were paid scrip you couldnt cash it at the bank All these legends have faded away So have other old rules of thumb that used to shorten the budget negotiating season according to Mr Kremer They used to say you cant work on a weekend on a holy day  we worked on Palm Sunday last year There were at least 30 commandments for legislators now theyre all gone he said What Will the Public Think Although budget delays seemingly have had no ill effects on the fiscal health of the state Assemblyman Kremer worries about what the public might think It bothers me from a political image point of view he said Its bad for all parties if the Legislature looks like it is unable to get its act together The public doesnt punish legislators for it but it adds to the image of the public official being a bumbler With deadlines no longer a factor in speeding budget compromise legislators have looked to Governor Carey for leadership in expediting the process But the Governor has been loathe to negotiate until absolutely necessary hoping instead that the Legislature would adopt his budget in full and if not that Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink would serve as his agent in the hard bargaining with Senator Anderson Mr Fink however has recently been reluctant to take on that role The timing of the ultimate compromise seems to depend on what Mr Kremer calls outside factors These include the complaints of Assembly and Senate members waiting uselessly on the sidelines while their leaders negotiate and their vacations slip away the complaints of the school boards and nursing homes and the insistent voices of the chief underwriters anxious to get the states spring borrowing done Hopes of shortening the current session which is expected to last through June are regarded as almost nil The legislators half of whom have no other profession seem content to allow their work to go on into the summer At 55 a day in expenses and a 28000 a year salary many of them Mr Kremer observed are making more money than ever before in their lives
"AS CONGRESSMEN TAKE UP THE ABORTION ISSUE, TWO SIDES DEBATE: WHEN DOES LIFE BEGIN",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/19/weekinreview/as-congressmen-take-up-the-abortion-issue-two-sides-debate-when-does-life-begin.html,Eight years ago in the landmark Roe v Wade ruling the Supreme Court legalized abortion during the first stages of pregnancy Since then opponents have been seeking a way to undo that decision which was based on the womans right to privacy Since a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion seems unattainable abortion opponents have introduced a bill in Congress S 158 which declares that human life shall be deemed to exist from conception thus allowing states if they choose to prosecute abortion as murder The bill is based on a clause of the 14th Amendment that gives Congress the power to enforce the Amendments due process and equal protection guarantees Hearings on it begin this week The Week in Review asked Senator Orrin G Hatch a Utah Republican and abortion foe who heads the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Rhonda Copelon a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York and a proponent of legal abortions to discuss the merits of the bill and its implications Excerpts from their interviews with Robert Reinhold a Wasington reporter for The New York Times follow Senator Orrin Hatch Question Do you think that a Congressional statute is the proper approach to this issue Senator Hatch Well I continue to prefer a constitutional amendment to deal with the Roe v Wade decision I am not yet entirely comfortable with S158 the statutory approach but I do believe that a credible case can be made for it Im strongly committed to the right to life effort and the need in Congress to overturn Roe but I am equally committed to a sound constitutional approach Section 5 of the 14th Amendment however gives Congress the power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of the 14th Amendment S158 would make the Congressional finding that human life shall be deemed to exist from the point of conception without regard to race age health defect or condition of dependency It would make the further finding that a person for purposes of the due process guarantees of the 14th Amendment would include all human life Q Would it not be possible to nullify many Supreme Court decisions just by changing definitions of a word A If it is extended in a very broad sense it would permit legislative circumvention in some Supreme Court decisions But keep in mind that those on the other side of this issue didnt mind going around the 14th Amendment to have their issues resolved by Congress I frankly think its ironic that the liberals applauded decisions like Katzenbach v Morgan which struck down literacy tests in voting and Fullilove v Klutznick upholding affirmative action in racial hiring when they were handed down because they granted extensive powers to Congress Now those decisions are the law of the land and S158 is the conservative response Or should I say the familyoriented response to the liberals who want it both ways They want to be able to circumvent the 14th Amendment anytime they wish but when the familyoriented people who feel that abortion is an insidiously bad thing want to come out with S158 there is a hue and a cry that Oh my goodness you cant do this Now I think that whats sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander Clarifications and Compromises Q Would the law require states to punish a rape victim seeking an abortion as a murderer Or the druggist who sold her a morningafter pill as an accomplice A I think that is something that would have to be resolved afterwards Q Afterwards A After the passage of the bill assuming it passes Q Some people would argue that you shouldnt leave those kinds of loose ends A Well unfortunately the law always does leave loose ends because theres no way of absolutely determining how a particular law is going to be interpreted by any of the courts including the Supreme Court Weve always found some astounding decisions by the Supreme Court Q With the advances in biological sciences such as test tube conceptions weve blurred the point at which life starts Doesnt this law create a morass of questions about defining that point A No S158 would resolve that ambiguity It says that life begins at conception Q Would life include something created in a lab A That would have to be determined under this statute as it is written I presume that it probably would Q Youd determine that by interpretation A Yes Our committee intends to explore all of these questions Were willing to listen to experts in many areas however I dont know that even experts will resolve the question of when does life begin Q Do you personally believe the law should apply even to victims of rape and incest A I think we would have a much better chance of getting it through the Congress if those two exceptions were put in I personally prefer the constitutional amendment That makes no exception except to save the life of the mother But on the other hand lets face it the amendment to the Medicaid funding which was already on the books did provide for abortions to save the life of the mother and for rape or incest Those of us who believe in the sanctity of human life were not totally happy with that but we thought it was better than leaving it up to bureaucrats which human life can be taken and using federal dollars to have indiscriminate abortions all over America I believe we should do whatever we can to protect the sanctity of human life If thats as far as we can go then Id rather do that than not have any protection Q Doesnt this bill use the law to impose religious and moral views of one group on others A One does not have to hold any particular religious view to examine and make conclusions with respect to biological evidence on the beginning of life And as the Supreme Court noted in Harris v McCrae legislation relating to abortion is not necessarily in violation of the First Amendment simply because its consistent with the doctrines of some or all religions Q Some would argue that the sponsors of this bill are doing it mainly for the political purpose of satisfying the antiabortion forces A I know the sponsors of the bill and theyre very sincere and dedicated I think there is no such consideration Q The reason that this bill was introduced was that the sponsors did not get an amendment through What are the chances in your view of its passage A I think it has an excellent chance I believe that this is one of the great constitutional debates of this century The courts have said that its basically not a religious question To those who are antagonistic toward indiscriminate abortion it is in some respects a religious question and certainly a familyoriented question I think that this particular debate could resolve those issues by just making the simple determination of when life begins And if Congress has that power then S158 may be the way for those who are against abortion including myself to resolve this very volatile and difficult issue Rhonda Copelon Question Is a statute the proper way to deal with this issue Miss Copelon No The only way you can reverse Roe v Wade is through a Constitutional amendment But even a constitutional amendment would be a tragedy not only for women but for the country Q Nevertheless if the Congressional law were passed what would be its practical consequences A It would mean first of all that states could criminalize abortion if they wanted to And since the statute attempts to make an equation between a fetus and a person under the Constitution it would be at least permissible and possibly required to treat abortion as equal to homicide which includes murder and manslaughter A statute or an amendment would not as it proponents say simply return us to the situation before Roe Before that abortion was a minor form felony a separate crime The old laws had to do with the medical dangers of abortion The declaration of the fetus as a legal person has no no reference point in any constitution law common or statutory law Q What effects would you anticipate from the recriminalization of abortion A It would have a very significant impact on womens health not only because women would be forced to turn to dangerous illegal abortions but because doctors would be reluctant to provide care for medical complications of abortion or of miscarriage because of fear of investigation Certain kinds of birth control would be threatened and potentially outlawed Moreover criminalization would bring into play severe penalties not only for women but for those was assist them in getting abortions It would generate a surveillance and enforcement process which to succeed would have to intrude on the most intimate aspects of a persons life For example every miscarriage would have to be investigated Was it induced abortion or a spontaneous one Did it happen because the woman failed to provide maximum protection to the embryo QDo you believe the people pursing this bill would take it to such extremes A Yes One has to recognize that underlying the drive is a religiousmoral position When you enact a law at the behest of a of a religiously motivated movement you have the potential for the most extreme application A good example is Prohibition which started with an attack on public drunkenness and ended up making constitutionally illegal the most minimum form of alcoholized beer It ended up trying to impose a morality through a criminal statute which had been given the force of the Constitution That is a real danger Most of the people who want to treat abortion as a severe crime really want to see all abortions ferreted out Underlying Premises Q What is their motive in your view A I think the underlying motive is an attack on women on their right to selfdetermination which is at the core of being human and on their right to be sexual apart from procreation If there is no abortion every act of sex is an act of fear I also see it as a mechanism for excluding women from certain workplaces Q Why is that A We have just come out of a period in the last 10 years of thinking about women as fragile vessels during pregnancy A law declaring a fetus a person would imply that while you are pregnant your activities are subservient to the primary goal of insuring that pregnancy survives Working in a job that requires physical exertion could easily be seen as creating some risk to the fetus Q Do you recognize no rights of the fetus A Roe v Wade says that under the 14th Amendment the fetus is not a legal person entitle to claim civil rights for itself It also says that the question of when human life begins is a moral issue about which there are deep philosophical and theological differences Underpinning the Courts refusal in Roe to allow states to adopt a theory of life is the pluralistic premise that in our society peiple have the right to hold different beliefs and to live in accordance with those beliefs The law enforces a moral norm only when there is a consensus Q Wouldnt different states be able to interpret the law differently A The proponents of the bill want to call it a states rights approach But if they were able to sustain a declaration of fetal personhood in a statute they could try to enforce it in the states through individual lawsuits brought by people who style themselves as guardians of fetuses Also any public money for provision of abortion would surely be challenged For example in New York State which voluntarily funds abortions for the poor such funds could be stopped Q If the enforcement provision of the 14th Amendment can be used to enforce voting rights and affirmative action why cant it be used by abortion foes A The basic power of Congress under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment is to provide remedies for discrimination This bill is not an exercise of that power It is an exercise of a power that Congress does not have to reinterpret the Constitution Roe v Wade correctly said that under the 14th Amendment the word person does not apply to prenatal life They are now trying to redefine the word in the 14th Amendment If Congress can enact this law it could enact a law again which holds that equal means separate but equal It could use its power to reverse every Supreme Court decision that the current majority in Congress does not like Q If passed will such a law be struck down by the Supreme Court A I think it is such an unconstitutional statute and such a direct assault on the fundamental role of the Court that they would lose their role in our system if they sustained it On the other hand one has to take into account that the political pressures are very extreme Underlying this statute is an attempt to create a political confrontation between Congress and the courts to create a constitutional crisis
THE SUPREME LAW IS STILL THE CONSTITUTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/20/opinion/l-the-supreme-law-is-still-the-constitution-091961.html,To the Editor Although my colleague John Ely and I rarely agree on any constitutional issue the two of us recently explained our shared judgment that a proposed Congressional statute defining fetuses as persons from the moment of conception cannot overcome what the Supreme Court has held to be a womans right to end pregnancy before the fetus is viable OpEd March 17 Nothing short of a constitutional amendment can have that effect In their reply April 12 the authors of the proposed statute Senator Jesse Helms and Representative Henry Hyde claim to have found some very respectable constitutional arguments for the contrary view But they point to no recognized authority who agrees with them and I know of none Messrs Helms and Hyde make much of the Supreme Courts selfconfessed inability in its 1973 opinion on abortion to decide when human life begins But they omit to note the Courts conclusion just three pages later in the same opinion that no legislative resolution of that issue can override a womans right to choose They then quote from my treatise American Constitutional Law to the effect that Congress need not always accept the Supreme Courts view  of the Fourteenth Amendment p271 But they overlook my conclusion on the very next page that Congressional legislation whether grounded in legislative interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment  or in any other  grant of  power must be consistent with the Bill of Rights p272 Finally Messrs Helms and Hyde invite all who believe Congress cannot validly undo a constitutional right by mere statute to watch Congress begin this month to do just that Im reminded of the fellow who when asked if he believed in baptism replied Hell yes Ive seen it done With a majority in each House and a supportive President Congress can pass any law weve all seen it done But the supreme law of the land is still the Constitution and its enforcement is still entrusted to the Supreme Court LAURENCE H TRIBE Cambridge Mass April 14 1981
CBS STATION CHALLENGES ABC'S ''20 20'' ARSON REPORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/20/arts/cbs-station-challenges-abc-s-20-20-arson-report.html,The CBSowned television station in Chicago will present a onehour documentary tonight about investigative reporting that disputes a report on the ABCTV newsmagazine 2020 entitled Arson and Profit The program won an Emmy Award last week WBBMTV will broadcast its documentary Watching the Watchdog from 9 to 10 PM but it will not be shown nationally Nonetheless the program is certain to generate broad interest both because it represents a rare attempt by television to look critically at its own practices and because it puts a television news organization in the unusual role of questioning the credibility of a competitor The CBS national news organization had no role in preparing the WBBM documentary More than half of the documentary is devoted to the Arson and Profit segment which was produced by Peter Lance and reported by Geraldo Rivera ABC conducted its investigation in conjunction with the Better Government Association in Chicago a nonprofit consumer watchdog group that frequently works with the news organizations investigating government corruption Central Conclusion Doubted The most serious accusation is that the central conclusion of ABCs arson investigation was wrong The ABC report charged that a small group of Chicago realestate speculators had conspired to set fire to a series of rundown buildings in Chicago trading ownership among themselves and then profiting from insurance payouts after the buildings were destroyed To refute those findings the WBBM documentary cites evidence produced by Charles Roberts the Chicago landlord accused by 2020 of having masterminding the arson scheme Mr Roberts provides documents for WBBM showing that he had already sold at least three of the buildings that ABC alleges he had a role in having burned down Therefore WBBM concludes Mr Roberts did not stand to gain from insurance payments as 2020 had charged In response Peter Lance producer of the Arson and Profit segment said this weekend that 2020 and the Better Government Association had evidence in two of the three cases cited on the documentary that Mr Roberts and his associates actually did stand to gain from insurance payments even if their names were not listed as owners In one of the building a fire at the Ellis Hotel in 1979 Mr Lance said that Mr Roberts had recently given a sworn statement to a lawyer for the Better Government Association acknowledging that although his name was not on the title of the Ellis Hotel as its owner he did receive insurance payments after it burned Involved in a Suit Mr Roberts and several of those named in the 2020 report are suing ABC for libel ABC has stood by the accuracy of its findings Mr Lance was asked by WBBM to appear on its telecast to respond but he declined The WBBM documentary which was reported by Bill Kurtis and produced by Scott Craig is critical also of the investigative techniques used on the 2020 arson segment including undercover reporting alleged entrapment and the socalled ambush interview In particular the documentary suggests that an ambush interview in Arson for Profit  in which Mr Roberts was approached without warning on the street by Mr Rivera and a camera crew  gave viewers the impression that Mr Roberts was guilty and also prevented him from having a genuine opportunity to produce evidence that might prove his innocence The ambush interview the documentary argues is a technique that serves no journalistic purpose and may even get in the way of eliciting the truth What it reflects instead the documentary says is televisions need for the sort of dramatic visual images that are not possible when interviews are conducted on the phone or even across a desk Interview Is Defended Mr Lance responded this weekend that the real reason for confronting Mr Roberts on the street was that 2020 did not want to give him a chance to consult with his associates before answering Mr Lance also contended that after Mr Riveras brief confrontation interview with Mr Roberts in the street three further telephone calls were made to him seeking a fuller response to the charges that he was involved in an arsonforprofit ring The approach of the WBBM documentary is itself bound to create controversy The program focuses almost entirely on rival news organizations and indeed the ambush interview came to prominence as an investigative technique on CBSs own 60 Minutes The latter half of the documentary deals briefly with a 60 Minutes investigation into Medicaid fraud also done in conjunction with the Better Government Association raising the issue of the ethics of undercover reporting and masquerading The documentary explores those issues as well as the right to privacy through a third Better Government Association investigation this one into abortion clincs which was done in association with The Chicago SunTimes The documentary also explores the investigative practices of its own news department but only in the last several of minutes of the program Brief mention is made of the fact that WBBM employs many of the techniques that are criticized in its documentary  including the ambush interview Ironically perhaps the debate over the accuracy of the charges that WBBM makes against ABC and other organizations may divert attention from the central issue the documentary raises the techniques of investigative reporting on television

POLL FINDS MANY YOUNG CATHOLICS WHO OPPOSE DOGMA ATTEND MASS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/22/nyregion/poll-finds-many-young-catholics-who-oppose-dogma-attend-mass.html,While young Roman Catholics have rejected the church as a moral teacher about 41 percent attend mass at least twice a month feel close to God and pray quite often according to a report delivered at a convention of the National Catholic Education Association in New York City yesterday Although most of the young Catholics polled by the National Opinion Research Center in Chicago opposed the church on several issues they still considered themselves Catholics Dr William C McCready who conducted the research told the convention The survey polled 2170 randomly selected young Catholics from the United States and Canada and was sponsored by the Knights of Columbus a Catholic organization for laymen Young Catholics have what Dr McCready termed a relaxed attitude toward the institutional church and a full 25 percent of them attend mass once a year or less and still think of themselves as Catholics But 26 percent said they had read a spiritual book recently and 20 percent said they had been involved in a religious discussion group Doctrine Not Fully Accepted A Catholic education does not guarantee full acceptance of church doctrine the study revealed Threequarters of those polled did not agree that the Pope was infallible on matters of faith and morals The church teaching against artificial birth control was rejected by 95 percent of the respondents About 90 percent did not agree that divorced persons should not remarry and only 17 percent of the young adults felt that premarital sexual relations were almost always wrong or always wrong These moral views were held equally strongly among the devout and the less devout the researcher reported The majority of young Catholic adults accepted the Churchs view on only two of the issues about which we inquired Dr McCready said On these he said most agreed that homosexual relations were wrong and that abortion on demand was wrong He did not report on the percentages of young people holding those views On Life After Death The strongest expresion of agreement with church teaching was regarding life after death with 64 percent affirming church teaching Ten percent do not believe in life after death and others are uncertain Dr McCready stated A Catholic education plays a crucial role in bringing young adults to a religious turning point usually in their late 20s Dr McCready told the convention of more than 15000 Catholic educators and administrators Religious practice and a general feeling of wellbeing declines sharply after the teenage years and then rebounds he explained A person who has attended Catholic schools rebounds more quickly he said In another session of the convention which is being held at the New York Hilton Hotel and the Sheraton Centre Dr Francis J Lodato a psychologist told educators who worked in Catholic schools that they like their colleagues in public schools must begin giving more thought to the needs and special circumstances of children from oneparent families These children have been identified but we have not developed sufficient programs to minister to them Dr Lodato said adding that a survival curriculum is necessary to cope with todays family problems
BILL TO BAN ABORTIONS IS ASSAILED BY SCHOLARS AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/22/us/bill-to-ban-abortions-is-assailed-by-scholars-as-unconstitutional.html,Eleven constitutional scholars including several prominent conservatives as well as liberals today denounced as unconstitutional proposed legislation designed to ban abortion In a letter to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee the scholars said that the legislation which in effect would overrule the Supreme Courts interpretation of the 14th Amendment was both an attempt to exercise unconstitutional power and a dangerous circumvention of the avenues that the Constitution itself provides for reversing Supreme Court interpretations of the Constitution The Supreme Court declared in 1973 that women have constitutional rights under the 14th Amendment to abort fetuses in a decision that has been criticized as incorrect by some of the scholars who signed todays letter The letter indicated that this decision could be legally overruled and abortions legally banned by a constitutional amendment but not by an act of Congress Reagan View Challenged It thus implicitly challenged comments by President Reagan at a news conference in March The President spoke favorably of a bill proposed by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina and Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois that would declare that the life of a fetus is entitled to the protection that the 14th Amendment extends to all persons If such a bill was enacted Mr Reagan said there would be no need for a constitutional amendment banning abortion because the Constitution already protects the right of human life The HelmsHyde proposal would also deprive the lower Federal courts but not the Supreme Court of power to review the constitutionality of state and local abortion laws Those signing the letter opposing the HelmsHyde bill were Philip Kurland University of Chicago Law School professor one of the nations most prominent conservative constitutional scholars Charles Alan Wright University of Texas Law School professor who served President Nixon for a time as counsel in the Watergate investigation Harry H Wellington dean of Yale Law School Erwin N Griswold dean of Harvard Law School a former Solicitor General Paul Freund Harvard law professor Laurence H Tribe Harvard law professor John Hart Ely Harvard law professor Telford Taylor Benjamin Cardozo School of Law professor at Yeshiva University who was chief prosecutor at the Nuremburg war crimes trials William Van Alstyne Duke Law School professor Louis Henkin Columbia Law School professor Louis Schwartz University of Pennsylvania Law School professor

DETERMINING WHEN LIFE BEGINS AND ABORTIONS STOP,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/23/us/determining-when-life-begins-and-abortions-stop.html,Nine years after the Supreme Court ruled that women have a constitutional right to an abortion in at least the first three months of pregnancy a highly emotional Congressional battle is shaping up over efforts to bypass the Courts decision The issue one that explores moral religious and social values is perhaps the most passionate and intensely felt issue in politics today emerging on Capitol Hill just behind the Reagan Administrations economic package as a matter of prime importance Fueling the debate is a powerful movement with as many as 10 million followers that successfully designated several legislators for defeat last fall That movement has also promoted a swing toward conservatism in Congress bringing in antiabortion Senators and placing some in positions of influence such as Senator John P East now in charge of the Judiciary subcommittee overseeing the abortion issue Beyond this President Reagans stance against abortion coupled with his appointment of likeminded supporters to key jobs in the Department of Health and Human Services has plainly buoyed antiabortion activists preparing for the opening round of battles in the next two weeks Hearings Start Tomorrow Tomorrow and Friday the subcommittee headed by Senator East will hold hearings on the problematic question of when human life begins to exist a question that the Supreme Court has been unable to resolve On May 4 and 6 Senator East will hold hearings on a bill proposed by Senator Jesse Helms a fellow Republican from North Carolina and Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois that would effectively bar all legal abortions The bill says For the purpose of enforcing the obligation of the states under the 14th Amendment not to deprive persons of life without due process of law human life shall be deemed to exist from conception The bill would mean that the aborting of a fetal life could be defined as murder thereby making the woman and doctor involved subject to criminal prosecution The bill does not address exceptions for rape incest or situations that threaten the life of the woman According to some womens groups the legislation carried to extremes could also make illegal any birthcontrol method that is believed to act after conception perhaps including the intrauterine device What were now facing is an allout attack not only on abortion but on birth control said Eleanor Smeal president of the 125000member National Organization for Women People are shocked Its going way beyond the abortion issue But Mr Hyde is confident of success We now have the votes he said The Background Despite opposition from the Roman Catholic Church and various political factions the nations courts have made decisions over the past 40 years that extensively altered the realm of birth control A pivotal decision came in 1937 with a Federal court ruling that laws forbidding doctors to dispense birth control information or devices were unconstitutional In its landmark 1973 decision Roe v Wade the Supreme Court held 7 to 2 that a womans right to privacy barred the Government from intruding on her right to choose abortion Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun speaking for the majority said the Court had been unable to determine when life begins When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine philosophy and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus he wrote the judiciary at this point in the development of mans knowledge is not in a position to speculate as to the answer The decision was bitterly attacked by some legal scholars as well as prolife advocates who undertook an ambitious effort to overturn legalized abortion on the ground that it was tantamount to murder After the Courts decision the number of legally performed abortions rose dramatically 15 million were performed last year according to published reports An Attempt to Circumvent Although prolife adherents have sought since 1973 to marshal support for a constitutional amendment that would reverse the Courts ruling Mr Hyde Mr Helms and others maintain that a legislative bill to circumvent the Court is far more likely to succeed A constitutional amendment must be approved by a twothirds vote of the House and the Senate and then ratified by 38 state legislatures while a bill needs only a simple majority in the House and the Senate and then the signature of the President At one level the central question in the forthcoming debate  when does life begin or when does a collection of cells constitute a human being seems unresolvable and blurred Some biologists believe that fertilization marks the start of life while others argue that human life begins about a week or so later after the fertilized egg has traveled through the Fallopian tube and implanted itself in the wall of the uterus At the political level the questions seem intractable For the Legislation Representative Hyde has said that defining when life begins is the sort of question Congress is competent to answer adding The fetus is human life It ought to be accorded equal dignity with the snail darter and sperm whale The major architect of the legislative proposal is Stephen H Galebach a lawyer with the Washington firm of Covington  Burling In an article in Human Life Review an antiabortion publication he defended the proposal as a legitimate exercise in Congressional authority arguing that the Supreme Courts inability to decide when life begins leaves a void to be filled by Congress The 14th Amendment which prohibits states from depriving a person of life without due process of law logically extends to unborn children he said Citing previous Supreme Court cases on Congressional authority Mr Galebach also asserted In order to define the unborn as persons Congress need only find a likelihood that life begins at conception Against the Legislation The question of when life begins is an ethical and religious matter left to wholly different interpretations said Faye Wattleton president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America Its inappropriate of Congress to make any kind of determination Of course the basic question here is Does a woman have a right to choose  Several legal experts including Laurence H Tribe of Harvard University argue that the legislation is unconstitutional and that allowing Congress to determine when life begins as related to the 14th Amendment would set a damaging precedent They contend that a constitutional amendment is the only way to make such a determination Even the ranking legal adviser to the United States Catholic Conference a bishops organization that recently reaffirmed support for a constitutional amendment says that it is utterly unrealistic to believe that the Court would uphold a measure in which Congress declares a fetus to be a person from the moment of conception Wilfred Caron the conferences general counsel said that the legislation would substitute Congresss judgment for the Courts and restrict the Courts right to interpret the Constitution The Outlook Miss Wattleton and other opponents of the legislation say they are very optimistic that the ambitious lobbying of prolife groups will be outweighed by opinion polls indicating a majority belief that abortion should remain legal in all or some circumstances Foes of the legislation also note that in the past Congress has been hesitant to tamper with Federal court jurisdiction on this and other matters And Howard H Baker Jr the Senate majority leader has suggested that debate on what he termed the emotional issues of abortion and school prayer would be postponed until next year Nonetheless supporters of the legislation are convinced that the conservative sweep in last years national elections as well as President Reagans support will enact the HelmsHyde measure Its the perfect moment for our prolife bill Mr Hyde said

SENATE BEGINS HEARINGS ON BILL TO OUTLAW ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/24/us/senate-begins-hearings-on-bill-to-outlaw-abortions.html,Senate conservatives opened their drive to outlaw abortions today as five doctors appeared on Capitol Hill and testified that human life begins at conception The hearings convened by Senator John P East Republican of North Carolina were interrupted by two brief demonstrations by supporters of the right to abortion and statements of protest were distributed by such groups as the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology the American Civil Liberties Union and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America Senator East a conservative who is a strong foe of abortion said at the opening of the hearing that the statute under consideration was designed to vitiate negate a 1973 Supreme Court ruling that gave women a constitutional right to an abortion The statute is sponsored by Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois and Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina Were fully aware of the importance of this issue said Senator East whose Senate Judiciary subcommittee has been riven with conflict over the twoday hearings Two Democrats Miss Hearing The two Democrats who are the minority members of the committee Senator Max Baucus of Montana and Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama did not appear at todays hearing Senator Baucus said in a letter to Senator East that he was disappointed that Mr East had barred the Democratic counsel from questioning witnesses and had refused to schedule witnesses selected by the Democrats Senator East has said that he wants to hold fair hearings and has indicated he may seek a variety of witnesses later In addition a key Republican on the panel Senator Orrin G Hatch of Utah a conservative who opposes abortion questioned the constitutionality of the HelmsHyde measure Does Congress have the authority under the 14th Amendment he asked At issue is legislation that seeks to redefine human life as starting from conception thus giving the unborn constitutional protection under the 14th Amendment which obliges the states to guarantee due process of law The practical effect of the bill would be to make abortion the equivalent of murder and subject women and doctors to prosecution under state criminal laws Mr Hyde has conceded that opponents of abortion are now seeking a backdoor approach to overturning the 1973 Supreme Court ruling Previous efforts have focused on a constitutional amendment to bar abortions which has been difficult to pass because it must be approved by a twothirds vote in each house of Congress and then ratified by 38 state legislatures A bill on the other hand needs only to pass by a simple majority of each chamber and can be enforced after the President signs it Five Doctors Who Testified The five doctors invited by Senator East to appear today were Dr Jerome Lejeune professor of fundamental genetics at the University of Rene Descartes in Paris Prof Hymie Gordon chairman of the Department of Medical Genetics at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn Dr Micheline MatthewsRoth a research associate at the Harvard University Medical School Dr Watson Bowes professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and Dr McCarthy DeMere a plastic surgeon and lawyer from Memphis Tenn The question of when human life begins is an established fact said Dr Gordon All life including human life begins at the moment of conception Dr Lejeune compared the fertilized egg to the fairy tale character Tom Thumb as well as to an astronaut He said an 11week old fetus plays so to speak on a trampoline adding He pushes on the wall soars up and falls down again Only astronauts in their gravityfree state can achieve such gentleness of motion Dr MatthewsRoth said It is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception when egg and sperm join to form the zygote and that this developing human always is a member of our species in all stages of life A Packed Hearing Room The session in one of the largest hearing rooms on Capitol Hill was crammed with both supporters and opponents of abortion Twice in the two hours of hearings three women jumped atop their chairs unfurled banners and shouted A womans life is a human life Stop the hearings Two women who said they were members of the Womens Liberation Zap Action Brigade were arrested on charges of disrupting a meeting of Congress There were sharp reactions to the hearings from several organizations The Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights which includes about 40 groups said it was absolutely ludicrous that the Congress believes that it can now discern from two brief hearings what the wisest minds in all history have not been able to resolve And the Planned Parenthood Federation said By focusing narrowly on the medical question by assembling witnesses who are wellknown for their hostility to abortion and by holding until the last minute invitations to any parties likely to introduce conflicting opinion into the hearings the subcommittees leadership and staff have tipped their hand

IN THE NATION; COURT-STRIPPING,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/24/opinion/in-the-nation-court-stripping.html,The only way to amend the Constitution is by a twothirds vote of each house of Congress and the approval of threequarters of the states Right Not if any of 22 bills introduced in Congress this year becomes law they would make effective constitutional change possible by a mere majority vote of each house plus the Presidents signature The power to interpret the Constitution and to enforce constitutional rights rests with the Supreme Court Right Not if any of those bills become law since they would remove the Supreme Courts jurisdiction and give Congress and the state courts the power to say what the Constitution means in numerous areas Senator Jesse Helms Representative Philip Crane Representative John Ashbrook and Senator Orrin Hatch are conservatives Right Not on the evidence of these 22 bills of which they are prime sponsors The measures many of them duplicative propose to eliminate the Supreme Courts jurisdiction in five general areas  prayer in the schools abortion school busing a malesonly draft and state court rulings This is not conservatism but a radical departure from the constitutional and legislative precedents of 200 years Congress would strip power from one of the equal branches of the Federal Government and take it for itself And that would reflect an unconservative triumph of temporary political attitudes over established procedures  including that of amending the Constitution No such naked attack on one branch of Government by another has been launched since President Roosevelts Courtpacking plan of 1937 The Courtstripping plan of the Mssrs Helms Crane et al actually goes further Eliminating the Supreme Courts jurisdiction over whole classes of cases would mean that the Court could not even enforce rulings already made in those areas Thus Courtstripping would work retroactively not just on future cases This is not an idle threat No one should discount Jesse Helmss power Even in the last Congress the Senate passed his stripping bill on school prayer it missed coming to the House floor by only 32 votes on a petition to discharge it from the Judiciary Committee In the new more conservative Congress and with the tacit support  so far at least  of President Reagan that particular bills chances of passage are ominous So probably are those of stripping bills on school busing and abortion But wont the Supreme Court itself declare such measures unconstitutional Probably but if by the time they reach the Court Mr Reagan has appointed one or two new conservative justices who can tell And in the meantime severe damage could be done to what people have thought were constitutional rights Courtstrippers make a constitutional argument of sorts based on Article III Section 2 which makes Supreme Court jurisdiction subject to such exceptions  as the Congress shall make They say the framers adopted this language precisely for situations where the Court might have usurped power or misinterpreted the Constitution If so nobody explained that intention in the Federalist papers or other writings of the time Most constitutionalists including many conservatives believe the provision was intended for lesser housekeeping purposes and deny that it gives Congress authority to prevent the Court from making constitutional interpretations Representative Robert Kastenmeier of the House Judiciary Committee points out that to do so would make members of Congress the sole judges of what the Constitution is And former Solicitor General Robert Bork of the Yale Law School says the exceptions clause would have been an odd way for the framers to have provided for Congressional revision of Court decisions since it would create chaos It would do so by leaving state court decisions on constitutional matters unreviewed by the Supreme Court Thus if the states ruled variously on say abortion American citizens in one state could have constitutional rights not enforced in another And any time Congress didnt like Supreme Court rulings in some area  on gun legislation for example  it could strip the Court of jurisdiction in that field In fact of course the motivation for Courtstripping is political not constitutional Strippers like Mr Helms and Mr Crane want to prohibit abortion and school busing and overturn a 17yearold ruling of the Court on school prayer But they fear they do not have the votes to pass a constitutional amendment on any of those issues So they are attempting to muscle their way through a back door Congress has never before been willing to open  not when the same disingenuous arguments were made for Courtstripping during the era of McCarthyism or when they were put forward after the landmark school desegregation case of 1954 True conservatives should be first among those opposed to this radical power grab

A CITY SCHOOL ON THE UPBEAT SIDE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/26/education/a-city-school-on-the-upbeat-side.html,A BIG furry tarantula named Milady de Winter sits on the desk of the assistant principal for biology at Benjamin N Cardozo Jr High School in Bayside Queens All around this departmental mascot individual students are doing original research into algae milkweed bugs the poisonous secrets of mushrooms and other explorable territory Theres a coffee corner offering refrigerator lunchstorage privileges for the 35member lab squad that works out its schoolservice credits there The accelerated class that combines firstyear biology and chemistry cooked breakfast together on a recent morning And the enthusiastic interchange between its students and teachers often goes on long after the school is ended In a day when the public visualizes the nations urban high schools as the center of all forms of teenage turbulence and where little learning takes place Cardozo opened in 1967 as a neighborhood high school is establishing an enviable tradition of achievement It manages this in a racially integrated setting and with no special selection of academically superior students Out of 600 graduates last June the school not far from the Nassau County line in northern Queens had 81 New York State Regents scholarship winners the highest percentage of any public high school in the county and a superior ranking in the city This years senior class has three National Merit Scholars the number has gone as high as five and 20 commended scholars in the same national competition Last years class of graduates now has a score of members attending Ivy League schools and more who were accepted 70 or so at branches of the State University 146 in the City Universitys fouryear colleges 139 in its community colleges and others scattered from the University of Virginia to the University of Michigan On a science bulletin board is a message from Debbie Green of Jamaica now a Harvard freshman She is among the nearly 85 percent of Cardozos graduates who go on for further education  60 percent of the class to fouryear colleges Cardozo was excellent preparation for college she commented I knew what was expected  a lot of reading And compared to my biology research course at Cardozo my labs here are really easy A similarly tough math research program which in 1974 replaced the math team found in many high schools investigates the theories of numbers and of groups combinatorics and other problems not often studied at that level In the physics department theoretical astronomy is a new course this year Cardozos strengths in science and mathematics have drawn the most attention partly because of several winners and a consistent record of finalists in such competitions as the Westinghouse Science Talent Search and the nationwide examination of the American Mathematical Association In 1972 Nina F Tabachnik of Bayside became the first woman since the national talent search began in 1942 to win the 10000 Westinghouse firstprize scholarship After attending Yale and Rockefeller Universities she is completing her pediatric internship in Boston Cardozo students from Bayside took seventh place for three consecutive years starting in 1978 and Michael R Candan a senior from Bayside was a Westinghouse finalist this year Cardozos English and social studies departments although there are no such showcases for them are also described as very strong by city and Queens school officials Besides a number of honors programs the schools advancedplacement classes currently include 50 students in English 28 in American history 100 in calculus 20 in chemistry 20 in accounting and 20 or 30 each in French and Spanish It also has prelaw studies for juniors and seniors  a joint program of the social studies and business administration departments The schools arrangements with nearby Queensborough Community College and Queens College provide advanced or additional courses in foreign languages as well as other studies Cardozo is situated in a fairly affluent middleclass zone that includes the southern part of Bayside Little Neck Douglaston and Douglaston Manor But because of legal rulings on school desegregation in southeast Queens Cardozo also accepts students from the Jamaica area St Albans Hollis Queens Village Cambria Heights and Springfield Gardens The student body has shrunk however from a peak of 3800 in the early 1970s  attending in shifts  to just over 2400 mostly because of the declining school population in northern Queens About 40 to 45 percent minority are minorities 38 percent black plus a few hundred who are Hispanic or Oriental mostly Chinese One root of Cardozos success school officials say is that the majority of its students are from middleclass backgrounds and superior middle and junior high schools We have a large number of middleclass black students whove been in integrated schools in the Bayside area since the early grades said Joseph E Rottino coordinator of student affairs For a neighborhood academic high school were probably low in our number of remedial classes  most dont come to us with overwhelming academic handicaps Cardozo has one class in English as a second language about 350 students in remedial reading classes and 160 in remedial math with some in both 150 in verbalskill courses that emphasize writing and a similar number in math upgrading courses The school looks for gifted children especially in science and math For example Morton S Roggen assistant principal for biology takes advanced students who are also involved in school life to talk about Cardozo at its feeder junior highs and sends out personal letters to promising eighthgraders all over the area In class here the individual teacher is a talent scout  you recognize it when a student raises his performance and achieves a certain maturity level he said Some who earlier may have done only medium well become highly motivated  then we must be ready with new challenges This midyear Andre Glenn a junior from Springfield Gardens who had four terms of laboratory biology expressed more interest in mathematics and computer theory Now he is among the students for whom Mr Roggen and Carl Goodman assistant principal for mathematics are seeking summer programs and internships But Mr Roggen said our school caters to all kinds The threeyear dance program notable for its balance of sexes and ethnic groups offers ballet modern and jazz dance Fifty students make up its performing dance troupe with 120 more in preparatory classes Two choruses include 400 to 500 students And Sing an annual show and interclass competition that is produced and choreographed by the students involves 600 dancers and musicians You can learn to play any orchestral instrument in this school said Mr Roggen who doubles as chairman of the music department They told us right from the beginning said Andrea Nagel of Bayside that they want everybody to experience everything in the school Beyond the basic eightperiod day six courses five of them majors plus gym and lunch  many students take seven courses and some in special programs take eight Joan Nunke assistant principal for physical and health education said problems of budget cuts and a faculty reduced to 114  only seven of them black  had meant fewer electives than either the school or its students would like Home economics for example was lost entirely although family and health courses continue and it is unclear whether the school will be able to muster a blueprint class for its industrial arts division But we keep upgrading and updating the curriculum offering variety trying to make sure there is something to keep everybody interested Miss Nunke said The idea is to provide a broad program of possibilities motivating students at all levels to perform at full potential In a recent unit in senior English students studied Platos Dialogues Aldous Huxleys Brave New World and a new book on the Libertarian Party and neoconservatism They were then assigned a 25 to 30page paper to take apart a single concept  abortion capital punishment the draft gun control equal rights legal drinking ages  using Socratic dialogue and with evidence from the three different books answer the questions To what extent does government control man What is mans relationship to government A frequent comment from Cardozo students was that most of their teachers really care if you learn When youre working up to a diploma they dont let you get away with anything  they hold you right to their expections as well as the requirements said Joe Labozzetta a junior from Bayside He said that while Cardozo was his first New York City high school the Nassau County high school he had come from was a playground compared to the strictness here Students and faculty members alike regard Cardozos fully packed bundle of extracurricular and sports programs as a major factor in making the school work Clubs and activities  as well as the intensive and advanced programs in most departments  create intimate and committed schoolhours communities in a diverse student body To be sure there is a crowd of classcutters who habitually hang out around Cardozos periphery some smoking marijuana or drinking beer and many so alienated that they explain they just cant get interested in the realities of classrooms homework or even activities Enough cutting can result in a flunk and if that does not produce results the student is referred to one of Cardozos three guidance counselors The school also has three three advisers on college planning If an underachiever wants to seek out help theres always someone there said Yvette Scarlett of Cambria Heights the senior class secretary And Mr Bert Silverman in the guidance office is like a surrogate father  even those who hang around outside respect him He gets to them Teachers and students agree that the school which has a strong and thoroughly integrated student government has had no racial incident of group dimensions in several years Both teachers and students also expressed complete confidence in their safety Black and white kids enjoy teasing each other but weve pulled away from the realistic thing of fighting said Rocco Agostino a junior from Bayside We sort of yield toward each other No one bothers each other anyway said Robert Dockeray  a freshman from St Albans who was attracted by the prelaw program and is a member of the Key Club a communityservice group But when students get really involved in the departments or activities there doesnt seem to be any tension at all  you just work together If you want to try its all really here said Diane Ippolito a senior member of the Key Club Everything is provided for you to do well
SURVIVING IN AFRICA,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/26/books/surviving-in-africa.html,MARY LACEY By Maureen Connell 277 pp New York Harper  Row 1195 IN a rare moment of simplification John Berryman once wrote O really I dont care where I live or have lived Wherever I am  my wits about me memory blazing Ill cope and make do So saying he denied the pervasive pain of exile which for so many is a sort of orphaning of the soul a separation of first sensuous memory from conscious life ever after Maureen Connell in her first novel Mary Lacey faces the pain foursquare In fact her character is twice orphaned first literally then by the loss of her motherland when she impetuously decides to leave her native Kenya at the time of the Mau Mau uprisings Convinced that she can find her own way in London because in the words her mother taught her good looks are a help providing you dont speak with a funny accent she makes the leap to England and cripples herself landing Mary Lacey twice maimed is chronically insecure despite her models looks She has had a threadbare past with only a rigid grandmother to guard her welfare an older brother to idolize a Catholic boarding school to make her feel inadequate in family and fortune a religion to chastise her for every undisciplined impulse no comfort but a Kikuyu ayah Miriamu to love across the intractable distance that separates black and white When she learns in London that Miriamu has been massacred by fellow Kikuyu  the realities of tribal warfare are complex Mary thinks she can put her past behind her She moves onto what she assumes will be sure footing by marrying a typically dashing and unrelievedly uninteresting upperclass Englishman who has limited sympathy for his wifes loneliness in exile because he cant begin to comprehend it He begins to philander casually and distracted tries to comfort his wife without appreciating the depth of her anxieties Marys brother Elliott her one love also suffers but differently All he wants is a farm in Kenya which he is doomed never to have through a combination of personal and political bad fortune He is a clumsy and foolish but endearing eccentric and at least for the reader he is infinitely more engaging than Marys presentable husband Elliott and Mary not typical colonials are sympathetic to Kenyatta Nonetheless Elliott admits that although sometimes I know the white mans finished in Kenya  I start dreaming and thinking Im living back in the nineteen hundreds  I have these long conversations with a Home Office wallah about a government loan the acres Ill farm  Mary is a starved selfhating woman and she understandably confuses the voraciousness of her appetite for husband and child with her desires for more restorative nourishment By the novels end she has undergone shock treatment for a welldescribed case of depression and isolation that reaches an extreme when her husband manages to visit her beloved Kenya without her she suffers through desperate drinking a vengeful affair an abortion and the wrenching loss of someone in Kenya whose death she feels responsible for because in a moment of drunken inattention she ignored an intuition of danger She has begun to shake herself free of the primitive Catholicism that has been for her like another addiction never joyful never intellectually demanding only punishing And in loosing the hold of Catholicism she frees herself as well from her terror of the Kikuyu god Ngai who has held secret sway in her mind since she was a child in the shadow of her godfearing ayah At the novels end drawn back to Kenyan soil in the wake of that death and close to the source of her pain Mary promises to begin if only by default her adjustment to the world as it is She has felt  has owned her grief Yet she remains passive in her life which is built on the shaky foundation of her husbands fidelity When we last see her Mary is still waging bitter battles with her husband and she is still the unredeemed and sorrowful convent orphan who learned never to let them know whats going on inside Ill make myself forget  Ill go to sleep for fifteen years and when I wake up there will be a husband and a grownup family An instant later when Mary stretches her arms toward her husband it is hard to know whether the author wants us to see her as a woman doomed to selfdelusion or only tired of combat resigned Even less satisfying is the inconclusiveness of her visit to Kenya Marys yearning for Africa has been her refuge and her burden Yet oddly her return does not seem to change her emotionally to relieve or disappoint her nor does she seem to see Africa changed in the light of her experiences abroad Her desperation seems to have overwhelmed even the solace of home Mary Lacey is an earnest novel that pays much too rapt and repetitive attention to every detail of its heroines psychic fall and potential resurrection It is written with conviction in a direct unmetaphoric prose that at its best works by accretion The exotic particulars of Kenyan life are wonderfully rendered  a gate eaten away by white ants baboons stealing cobs from the maize fields bats and mango worms glittering coffee berries a hyrax screaming across the convent playing fields Mrs Connells fascination with sensual nuance carries over to more prosaic London too Marys return to consciousness after the birth of her baby brings her up to the smell of narcissus and disinfectant The study of her aristocratic motherinlaw in whose presence Mary feels as lovely and as welcome as a picked scab is all damask curtains falling in faded beige folds across the mullioned windows Thus we have the opposition of two palpable worlds that reflects the conflict of Mary Laceys life But the elaboration of that contrast is not quite rich enough in idea or variation for the length of the novel What is excessive in it feels like autobiographical impulse surrendered to rather than resisted On the other hand that same apparently autobiographical source accounts for the passionate accuracy of those details It will take another book to assure us that Maureen Connell is a novelist not a memoirist Nonetheless Mary Lacey may be enjoyed for what it captures of vestigial colonial life  the spectacle of the notquiteBritish soul in an extravagant landscape  and of the undiminished pain of a grown child in search of her portion of lost love
REAGAN'S FIRST 100 DAYS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/26/magazine/reagan-s-first-100-days.html,Steven R Weisman is a White House correspondent for The New York Times By Steven R Weisman n a mild winter morning nearly 100 days ago Ronald Reagan took his oath of office as the American hostages in Iran took an Algerian jet to freedom Mr Reagans smooth insistent voice summoning Americans to a new beginning has since had to compete with such intrusions as the crackling barrage of a wouldbe assassins bullets the disturbing staccato of terrorism in El Salvador the rumble of Soviet troops maneuvering near Poland and the lesser static of quarreling among his Cabinet and staff But none of these distractions has weakened the new Presidents resolve to propel the Government into the greatest change of direction in half a century With a gift for political theater Mr Reagan has established his goals faster communicated a greater sense of economic urgency and come forward with more comprehensive proposals than any new President since the first 100 days of Franklin D Roosevelt the hero of his youth and the man whose record of achieving social change Mr Reagan seeks to emulate  albeit at the opposite end of the political spectrum In Rooseveltian fashion Mr Reagan has commanded the attention of the public the Congress and Americas allies and adversaries He has skillfully courted new and old friends kept Democrats and liberals on the defensive and maintained a friendly posture even to those who like labor leaders and blacks regard his program as anathema And perhaps by luck he has managed to avoid the serious blunders of many predecessors Before the end of their first 100 days after all John F Kennedy had the Bay of Pigs and Jimmy Carter had already alienated his Congressional allies and had been dramatically rebuffed by the Russians on his early armscontrol initiative setting negotiations back as much as a year for the illfated nuclear arms treaty Mr Reagans accomplishments seem all the more remarkable for having come from one of the most improbable figures ever to assume the Presidency  a onetime baseball announcer Bmovie actor and television pitchman who has had to force the Establishment to take him seriously Having become President in the face of such skepticism he seeks nothing less than the biggest military buildup since the Vietnam War and the adoption of a conservative Republican program that would all but repeal the Great Society bringing about a seismic shift of resources from Government to private hands In the process he has proclaimed an elusive goal essential to the success of his Presidency restoring the confidence of Americans in themselves and in the future Every modern President plagued by an economic crisis has defined it in terms of confidence from Roosevelts appeal  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself  to Gerald Fords WIN buttons and Mr Carters 1979 speech about Americas malaise With Mr Reagan comes a new resolve contemptuous of a decade of talk about the need to accept limits on American growth eager to embark on great new deeds worthy of his version of a simpler past And after all he declared on Inauguration Day why shouldnt we believe that We are Americans But if Mr Reagans goals are awesome so are the obstacles that impede him and they have come into sharper focus as well in his first 100 days The similarities between Roosevelt and Mr Reagan are many but one major difference is that Mr Reagan has begun by outlining a program not enacting one Before the end of Roosevelts first 100 days he had taken the nation off the gold standard rescued the banking system and won passage of 15 major pieces of legislation from Federal welfare programs to revisions in securities laws and enactment of the Civilian Conservation Corps the Agricultural Adjustment Act and the Tennessee Valley Authority Mr Reagans achievements so far are contained in a package of proposals including 83 major program changes 834 amendments to the budget this year and next 151 lesser budgetary actions and 60 additional pieces of legislation Not until March 31 did he sign his first bill  cutting back dairy price supports  on a breakfast tray at George Washington University Hospital the morning after he was shot If the bulk of his program is enacted it wont be until much later in the year and it is far from certain what form it will be in by then Reagans people may be right in wanting a fastpaced first 100 days  says Richard E Neustadt professor of political science at Harvard University But the situation now is altogether different from the collapse of the banking system that faced Roosevelt in 1933 I think Reagan has done an effective job getting started and Im impressed with how he has spent his time But that doesnt tell us how his policies will fare against the shock of events The real pushing and shoving has yet to happen adds another Presidentwatcher James David Barber professor of political science at Duke University Reagans moved quickly but our expectations should be lower than they were for Roosevelt So far weve seen a lot of smiling at meetings with Congress Thats the oil but its not the machinery of Government On President Herbert Hoovers last day in office he curtly told his successor Mr Roosevelt when you have been in Washington as long as I have you will learn that the President of the United States calls on nobody Roosevelt ignored the advice and here Mr Reagan has done exactly the same He has gone horseback riding in Virginia visited backstage at concerts ballet and theater in Washington and New York City dined and lunched at hotels and private homes donned black tie and white tie for parties at the most elegant clubs in town and made a point of himself traveling to Capitol Hill to visit Congressional leaders In the process Mr Reagan has defined his objectives with such amiable geniality that even an assassination attempt became an occasion for humor and selfconfidence That too marked an eerie parallel with Roosevelt who barely escaped a wouldbe assassins gunfire that left one man dead and four others wounded in Miami three weeks before he was to take office The ghastly incident brought a new rush of faith in Roosevelt at a time when that quality was needed most according to the historian Arthur M Schlesinger Jr Those sentiments find their echo today For after jolt upon jolt to American pride from setbacks overseas and at home the yearning for an oldfashioned cando spirit is surely what Mr Reagan rode to victory when he defeated Mr Carter in 44 states and won 51 percent of the popular vote Now he seeks to harness the same spirit in a highly unusual way The unorthodox economists who have devised the Reagan program acknowledge that Americans will only change their patterns of behavior  that is save enough and be willing enough to accept lower wage increases  if they come to believe that Government can be curbed and that inflation can be brought down If instead Americans react to a tax cut by spending today rather than saving for tomorrow and by clamoring as they have in the past for wage increases Mr Reagans program will be one of the most calamitous inflationary failures of all time The theory behind Mr Reagans proposals is untested and he conceded as much in a speech to Congress Turning to his critics he asked Have they any alternative which offers a greater chance of balancing the budget reducing and eliminating inflation stimulating the creation of jobs and reducing the tax burden And if they havent are they suggesting we can continue on the present course without coming to a day of reckoning in the very near future At every chance Mr Reagan recognizes the need to rebuild expectations by sounding the theme of selfconfidence that we are in control and that we can and will resolve the problems which confront us But what he seeks most of all is a duplication of Roosevelts political success altered to conservative needs  a creation of the conditions leading to a new era of Republican primacy in America This may be Mr Reagans most difficult task of all for it is in his political approach that Mr Reagan most differs from Roosevelt Roosevelt ran on a pledge to cut Government spending by 25 percent and then showed himself to be a pragmatist and an improviser capable of abandoning campaign promises Take a method and try it he said If it fails try another But above all try something By contrast Mr Reagan may be pragmatic about his tactics but he ran for office intent on implementing an agenda he had advocated for decades To the astonishment of many he is seeking now to carry it out s an actor and afterdinner speaker and as Governor of California for example Mr Reagan had made it clear that he didnt like the antipoverty programs of the Great Society even when most voters did And at the height of the popularity of President Richard Nixons policy of detente with the Soviet Union Mr Reagan remained a hawkish skeptic He was against Government regulation even when the consumer environmental and workersafety movements were at their peak He scoffed as well at energy conservation just as that idea took hold As a politician he had been nothing if not consistent Now the question is Has he a mandate to dismantle what he opposed and alter the American landscape Or did he win last year simply because he vaguely but skillfully tapped the frustrations of Americans with a campaign theme summed up brilliantly at the debate with President Carter when Mr Reagan asked voters Are you better off now than you were four years ago The answers to these questions are so unclear and American public opinion is so changeable in any case that the political risks Mr Reagan faces are probably even more serious than the economic risks The Reagan proposals promise a political struggle whose outcome will affect American society for a generation Confident of his electoral mandate the President told an applauding conservative audience a few weeks ago Were not cutting the budget simply for the sake of sounder financial management Those of us who call ourselves conservative have pointed out whats wrong with Government policy for more than a quarter of a century Now we have an opportunity  to change our national directions  Fellow citizens fellow conservatives our time is now Our moment has arrived In the strategy of Mr Reagans Presidential campaign lies the foundation of his first 100 days Last fall the candidates aides realized that voters perceived Mr Reagan to be more conservative than they  perhaps too much so We must minimize the perception that he is dangerous and uncaring said an internal campaign memorandum in October Campaign pollsters tested different future scenarios with voters and found that they vastly preferred to believe America can do rather than less is better The can do theme thus formed the vehicle for easing voters fears about Mr Reagans conservatism and instilling their faith in his leadership potential The themes and actions of Mr Reagans first 100 days have been as carefully planned as the campaign itself and by the same people Was the American dream over asked another internal memorandum of last December The voters said NO the American Dream was not over or at least they hoped it was not Upon taking office the memo went on Mr Reagan should gear his actions to his call for renewed confidence in America and for passage of his economic program He was warned not to use grand rhetoric until his program was ready and then to seek to lower expectations so that the public would understand that his goals coud not be achieved quickly Finally to provide real leadership President Reagan must engage in a perennial campaign the memorandum said and then concluded He should mount a daily barrage of speeches directives and meetings to support his legislation and he should forget any notion of being an outsider in the nations capital Mr Carter had failed at that alienating the power centers needed for a President to govern effectively In his very first days Mr Reagan therefore issued a blizzard of executive orders lifting dozens of Government regulations dismissing hundreds of Carter holdovers setting a Federal hiring freeze and cutting back on travel office redecoration consultants and furniture procurement He met with everybody from the Congressional Black Caucus to the antiabortionists He spoke to the nation on television addressed a joint session of Congress and let NBC film a day of his activities devoted to the economy for an hourlong special Indeed in two months he met face to face with 400 Congressmen and ostentatiously courted the most powerful Democrat among them Speaker of the House Thomas P Tip ONeill Jr who was invited for dinner and to the Presidents surprise birthday party for intimates When Mr ONeill sent a souvenir tie to the White House Mr Reagan showed up at their next meeting wearing it Now youre in the big leagues the Speaker had warned the new President But Mr Reagan had already proved he knew it As part of his effort to keep the focus on the economy Mr Reagan deliberately avoided speaking out on the controversial agreement that freed the hostages from Iran He has deferred such promises as those to dismantle the Departments of Energy and Education and he has tried to avoid embroilment in the abortion and crime issues Not once meanwhile has Mr Reagan called for sacrifice Jimmy Carter talked about accepting shortages and look where it got him said an aide to Mr Reagan defending the Presidents description of his program as merely a reduction in waste and extravagance The truly needy are protected Mr Reagan says and anyone who thinks otherwise has fallen captive to the rhetoric of bureaucrats bent on protecting their jobs and their clientele The ease with which Mr Reagan dismisses criticism obviously derives from the practice he got in California Following the election however Mr Reagans economic advisers had in fact disagreed sharply behind the scenes about whether to attach a program of deep spending cuts to the 30percent cuts in income taxes that had been a cornerstone of his campaign For example Representative Jack F Kemp the Buffalo NY Republican who was an original author of the tax cut warned there would be blood on the floor of Congress if Mr Reagan tried to cut Government programs as sharply as others were urging Mr Kemp and others argued that tax cuts themselves would produce enough economic growth to pay for existing Government services In a pivotal decision Mr Reagan rejected Mr Kemps advice siding with the orthodox Republican economists who held that tax cuts without budget cuts would ignite a new round of inflation But not until the appointment of David A Stockman the fiercely conservative director of the Office of Management and Budget did Mr Reagan begin to review the specifics of the cuts Seated at the center of a long table  first at a transition office and then in the Cabinet room  Mr Reagan listened as Mr Stockman presented cuts the budget director had been wanting to make for years while studying the budget as a Republican Congressman from Michigan In 90 percent of the cases the President gave a simple assent to what Mr Stockman had wrought Occasionally he sided with a Cabinet Secretary who objected and sometimes he asked why a certain program couldnt be reduced even more Go ahead and cut it he interjected at one point after a long debate Theyre going to hang me in effigy anyway and it doesnt matter how high The most heated debates were over tax policy with Treasury Secretary Donald T Regan arguing for greater benefits to persons with higher incomes a move he said would increase savings and investment Mr Reagan rejected his advice on political grounds We couldnt afford to have a package that looked like a giveaway for the rich an adviser said later As consultations proceeded Mr Reagan approved modifications to placate allies on Capitol Hill Subsidies for the Clinch River breeder reactor in Tennessee were left untouched in deference to the majority leader Senator Howard H Baker Jr a Tennessee Republican Cuts in food stamps were reduced to please Republican Senator Robert Dole of Kansas The timetable of these actions tells the story of Mr Reagans rapid Presidential pace On Jan 20 he gave an inaugural address devoted almost exclusively to the economy He spoke to the nation on television Feb 5 and addressed Congress in a joint session Feb 18 presenting the bulk of his economic package on that date Continued on Pgae 76 Pgs 76 78 80 By March 10 he had com pleted details of the package In sum the package consists of a 695 billion budget for next year the boldest attempt of modern times to redirect the resources of government It features nearly 50 billion in spending cuts more than 50 billion in tax cuts and the start of a threeyear 27 percent rise in military spending  an increase so huge many experts question whether the Pentagon can spend at that rate In Congress the package met with initial predictions even among Democrats that Mr Reagan would get most of what he proposed Indeed Democrats joined with Republicans in supporting a set of Reaganbacked spending cuts on the Senate floor in early April But just before Congress broke for Easter recess two weeks ago some conservative Senate Republicans dealt the Administration a setback by defecting on a key resolution in the Senate Budget Committee which didnt cut spending as fast as they wanted  Meanwhile Democratic leaders in the House were saying Mr Reagan would have to awaken soon to the need to compromise at least on his tax cuts The Democratic critics focused on both the economic and political premises of Mr Reagans program For one thing many economists dispute Mr Reagans opening contention that radical surgery is needed because Government spending and deficits have left Americans worse off than 20 years ago In fact they point out the standard of living for Americans is twice as high as it was in 1960 even after inflation although it is true that many Americans are worse off than they were four years ago as Mr Reagan suggested in the Presidential campaign Also the rate of relief in Mr Reagans tax cut grows with ones income skewing its benefits toward the welltodo This reversal of the historic policy of taxing the wealthy at higher rates is defended by Reagan aides on the ground that the wealthy are more apt to save or invest and an increase in savings and investment is needed to improve productivity and dampen inflation Thus even though the President had earlier ruled out increasing taxcut benefits for the very wealthy the program still leaves Mr Reagan open to the charge that he is proffering traditional Republican economics favoring the upper classes One is drawn then to the conclusion that Mr Reagans budget cuts have spared the truly powerful more than the truly needy To be sure student loans business loans dairy price supports and other programs for the middle class are being trimmed But the costliest programs for the poor  welfare Medicaid food stamps social services and rental assistance  are slated for the sharpest cuts Programs that mostly help those in the middle class or above Social Security Medicare and veterans benefits  are preserved Also untouched are tens of billions of dollars in tax benefits that in effect subsidize housing and health care for the middle class One more controversial feature of Mr Reagans program is his proposal to consolidate at least 75 different health education and social service programs into a few big block grants leaving the states to spend the money with no strings attached This move toward a new federalism has been both a longtime Republican dream and consistent with Mr Reagans talk of states rights during the campaign The approach is controversial because nothing would remain to impel states to spend the money on those deemed needy by Congress in the last 20 years Indeed Congress would be deprived altogether of its historic role in deciding the purposes for which Federal money should be spent Small wonder that on Inauguration Day the governors in attendance applauded Mr Reagans appeal for power to be returned to the states the Democratic leaders of Congress greeted the idea with stony silence The question of mandate hovers over all of Mr Reagans doctrines Americans no doubt endorsed his pledge to curb the intrusive role of Government But did their votes for Mr Reagan mean that they wanted him to take all these steps Did the election results mean that voters will embrace his efforts to weaken the Clean Air Act or ease the regulation of wages hours and conditions in the working place Do most Americans want weaker controls over strip mining offshore drilling nuclear power plants and the labeling of food additives Do they want the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to back away from regulating businesses Do they want Government to deemphasize energy conservation Do they indeed want an end to Government social service programs as we know them Democrats who argue no have had problems opposing Mr Reagan because until recently they failed to produce an alternative of their own Moreover they have been leaderless rudderless and divided on the ideological lines that split the party even when Mr Carter was President The assassination attempt on Mr Reagan also appears to have helped the Presidents program at least in the short run I sense an awful lot of sympathy and love for the President flowering around here now said Senator Paul Laxalt the Nevada Republican who is Mr Reagans closest Congressional ally But if I know the Congressional beast itll be shortlived Even if Mr Reagan wins approval of his program it is still far from clear that he can achieve his desired results Most outside economists say his assumptions are overly optimistic The Reagan program assumes inflation will drop to 72 percent by the end of next year for example and that overall economic growth will soar to a rate of more than 5 percent The last time the economy grew that fast in 1977 it also stoked the fires of inflation Reagan aides say their predictions will materialize because of an improvement in rational expectations so dramatic that Americans will change their economic behavior out of confidence that inflation will go down Edwin Meese 3d Mr Reagans senior policy adviser agrees that in this sense the Reagan program is as much as 80 percent psychological However most recent Presidential efforts to instill confidence have foundered for various reasons Hoover thought balancing the budget would do it Nixon turned to wage and price controls to eliminate inflationary psychology Such efforts failed because confidence has proved itself consistently beyond the reach of the manipulation of politicians and too susceptible to outside shocks such as an Arab oil embargo This stark lesson of the past throws the darkest shadow of uncertainty across Mr Reagans path After the beginning of the Great Depression President Hoover considered cutting back on glitter at the White House but opted instead for nightly banquets with trumpets announcing the arrival of the President and his guests  even when Hoover wearing black tie dined alone with his wife It was good for American morale to know that things had not slipped at the White House he argued Mr Reagan and his wife Nancy may not have had this rationale in mind as they embarked on putting a sense of splash back into the White House after four years of the studied simplicity of Mr Carter But the Reagans have reestablished an exuberant style nonetheless since Inauguration Day when the Californians Texans and their friends arrived and created a Republican gridlock in downtown Washington with limousines bearing men in formal attire and women in fulllength mink Before the assassination attempt Mr Reagan was wearing black tie himself several nights a week And after the Reagans spent 8 million in privately raised funds on their inaugural festivities another 800000 was contributed to refurbish their living quarters Mrs Reagans staff had been shocked to find mousetraps poking out from underneath threadbare sofas and chairs at the White House The Reagans had some of the walls painted pale yellow and in their residence today there are palm trees plants and freshly cut flowers giving the place a touch of the good life in Pacific Palisades Mr Reagan has discovered a favorite hideaway in a small secondfloor study where he escapes when possible during the day His biggest complaint to Helene von Damm his longtime secretary is the absence of free time I have no time to be President hell say when glancing at his crowded calendar meaning that he misses the moments alone to think Unlike his immediate predecessor this President likes guests and loves ceremony Recently his schedule got backed up because he lingered and swapped endless baseball stories with Duke Snider Mickey Mantle and 35 other visiting members of the Baseball Hall of Fame When Mr Reagan enters the room the Marine Band plays Hail to the Chief which it used to do until Jimmy Carter For the first time since Richard Nixon departed a marine in dress uniform salutes visitors to the main entrance of the West Wing In the Cabinet room Mr Reagan replaced the portraits of Truman and Jefferson with Coolidge and Eisenhower Presidents he admires because of their record of prosperity peace and no inflation Official Washington at least has been captivated by Mr Reagans affability Having angrily labeled some Congressional budget figures as phony Mr Reagan ducks his head later and allows with a grin that it probably wasnt the proper word to use Told by an aide that hed be happy to hear that the Government had functioned normally during his stay in the hospital Mr Reagan replied What makes you think Id be happy about that Mr Reagans quips deflect criticism the most nettlesome of which is that the Administration remains riven by factionalism Sometimes our right hand doesnt know what our far right hand is doing Mr Reagan observed in response The organizational problems have been serious Despite the drive for collegiality a series of acrimonious disputes impedes the staff and the agencies Power at the White House indisputably rests with Edwin Meese 3d James A Baker 3d and Michael K Deaver three men who have come to work better together than they have worked with the Cabinet especially Pgs 82 84 Secretary of State Alexander M Haig Jr By far the toughest organizational decision Mr Reagan faced was his installation of Vice President George Bush not Secretary Haig as director of crisis management at the White House in charge of emergency situations that require interagency coordination But the crisismanagement decision simply exposed the difficulties Mr Haig was having in getting along with colleagues First the Secretary feuded with Budget Director Stockman over foreign aid then with Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis and with Bill Brock the Special Trade Representative over Japanese auto imports and also with Agriculture Secretary John R Block over the Soviet grain embargo His biggest disagreements have been with Defense Secretary Caspar W Weinberger over statements about the neutron bomb arms negotiations with the Russians and  most embarrassingly  over who was in charge in the Situation Room at the White House hours after Mr Reagan had been shot To the dismay of the White House staff the Cabinet disputes have been damaging in two respects they have blurred the desired coherence in foreign policy and they have undercut the Presidents drive to focus attention on the economy A major theme of Mr Reagans foreign policy is the notion of American moral superiority  a shining city on a hill  and its central element has been a return to the concept of containment of the Russians This has meant for example that other recent Carter priorities  curbing nuclear proliferation advocating human rights and defusing regional disputes in the Middle East and Africa  have taken second place to the renewed tendency to see problems in terms of EastWest strategic considerations Surely the public supports a military buildup and it may also approve of Mr Reagans insistence that the Soviet Union reserves the right to commit any crime to lie to cheat to advance its interests Such language hasnt been heard from an American President in years But privately the Presidents political advisers say they know that while the American people favor a tougher stance toward the Russians they simultaneously worry about any increased prospects for a nuclear confrontation Thus some aides concede that the Administrations bellicose talk was a significant factor in dampening Mr Reagans approval ratings just before the assassination attempt and that it could become a factor again hampering his ability to get his economic legislation passed The Presidents aides are also concerned that the tough talk might raise unrealistic expectations for action A Russian invasion of Poland for example would force the Administration to face the fact that it could do little to stop Moscow Such a situation would be similar to Mr Reagans early promise of swift retribution for terrorism followed by an embarrassed admission by aides that nothing would be done to punish the terrorists who jeopardized American lives in two recent airplane hijackings On the minds of Mr Reagans political advisers seems to be the memory that his biggest obstacle in the election campaign was a fear among voters that he was triggerhappy As a result President Reagan and his senior aides decided very gingerly that Secretary Haig would go public with a proposal for aid to the Government of El Salvador which has been fighting an insurrection that the United States claims is supported by the Communist bloc This opening shot in late February the carefully planned signal of a more assertive foreign policy was timed to be made between two key economic announcements But the strategy backfired The mail against the American El Salvador intervention has been running tentoone opposed It was not something we expected said a shaken Presidential aide The political risks are equally obvious in the Administrations decision to place IsraeliEgyptian talks on a back burner and to send weapons and aircraft to Saudi Arabia and possibly other nations in the Persian Gulf over Israeli protests The kind words Mr Reagan has had recently for South Africa  and for military regimes in Argentina South Korea and elsewhere may also create problems because Mr Carter found that human rights were still a popular issue last year Another key Presidential initiative has gone largely unnoticed Mr Reagans request for Congress to repeal its restrictions on the Administrations ability to help the proWestern rebels in Angola and to channel aid to the Governments of Argentina and Pakistan Congress placed these three bans at the height of its postVietnam War eagerness to curb the Presidents power to support activities Congress didnt like such as humanrights violations in Argentina and nuclear proliferation in Pakistan But Mr Reagan is trying to get the pendulum to swing back to the Presidency at least in the conduct of foreign policy The President needs to be able to act quickly in foreign affairs asserted a senior aide And there is no better time to restore his ability to act unilaterally than now when hes at the height of his popularity This awareness that the Presidents popularity cannot possibly last suffuses the White House as Mr Reagan approaches the end of his first 100 days The occupational hazard of any Presidential staff is that they think theyre going to be here forever a senior White House aide said What an illusion that is Those shots at Reagan gave me a sense that we have to act 
efore time runs out Already some of Mr Reagans own constituents are growing restive Rightwing groups say they are upset at certain appointments Mr Reagan has had to break a major campaign promise and continue the Soviet grain embargo The freetraders are upset that he is seeking voluntary restraints on Japanese car imports Conservatives are uncomfortable with Mr Reagans agreement to try to head off any attempts in Congress even by his friends to tie his economic package to the explosive issues of abortion the death penalty or busing One thing to watch if Mr Reagans political fortunes turn sour is whether the President will jettison the hardline Mr Stockman or the unpredictable Mr Haig if they draw more criticism than they are worth There have really been only three periods in this century however when American Presidents worked harmoniously with Congress to achieve farreaching changes in Government the first terms of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D Roosevelt and the first two years of Lyndon B Johnson But these were eras when Government was expanding not contracting as Mr Reagan wants it to America has in more recent years become familiar with the conditions making it more difficult than ever for a President to bring about change The factors include the atrophying of political parties the fragmentation of Congress the rise of Government bureaucracy and the problems posed by special interests lawyers American cynicism  and the tendency of Presidential election campaigns to produce effective candidates but not effective Presidents Facing these difficulties Mr Reagan has displayed remarkable political strengths and gifts His first 100 days have shown that he is a President determined to change the tides of history The question remains whether his popularity and his claim of a mandate have given him enough strength to do it,,

"PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS SON, LOVER, ELEGIST",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/26/books/portrait-of-the-artist-as-son-lover-elegist.html,THE SOURCE OF LIGHT By Reynolds Price 318 pp New York Atheneum 1395 PORTRAITS of artists are most adroitly approached aslant One thinks of Joyce showing us Stephen Dedalus lost in a romantic reverie then awakening to squash a louse on his neck or of Oscar Wildes Basil Hallward the artist in The Portrait of Dorian Gray who is not only murdered by his subject but dissolved in nitric acid By contrast is there anyone more insufferable and more improbable as an artist than Virginia Woolfs tiresome Lily Briscoe who is only shown painting and who seems to have taken a lifetime to paint one canvas The Source of Light Reynolds Prices 10th book is a portrait of the artist as son as lover as elegist a romantic egoist who loves solitude yet who reports on nearly every waking and dreaming hour of his life a mourner who suspects that he must convert his private domestic suffering into something more substantial into art if he is to redeem it  and himself Hutchins Mayfield is a 25yearold poet who thinks of himself as an aging boy who feels he must leave his North Carolina home and his deep attachment to his father in order to discover whether he is a genuine poet or a fraud He goes to Oxford to read for a Bachelor of Letters degree to write a thesis on the love and nature of Andrew Marvell and to work on his poetry in virtual solitude Hutch is touchingly frank in the letters he writes home almost every day Ive been huffing and puffing to cheer myself up in this odd high leap I find myself taking What we didnt discuss  were the things I am scared of The main thing is me  that once Ive paid for and found this famous stillness around me filled my fountain pen and faced the window then therell be no work not a thing I know thatll prove big enough to hold any human eye but mine and no words to say even small things in Hutch Mayfield believes he has successfully cast off the hobbles that restrain him  his father Rob who is devoted to him his recollections of MayfieldKendal family history his confused and painful thoughts about his mother who died giving birth to him But his fathers unanticipated death calls him home and makes him realize that his subject will be his family after all In one of his final letters Hutchs father tells him in essence that he must be the means by whichthe various generations of their family are made into a figure   a diagram  a writing in lines Thats the hope Son his father writes  that we make some figure If we do youd be the one to know though it may take awhile to know you know This richly detailed and intensely romantic novel which covers approximately a year in Hutchins Mayfields life is not a sequel but a continuation of Mr Prices The Surface of Earth which was published in 1975 That novel which began with the disastrous elopement of Hutchs grandmother then 16 years old in 1903 moved with luxuriant slowness through some four decades ending a few years after Hutchs birth Both novels are lyric brooding meditative obsessive and possess at their most powerful moments the histrionic clarity of a vast tapestry in which action is necessarily arrested and individual figures exist only in their relationship to one another and the larger design Where The Surface of Earth had the structure of an oldfashioned family saga The Source of Light is far narrower in scope more centrally focused If the source of light is Hutchs MayfieldKendal background in all its melodramatic complexity the light itself is Hutch  who for good reason is tormented by the possibility that he cannot be equal to it Thus the mood of the novel is edgy selfabsorbed questioning and uncertain And finally it is elegiac for Hutch though capable of making his bold high leap to England cannot escape obsessive thoughts of the deaths of his parents The depiction of Robs death contains some of the most beautifully sustained passages in all of Reynolds Prices work Nor can he decide whether he loves a young woman well enough to marry her Near the end of the novel he learns after the fact that his girl has had an abortion to free herself of a baby that was probably though not certainly his As one might imagine there are difficulties in assessing a writer in vigorous midcareer like Reynolds Price and these difficulties are in the present case compounded by the fact that the novel under review is a continuation of an earlier work and gives every indication of leading to yet another Hutch Mayfield novel It seems unfair to judge Hutchins Mayfield at this point and irrevelant to question whether he will ever be a poet for that is not the concern of this novel Mr Price seems to be lightly satirizing Hutch who believes that his selfobsessed letters home allow him to avoid the rapt mirrorgazing that diaries invite then again he indulges him at length in long unedited letters that contain dreams recounted in full One can see why Hutchs girl Ann becomes so impatient with him  he is romantically indulgent about himself and yet his manner with her is cautious and ironic and he always seems to draw back from any forthright declaration of love Ann does not know but perhaps can sense that Hutch is attracted to other men  that indeed he has homosexual relations Because he is so central to the novel dominating virtually every page it is disconcerting that Hutch remains so blurred to us and that Ann too lacks definition We wonder whether she is as pallid as she appears or whether her passivity is part of her strategy to win Hutch for a husband She takes pride for instance in confessing to a total lack of interest in a profession or in what might be called the world Im a woman as oldstyle as anything painted on the walls of caves  What I want is to work inside at home making life easy or easier for twotofour people in whom Im involved and who want me to be The chilling complacency of the 1950s  no wonder Hutch eludes her even as he insists he loves her In this novel as in Reynolds Prices previous work the most appealing characters are garrulous storytellers who are often peripheral to the central concern of a novel but irresistible nonetheless for it is through them that we experience the texture of life in a given place and time Since the publication in 1962 of his justly acclaimed first novel A Long and Happy Life Reynolds Price has been superb at capturing voices and so it is not surprising that the older talky women of The Source of Light one of them Hutchs grandmother Eva the mother of Rob are marvelous as are Hutchs male friends Lew a Welshman whom he meets on the ocean liner and Straw a nineteenyearold reformed alcoholic who had been Hutchs student at a rural Episcopal boys school in Virginia The women are warm bemused funny and wise without necessarily being intelligent and certainly without being selfconscious the male lovers are uncommonly intriguing in ways poor Ann locked into her claustrophobic feminine role can never be Indeed it is one of the puzzling aspects of the novel that Hutch doesnt seem to grasp what the reader so quickly grasps  that his homosexual liaisons are much more meaningful to him because more interesting than his laconic courtship of Ann In all The Source of Light is a somber rather beautifully muted work in which the melodrama of earlier generations has receded leaving a hero who is in his very uncertainty absolutely convincing It is a measure of Reynolds Prices integrity that he ends this novel on so restrained and so unresolved a note Hutch back at Oxford Ann at home the Atlantic between them as well as the death of an unborn child and a sense of great injury Perhaps suffering will deepen Hutch perhaps it will make him into the poet his father has required him to be

SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP; CENSUS DISPUTE IN JERSEY FACES REVIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/28/us/supreme-court-roundup-census-dispute-in-jersey-faces-review.html,The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether the Census Bureau can refuse to disclose its master address lists to state and local governments seeking to check the lists for accuracy The issue of the lists confidentiality embroiled the Census Bureau in lawsuits around the country in the final months of the 1980 census Todays case is an appeal by the agency of lower court decisions that ordered it to turn over the address lists to officials of Essex County NJ The Supreme Court today also upheld the constitutionality of an Indiana law that requires that all abortions after the first three months of pregnancy be performed in a hospital The Court decided the case without comment in a onesentence order from which three Justices dissented In the census case the New Jersey officials contended that the census takers had missed thousands of residents in Essex County which includes Newark and had failed to count entire buildings The officials filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act for the master list of names and addresses on which the enumeration was based Privacy in Response to Questions The Census Bureau argued that the address lists were exempt from disclosure under provisions in the Census Act that guard the privacy of individuals who respond to census questions Both the United States District Court in New Jersey and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit disagreed ordering the director of the census to provide the material or face contempt proceedings The Supreme Court gave the director a reprieve while the Government was preparing its appeal New York City and New York State are also seeking the master address lists Last October the United States District Court in Manhattan ordered the Census Bureau to turn over the lists The Governments appeal of that order is now before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit The Census Bureau believes that the lists are subject to the same confidentiality that applies to answers on the actual census forms because the address lists disclose instances of illegal occupancy and other conditions that occupants might not want to disclose to local authorities Strict confidentiality of census data is essential to insure public cooperation with and voluntary participation in the nationwide census the Government told the Justices in the case Baldridge v Shapiro No 801436 The Essex County officials said that the bureau had failed to show why disclosure of a list of street numbers would breach the confidentiality that the Census Act was designed to protect Other actions at the Court today included the following Abortion Law The Indiana law that the Court upheld provides criminal penalties for doctors who perform abortions outside hospitals after the first trimester of pregnancy Thirteen other states including New York and Connecticut have similar restrictions on where late abortions may be performed In 1973 when the Supreme Court struck down state laws banning abortion altogether it said that for the period of pregnancy after the first trimester a state may regulate the abortion procedure to the extent that the regulation reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health Indiana enacted its hospitalonly law after that ruling Todays case GaryNorthwest Indiana Womens Services v Orr No 801275 was an appeal by patients and operators of an abortion clinic of the refusal by the United States District Court in Indiana to enjoin enforcement of the state law Associate Justices William J Brennan Jr Thurgood Marshall and Harry A Blackmun dissented from the majoritys order affirming the lower court They said that the Court should hear full arguments in the case Hearst Appeal Without comment the Court refused to hear an appeal by Patricia Hearst Shaw of her 1976 conviction for armed robbery Mrs Shaw argued that her lawyer F Lee Bailey had a conflict of interest a contract to write a book about the trial that prevented him from adequately defending her Under a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit the former kidnapping victim is entitled to a new hearing in United States District Court at which she may present evidence of the alleged conflict Consequently todays action Hearst v US No 801445 leaves open further avenues of appeal Age Discrimination The Court refused to hear an appeal by the West Hartford Conn school board of a ruling that its refusal to hire a 55yearold applicant for a teaching job violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act The school board defended its policy on the ground that experienced teachers command higher salaries and cost the school district unnecessary money but the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirming a jurys award of back pay ruled that cost saving is not a defense to a charge of age discrimination Associate Justice William H Rehnquist voted to hear the case Markham v Geller No 801258 Paternity Suits The Court agreed to hear a constitutional challenge to a Texas law that gives a mother a year after the birth of an illegitimate child to bring a lawsuit to establish the childs paternity A Texas appeals court upheld the law

Science Academy Sees No Way To Absolutely Define Life's Start,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/29/us/science-academy-sees-no-way-to-absolutely-define-life-s-start.html,The National Academy of Sciences addressing a key issue dividing antiabortion forces and those who favor permitting abortions today passed a resolution asserting that it was not possible to answer the question of when human life begins in clearcut scientific terms The resolution was passed in response to proposed legislation that would define fertilization of the human egg cell as the initiation of life thus making it a crime to destroy an embryo The purpose of the proposed legislation which has been the subject of Congressional hearings this week is to bypass a 1973 Supreme Court decision that gave women the right to decide whether to have an abortion At its annual meeting the academy also assailed proposed cutbacks in Federal support for the social and behavioral sciences and for science education
ACCORD ON BUDGET REACHED IN ALBANY TO END STALEMATE majority leader Warren Anderson,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/29/nyregion/accord-budget-reached-albany-end-stalemate-majority-leader-warren-anderson.html,The monthlong impasse on the state budget was broken today as Governor Carey and the State Senate Republican majority leader Warren M Anderson reached agreement on a 166 billion budget for New York State It does not include a state takeover of the local costs of Medicaid that had been sought by Mr Carey The Governor who had called the Medicaid plan the centerpiece of his budget proposal delayed that condition today opening the way for a quick accord Senator Anderson had opposed the Medicaid takeover plan as unaffordable and had asked that debate on the issue be set apart from the budget process The Senator has agreed to work on a Medicaid plan over the next 30 days Aid Demands Withdrawn In exchange for Mr Careys concession Mr Anderson has withdrawn nearly all of his major aid demands for localities The Senator began softening his position last Friday when he reduced his taxcut proposals considerably The budget agreed upon will include an additional reserve of 80 million for localities that could be part of an agreement on a Medicaid takeover later The Governor called these funds insurance that negotiations on the issue would continue But the Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink said the funds were not contingent on the Medicaid issue The state which has been without a budget since its fiscal year began April 1 has been unable to pay its bills and has issued scrip to its workers Hospitals nursing homes and school districts have been hit hardest by the delay in state aid having to borrow money to cover their expenses Abortion Fight Expected Mr Carey said he now expected a budget to be adopted by next Wednesday But coming up next week is the annual battle over the including of Medicaid funds for abortion in the state budget That disagreement has stalled budget adoption for two of the last three years At a late afternoon news conference today the Governor said The Medicaid issue is very much alive No one gave up anything he added We all gained Mr Anderson agreed to work on a takeover plan during the next 30 days in conjunction with an 80 million increase in aid to towns villages and cities  the reserve referred to by the Governor Those local governments would not be helped by the Medicaid takeover New York City with an 800 millionayear Medicaid bill and county governments pay the local share and thus would be the beneficiaries of such a takeover As Mr Carey described his postbudget negotiating plan 80 million would be set aside to cover a Medicaid takeover and any increased aid to localities Senator Anderson although agreeing to this way of linking the issues called the arrangement a little tortured In exchange for Mr Careys offer the Senator gave up his call for increased local revenue sharing leaving that aid frozen at 800 million He also agreed to seek passage of nearly all of the 290 million in revenueproducing measures the Governor had asked for that have already been approved by the Democraticled Assembly Mr Anderson also reduced his taxcut proposal from 488 million to between 70 million and 75 million Votes Expected Next Week Emerging from an hourandahalf meeting with the Governor and looking more jovial than after previous sessions Mr Anderson a Binghamton Republican and Speaker Fink a Brooklyn Democrat stood side by side and announced that they expected budget bills to be printed by Friday and adopted by the two houses early next week The final budget figure is 400 million more than the Governor originally proposed and 200 million less than the Senates version passed a month ago In New York City Mayor Koch issued a statement critical of the agreement I believe that when the Governor and legislative leaders capitulated to Warren Andersons demand of a truncated budget without the passage of a Medicaid takeover bill Warren Anderson won the battle the Mayor said They blinked He did not The Governors office has advised me that as a result of their negotiations they hope the Medicaid bill will be enacted within 30 days Mr Koch continued My personal feeling is that much of the momentum and leverage they once had has been lost Obviously he said I hope I am proved wrong But if I am proved right and there is no Medicaid takeover the Governor and Democratic and Republican legislative leaders will be held accountable by the people of the state After the meeting with the Governor Mr Anderson did not rule out the Medicaid takeover entirely Ive always said its a subject we can discuss he said But weve made no commitment that its to be an integral part of this budget The Governors aides exulted that weve gotten the entire fiscal plan noting that Mr Anderson had withdrawn his huge taxcut program and had agreed to the revenueproducing measures including increased penalty fees for businesses for late payment of taxes and advanced payment of business taxes The Democrats had contended for months that the State Senates revenue and spending plans were 1 billion out of balance But Michael J DelGiudice the Governors director of policy management conceded that by placing discussion of the Medicaid takeover outside of the budget process valuable leverage had been lost He said he hoped that the offer of increased aid for upstate towns villages and cities tied to the Medicaid takeover plus the pressure from New York City for the aid would provide some impetus toward adoption of the plan Senator Andersons upstate colleagues in the Senate had objected to the takeover seeing it as a bonanza for New York City with little impact on their constituencies Eventually Senator Anderson who originally had proposed his own Medicaid takeover plan adopted a stance against the program at least as part of the budget package Besides hammering out the details of the budget agreement the Senate and the Assembly leadership still have to find a school aid formula that both houses can accept Mr Fink and Mr Anderson predicted the total amount would be about 140 million on a schoolyear basis or about 25 million more than the Governor had originally proposed
TV: PAULIST DRAMA ON TEEN-AGE PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/30/arts/tv-paulist-drama-on-teen-age-pregnancy.html,GIRL on the Edge of Town on WNEWTV tonight at 9 oclock is a modest and wellintentioned but irritatingly inept drama about teenage pregnancy abortion and adoption services The hourlong program merits attention primarily because it comes from Roman Catholic sources specifically Paulist Productions The executive producer is billed as Elwood Kieser Paulist Written by Jim McGinn the production is part of a Capital Cities series of Family Specials Past presentations have treated such issues as teenage alcoholism and suicide The church views offered in Girl on the Edge of Town are clearly liberal a good deal to the left of Pope John Paul II When Gina Swenson Sherry Hursey becomes pregnant she considers the possiblity of an abortion without any influence from fetus horror pictures Gina decides to have the baby but the story includes other women who opt for abortion and there is no laying on of heavyhanded criticism As it turns out the drama is more interested in the process of growing up than in the crisis of a pregnancy The problem is that the slender plot line has been overloaded with heavy subplots Ginas mother Patty Duke Astin reacts violently to the pregnancy because we learn she was also an unwed mother and has been living in a fantasy land of what might have been Ginas boyfriend Brad Wilkin has won a hefty college scholarship that he cannot accept unless he remains single Her seemingly dour and strict father Billy Green Bush suddenly turns to sentimental blubber And so it goes with characters doing 180degree personality turns right before your very eyes The pleasant teacher who is proud of Ginas mildly feminist campaigns at school is outraged when the obviously pregnant girl announces that she intends to stay in the race for president of the student council That would be unthinkable she snarls in her best narrowminded manner But determined to accentuate the positive the script leaves Gina discovering despite the gossip and heartbreak the value of acceptance and responsibility The film ends with a standing ovation for Gina that is uplifting and totally unbelievable
CONSTITUTIONAL CAVEATS ON THE ANTI-ABORTION BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/01/opinion/l-constitutional-caveats-on-the-anti-abortion-bill-106726.html,To the Editor Bernard Weinraubs otherwise excellent article on the HelmsHyde moment of conception antiabortion bill Determining When Life Begins and Abortions Stop April 23 overlooks one central reason that the proposed law would be unconstitutional under Supreme Court precedent he Courts landmark abortion decision in Roe v Wade did not hold merely that courts were unable to determine when life begins Rather it held that because of the innumerable conflicting views on the subject no governmental authority could decide the question with sufficient clarity and certainty to outweigh the clear constitutional right of a pregnant woman to end her pregnancy Thus even if Congress should determine on the basis of testimony from a carefully selected onesided array of physicians and others that human life begins at conception its decision could not be enforced under the Constitution The reasoning is not unlike that which underlies the free speech and press guarantees of the First Amendment While there may be overwhelming agreement or even near unanimity on one side of a given issue it is nevertheless not within the power of the Government to determine that that position is the truth and outlaw the expression of competing views This is only one of the many reasons that this harmful and illconsidered bill would be unconstitutional but it is a most cogent one It should not be overlooked as Mr Helms et al would have us do STEVEN DELIBERT MARSHALL BEIL New York April 24 1981 The writers are members of the law firm that is counsel for Abortion Rights Mobilization
* To the Editor:$,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/01/opinion/l-to-the-editor-106746.html,The proposal by Senator Helms and Representative Hyde for a Congressional act overruling the 1973 Supreme Court decision upholding a womans right to an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy marks not the first time it has been suggested that a Supreme Court decision can be negated by a mere act of Congress he notorious 5to4 decision of 1895 ruling that the income tax was a direct tax and therefore required apportionment was widely denounced as being in error Yet authorities of highest rank including President Taft and Senator Elihu Root insisted that a constitutional amendment was necessary to erase it Taft himself considered the decision wrong but explained A mature consideration has satisfied me that an amendment is the only proper course  This course is much to be preferred to the one proposed of reenacting a law once judicially declared to be unconstitutional For the Congress to assume that the Court will reverse itself and to enact legislation on such an assumption will not strengthen popular confidence in the stability of judicial construction of the Constitution It is much wiser policy to accept the decision and remedy the defect by amendment in due and regular course Taft and Root placed high value on maintaining the fiction of an unchanging Constitution even in the face of judicial action that was in error Neither was under the illusion that the law either is or can be stationary but both were wary of encouraging the notion that Congress could reverse an objectionable decision by an ordinary act lest the popular image of identity between the judicial version of the Constitution and the Constitution itself be fatally damaged To overrule a decision however mistaken both urged resort to timeconsumng amending procedures After a lapse of 20 years Taft and Root prevailed The income tax was legitimized by the 16th Amendment as an indirect tax and therefore could be levied without apportionment among the several states and without regard to any census or enumeration ALPHEUS THOMAS MASON Emeritus Prof of Jurisprudence Princeton University Princeton NJ April 23 1981
*,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/01/opinion/l--106725.html,To the Editor There is a great misunderstanding regarding the position of the proabortionists The Right to Life and other antiabortion people believe that those who favor abortion do so because of some libertarian crusade they have undertaken to legalize a licentious activity such as gambling prostitution or drug use v hat the proabortionists favor is the right to have an abortion No one is in favor of having an abortion No woman wants to have a abortion It is a surgical procedure and is feared and dreaded as any other surgical operation would be A woman has an abortion because it is necessary for her physical and psychological wellbeing The essential point is this No one man no group of men have the right to deny a woman the right to good sound medical treatment And this is exactly what a bill banning abortion would do It wouldnt stop abortions from taking place but it would stop them from taking place in proper medical facilities For those who are opposed to abortion on religious and moral grounds let them remember that in the not too distant past it was a widely held belief that medical procedures of any kind to treat and cure disease and extend life were interfering with the will of God Thankfully society has become enlightened enough so that we no longer treat this point of view with validity although there are certain religious sects that still cling to this belief  as they are entitled to do I am not in favor of abortion and neither is anyone else What I am in favor of is the right of everyone to sound medical treatment RAYMOND J OBRIEN Massapequa LI April 24 1981
OBSERVER; There Is No There Here,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/02/opinion/observer-there-is-no-there-here.html,For nearly 400 years Americans have spent their history getting from There to Here and usually found Here unsatisfactory after they arrived Sometimes as now they have been so disenchanted with Here that they want to go back to There and start over again This is one impulse behind the Reagan movement with its varied urges to go back to one of those forks in the road and take another route Which fork we want to go back to is not so clear The religious fundamentalists look back to Victorian social morality the economists look back toward the business imperium of the 1920s and the military and foreign policy people yearn for the age of the battleship and unchallengeable American power around the globe Whether the goal is 1890 1928 or 1946 may be unclear but one point on which there is agreement is that 1981 wont do Some place back there there was a good There and we made a terrible mistake in coming Here How we got from There to Here however is finally a question for each of us to answer individually A country like this does not move like a vast army but travels a path that is the sum of millions of individual decisions accidents strokes of good fortune and small disasters One of the more durable Theres in my own journey was located here at Lancaster Court House a Tidewater town near the Rappahannock River Calling it a town is overstatement It is a few houses a schoolhouse a small store and a courthouse along the side of the road and as a cousin of mine puts it if you blink twice while youre driving through youll miss it Here my grandfather and greatgrandfather lived the life that now seems so desirable to those who are angry about the environs of 1981 My greatgrandfather practiced law here before and after the Civil War and if the testimony of the Confederate war monument can be trusted did some service to the cause of perpetuating slavery in the 1860s My grandfather followed him in the practice of the law thus perpetuating a family tradition This business of the son carrying on his fathers work probably strikes many of us as one of the happy characteristics of life back There The necessity to defend slavery clouds this happy picture a mite My grandfather lived less than a mile from the courthouse He had a big house a farm and timberland off the left side of the road that runs down to the river His two daughters and seven sons were all born there just before and after the turn of the century In this bucolic There there was no birth control Certainly no abortion My grandfather was a pious man So pious in fact that he refused to buy life insurance He said insurance was a sacrilegious betting with God Whether the corporate tycoons who surround the Reagan philosophers would approve of going back to this particular There seems doubtful I rather fancy they would disapprove of the old gentlemans refusal to invest in America but surely he would cut a fetching figure for the folks of the Moral Majority Whatever the case God called for him in his uninsured state one May day in 1917 and he passed from the sweet There of Lancaster Court House to the Hereafter He and my grandmother are buried under a shady tree behind White Marsh Church about two miles from their home place I stopped by there the other day It is everybodys dream of the country graveyard The plain brick church built in 1848 on the ruins of another built in 1792 The white dogwoods flowering the spring breeze rippling the grass Not like those hateful new burial factories being constructed like highrise apartments on the outskirts of 1981 cities My grandfathers death ended my own chances of ever living in that particular There He had left little but debts His house farm and timberland were lost his children scattered down many roads as American children have always been scattered by happenstance and traveled from There to many Heres His grandchildren were born and shaped along those many roads some in Richmond others in Baltimore New York and California and the old There ceased to exist I went looking for it after visiting his grave His house had sat at the far end of a long lane under big spreading trees Two men were plowing a field where the lane used to be The house had vanished Destroyed by fire I am told There is one big spreading tree left where the house might once have stood There is no There to go back to The plowing was being finished by two men on huge modern machines What used to be a dirt road running past his acreage is an elegantly paved highway traveled not by horseandbuggy rigs but by flashy new cars from Japan Detroit and Germany It is no longer There It is Here and you cant get There from Here From Here you can only get to The Next Place and you probably get there inexorably even if you choose to spend the entire journey looking backward
POLL FINDS NATION IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY REPUBLICAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/03/us/poll-finds-nation-is-becoming-increasingly-republican.html,The United States is becoming increasingly Republican but it is becoming more conservative only selected issues according to the latest New York TimesCBS News Poll Democrats still outnumber Republicans but the Democratic lead is only half what it was when last years Presidential campaign began The changes as measured by the poll offer Republicans an opportunity to effect a classic political realignment comparable to the Democratic accession to power in the 1930s Charles T Manatt chairman of the Democratic National Committee said his partys losses among younger Americans and Southerners had only identified groups the party must work on Richard Richards the Republican National Chairman said he thought the shifts did not yet mean realignment but that people are giving the Republican Party a chance The TimesCBS News Poll taken to measure trends as President Reagan completed three months in office indicates that more Americans from most population groups are calling themselves either Republicans or Republicanleaning independents In January l980 53 percent of those polled said they were Democrats or Democraticleaning independents while 33 percent said they were Republicans or Republicanleaning independents In the latest poll conducted April 22 to 26 among 1439 adults the Democratic margin was 49 percent to 41 percent with the remainder saying that they leaned to neither party Among those who said without qualification that they belonged to one party or the other the Democratic lead once 38 percent to 22 percent shrank to 34 percent to 22 percent This shift in partisan identification may be confirming earlier changes of position on some issues But it was not accompanied in this poll by increases in support measured over the last one to four years for a constitutional amendment allowing prayer in public schools or by more opposition to abortion or the proposed Federal equal rights amendment reduced support for tighter gun control or greater opposition to unmarried couples who live together or to married women who work even if their husbands could support them Conservative positions on which this poll did disclose growing support in recent years included the view that the Government has gone too far in regulating business and interfering with the free enterprise system and that spending on food stamps should be cut Public backing of increased military expenditures slipped a little but remained high On the other hand support for national health insurance stayed as high as or higher than it was in 1980 While the poll showed that no sharp rightward shift on issues could explain the increase in Republicanism followup interviews with some of those questioned for the poll suggested that their unhappiness with the Democratic Party had been growing over several years They indicated that approval of Mr Reagan had crystallized that feeling into a decision to start calling themselves Republicans Alignment on Issues And though nearly half of those polled said at first that there was no significant difference between the parties the respondents when they were asked specifically picked the Republicans as better able to handle inflation and Federal spending and barely better on unemployment and the Democrats as better in keeping the country out of war and helping the poor Even Democrats preferred Republicans on spending and Republicans picked Democrats on helping the poor This poll like many surveys in recent years found that on one issue after another the attitudes of closet partisans respondents who first said they were independent but then acknowledged that they were closer to one party than the other were only barely distinguishable from those who admit unhesitatingly to a party identification For that reason lumping allout partisans and independents who cite a leaning  and threefourths of those interviewed did so  is a widely accepted way of measuring party allegiance Trend in Baby Boom Group While there were shifts toward Republicanism in most population groups the most significant was the change among the now grownup children who constituted the baby boom that followed World War II the 25to 34yearolds A year ago that group was 56 percent Democratic and 30 percent Republican Today it is 44 percent Democratic and 43 percent Republican Past political realignments in the United States have been more heavily influenced by bringing new voters into the electorate than by changing the minds of those already in it and this is widely accepted academically as the way the Democratic New Deal coalition was built in the 1930s One of the leading scholars in the field Paul Allen Beck a professor of government at Florida State University said the other day I think realignment always occurs from mobilizing young voters He said the 25 to 34yearolds until now largely uninvolved in the electorate were ripe to mobilize Dramatic Shifts in Stands The other most dramatic shifts were among Southerners whites conservatives and possibly the elderly and Westerners Southerners overwhelmingly Democratic as last year began now match the patterns of the nation as a whole The change in their region has been sharper in the Outer South the states of Texas Oklahoma Tennessee Kentucky Virginia North Carolina and Florida than in Deep South states Whites went from a 49to36 percent Democratic edge over the Republicans to an alignment of 45 percent Republican and 44 percent Democratic Conservatives went from a 45to42 percent Democratic edge over Republicans to a 54to40 percent Republican advantage over the Democrats The latest respondents among people 65 years old and over who have shown sharp fluctuations in party identification in the last 15 months stood at 46 percent Democratic and 45 percent Republican a drop from a 22point Democratic lead 15 months ago And a 54to34 percent Democratic lead among Westerners had turned into a 45to42 percent Republican lead Fluctuation in 1981 Polls These last two groups showed the most fluctuation between the TimesCBS News Poll in January and the late April poll Most groups showed only slight movement between those two 1981 points and the national totals were almost identical with the January figure standing at 48 percent Democratic and 41 percent Republican Mr Manatt took that apparent stall as a sign of encouragement despite the tremendous personal popularity of the President That caused him he said to believe that Democrats will again gain strength as the Republican Administrations domestic programs are assessed and the Reagan foreign policy is more closely scrutinized Mr Richards was perhaps even more cautious in his analysis although the most recent poll taken for his party by Richard B Wirthlin shows only a 40 percent to 35 percent Democratic edge The Republican chairman said he interpreted the findings as indicating that Americans admired Mr Reagan as a symbol of the Republican Party adding People are willing to try us Uncertainty on Conservatism For all the current attention given conservatism this poll served as a reminder of the uncertainty with which the term is used by the public Fiftytwo percent of those interviewed said they could not think of the biggest difference between liberal and conservative views While 15 percent cited opinions on government spending 12 percent identified mental attitudes and temperament as the main distinction Far more striking than the differences between Protestants and Roman Catholics on several social issues were the differences within those religious classifications between those who attended church weekly or almost every week on one hand and those who were less frequent worshippers For example 43 percent of the public said it was always wrong for unmarried couples to live together a figure that was down from 48 percent in October 1977 Thirtythree percent of all Catholics and 49 percent of all Protestants took that stand But 49 percent of observant Catholics thought so while only 17 percent of those who did not worship regularly did Views on Unwed Cohabitation Among Protestants 71 percent of regular churchgoers called unwed cohabitation always wrong but only 33 percent of the less devout did For all that the poll indicated about public issues it also served as a reminder that the nation is at least as much optimistic as it is partisan or ideological Sixtyseven percent of the public responded yes when asked Do you think its possible nowadays for someone in this country to start out poor and become rich by working hard Twentyeight percent said it was not Westerners at 74 percent were among the most confident of that possibility and blacks at 57 percent agreement among the least Seventynine percent of those in the 40000plus familyincome group believed it was possible suggesting continuing vitality in the Horatio Alger story It was a question on which only 3 percent of the public said it did not know the answer Ideologues and Partisans

ANTI-ABORTION BILL OPPOSED BY 6 EX-ATTORNEYS GENERAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/03/us/anti-abortion-bill-opposed-by-6-ex-attorneys-general.html,Six former United States Attorneys General half Democrats and half Republicans have signed a letter describing as unconstitutional a bill designed to ban abortion by overruling a Supreme Court ruling In a letter sent yesterday to Senator Max Baucus Democrat of Montana the six former legal officers said the antiabortion bill was an attempt to exercise unconstitutional power and a dangerous circumvention of the avenues that the Constitution itself provides for reversing Supreme Court interpretations of the Constitution Senator Baucus is the ranking minority member of the Senate subcommittee that is considering the antiabortion bill The letter was signed by Herbert Brownell Jr who served in the Eisenhower Administration Nicholas deB Katzenbach and Ramsey Clark who served in the Johnson Administration Elliot L Richardson who served in the Nixon Administration William B Saxbe who served in the Nixon and Ford Administrations and Benjamin R Civiletti who served in the Carter Administration Similar Letter From Scholars The letter was similar to one sent to senators by 12 constitutional scholars on April 21 It was designed to demonstrate that prominent lawyers and scholars in both major parties conservatives as well as liberals agreed that the antiabortion bill was unconstitutional even though as the letter states our views about the correctness of the Supreme Courts 1973 abortion decision vary widely The 1973 decision Roe v Wade ruled that women have constitutional rights under the 14th Amendment to abort fetuses and rejected the argument that a fetus is a person protected by the 14th Amendment The bill designed to overrule this decision proposed by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina would declare that human life begins at conception and that an unborn fetus is a person protected by the 14th Amendment A similar bill had been introduced in the House by Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois The HelmsHyde bill has generated one of the most emotional debates in Congress this year Medical Opinion Differs Medical experts hold a variety of views about when life begins but antiabortion groups have pressed for passage of the legislation as a lifesaving measure while those who maintain that women should have a choice about terminating their pregnancies say the bill would make murderers not only of women who have abortions but also of those who use certain contraceptive devices All of us are agreed that Congress has no constitutional authority to overturn the Supreme Courts abortion ruling by enacting a statute redefining such terms as person or human life  the Attorneys General and constitutional scholars said in their letters They also said they regarded as unconstitutional a provision in the bill that would deprive the lower Federal courts but not the Supreme Court of power to review the constitutionality of state and local abortion laws The current Attorney General William French Smith said at a meeting with reporters this week that he did not yet have an opinion regarding the constitutionality of the HelmsHyde bill But President Reagan has spoken approvingly of the bill
AUTOMATIC POLITICAL REACTION...,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/03/opinion/automatic-political-reaction.html,Too much of the political discussion that we hear divides along predictable lines and the result is that we quickly guess what is coming next The reason is the automatic response The automatic response comes in several varieties of which conservative and liberal are probably the most familiar It is guaranteed to bore all but its true believers and far worse it keeps us from seeing sensible solutions to our problems Take defense where Republicans tend to be uncritical supporters of more spending while Democrats spent most of the l970s automatically opposing the military People like Senator Gary Hart of Colorado who advocates a strong national defense but opposes wasting money on weapons that arent needed or dont work have been rare indeed James Fallows author of the coming book National Defense asked Richard Viguerie the conservative Republican fundraiser why he automatically supported defense spending Because so many liberals automatically oppose it was Mr Vigueries reply Mr Fallows then asked Elizabeth Holtzman a liberal who was Democratic Representative from New York how she responded to that charge With all the graciousness that made her a former Representative she replied I wont dignify that with an answer The regulation issue is another on which people split automatically into pro and anti groups with little attempt to discriminate between regulations that are needed to protect life do you really want your baby deformed by a dangerous drug and regulations that needlessly stifle competition Of course the subject that inspires the most automatic of automatic responses is abortion The proabortion people absolutely refuse to acknowledge the obvious truth that a life is being destroyed The antiabortion people refuse to acknowledge the occasions when having a baby would be disastrous for a mother or her family or the toughest fact of all the fate that is suffered by children who are truly unwanted Not long ago I read a newspaper article about the remarkable success enjoyed by the Austrian economy in the l970s That success was attributed in part to a surprising combination of Keynesian and monetarist principles The right solutions to our problems could have similarly mixed ideological roots But we wont find out as long as we are prisoners of the automatic response To make our automatic responses less automatic we need to face complexity and take pride in doing so We dont have to abandon morality to deal with complexity indeed the most moral decision is usually the one that takes all factors into account Nor do we have to sacrifice our determination to get things done  which is of course what some people really mean when they say Well thats a very complicated matter They want you to give up to stop bothering them The way to deal with the problem of the automatic response might be to introduce into the American educational system experiences comparable to those a trial lawyer must go through before presenting a case to the jury He cannot be a prisoner of the automatic response because that is the sure path to defeat He must open himself up to every fact and argument in his opponents favor He must scrutinize his own case to see what will ring false or unpersuasive to the l2 people on the jury He must continually expose his own arguments to the questions that reasonable men would have Of course this is something the worst of the automatic responders hate to do In my experience as an editor I have often had to deal with kneejerk liberal and conservative writers They actually get choleric when I try to make them face the reasonable arguments of the other side They obviously think that their articles will be weakened if they acknowledge the valid points of their opponents when in fact their articles would be better if they faced them enriching their own positions with an acceptance of the other sides good points and making their own position more convincing because they have demonstrated to the reader that they arent some blind zealot Think of a failing marriage It can usually be saved only when the parties stop replaying in their minds the litany of arguments that inflame their sense of selfrighteousness and really begin to really to the legitimate points of their partners That is exactly what concerned liberal and conservative Americans must begin to do

"MRS KING OFFERS TO QUIT AS W.T.A. HEAD, SO NOT TO HURT PLAYERS",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/03/sports/mrs-king-offers-to-quit-as-wta-head-so-not-to-hurt-players.html,Billie Jean King said yesterday she was prepared to resign as president of the Womens Tennis Association if they dont want me as president anymore Concerned about the widespread publicity generated over her admission Friday of a lesbian relationship with her former secretary Marilyn Barnett Mrs King said I dont want to hurt the players Miss Barnett a 32yearold former hair dresser filed suit earlier in the week asserting that she was entitlted to part of Mrs Kings property between 1972 and 1979 because of their relationship during that period On Friday Mrs King called a news conference and admitted the affair The tennis women have been dynamite through all of this Mrs King said in a telephone interview Every one of them Im going to offer them whatever they want me to do as president If they dont want me anymore I can appreciate that fact Its been a strain on them already which really bothers me The players are being harassed and Im protective of the players because I think theyre good to each other I want them left alone Let the publications parents and officials deal with me Im the one Leave the players alone New Can of Worms Mrs King said she had been told by some players that several national publications had offered them as much as 20000 to discuss the situation on the womens tour If Marilyn had not raised the issue she said I probably would not have discussed it publicly because I feel it opens a whole new can of worms for a lot of other people You can talk about yourself as an individual but whatever you say always affects other people like a pebble in a pond Theres that rippling effect I always worry that I may be hurting somebody else I have to be careful about that because everyone has a right to their own privacy I really believe in that I dont care what world youre in Larry King her husband who was also named in the suit said Billie Jean is not trying to set a trend She only spoke up out of dire necessity Miss Barnetts lawyer Joel Ladin told The Associated Press in Los Angeles Saturday that his client would respond to Mrs Kings statement later next week He said his client had told him she was pleased and relieved that Mrs King had made the admission Larry King attended a meeting of tournament directors several days ago in Orlando Fla They were more or less empathetic he said and felt it was a tough situation Long term in the corporate board rooms they may have to review that strategy but at first glance they view tennis as a small society To Play in Doubles Event In the interview Mrs King said she had volunteered to withdraw as a doubles partner of Andrea Jaeger 15 years old in next weeks 150000 Bridgestone doubles event in Tokyo I told the Jaegers they didnt have to feel obligated Mrs King said But theyre absolutely adamant about Andrea playing so I guess I better start practicing again Mrs King said she expected the worst from the disclosures  from a possible loss of endorsement revenue to negative public reaction She again described her relationship with Miss Barnett as a mistake but defended her sensitivities as an athlete who she said had fought for equality everywhere and had symbolized success for young people You dont know when a person is going to be unkind to another person she said I dont think it has anything to do with sexual preference I feel that basically Marilyn was a mistake For me its an odd situation I dont feel homosexual Thats not my feelings and I dont understand why people feel that Im any less of a person What theyre saying is that it equals bad if someone happens to be homosexual Its a fear an unknown fear and people dont understand it Mrs Kings career has been involved in controversy from the time she admitted undergoing an abortion to her futile attempt last year to establish a separate womens United States Open at the new indoor arena in the New Jersey Meadowlands Tells of Hate Mail The abortion issue was very painful she said retrospectively I got so much hate mail And now abortion is getting so hot again and I get upset with what I see and hear She said she had never seen a female tennis player attempt to influence others on sexual preference Lets say were on a mixed circuit and a guy picks up a girl she theorized Ive never seen what happens there either I think the players are basically good people There are a few who arent kind but that has nothing to do with sexual preference Miss Barnett was not a mystery woman on the tour She was mentioned in A Long Way Baby Grace Lichtensteins 1974 book about the womens circuit and also in Love and Faults Ted Tinlings 1979 autobiography Her presence was especially noticeable in dealing with the news media before and after Mrs Kings 1973 Battle of the Sexes with Bobby Riggs in Houston Mrs Kings husband a sports promoter acknowledged that their marriage which often has had them apart for long periods was very unusual even by todays standards You have to look at it from the personalities involved he said Most people have some glimpse of Billie Jean as a highcharged emotional person with a high level of personal contact Shes very compelling and draining She has a need for total attention Im different I like to have 12 problems at one time and give a little bit of attention to each one of the 12 I dont have this need for total attention from any one person or group of people We have very different capacities for needing personal attention from each other which has created a certain amount of conflict You resolve these in any relationship by either making certain tolerances or breaking up the relationship My family is from Finland Im a very stubborn person That reflects on my relationship with Billie Jean Theres a high degree of loyalty Other people may not see it as loyalty but I love Billie Jean Ive never stopped loving her and that translates not into possession but into trying to do whatever makes her the happiest Most people look at love as an ability to possess people I look at it as sharing with them loving them and wanting the best for them I love Billie Jean and Ill always love Billie Jean That doesnt mean that she might not be happier because of her capacity and needs for attention with some other person
JUDGE FLIPS FAMILY ALBUM,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/03/weekinreview/judge-flips-family-album.html,Is a husband the head and master of his household Should parents be notified by the doctor before their pregnant teenage daughter can have an abortion May minor children be permanently taken away from their parents if the parents dont do a good job of raising them The questions are not from the mailbag of a newspapers personal advice columnist but from the docket of the United States Supreme Court for the current term Like the dockets of other courts all over the nation the Supreme Courts is a barometer of the dramatic changes occurring in the American family As evidence of these changes consider this random sample of recent court cases  In Los Angeles last week a Superior Court judge approved the removal of four children from their parents custody after the police said a pattern of criminality in the home ultimately would lead the children into lives of crime  Last month in a case that the Supreme Court declined to review a divorced lesbian mother in Louisville Ky sought unsuccessfully to keep custody of her 3yearold daughter arguing that she and her livein female lover could give the child as good a home as her former husband  A county court judge in Easton Pa ruled that despite objections by her natural parents a 23yearold woman had a legal right to change her family name and be adopted by another couple And a family court judge in New York City allowed one homosexual adult man to adopt another  The Supreme Courts of New Jersey and Massachusetts ruled that a man could be criminally prosecuted for raping his wife  The California Supreme Court decided that a husband could not give his children his surname over his wifes objections  A Pennsylvania Superior Court awarded custody of a 14yearold girl to her maternal grandparents who had waged a court battle against the girls parents to keep her  The Massachusetts Supreme Court said husbands and wives could sue each other and the Supreme Courts in Minnesota and South Carolina ruled that minor children could sue their parents All three courts rejected longobserved doctrine that such lawsuits were inimical to family harmony Many cases like these end up at the top of the nations judicial pyramid the Supreme Court They are being brought under legal theories that can be in effect openended invitations for imposition of the nine Justices personal preferences since the constitutional language invoked as grounds contains no direct clue as to its intended impact on the family In the current explosion of family law litigation creative lawyers rely upon such rights as that of privacy which is explicitly mentioned nowhere in the Constitution and on such broad and malleable legal concepts as due process and equal protection under the 14th Amendment a provision that has been in effect since 1868 but whose meaning and purpose are still the subject of heated debate among legal scholars Traditional Values How much the Justices rely on their personal values and experience in deciding family law cases is anyones guess However some decisions seem to reflect traditional values For instance the Supreme Court decided in March that a Utah law requiring doctors to notify the parents of a minor girl before performing an abortion did not violate the girls right of privacy In that case a 15yearold girl who lived at home wanted an abortion without her parents finding out The Court in an opinion by Chief Justice Warren E Burger said the statute furthered legitimate state interests that favored the family and were more important than the girls privacy In another case decided the same day the Court held unconstitutional as a violation of the equal protection clause a Louisiana law that gave a husband as head and master of all property owned jointly with his wife the unilateral right to dispose of it without her consent Nominally the decision dealt only with state laws regulating the disposition of property In the process however the Court also made an important statement about the equality of husband and wife in making important family decisions How did the courts become involved in such matters Not by direct choice Judges must wait until litigants bring cases to them they are not free to decide issues at random The Supreme Court itself probably opened the door to adjudication of family life issues early this century As early as 1923 the Court said that part of the liberty guaranteed by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment was an individuals right to marry establish a home and bring up children Two years later the Court declared that parents had the right to direct the upbringing and education of their children free from unreasonable state interference In 1944 the Court spoke in a third case of the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter These cases generally dealt with fairly clearcut conflicts between state laws on the welfare of children  compulsory education and child labor laws for instance  and claims by parents that their fundamental right to guide their childrens upbringing had higher Constitutional standing An Expanding Realm However as the nature of family life changed particularly after World War II disputes that used to be settled in the home began to spill out by the thousands into the nations courtrooms Since the 1960s what is loosely known as family law or domestic relations law has expanded beyond divorce and child custody matters to encompass problems related to homosexuality foster parents artificial insemination surrogate mothers and grandparents demands to visit or have permanent custody of their grandchildren to name but a few Where the courtroom opponents used to be the parents and the state judges now face cases where parents are opposing each other or their own children where grandparents and foster parents are opposing natural parents and where states invoking the best interests of the child may be opposing everyone else
PRAYER AND ABORTION ARE PRIVATE MATTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/03/opinion/l-prayer-and-abortion-are-private-matters-109523.html,To the Editor I have been thinking how grateful I am being a citizen of the United States and how our Constitution with its guarantees of liberty has made this nation now over 200 years old a stronghold of democracy where people of every background and religion have been able to live together in peace and create a real national identity One of the most important guarantees in the Constitution is the separation of church and state which is now being challenged by some pressure groups I find this very disturbing Why introduce prayer into the public schools Whose prayer Surely this is a very private thing and there is plenty of time in the home for the children to pray according to the teachings of their parents Another thing that seems to me to be a religious question is abortion That too is a very personal matter for a woman to decide  whether or not to have an unwanted child or possibly a handicapped one Her decision should be between her and her conscience and not according to the dictates of any legislative body either nation or state I hope our legislators will realize that they are acting unconstitutionally in considering prayer in the schools and antiabortion laws and they should get back to the really important job for which they are elected  attending to the economy of the country and the health and welfare of its citizens HENRIETTA MACDONNELL New York April 29 1981

ONSET OF HUMAN LIFE: ANSWER ON CRUCIAL MOMENT ELUSIVE; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/04/us/onset-of-human-life-answer-on-crucial-moment-elusive-news-analysis.html,The introduction by antiabortion Senators of a bill that would define the legal commencement of human life as the moment of conception has given new urgency to a debate among scientists that began in July 1978 after the birth of Louise Brown the first person born after being conceived in a glass dish The discussion has focused on defining the extent to which a newly conceived embryo enjoys human rights  According to the Senate bill proposed by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina and Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois The Congress finds that present day scientific evidence indicates a significant likelihood that actual human life exists from conception Last week at the annual meeting of the National Academy of Sciences some 150 academy members representing the nations scientific elite debated how to respond They then passed a resolution almost unanimously that said such a statement cannot stand up to the scrutiny of science No Answer From Science It deals with a question the resolution added to which science can provide no answer The definition of when a developing embryo becames a person the resolution said must remain a matter of moral or religious values The resolution represented the Academys first involvement with this subject Its only related action was a 1972 resolution on the validity of the concept of Darwinian evolution as opposed to creationism Since the birth of Louise Brown a number of scientists and specialists in medical ethics have examined ways to define the critical time when a developing human being becomes entitled to full legal protection In 1979 the problem was dealt with in depth by the Ethics Advisory Board of the Department of Health Education and Welfare Over a sixmonth period the department held 11 public hearings commissioned studies by a number of specialists and received more than 2000 communications on the subject Debate on TestTube Babies The question of embryo rights had became critical because the procedure that made possible birth of the first testtube baby could possibly lead to the discarding of a newly fertilized egg that under microscopic examination appeared to be developing abnormally Thus the issue parallels the debate on abortions The procedure that led to the birth of Louise Brown can be used when the mother has a blockage of the fallopian tubes along which a new egg cell travels each month from an ovary to the uterus Normally it is in the course of this journey that the egg is fertilized This form of sterility affects about one in 500 women and in the procedure for overcoming the problem a mature egg cell is surgically removed from the womans ovary and fertilized in the laboratory by sperm from the husband The fertilized egg is cultured through several cell divisions and if normal is inserted into the uterus for gestation The Ethics Advisory Board heard testimony on both sides of the issue Paul Ramsey a professor of religion at Princeton University argued that no woman should want a baby under such circumstances High Loss of Embryos While the board in its conclusions said it was in agreement that the human embryo is entitled to profound respect it added that this respect does not necessarily encompass the full legal and moral rights attributed to persons It noted the high rate of embryo loss in natural reproduction and proposed that some embryo loss associated with attempts to help infertile couples to bear children be regarded as acceptable from an ethical standpoint under certain conditions It is estimated that about two out of three embryos conceived in the normal manner are aborted almost immediately without the mothers knowledge presumably because they are defective Some supporters of laboratory fertilization argue that the procedure may even reduce the percentage of defective embryos The findings of the board were not greeted with universal acclaim Of the 13000 public comments received most were said to have been adverse Coping With Sterility Meanwhile however attempts to cope with sterility through laboratory fertilization and embryo culture have continued with a low success rate At last report the British group had accepted 70 women for treatment and had obtained mature eggs from 45 of them Of these 35 were successfully fertilized All but three of the eggs began to develop and were inserted into the mother Four insertions resulted in pregnancies two of which aborted two ended with normal births In the May 8 issue of the journal Science a group of Australian researchers reported achieving four normal pregnancies in this manner A clinic in Norfolk Va has undertaken similar treatments but has not yet reported any successes When researchers sought Federal approval for research aimed at improving the success rate the Ethics Advisory Board was asked to examine the issues involved Clifford Grobstein a professor of biological science and public policy at the University of California in San Diego has explored the problem in a book From Chance to Purpose  An Appraisal of External Human Fertilization to be published this spring by AddisonWesley He examines embryonic development as it relates to the emergence of personhood or self in the sense of a sentient human being Writer Poses Questions Does it turn on like a light in development or is its beginning more like painting a picture or writing a novel he asks When is enough completed to say it exists He notes that in fact life is continuous and began only once  some three billion years ago Human life like that of all species descends without break from generation to generation he wrote It waxes and wanes in complexity but never begins de novo He also points out that new developments in mouse cloning bypass conception as the critical moment in creation of a new individual Professor Grobstein reasons that the early embryo is a potential human being rather than a person But he adds this does not resolve the many issues raised not only by abortions but by the new opportunities for laboratory study of embryo development It is now possible to study the earliest stages of human development which were previously hidden from scrutiny Such studies could lead to major advances such as an understanding of how some birth defects originate But Professor Grobstein says they raise ethical questions that are not yet resolved

NEW ACCORD TO END IMPASSE ON BUDGET REPORTED IN ALBANY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/08/nyregion/new-accord-to-end-impasse-on-budget-reported-in-albany.html,Legislative leaders and Governor Carey announced agreement today on virtually the same version of the 166 billion state budget they had presented as an accord on April 28 I hope this time weve got it right said Stanley Fink the Assembly Speaker For the last week the Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson Republican of Binghamton contended that there had been a misunderstanding about longrange tax cuts his Senate colleagues had sought and that he could not therefore support the initial agreement Tax Relief Improvements Today the Democrats offered an increase in their initial taxrelief plan changing it from 1 billion over five years to 115 billion for the same period The offer seemed to make the accord more palatable to Senator Anderson who said I dont think its last weeks agreement There are substantial cuts in taxes He calculated that the Democrats new program was worth 12 billion The Republicans had sought a 2 billion program The major changes in the Democratic plan are a 100 increase in the standard deduction in 1981 and a 50 increase in the personal exemption now 750 in 1982 A number of taxrelief measures for business are also included Speaker Fink and Senator Anderson appeared at separate news conferences today Last week they emerged from the Governors office to proclaim an end to the budget impasse which has paralyzed state fiscal operations since April 1 New Snarl Possible Governor Carey said at a news conference tonight that the agreement was almost hermetically sealed Mr Fink and Senator Anderson said that budget measures would probably be considered by the two houses on Monday but they predicted a snarl on the issue of including Medicaid funds for abortion Both legislative leaders said there had been substantial agreement on all issues except a schoolaid formula The leaders are still trying to agree on a way to distribute 287 million in school aid which Mr Anderson would like to see more heavily committed to districts outside New York City Mr Fink a Brooklyn Democrat said today that he had been in contact with Governor Carey several times and was speaking for him The Speaker suggested that todays agreement was hastened when Mr Anderson became aware that the Assembly Democrats intended to push the initial budget agreement through their house tomorrow Senator Anderson however said today He didnt discuss that with me That did not have any motivation on me at all As in last weeks version this budget does not include a state takeover of the local costs of Medicaid an initiative that Governor Carey had called the centerpiece of his economic plan It does include 300 million in revenueproducing measures that the Democrats sought and that the Senate Republicans had said they could not accept without more tax relief The state  without a budget since the 198182 fiscal year began April 1  has been unable to pay its bills and has been running on credit from vendors long accustomed to delays in payment from the state State employees have now received five payrolls in scrip a form of iou School districts are struggling without 2 billion in aid due from the state Hospitals and nursing homes have been borrowing money to cover Medicaid reimbursement funds the state owes them Among the tax relief measures the legislative leaders now support are an exclusion from state taxes of any pension income up to 20000 an increase in the investment tax credit to 6 percent over the next two years from the current 4 percent and a 4 percent investment tax credit for research and development As in the budget of last week statelocal revenue sharing would remain frozen at 800 million and an additional 80 million would be set aside as a reserve to be distributed to small upstate cities showing need About 15 million would be allocated for a criminal justice improvement program a measure pressed by Mr Fink Although Speaker Fink had vowed this year not to serve as what his aides called the Swedish Embassy in dealings with Governor Carey and Mr Anderson the Assemblys Democratic leader ultimately found himself in that position He shuttled between offices yesterday and today he held meetings in his office and kept the Governor in touch with the negotiations by telephone Earlier this week Mr Fink had rejected as insane a counteroffer by Senator Anderson that had cut out all the aid programs the Democrats believed were part of the initial agreement Among the tax changes supported by the legislative leaders but still subject to adjustment are  The portion of capital gains from the sale of a home or other investment that is subject to state income tax would be reduced to 40 percent from 50 percent  Publishers in New York State would get a tax break by being permitted to allocate advertising revenues for tax purposes based on where their publication is sold rather than where it is produced  The exclusion limit for businesses on officers salaries would be increased to 30000 from 15000  New businesses that have few profits would be exempt from a form of corporate franchise tax that assesses them based on their capital New businesses would also be permitted to take part in the employment incentive credit in their first year of operation To encourage investment the leaders are considering measures that would give some form of capital gains tax relief to individuals investing in new businesses Also a corporation would be able to get a deferral of capital gains income if that gain is reinvested in a new business within the state The state would conform to a Federal law that allows a corporation of 15 or fewer shareholders to distribute its taxable income and dividends to shareholders as personal income New York State now taxes that income as part of a corporate franchise tax as well as personal income
ALBANY ATTAINS BUDGET ACCORD ON SCHOOLS AID,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/09/nyregion/albany-attains-budget-accord-on-schools-aid.html,The last negotiable item of the New York State budget fell into place today as Assembly and Senate negotiators agreed on a new plan to distribute public school aid around the state The plan provides for an increase of 287 million in state aid to public schools which would receive a total of 4063 billion from the state in this fiscal year Of the increase 1036 million would go to New York City which would receive a total of 1215 billion from the state Essentially the plan is the same as the one that had been proposed by the Democrats who dominate the Assembly with the addition of certain revisions and protections that had been demanded by the Republicanled Senate to benefit upstate districts Minimum Assurance The formula protects anq of the states 714 school districts from receiving less money from the state than they did in the previous fiscal year which ended March 31 Senator Warren M Anderson Republican of Binghamton and the majority leader said a computer analysis of the formula showed that 265 school districts around the state would receive more than they did last year Other details of the plan were not immediately available The Legislature is expected to begin debating the longdelayed budget on Monday The only major battle remaining is an expected fight over the inclusion of state funds for Medicaid abortions and that Senator Anderson said is a matter thats in the hands of other than me Im relaxed Senator Anderson said for the first time in a month
CONSERVATIVE MORALITY; by Burton Zwiebach,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/09/opinion/conservative-morality-by-burton-zwiebach.html,There is an unanticipated dividend for liberals in the conservatives domestic program further evidence if more is needed of the hollowness of the conservatives commitment to freedom Clearly we cannot pretend that conservatives are passionate protectors of the classical liberties of speech conscience expression and privacy In nearly every battle fought over these issues in the dast half century conservatives have been on the other side It is late in the day for those who attacked the Warren Court and who supported Joseph R McCarthy unauthorized wiretaps mass arrests coercion of the press and who now support the renewal of internalsecurity investigations to pose as the last hope of our constitutional freedoms Their claim that government has intruded into our lives that we are being swallowed up in a sea of bureaucratic manipulation reflects a concern not for freedom of the individual but for something else What is this something else Consider the implications of the crusade for free markets and family values On the one hand conservatives propose to grant corporations a substantial immunity from public control We know that the policy will not result in the advancement of corporate virtue But we are told that wealth and prosperity result from enlisting human greed not human virtue On the other hand conservatives want to introduce serious controls on sexual and personal behavior by restricting abortions requiring parental notification of teenagers abortions eliminating sex education etc We know that this policy will result in many more pregnancies  frequently tragic ones  and backalley abortions But here policy demands that we choose virtue and flee greed Conservatives have not explained why the failure of public virtue is tolerable while the failure of private virtue is not But no matter  the issue remember is freedom The problem therefore is to understand the alchemy by which regulation of great quasipublic institutions is akin to despotism while regulation of the most private and intimate aspects of a persons life is the stuff of liberty We want to understand the arcane turn of mind that holds it wrong to enforce moral virtue on the public body of the corporation  whose decisions affect millions and who for its own wellbeing cheerfully sacrifices theirs but right to enforce moral virtue on the private body of say a terrified teenaged girl whose decisions affect no one more than herself The best explanation for this apparent anomaly is the most obvious Conservatives are interested in order and what guarantees order is not freedom but social hierarchy and unequal power The market economy appeals to conservatives not merely because it creates wealth but because it promotes inequality  the only virtue that is for conservatives its own reward Similarly the conservative interest demands the regulation of morals for social hierarchy thrives on the medicine of traditional morality It is commitment to order and inequality not freedom that renders the conservative program coherent and the apocalyptical visions of its moralists comprehensible Conservatives policies show that freedom is no more to them than a slogan It is a useful slogan although characteristically it has taken them some time to understand its utility Nineteenth century conservatives feared liberty as they abhorred democracy because these institutions threatened to overturn the social applecart In this they were only partly right without equality democracy and liberty are tame affairs Twentieth century conservatives have seen this They have learned that because powerlessness corrupts they need not fear democracy encased in an inegalitarian social system because familiarity breeds indifference the shock of witnessing poverty soon wears thin because each man strives to be an island entire of itself providing a person with the opportunity to escape from social evil convinces him of the pointlessness of remedying it To see in this a philosophy of freedom is to reduce philosophy to a party line and to make freedom a description of pretenses rather than of the activities of robust living souls But it is the robust character of our souls that matters because it is that character that enables us to confront unjust power The widespread development of that character is the rationale of both equality and freedom Behind conservatives criticism of entitlements ridiculing of welfare rejection of the undeserving poor lies a mentality that seeks to limit the spread of this character Why Perhaps conservatives realize that its spread will entail a challenge to their hierarchical utopia If that is the reason it is at least a sign of clear thinking and a recognition of their fundamental moral roots  Burton Zwiebach author of Civility and Disobedience teaches political theory at Queens College and the Graduate

DEMOCRATS VIE TO OPPOSE PURCELL,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/10/nyregion/democrats-vie-to-oppose-purcell.html,NASSAU Democrats who were having trouble finding a candidate for County Executive now have two men fighting for the nomination in what looms as a potentially damaging primary contest John W Matthews of Long Beach a 43yearold insulation contractor and vice chairman of the Nassau Democratic organization was designated last Monday by the partys county committee to challenge County Executive Francis T Purcell However Mr Matthews faces a primary challenge in September from Assemblyman Lewis J Yevoli 42 of Old Bethpage who is accusing his own party leadership of an insidious deal with Nassau Republicans The contest judging by the county committee meeting at the Salisbury Restaurant in Eisenhower Park shapes up as one between a lowkey relatively inexperienced candidate and an aggressive streetwise legislator Three months ago the party formed a search committee to find a candidate after two frontrunners  District Attorney Denis E Dillon and David H Peirez who lost the County Executive primary four years ago  said they did not want to run Mr Matthews headed the search committee which Mr Yevoli said never interviewed him Democrats generally agreed that the trial of Joseph M Margiotta the Nassau Republican chairman and the questionable patronage tactics it laid bare encouraged the sudden surplus of Democratic candidates for County Executive Mr Margiotta was the target during nominating and seconding speeches at the meeting with Mr Yevoli and his supporters the most critical The legislator criticized Mr Purcell as a Margiotta marionette He attacked as kickbacks not patronage the 900000 in municipal insurance commissions and fees that were split with Republicans who did little or no work for the money A Federal Court jury was unable to reach a verdict on the charges of mail fraud and extortion against Mr Margiotta that grew out of the fee spliting Mr Yevoli coupled his attacks on Mr Margiotta with criticism of his own party leader Stanley Harwood the Nassau Democratic chairman The legislator accused Mr Harwood of an insidious deal with Mr Margiotta a reference to a bipartisan agreement on judgeships in which Mr Harwood is expected to receive Republican endorsement for a Supreme Court judgeship in September Mr Matthews sought to put some distance between himself and Mr Harwood by declaring in his acceptance speech that Stanley Harwood is beside me now but he wasnt by my side he wasnt at my back when I visited every leader myself Mr Harwood supported Mr Matthews but many Democrats agreed that the candidate had started enlisting supporters while Mr Yevoli was still considering whether to run In addition Mr Matthews has been involved in the party inner circle while Mr Yevoli is a loner who has publicly criticized Mr Harwood as a weak leader Mr Harwood and Mr Matthews dismissed the Yevoli criticism of the party leaders relationship with Mr Margiotta Mr Harwood said that his agreement with Mr Margiotta would not inhibit criticism of the GOP leader However he added that I dont believe a campaign can be waged solely on attacking the other candidate and the leader of the other party Mr Matthews said that Mr Harwood who had offered to help Mr Margiotta and previous Democratic leaders who had used the insurance commission patronage themselves  although to a considerable lesser degree than the Republicans  have to answer for what they have done He said that he doubted the efficacy of attacking Mr Margiotta and the Nassau Republican organization in any event Weve been running against it for years and weve been losing he said He said he preferred to emphasize economy and inefficiency in government sales tax cuts and the shifting of sales tax revenues from county to school districts to alleviate the property tax load Mr Matthews a Roman Catholic like Mr Yevoli raised the abortion issue in his speech when he said he would speak to womens issues at every opportunity including the right of a woman to control her own body Asked later why he raised the sensitive question which is largely a state rather than a county issue and could cost him votes Mr Matthews said that people want to know where you stand on important issues He added that too often Democrats have waffled on the question He has run twice before for County Clerk and for the House of Representatives and lost  a record Mr Yevoli points up Mr Yevoli a fourterm legislator who was described by one of his seconders as a rarity in Nassau a Democrat who wins nevertheless lost an election four years ago partly because of GOP revelations of unpaid personal bills Either Mr Matthews or Mr Yevoli will head a Democratic ticket this year that will include Mr Dillon who was unanimously designated for renomination and an as yet unselected comptroller candidate Harold Berger a Democratic Party leader was designated as a temporary standin candidate for comptroller at the meeting but some leaders are trying to persuade Richard Kessel who has probably been the most vocal Democratic critic of the Purcell administration to run Mr Kessel said he was reluctant because he feared that Mr Dillon would accept a bipartisan endorsement and thus undercut the Democratic ticket
A REFUSAL TO PERCEIVE SOCIAL PROBLEMS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/10/archives/a-refusal-to-perceive-social-problems.html,THE demographics of the 1980s from my point of view are little different from what they were 30 years ago when I hitchhiked from Minnesota to New York City to live and work as a student group worker on 124th Street around the corner from the St Theresa Hotel  The demographics at that time forced those of us in the humanservices field to give attention to children the elderly the disabled and the blind As I look ahead to the 80s these are the areas to which we in public welfare and it is hoped volunteerism as well will devote our attention and mobilize our energies First let me focus on children Thirty years ago when I spent a short time living and working in the streets of Harlem it was obvious that housing was critical jobs in short supply family breakdown rampant and delinquency and illegitimacy a crisis The changing life styles of the American family the explosion in sexual activity among young people the continued deterioration of our central cities our educational shortcomings the lack of jobs and decent housing insure that the 80s will continue to reel from the results of these problems and demographics Increasingly we will see unwanted and abused children alienated troubled and disturbed children and also the need to rescue salvage treat and prepare these castoffs and victims of this changing society for a constructive rather than a destructive future The elderly are an exploding segment of the population Their numbers are growing People are living longer and becoming more isolated Nearly 30 years ago when I worked in a small rural county on the northernmost point in the United States in Minnesota I had three experiences that helped me understand the particular needs of the elderly In one case I worked with an old sick man badly in need of care We took him to a nursing home where he received ideal nursing care He complained however that he felt he was treated like an inanimate object I called it sanitized care And when he wanted to leave I agreed to it feeling strongly that he wished to go home to die The nursing home provided competent physical care but he needed some kindness and human caring Lacking that he was willing to settle for simple human dignity Some time later he froze to death in his shack He preferred it that way maintaining his independence and dignity to the end There was another elderly man whose family demanded that he be protected for his own good by being moved to a nursing home He was a stroke victim When I visited him at his home I found him on a ladder two stories high putting up his storm windows only half of his body working Put him away No way What he needed was some support to help him remain at home where he felt he had a right to be The third instance was that of an elderly woman a mother of 13 children She needed assistance and I a young conscientious social worker canvassed all the children to provide the help she needed but without success She said to me Isnt it interesting how one mother can raise 13 children but 13 children cant take care of one mother Yes the demographics of the 80s certainly seem to indicate that family responsibility is dead Elderly people should be permitted to live out their lives with reasonably good health and with dignity In fact they are often warehoused in institutions that provide little more than keeping them out of societys sight Or even worse they are released into the streets without safeguards or protection Given the choice would any of us prefer sanitized care over humanity and warmth What priorities are provided by our society For the elderly the needs are clear Will volunteerism support their needs Will the public sector have the resources to support them Or is the safety net already crumbling And the disabled fare little better in these times Once again I can recall a man of almost 60 with a family of 13 children all living in three rooms He had no skills at all We had a Workforce program even then Such people trimmed bushes along the highways It was necessary for this man to walk three to five miles into town each day to catch his truck despite the fact that he was disabled He was a Russian immigrant gruff taciturn hard to understand neither liked nor understood by the community His frustration must have been a heavy burden Frequently he found that after walking to town to meet his transportation his coworkers had left early and he was forced to walk back home The Year of the Disabled There are those who are disabled other than physically They lack social skills or talent or have far less than their share of the worlds goods These are the people who are unable to meet the skill requirements for the jobs of the 80s or the communitys social expectations They may be truly classed as the rejects of our society And their plight is even more perilous as we face in the 80s one of the major revolutions of all time  a technological revolution the age of the computer The marginally literate those considered unattractive the middleaged fearful displaced worker are all becoming the economically disabled population of the 80s It is predicted that robots increasingly will replace assemblyline workers in Detroit This supposedly will help General Motors compete more effectively with Japan in reducing manufacturing costs But what about the castoff assemblyline people What will happen to them in the 80s Despite the hard facts we hear many people saying Do away with CETA jobs public service makework jobs and eliminate public concern with employment Our own President recently announced that unemployment was not a real issue in this country and referred to some 40 pages of job advertisements in The New York Times He is failing to consider that the worker of the 80s will face a decade of unequaled technological change  a decade when the computer will most certainly displace the marginal worker What then happens to the people no one needs those who lack talents or skills And we are not even considering the physically and emotionally disabled who need our attention too But it is the plight of the blind that troubles me most deeply Years ago while working in New Orleans I came across a client who had a peculiar illness I remember her neighbor being confused when I referred to it by name Hansens disease The neighbor indicated the doctor had called it something else  a terrible name she could not remember The name was leprosy At that time people who had leprosy could not travel on public transportation The place for treatment of Hansens disease was at Carville La in the leprosarium In order to get the client to Carville I took her in my car What does this have to do with blindness The people who lived in the Carville area did not appreciate having the treatment center so close to them and repeatedly removed the signs to Carville It was a very hard to find your way to Carville It was a psychological thing If there were no signs there was no leprosarium and therefore no lepers There is more than one kind of blindness And that kind is becoming a national problem We are refusing to see We are putting on our darkest glasses to shut out our human problems which are the true demographics of misery in America today It is blindness to imply that 40 pages of job opportunities in The New York Times indicate that employment is no longer a problem It is blind insensitivity to suggest that access to family planning and abortion be made difficult or impossible for our adolescents The results of such deliberate blindness are with us now  increasing child abuse uneducated and untrained young parents a continuing cycle of dependency It is total blindness to believe that the profit motive alone will give employment to the unemployable or decent humane care to the unwanted elderly and the handicapped or to accept that detention is the final answer to angry disturbed children I suggest that the demographics of the 80s are the changing dynamics of our families and our society with its distrust of children and the aging of a large part of our population without societys commitment to human understanding and caring for these needy among us whatever the public cost I suggest that one of the greatest concerns of our times is the deliberate blindness and scapegoating which accuses those who have cared who have become involved in trying to build a humane society as being motivated only by selfish reasons Within the scope of our own memories it was just such misguided thinking about the retarded the unpopular human misfits the different among us that led to the Third Reich in Germany in the 30s The demographics of the 80s do not really concern statistics and labels but rather the plans this society is making  or should be  making for the least of those among us
SISTERHOOD IS BRACED FOR THE REAGANAUTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/10/weekinreview/sisterhood-is-braced-for-the-reaganauts.html,For the womens movement which until the election of the new Administration seemed well on the way to becoming an accepted interest group these are hard times Now there is a President who opposes the Equal Rights Amendment who is lukewarm on affirmative action who favors a ban on abortions and who has endorsed budget cuts in programs of special relevance to women from education to food stamps By no sort of coincidence there has been a membership boom in the National Organization for Women This is the best period weve ever had said Eleanor Smeal NOWs president adding that new memberships since November were running at about 9000 or 10000 a month  two to three times the previous average The tone of the mail has totally changed she continued Its a lot like Thank God youre out there  Most women Mrs Smeal said even those prepared for change with the new Administration were surprised by the degree of rollback  I dont think people ever thought by April they would be looking at such reactionary proposals The White House says its cutbacks are part of a general commitment to austerity and that women are not a particular target Nevertheless policy changes such as cuts in funds for Title IX which guarantees equal opportunity in education cuts in grants for womenoriented programs such as nurses training cuts in Small Business Administration funding for womens programs and the elimination of a womeninscience program suggest to many in the movement that the time is past when government support for womens issues is assured or even likely But if anything according to Mrs Smeal the situation has galvanized our side creating a stronger counterforce That sense is shared by many others Donna Shalala the president of Hunter College and a former official with the Department of Housing and Urban Development said she believed the atmosphere would make women if anything even more focused The womens movement she believes must now go to the grass roots noting that it didnt start and isnt going to end in Washington Representative Barbara Mikulski a Maryland Democrat maintains that the ReaganStockman Administration is a direct assault on women and children in this country Lobbying and speaking out she noted has often been a function of collegeeducated women but now women in workingclass and poor communities have real fear and women are coming together There are all these sproutings One example of women coming together was a joint statement at the end of March by 24 womens groups from the League of Women Voters to the Womens Equity Action League assailing the Reagan Administrations budget cuts as inimical to womens interests Another new coalition The Alliance for Justice includes such publicaffairs law groups as the Womens Legal Defense Fund the Environmental Defense Fund and the Mental Health Law Project A similar organization is being put together by groups concerned with food and hunger issues which in the opinion of many analysts have a greater impact on women Women the aged the handicapped and minority groups said Judy Lichtman of the Womens Legal Defense Fund have been brought together by the severe jeopardy they face The Reagan Administration calls such alarm unjustified I dont know of any antiwomen feeling within the Administration said Red Cavaney the deputy to Elizabeth Dole who is the assistant to the President for public liaison Women must be treated as any other interest group he said in that their special concerns must be subordinated as the President takes his mandate to take a course of action to correct the economic problems he inherited The Pressures of Economics When the economic mess is straightened out Mr Cavaney said it will be time to address various groups Moreover in direct contrast to analyses made by members of the womens movement he expressed the belief that women being more economically vulnerable than men would be the first to benefit from an economic turnaround Phyllis Schlafly a leader of the fight aginst ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment agreed with Mr Cavaney that inflation is the principal problem and measures to correct it would mean that everyone is going to benefit She thought that Mr Reagan might have appointed more women to high positions but said that the ideology of his appointees was more important than their gender But many women including those closely involved in politics are not persuaded by such assurances Iris Mitgang who heads the National Womens Political Caucus said there is clear antiwoman feeling in the air in this Administration Youd have to be obtuse not to pick it up She hoped she said that feminists would learn some lessons about organization from the right and would be stronger better organized better funded in the future The caucus is focusing on the 1982 and 1984 elections and Miss Mitgang said she takes heart from the results of 1980 elections in which women made a two percent gain at the state level Now 901 women hold statelevel legislative office as well as 21 in the House of Representatives and two in the Senate Carol Bellamy the president of the New York City Council also referred to what she said was a dramatic disparity in voting patterns between men and women  it was noted by some pollsters that fewer women than men voted for Mr Reagan  as evidence that theres some energy out there More recently polling showed that substantially more women disapproved of Mr Reagans conduct of his office than did men Betty Friedan who is often called the mother of the womens movement has recently called for a return to committed volunteerism saying that reliance on the Government to provide social programs would be a mistake We are acting as if we have more time than we have she said The programs are being dismantled Mrs Friedan who just finished a book called The Second Stage has been saying for some time that the womens movement has reached a new phase and must begin to come to grips not only with the vicissitudes of politics but also with the changing American family The movement she said is now at the end of the beginning

PREGNANCY LAB REPORTS A SUCCESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/12/science/pregnancy-lab-reports-a-success.html,FOR the first time an American woman has become pregnant following the insertion into her womb of an embryo that had been fertilized in a glass dish by sperm from her husband it was announced yesterday in Norfolk Va Several pregnancies using a similar method and leading to normal births had previously been achieved in Britain and Australia as well as in one unconfirmed case in India After a year of efforts at a clinic associated with Eastern Virginia Medical School Dr Howard Jones director of the clinic told a press conference yesterday of his first success He declined to identify the prospective parents or say how far the pregnancy had progressed He said that after a fertilization clinic in France had achieved a pregnancy the prospective mother was so beset by attention from the news organizations that she miscarried The first American pregnancy by in vitro in glass fertilization comes at a time when proposed Federal antiabortion legislation could make aspects of the procedure illegal The fertilization clinic of Eastern Virginia Medical School was established on March 1 1980 after certification by Virginias Commissioner of Health and hearings at which the project was vehemently opposed by antiabortion forces Vernon Jones spokesman for the clinic said yesterday that the certification was unrelated to the merits of in vitro fertilization Opposition to the procedure arises chiefly from the need before newly fertilized eggs are inserted into the womb of discarding those that appear abnormal But supporters of the procedure argue that this mimics the natural process that aborts defective embryos before they are implanted in the uterus Laboratory fertilization is designed to cope with a kind of sterility occuring in about one out of 500 women in which the tubes that carry the egg cells from the ovary to the uterus are defective Normally fertilization occurs during this journey By the time the fertilized egg reaches the uterus or womb it has begun to subdivide in the earliest stages of embryo development It then attaches itself in the womb for gestation The woman made pregnant at the Norfolk clinic had lost both her tubes because of tubal ectopic pregnancies according to Dr Jones In such pregnancies the embryo becomes implanted in the tube instead of the uterus and must be removed surgically destroying the tube In the laboratory procedure an effort is made to determine as precisely as possible when the mothers egg cell is ready to erupt from the ovary A device called a laparoscope is then inserted through a small incision into the abdomen In the laparoscope bundles of glass fibers carry light into the abdominal cavity while other fibers enable the surgeon to look in seek out the ripe egg cell and extract it with a suction needle In the Norfolk method two incisions are made one for the laparascope and one for the needle It was perfection of the technique by Dr Patrick Steptoe that on July 25 1978 led to the birth in Britain of Louise Brown the first child conceived in this manner Once the egg is removed it is placed in a dish with a special mixture of fluids and exposed to sperm capacitated by chemical treatment It was the mastery of these steps by Dr Robert Edwards of Cambridge University that also made success possible After the fertilized egg has subdivided a few times in its dish paralleling the development that occurs during descent to the uterus the embryo is inserted into the mothers womb via the cervix in the hope that it will attach itself and develop normally
15% WELFARE GRANT RISE WINS PASSAGE IN ALBANY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/12/nyregion/15-welfare-grant-rise-wins-passage-in-albany.html,The first increase in welfare grants in seven years received final passage in the Legislature today when it passed the Assembly by a vote of 78 to 68 as the legislators began formal adoption of the overdue state budget The 15 percent increase to be borne entirely by the state would mean a family of four would receive 296 a month instead of 258 Governor Carey who had pressed for some increase in welfare payments is expected to sign the bill The 166 billion budget on which the legislative leaders had announced agreement Thursday was drafted in detail and hastily printed over the weekend With a message of necessity from Governor Carey the two houses began deliberations today on its basic parts Further delay in approval of the budget was expected because of debate scheduled for tomorrow over whether to grant Medicaid funds for abortion Those funds are included in the budget bills framed by the leaders There had been apparent agreement on a budget April 28 but action was halted for more than a week when the Republican Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson of Binghamton said there was a misunderstanding about the extent of tax cuts Question for Fink Consequently when Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink today began pushing through the budget bills which at the top now bear sponsors from both the Assembly which is controlled by Democrats and the Senate controlled by Republicans James L Emery the Assembly minority leader who comes from Geneseo popped up with a question Mr Speaker he said is spring training over Is this for real now Mr Fink of Manhattan replied tartly Well never know until the Senate acts will we Mr Emery The bills for state operations legislative and judicial functions and capital construction prompted little debate in either house passing within minutes The Senate approved the state operations bill after defeating an amendment by Manfred Ohrenstein of Manhattan the Senate minority leader that would have eliminated funds for the planning and design of the Westway in Manhattan Both houses quickly passed a bill that would increase reimbursement rates for outpatient Medicaid clinics and also renewed the states responsibility for 60 percent of the local share of home relief There was also final passage of a bill rewarding localities for reducing the number of people who receive home relief but do not meet the requirements for it Home relief is the emergency welfare program financed by state and local government for people not eligible for the Federal welfare program Emission Funds Deleted The list of negotiated bills did not include some financing that had been the subject of controversy Because of local opposition there is no money for capital improvements at Ossining Correctional Facility and the Harlem Valley juvenile detention center which the Governor had hoped to use to expand the states prison capacity Funds for a proposed auto emissions inspection program were deleted Money also was eliminated for the courtappointed panel that has overseen the states improvement of conditions at the Staten Island Developmental Center once known as Willowbrook The only bill that prompted debate in the Assembly was the welfare grant increase defined by its sponsor Assemblyman Angelo DelToro of Manhattan as a home energy related payment because recipients needed more money to cope with the increasing costs of fuel oil The welfare grant level was last raised in 1974 based on the 1972 Cost of Living Index Objection Made Mr DelToro pointed out that 56 percent of the welfare recipients in the state were now forced to use part of their basic grant payment to cover housing costs in excess of the shelter payment Stating that over 92 percent of the people on public assistance are women and children he pushed for passage of the increase to assure that future generations can continue to survive Assemblyman George H Winner Republican of Elmira objected to the measure saying New York State already had the richest and most expensive and most generous public assistance program in the country Mr Winner also suggested the characterization of the increase as energy assistance was an attempt to obviate and get around the Federal Food Stamp Act He predicted that the Federal Government would not accept the characterization and would reduce food stamp benefits to recipients because of their increase in income from the state Well cross that bridge when we come to it said Mr DelToro School Aid Increase The local assistance budget that will be considered by the two houses tomorrow includes a school aid increase of 287 million for a total of 4 billion in aid New York City will receive 12 billion which represents a 925 percent increase over last year an average increase compared with other districts around the state Other changes in the way aid is distributed will help the city including reimbursement for early screening to identify pupils who need special help and the inclusion of a formula to help pay for extra aid to children whose command of English is limited Assemblyman Leonard P Stavisky of Queens chairman of the Education Committee said Suffolk County would receive the largest increase in aid of any county in the state Suffolk does extremely well because of the growth in students he said because there were caps on aid for operations and transportation there This formula ends the caps he said Mr Stavisky said total aid would decline for 28 school districts because of drops in the number of students in those districts and in some instances because theyve paid off their building bonds

HOUSE PANEL REBUFFS REAGAN AND BACKS KEEPING LEGAL AID FOR POOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/14/us/house-panel-rebuffs-reagan-and-backs-keeping-legal-aid-for-poor.html,The House Judiciary Committee by a 22to6 vote today rejected the Reagan Administrations plan to eliminate Federal financing of legal aid for poor people The bill approved by the committee however would reduce financing for the independent Legal Services Corporation to 260 million for each of the next two years from the current 321 million and would place new restrictions on federally financed legal aid lawyers The restrictions prohibit strikes by legal aid lawyers call for greater control over local programs by the corporations board which is appointed by the President and by state and local bar associations and would limit classaction suits and lobbying The committee bill would also bar legal aid lawyers from litigating on behalf of women seeking abortions unless the womens lives were threatened and from litigating for known illegal aliens and persons seeking to legalize homosexuality Supporters Praise Action Despite these and other restrictions Dan J Bradley president of the Legal Services Corporation and other supporters hailed the committee action as a victory in a battle for survival against the White House and predicted that Congress would support continuation of an independent federally financed program Seven of the 12 Republicans on the committee voted for the bill and against the Administration plan which would leave it to the states to finance legal aid programs using money from Federal block grants if they wish I think the question is if you believe in the rule of law in reasonable access to the legal system Representative M Caldwell Butler of Virginia a conservative Republican who voted for the bill said after the vote He said continued Federal financing was necessary because I dont believe the states are at this point committed to the program Mr Butler and others said that even if the Legal Services Corporation survived its board would soon be controlled by Reagan appointees and any authorizing legislation would have to contain new restrictions like those in the bill approved today if it was to gain the support of conservatives who have expressed concern about social activism and alleged abuses by legal aid lawyers Even tight restrictions might not prevent a veto of financing of legal services according to White House sources Administration Is Critical David A Stockman the budget director and other Administration officials have criticized legal aid lawyers as liberal activists more interested in pursuing their personal ideological causes than in serving the real needs of poor clients Michael Horowitz special counsel to Mr Stockman said in a recent interview that legal aid lawyers used clients as tools to pursue their own idiosyncratic views of the public interest brought too many lawsuits seeking to increase transfer payments under welfare programs and caused trouble for lawabiding poor people and others by helping their lawless neighbors Such allegations have been rejected and the Presidents plan has been opposed by the American Bar Association state and local bar associations throughout the country and lawyers judges and law scholars from both major political parties who have supported the Legal Services Corporation The corporation was formed in 1974 in an effort to make apolitical the Federal financing for legal aid which originated in 1965 as part of President Johnsons social programs The legal aid program grew rapidly in the Carter years and now supports about 6000 staff lawyers and 9000 other employees in about 1200 locally administered offices throughout the country Legal aid lawyers who are prohibited from handling criminal cases handled about 15 million civil matters for poor clients last year mostly problems involving family disputes housing and consumer sales matters and public benefit payments Mr Butlers amendment prohibiting strikes by legal aid lawyers which passed by a 15to11 vote provoked the greatest discussion among committee members yesterday and today
"POPE, CONDITION STILL SERIOUS, MEETS AIDES AND HEARS MASS; POLICE INTERROGATE SUSPECT",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/15/world/pope-condition-still-serious-meets-aides-hears-mass-police-interrogate-suspect.html,Pope John Paul II was recovering today from a fivehour operation for wounds sustained in an assassination attempt yesterday but he remained on the critical list and his doctors said he was expected to be hospitalized for at least a month The Holy Fathers vital signs are satisfactory but the prognosis remains guarded said Dr Francesco Crucitti the director of the surgical section of Gemelli Hospital The problems are not immediate but there is the risk of complicating infection and the necessary therapy is being applied Dr Crucitti pressed by reporters at a news conference said I do not hide that the situation is grave The course of the next hours and the next few days will give us the answer which we hope will be favorable At this moment one can be neither optimistic nor pessimistic Suspect Refusing Food The man accused of shooting the Pope in St Peters Square Mehmet Ali Agca an escaped murderer from Turkey underwent virtually continuous interrogation today at the headquarters of the antiterrorist police here Police sources said he was refusing food and drinking only water The Popes personal secretary Msgr Stanislaw Dziwicz who gave him the last rites last night said mass today in the Popes hospital room in the presence of several nuns The Pope asked that the prayers at the end of the mass be prolonged the officials said The Pope harbors no resentment but is showing understanding and forgiveness for his assailant according to Carlo Cardinal Confalonieri the Deacon of the College of Cardinals who spoke tonight during a mass in St Peters Basilica The Cardinal has been one of the few prelates permitted to see the Pope since the attack The Vatican Secretary of State Agostino Cardinal Casaroli who is acting as the head of the Curia the administration of the Roman Catholic Church also visited the Pope today immediately upon returning here from a trip to New York During the day the Pope had sufficient strength to say a few words to his doctors also Vatican officials announced tonight The Pope urged the doctors to be courageous the officials said Dr Crucitti was one of those to whom the Pope spoke The doctor said that he had asked the Pope whether the pain had diminished and that the Pope had answered I am hoping The doctor termed this a positive answer in the sense that the patient appeared to be fighting back against his affliction The doctor said that the Pope would now have to be kept in a halfsitting position and that the dosage of sedatives will be diminished because it is important from a clinical point of view to have the body react to pain For the moment the Pontiff is being fed intravenously and if all goes well he will be able to begin to take food normally within 9 to 10 days Dr Crucitti said He added that the Pope was lucid and that he had spoken with his aides and had asked for news about the two American women who were also struck by the assassins bullets They are also hospitalized Doctors at the hospital said that if all went well the Pope would be able to leave the intensive care unit in two or three days but that he would have to remain at the hospital for at least a month to recover from the almost five and a half hours of surgery last night for multiple lesions caused by a bullet that perforated the abdominal cavity John Paul will have to undergo a second operation Dr Crucitti said We performed a temporary colostomy and we will eventually have to close it and restore normal intestinal function he said Medical sources defined a colostomy as an operation to assure the artificial draining of fecal material when the lower end of the large intestine is no longer working They called this second operation a minor procedure Biologically Younger Than 60 Dr Crucitti said The Pontiff is 60 years old chronologically but biologically he is many years younger The director of Gemelli Hospital Dr Luigi Candia said the patient was being given huge doses of antibiotics to stem infection Medical sources said a degree of infection was inevitable given the wounds that the Pope sustained because some of the contents of the intestine which are not sterile had spilled into the abdominal cavity The two American women who were also wounded remained in another Rome hospital tonight Ann C Odre a 58yearold widow from Buffalo who was struck in the chest by one of the assassins bullets was in the intensive care section of Santo Spirito Hospital near the Vatican She underwent several hours of surgery yesterday for removal of her spleen Rose Hall a 21yearold American from Massachusetts who resides in West Germany was hit by a bullet that fractured her right arm Sources at Santo Spirito said the fracture would take about two months to heal Four Shots Reportedly Fired After the attack yesterday the police said the assailant had fired four shots from a semiautomatic 9millimeter Browning pistol The Pope was hit by two bullets the police said yesterday and the two women by one each Dr Crucitti the surgeon who directed the operating team said at the news conference today that he thought it possible that the Pope had been hit by three bullets and that one of them hit one of the women after glancing off his forearm One of the bullets that hit the Pope entered the abdominal region and exited from the sacral region after having perforated the intestine Dr Crucitti said One bullet fractured the joints of the ring finger of the Popes right hand he said The Rome Prosecutor Achille Gallucci placed initial charges of attempted murder against Mr Agca and similar charges against persons unknown in case the investigation showed that the assassin was helped by accomplices Believed to Have Acted Alone In the first moments after the attack the police suspected that others might have been involved but they soon concluded that Mr Agca had acted alone at least in St Peters Square where the Pope was shot as he was being driven through the crowds during his weekly general audience The investigation so far has turned up nothing to contradict this thesis although police do not exclude the possibility that Mr Agca was backed by an organization and had the help of friends in some of the countries that he had visited since escaping from a Turkish prison in November 1979 police sources said He has reportedly been to Spain Switzerland Yugoslavia and West Germany He had escaped from a maximum security prison near Istanbul after having been convicted of killing a Turkish newspaper editor in February 1979 Mr Gallucci the prosecutor did not lodge formal charges against Mr Agca today because he wanted to await the conclusion of the investigation the police said Such a delay is legal under Italys antiterrorist laws Life Sentence Is Possible If convicted by an Italian court Mr Agca is likely to be sentenced to life imprisonment the same punishment that would be given for an assassination attempt against the President of Italy Turkey today asked Italy for Mr Agcas extradition But legal sources said the Italian Government would not be in a position legally to return him to Turkey because he would be facing a death sentence there The death sentence does not exist in Italy Mr Agca chose a Rome lawyer Pietro dOvidio as his defense attorney Sources close to Mr Gallucci said the trial might take place soon under a special procedure that prosecutors can invoke in cases they deem urgent Normally trials are often delayed for months or years An anonymous telephone caller today told the Rome office of the Venice newspaper Il Gazzettino that he was speaking for the Movement for the Liberation of Armenia and that the group had organized the attack on the Pope and had armed the assailant The police were reported to regard the call as a hoax Initial Reports Denied Mr Agca is not an Armenian according to Interpol the international police organization but there had been reports yesterday that he had said he was Italian newspapers today gave huge headlines to the attack and many expressed outrage in frontpage editorials I Giornale of Milan said in its banner headline Stay with us Wojtyla John Paul was Karol Cardinal Wojtyla Archbishop of Cracow before he became Pope Recently the Pope had been criticized in many newspapers for speeches in which he told Italian Catholics that they should vote for repeal of the threeyearold Italian law that legalizes abortion The referendum is scheduled for this Sunday The bitterness that many Italians had felt over what they regarded as the Popes interference in Italian affairs seemed at least temporarily forgotten today
CONFEREES APPROVE $695.5 BILLION LEVEL FOR THE 1982 BUDGET,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/15/us/conferees-approve-695.5-billion-level-for-the-1982-budget.html,House and Senate conferees today split their differences and approved a 6955 billion budget intended to fulfill President Reagans conservative goal of slowing the growth in Federal spending by curtailing the social programs that have expanded in the last halfcentury The budget was just about what the President had sought and 438 billion less than President Carter had proposed It reflects Mr Reagans desire to establish an economic recovery program based on socalled supplyside economics which contends that spending by individuals and businesses would be more effective than higher tax rates and increased Government spending The final action did not accept the full package of Social Security reductions proposed by the Reagan Administration however Spending Priorities While the conferees worked to arrive at budget totals several committees were setting their spending priorities under the limits of the Presidents budget plan Subcommittees of the House Ways and Means Committee shifted an extra 15 billion into programs for the poor offsetting it with cuts in Medicare funds for the elderly And the House and Senate Agriculture Committees wrote new farm bills that raise price supports for milk and grain above Mr Reagans request and retain the grain subsidy program he wants eliminated Pages A16 and A17 In the Senate today however the President got exactly what he wanted approval of a 1365 billion military authorization bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct 1 Page A15 Deficit of 377 Billion The conferees agreed on a budget for the fiscal year 1982 with a 377 billion deficit and revenues of 6578 billion They agreed that they fell short of making allowances for the full 65 billion in Social Security reductions that the Administration proposed Monday but disagreed by how much In examining the maze of data the Senate conferees believed that they had accommodated 45 billion of the Presidents cuts but the House members looking at the same materials found only 23 billion The Senate bill had envisioned 6 billion in Social Security cuts while the House bill would have accommodated 23 billion Senator Pete V Domenici Republican of New Mexico who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee said that the Senate conferees had agreed to the compromise on Social Security because they felt that the House would not have accepted the larger cuts Some liberal Democrats including Senators Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware and Howard M Metzenbaum of Ohio said that in all their years in the Senate they could not recall receiving more angry constituent reaction than they received on the proposal to trim Social Security benefits In calculating the budget for the fiscal year 1982 the HouseSenate conferees assumed a 105 percent interest rate on Federal borrowings rather than the 89 percent on which the House had based its budget or the 12 percent assumed by the Senate Every increase of a percentage point in interest rates increases the Federal budget by 25 billion There isnt a member on this committee who honestly believes the interest rate in 1982 is going to be 105 percent Senator Metzenbaum told the conferees alleging that assuming such a low rate was merely a tactic to keep the projected deficit down I do replied Representative Delbert L Latta Republican of Ohio but he agreed were going to have high interest rates unless we get spending down Representative James R Jones Democrat of Oklahoma chairman of the House Budget Committee who preferred the 12 percent figure said I believe the interest rate to be totally unrealistic Although the conferees evenly split their differences on most categories they agreed to put an additional 300 million into education and an additional 500 million into energy Good Faith Gesture Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee sought the increase as a good faith gesture to placate the liberal members of his committee I chair a committee that I dont think has ever made a cut in its existence the Senator explained Were used to adding programs Some of the House liberals were unimpressed with the gesture however We came into this conference with a choice between cancer and consumption and by the time we finished we ended up with cholera said Representative Stephen J Solarz Democrat of Brooklyn Some of the Democrats argued that reductions in Federal spending would only mean increases in local spending supported by increases in property taxes Representative Jones noted that the Education and Labor Committee had been directed to change legislation to result in a reduction of 11 billion in Federal spending and said If you have cuts of this nature in education local school districts all over the country will have to raise their property taxes or eliminate programs Program Held a Gamble The Democrats also pointed out the untested nature of the Presidents economic recovery program What were embarking on is a gamble said Representative Leon E Panetta Democrat of California Were testing a theory on the American people The Housepassed budget called for a spending ceiling of 6888 billion revenues of 6578 billion and a 31 billion deficit The Senatepassed budget called for a spending ceiling of 7008 billion revenues of 6503 billion and a 505 billion deficit Although nominally tentative the spending ceiling revenue floor and projected deficit set by the conferees are likely to be significantly changed only in the event of substantially changed economic conditions The conference report now goes to the House and Senate floors for adoption A final binding budget resolution is to be adopted in September Reconciliation Package The budget includes a reconciliation package of 363 billion that instructs authorizing committees of the House and Senate to change laws to effect specified savings The budget also directs the House Speaker and President pro tem of the Senate to hold at their desks any spending bills that breach the budget ceilings Those ceilings are by functional categories such as agriculture and health The exact amount to be spent on individual programs within these categories such as food stamps and research will be set by legislative and appropriation committees In a related development the House approved last night an 186 billion spending bill for the current fiscal year and rescinded 127 billion in previously authorized spending Result Higher Than Requested The resulting 59 billion in new spending was 800 million more than the Administration had requested The bill now goes to the Senate The bill included 65 billion in new money for the military and another 46 billion to cover pay increases for the military The legislation also included a potentially controversial abortion provision aimed at halting all Federal financing for abortions for Government employees This provision was approved by a 242to155 vote Representative Jones chairman of the House Budget Committee succeeded in deleting 3 billion in advance appropriations to purchase oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Mr Jones argued that the money which would not become available until the fiscal year 1982 violated the budget ceiling adopted last week The House backed him by a vote of 260 to 152
SHOOTING CASTS SHADOW ON ITALY'S ABORTION VOTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/16/world/shooting-casts-shadow-on-italy-s-abortion-vote.html,An election poster on the wall inside Santa Maria Sopra Minerva one of Romes loveliest and most famous churches shows a stark picture of an embryo in the womb and beneath it is the caption It is a child It is 90 days old From its 18th day its heart is beating Now you know Vote yes in the referendum for life Italy has many thousands of Roman Catholic churchs  Rome alone has about 500 In most of them an intensive campaign has been waged for the last six months for the repeal of Italys threeyearold liberal abortion law the first in the nations history The referendum on repeal will be Sunday and if the voters follow the advice of the church and the RighttoLife Movement abortion will be illegal except in cases where the mothers health is directly at stake Pope Led Campaign The strong involvement of the church in an Italian political campaign had become a highly emotional issue in Italy in the days just before Pope John Paul II was felled by an assassins bullets Since the Pontiff had personally taken the lead in the churchs campaign much of the criticism was directed against him Leftist and centrist parties supporting the existing abortion law had scheduled a protest mass meeting for the very night of the shooting but they called it off after they heard the news of the attack Bettino Craxi the Socialist Party leader was to be one of the speakers Enrico Berlinguer the Communist Party leader was another The Pope provoked the anger of many Italians last Sunday when he addressed some 50000 members of the RighttoLife Movement who had marched through Rome to attend his Sunday appearance in St Peters Square The Pope calls abortion the killing of innocent creatures and in a direct allusion to the referendum he said that the church regarded all legislation favorable to abortion a very grave offense against the rights of man and a violation of the divine Commandment Thou shalt not kill  Looking Through Polish Glasses Mr Craxi who may be the first nonChristian Democrat to become Prime Minister in more than 30 years then accused the Pope of looking at Italy through Polish glasses and said that the hold that the church has on the Polish people simply does not exist here The conservative Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera declared in a frontpage editorial that it found the Popes statement excessive because he had made a specific call to Italian citizens to vote a certain way on a law of the Italian state Several lay politicians  the term covers all but the ruling Christian Democrats  accused the Pope of interfering in internal Italian affairs and predicted that his attitude would make negotiations for a revision of the concordat the agreement that defines the respective sovereignty rights of Italy and the Vatican more difficult The leftwing newspaper Paese Sera published a cartoon showing a Popelike figure being beaten up by two enraged women The cartoon appeared on the day that the Pope was shot Relief Assassin Wasnt Italian So emotional had the controversy become that many Italians on hearing the news of the shooting and the arrest of the Turkish assailant exclaimed Thank God it was not an Italian That cry of relief was repeated in almost the same words in a frontpage editorial this morning in La Stampa the Turin newspaper Gustavo Selva a leading Christian Democratic radio commentator accused the countrys lay press of having created a psychosis of violence and incitement to a sort of vindictive fight against the Pope He was reprimanded by the directors of the state radio and television network A few Christian Democratic politicians echoed his charges but most of the others disavowed them Many political analysts feel that the impact of the assassination attempt will further swell the Roman Catholic vote for repeal of the abortion law The righttolife advocates were thought to have had the edge over their opponents even before the event Apart from the Popes personal intervention the church had contributed heavily to the campaign Most of Italys leading prelates spoke out for repeal of the law In the Genoa region Giuseppe Cardinal Siri had priests in all churches read entreaties last Sunday for a vote in favor of repealing the abortion law Marching in the Country In southern Italy there have been reports that priests have been leading parishioners down country lanes carrying the statue of the local saint along with signs urging citizens to vote for repeal The present abortion law was passed in May 1978 as a compromise after several years of debate The Christian Democrats were opposed to it but they did not stage an allout fight against it and Giulio Andreotti then Prime Minister did not make it a question of confidence on which his Government could have fallen The law gives women over 18 years old the right to ask for an abortion within the first 90 days of pregnancy if there is threat to the physical or psychological health of the mother An abortion may also be justified for socialeconomic reasons or for instance in the case of rape and if there is a danger that the child may be deformed The RighttoLife Movement which collected more than the half a million signatures needed to put an issue on the referendum list originally demanded full repeal of the law But the Consitutional Court ruled that the issue could not be put on the ballot in the requested form saying it would be unconstitutional to jeopardize the mothers life in order to protect the life of an unborn child There Will Still Be a Problem Thus even if the campaign of the Roman Catholic Church is successful the result will be a law that will still be in conflict with the dogma of the church which does not accept abortion under any circumstances The Christian Democrats have been cautious Some of their leaders have been prominent in the RighttoLife Movement but others have been content to let the church lead the fight The defenders of the existing law have been slow in getting their campaign together With only a few days to go they were generally seen as facing an uphill battle They include the Socialists Social Democrats and Republicans who are part of the Government coalition as well as the opposition Communists and rightofcenter liberals Apart from their late start they have been weakened by the fact that the Radicals a party of nonconformists ranging from the left to the center have also asked for partial abrogation of the existing abortion law But the Radicals contrary to the RighttoLife Movement say that the present law does not go far enough and want a stronger measure Ironically it was the Radicals demand for a referendum that caused the RighttoLife Movement to do the same In addition to the abortion issue the referendum includes a proposal by the Radicals to ban guns and rifles for civilians A license to buy a gun in Italy can now be obtained by anyone who can produce an official certificate that he has no criminal record and that he needs the gun Other proposals on the referendum also sponsored by the Radical Party would repeal Italys 1980 antiterrorist law that enables the police to hold suspects in terrorist cases for 48 hours without informing family or a lawyer and to abolish life

"LIFE, AND ITS BEGINNINGS",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/16/opinion/life-and-its-beginnings.html,Im conservative and conventional uncomfortable with raucous protest demonstrations and hate even the word abortion since I know how traumatic they are from women who have endured them But I rage when I hear our fetusfixated legislators attempting to circumvent the separation of church and state through their ploy of determining when human life begins We dont have to call upon erudite scientists or passionate politicians to find that human life begins at conception even as we say the oak is in the acorn Maybe even as some believe it begins when a soul selects a fetus as a vessel into which to be reincarnated Who knows But a person in Caesars world begins when that vessel or whatever can viably come under Caesars jurisdiction It is one thing for a religion to hold the belief that abortion is a sin and another for Government to disallow abortion The religious belief is embodied in a total concept of procreation from sex through parental responsibility But in our heterogeneous secular society Government machinery is weak at best Our courts do their faulty best with the complexities of custody suits attempt to enforce and subsidize parental responsibility fail utterly in regulating sexual practices as they probably should and are bogged down by an increase in the crime rate that is due partly to the postwar baby boom Government cant keep children off alcohol and other drugs and cant educate a sizeable percentage to read and write as well as people used to learn on their own So now it needs to take on the care of fetuses Hogwash Abortion is a toxic sideeffect of the human condition Would that society could ensure that there be no misconceptions But that is utopian Mindless nature has the task of compelling the survival of species  rabbits and whales and human beings Those who can breed But we human beings are different from the other species when in the image of God we take dominion over natures blind compulsion toward more and more we most express our humanness when we feel and act upon concern for the persons who result from our desires and instincts I am no expert on sex education but I know the first lesson must be that sex makes babies that babies hurt and sometimes die if they are not well cared for and that human beings stay at the animal level if they think of themselves instead of the welfare of their offspring when they breed Recently I was sadly amused by some judicial decision regarding underage girls right to privacy and abortion As I understood it a sufficiently mature teenager may decide to abort otherwise she must have the child The inference one draws while recognizing the dilemma of the court in adjudicating familyrelated problems is that it takes less maturity to bear and nurture a child than not to have one No arm of government can cradle an infant as its mother can nor nurture it through its growing up as can responsible parents All the best that we know about nurturing tells us that there is no substitute for a happy mother thus society augments nature by assigning women primarily this responsibility So with them should lie the primary authority as to which babies come into this world Let Government stand mute on the question of abortion while all of us attend our rightful business of teaching and being examples of personal responsibility toward the welfare of offspring We could keep mighty busy at very essential and lifepromoting responsibilities before devoting ourselves to rhetoric about at what point between coitus and viable birthing human life falls under constitutional protection Should we not begin to say with boldness that the child destined to die before gaining strength to either cry or coo should never have been born And to say that that the rejected and abused child destined to fill a penal cell was innocent in some prelife Eden and condemned by human beings to cruel and unusual punishment And must we judge the mature responsible people who sometimes get caught up in conceptions to which their compassion and judgment say no Knowing feeling viable human life has always been cheap  in war zones refugee camps even in sorrowful pockets of our own cities So isnt it hypocritical however wellintentioned to pontificate about the right to life of a fertilized egg Of course it is a lot easier than worrying about born babies Ask any mother

AROUND THE NATION; Utah Woman Has Abortion Hours After Losing Appeal,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/16/us/around-the-nation-utah-woman-has-abortion-hours-after-losing-appeal.html,A woman who said she feared physical abuse from her estranged husband had an abortion today without his knowledge just hours after a judge ruled that the husband must be told beforehand in accordance with state law The abortion was performed without incident after two unsuccessful attempts to notify the husband Sandra Bagley director of the Utah Womens Clinic said Earlier Federal District Judge David K Winder had denied the womans request for a temporary restraining order barring enforcement of a 1974 Utah law requiring doctors to notify husbands whose wives seek abortions Miss Bagley said she called the husbands home phone number twice letting it ring 10 times before the abortion was performed Thats all the judge said we had to do  comply with the state law she said Assistant Attorney General Bob Wallace said there would be an investigation to assure no law was violated
Babies From a Dish,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/16/opinion/babies-from-a-dish.html,The nations first test tube baby may be on its way After a year of frustrating effort doctors at Eastern Virginia Medical School announced they had succeeded in taking an egg from a woman unable to conceive fertilizing it with her husbands sperm in a glass dish and inserting the resulting embryo into her womb If all goes well she will deliver a normal child who will join the small band of babies conceived abroad in a similar fashion The laboratory fertilization drew immediate criticism from some church and prolife groups that regard the technique as dehumanizing and immoral and may try to set limits on the practice in abortion legislation currently being considered in Washington But whatever ones views on fertilization in a laboratory dish the Virginia doctors deserve high praise for their cautious and humane approach to the project The clinic applies strict criteria in selecting patients for the procedure They must be married healthy childless and have no other way to achieve pregnancy The successfully impregnated womans fallopian tubes had both previously been removed rendering her sterile Ordinarily the egg travels from the ovary through the tubes to the uterus and is fertilized during the journey All the doctors did was provide a lift past the missing tubes They carefully extracted a ripe egg with a suction needle placed it in a dish where it was exposed to sperm let the fertilized egg subdivide a few times then reinserted it in the uterus where it implanted itself and began to grow Opponents of the procedure fear that it will dehumanize the loving process of creating children erode family life allow the casual disposal of defective embryos and lead to selective breeding There is some merit in these concerns but none apply only to laboratory fertilization The real concern should be the attitude society takes toward scientific advance Here the caution of the Norfolk doctors is reassuring For example they use only one egg at a time thus mitigating fears that they might simply flush away surplus embryos At this point it is hard to see test tube fertilization as anything more than a promising procedure that will allow thousands of sterile women to conceive and bear children It would be unfortunate if new legislation although promoted as prolife and profamily deprived these women of children they want

PARENTS' GROUPS PURGING SCHOOLS OF 'HUMANIST' BOOKS AND CLASSES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/17/us/parents-groups-purging-schools-of-humanist-books-and-classes.html,In Onida SD birth control information has been removed from the high school guidance office and the word evolution is no longer uttered in advanced biology Brave New World and Catcher in the Rye have been dropped from classes in literature The awardwinning childrens book Run Shelley Run has been banned from the library In Plano Tex teachers no longer ask students their opinions because to do so they have been told is to deny absolute right and wrong In Des Moines Iowa a high school student production of Grease the hit Broadway musical was banned In Mount Diablo Calif Ms Magazine is off the school library shelves it is available only with permission from both a parent and a teacher Lobbying Methods Sophisticated Emboldened by what they see as a conservative mood in the country parents groups across the nation are demanding that teachers and administrators cleanse their local schools of materials and teaching methods they consider antifamily antiAmerican and antiGod Armed with sophisticated lobbying techniques and backed by such national organizations as Moral Majority the Eagle Forum and the Christian Broadcasting Network these parents are banding together to remove books from libraries replace textbooks eliminate sex education courses and balance lessons of evolution with those of Biblical creation at least They also seek to revise such things as the open classroom new math and creative writing asserting that these relatively unstructured academic approaches break down standards of right and wrong and thus promote rebellion sexual promiscuity and crime Secular Humanism Opposed There have always been disgruntled parents of one political persuasion or another educators and leaders of the movement around the nation said in recent interviews that todays groups were far more numerous well organized and vocal Their focus is no longer a specific book or course of study but rather the very nature of public education itself The philosophy of secular humanism they say permeates every facet of school life from learning the alphabet to high school lessons in American history Secular humanism is the underlying philosophy of all schools said Terry Todd national chairman of Stop Textbook Censorship a group based in South St Paul Minn which argues that decent books such as The House of Seven Gables A Midsummer Nights Dream Huckleberry Finn and Robinson Crusoe have been censored in favor of humanist literature Those of us who understand know how it is infiltrated know how it is inculcated in the children Lottie Beth Hobbs president of the ProFamily Forum in Fort Worth Tex which distributes a leaflet entitled Is Humanism Molesting Your Child said Humanism is everywhere It is destructive to our nation destructive to the family destructive to the individual According to these groups humanism has become the unofficial state religion Its omnipresence they contend particularly within the nations schools is responsible for crime drug abuse sexual promiscuity and the decline of American power The Philosophy Called Humanism There is a philosophy called humanism which places man at the center of the universe encourages free thought and scientific inquiry without deference to a supreme being and offers no absolute standard of ethics But critics of the antihumanist movement including teachers parents and administrators charge that the campaign is based more on hysteria than fact They see secular humanism as a meaningless catchall term used by these groups to describe all the nations ills While they acknowledge that humanism is the underlying philosophy of modern society they dispute the belief that its acceptance is a result of conspiracy Nor do they believe that it has been destructive to mankind I think secular humanism is a straw man said Paul Kurtz a professor of philosophy at the State University at Buffalo a leading humanist They are looking for someone to blame Substitute the word humanist for Communist of the fifties or Bolshevik of the twenties said Dorothy Massie of the National Education Association This time the target is public school education Based primarily in predominantly white suburbs and small towns the protesting parents groups which number in the hundreds have names such as Young Parents Alert People Concerned With Education Parents of Minnesota and Guardians of Education They include many parents who have never been involved in organized activity before but have decided to join with others now because they fear that the problems of urban school systems are slowly encroaching on those of their own home towns Direct mail tollfree telephone numbers and cable television provide easy access to others who share their concerns Brainwashing Is Alleged Through brochures films and pamphlets distributed at parents meetings these parents are being told that humanism brainwashes students to accept suicide abortion and euthanasia and that it encourages them to lie alienates them from their parents fosters such socialistic anticompetitive practices as the open classroom and conditions them to think that there is no such thing as right or wrong Some of you may have elementary or secondary children who experience stomach aches headaches nightmares or other similar complaints andor disorders that cannot be accounted for warns a pamphlet entitled Parental Guide to Combat the Religion of Humanism in Schools distributed by Parents of Minnesota Look in your schools Modern educational materials and the techniques used may be what is causing those problems I worry about my sons said Lore Finley whose two sons attend grade school in Blunt SD and who only recently has become aware of the movement against secular humanism We do not have any rules in school no right no wrong I dont like secular humanism It teaches anything goes if you feel its OK do it What these parent groups are asking for they say is a return to many of the teaching practices and textbooks of 30 years ago as well as the Christian values and principles upon which they argue the country was founded They are asking specifically for history texts that emphasize the positive side of Americas past economics courses that stress the strengths of capitalism and literature that avoids divorce suicide drug addiction and other harsh realities of life On another level they advocate a return to academic basics contending that the abandonment of such disciplines as penmanship has led to slackening of standards and declining achievement They want reading programs that focus on phonics rather than whole word recognition writing programs that stress good spelling over creativity They also want they say a curriculum and an approach to teaching that clearly delineates between right and wrong Rating Textbooks for Parents There is just too much negativism said Mel Gabler who with his wife Norma operates the largest textbook clearinghouse in the country advising parents groups on the moral acceptability of textbooks from their home in Longview Tex The Gablers say inquiries have increased 50 percent since President Reagan was elected in November There is an uneasy feeling that maybe weve bent over backwards with being broadminded said Dr Scott Thompson president of the National Association of Secondary School Principals According to Judith Krug of the American Library Association since last November there have been attempts to remove restrict or deny access to 148 different books in 34 states In Buhler Kan for example The Kinsman a science fiction novel by Ben Bova was removed from the library of the Prairie Hills Middle School because parents complained that it was sexually suggestive In Gretna Va a parentteacher committee at the high school voted to cut out or ink over Howl by Allen Ginsberg and Getting Down to Get Over by June Gordon which involves the trauma of a woman who was raped both of which are in The Treasury of American Poetry In Muskego Wis students must now have written permission to check out the feminist health manual Our Bodies Ourselves In Branson Mo an issue of Sports Illustrated was returned to the publisher in a brown paper bag because it emphasized bikini swim suits In French Lick Ind Death of a Salesman has been banned from a high school English class because it contains obscenities Curbing Various Textbooks Because of successful challenges by such groups as the Gablers numerous health social studies English and science textbooks have already been removed or revised to comply with parental complaints Most recently the Alabama Board of Education voted to remove Justice in America and Unfinished Journey both published by Houghton Mifflin and widely used in social studies classes across the country from the states approved textbook list in response to parental complaints that they were filled with secular humanism We feel we brought the best of scholarship and accumulated as accurate and objective a book as we can possibly publish Gary Smith corporate counsel for Houghton Mifflin said of Unfinished Journey We found it difficult to find substance to support the charges made Many attempts to ban books have met failure Others are still tied up in litigation such as Pico v Island Trees a case involving a ban on Long Island in 1976 of nine books including Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut Jr The Fixer by Bernard Malmud and Down These Mean Streets by Piri Thomas The Long Island case is currently on appeal to the Supreme Court and could become an important test case of a school boards right to decide the contents of a school library Even in areas where censorship efforts have failed teachers and others say that the battles themselves have had a chilling impact in certain cases on what goes on in the classroom Avoiding Controversial Subjects I think about what Im doing twice said Betty Duke who teaches ninth grade history at Vines High School in Plano a suburb of Dallas where no specific book has been eliminated Is there anything controversial in this lesson plan If there is I wont use it I wont use things where a kid has to make a judgment In South St Paul a suburb of St Paul Minn all books that could possibly be considered controversial must be so labeled They must then be reviewed by committee and either rejected or accepted by the school board Rather than be subjected to that procedure teachers in the school system simply have not changed the curriculum in more than six years and continue to use books that may in fact no longer be relevant We want and need to update contemporary literature said Joyce Johnson who teaches language arts at South St Paul Senior High School But we wont make suggestions because they would only be labeled out of context Peter Carparelli the principal of Helena Senior High School in Montana said that many of his teachers had become anxious since a meeting last month when a discussion of the sex education curriculum turned into a forum on the ills of secular humanism There is this feeling that youre being questioned he said Anything that I think possibly controversial I tape said George H Tanner one of several teachers at Montello High School in Wisconsin who began taking cassette tape recorders to class after parents accused them of antiGod statements they deny making Learning About Humanism Parents become aware of secular humanism and the campaign to cleanse the schools in different ways Some first heard about it by means of religious television newspapers or at religious services Many others have been invited to community meetings and have been shown films and given pamphlets from such national organizations as the Gablers the ProFamily Forum the Eagle Forum Moral Majority the Heritage Foundation and Americas Future Some of the pamphlets currently in circulation include Weep for Your Children The Hate Factory and AntiGod Humanists are Conditioning Our Children A 29minute film produced by the Christian Broadcasting Network and entitled Let Their Eyes Be Opened has already sold over 1800 copies at 125 each to individuals and groups across the nation The film shows among other things aborted fetuses and teenagers who have taken an overdose of drugs It attempts to show that teenage prostitution pornography and murder are all a result of secular humanism in the schools Two years ago I didnt even know what secular humanism was said Joy Cook of Blunt SD president of the local parents group attempting to purge it from the schools Now I realize you can be a humanist without knowing it and that there are humanists doing everything  Quick Network Reaction Mrs Cook who has a son at Sully Buttes high school in Onida and another child in grade school in Blunt first heard about secular humanism when she was working to oppose the proposed equal rights amendment She was told to call a lobbyist in North Dakota who in turn said that she would put Mrs Cook in touch with someone who could tell her more about humanism Fifteen minutes later Mrs Cook said she received a phone call from Mel Gabler of Texas who sent her a package of materials Mrs Cook now subscribes to at least a dozen national organizations sympathetic to her cause and keeps their literature in cardboard boxes and files in her living room She plays host to sessions around her kitchen table to inform her neighbors of humanisms dangers and is always an outspoken participant at school board meetings She among others in the community was in favor of banning Run Shelley Runby Gertrude Samuels which was chosen by the American Library Association as Best Book For Young Adults in 1974 and which deals in sometimes stark language with the problems of a teenage runaway We have to get rid of secular humanism said Donald J Rykhus superintendent of schools in Onida and Blunt SD The only way that can be done he said was by getting rid of liberal real liberal personnel I worry for my son said Vicky Brooks who teaches English at Sully Buttes high school and opposed the ban I dont want him to be in a community where if you disagree you are wrong I want him to be able to evalute opinions and be able to think People who cant think are ripe for dictatorship
SHADOW OF DEATH THE POPE IS A VISIBLE FORCE- AND A VUNERABLE TARGET,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/17/weekinreview/shadow-of-death-the-pope-is-a-visible-force-and-a-vunerable-target.html,POPE John Paul II strode onto the world stage in October 1978 and quickly established himself as the most vigorous wielder of papal power in modern times In keeping with the pattern of his postSecond Vatican Council predecessors he has wielded that power to affect the course of events in the world at large rather than just among Catholics The papacy that John Paul inherited is far different from that of the past when popes as political figures were every bit as important and powerful as kings or princes or presidents Modern popes have had to adapt to a world in which the church  or Christianity for that matter  does not dominate and in which the principle of churchstate separation must be respected even in predominantly Catholic countries Papal power in world politics now derives largely from a popes personal magnetism and moral suasion and from moral authority over the worlds 600 million Catholics who can be voters taxpayers and officeholders as well as believers John Paul has seemed singularly wellequipped for the job As a priest and a prelate in his native Poland he faced the challenge of making the church a force in a situation where it was tolerated largely because the Government could not eliminate it He became adept at the political subtleties required to bolster individual freedom without overtly threatening the Communist regime As Pope he has not always been subtle in his efforts to influence political events Before the attempt on his life last week he was under heavy criticism in the Italian press and in some political quarters for his efforts in behalf of a proposal to be voted on in a referendum today to repeal Italys threeyearold liberal abortion law His predecessor Pope Paul VI made similar attempts to defeat a liberalized Italian divorce law Treading on Secular Turf In one of many public statements on the issue the Pope called all legislation favorable to abortion a very grave offense to the rights of man and the divine commandment Thou shalt not kill  The Corriere Della Sera a conservative Milan newspaper criticized John Paul in a frontpage editorial saying he was interfering unduly in state matters by making a specific call to Italians to vote a particular way In Spain last year during heated debate on a divorce bill the newly appointed Papal Nuncio Alberto Innocenti was said to have warned Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez that if the bill passed the Pope would not visit Spain this fall as had been planned And pressure from the Spanish bishops was one of several factors that contributed to Mr Suarezs resignation in January Earlier the Pope had intervened to avert war between Argentina and Chile over three tiny islands in the Beagle Channel He persuaded the two nations to accept a papal emissary Antonio Cardinal Samore as a mediator Negotiations have gone on two years without a settlement but neither has there has been any bloodshed John Paul has accelerated the Vaticans movement to give up much of the surrogate power it enjoyed by virtue of close association with the ruling classes of many countries notably in South AmericaFollowing the principles laid down by the Second Vatican Council Pope Paul VI and now John Paul II have pursued a policy of social justice for the downtrodden frequently putting the Vatican at least implicitly at odds with rulers and ruling groups with whom it formerly was very cozy John Pauls highwater mark in this effort was reached in February during his visit to the Philippines when seated next to President Ferdinand Marcos in the presidential palace he delivered a homily on the injustice of huge disparities in wealth between the few rich and the many poor and the inviolability of human rights even at the expense of security He arrived at this point only gradually after making statements on earlier trips that looked to many of the more socially active and committed members of his flock like equivocations On his first trip abroad as Pope to Puebla Mexico the big question was whether he would endorse liberation theology which seeks justification in the Gospel for political movements by oppressed people But the statement that grabbed attention was that clerics should not be politicians a point he reinforced later by approving an order that forced the Rev Robert Drinan a Jesuit to drop a bid for reelection to the United States House of Representatives Months later during a visit to Brazil he appeared to have developed more sympathy for church efforts to correct social and economic injustices The persistency of injustice threatens the existence of society within he told an audience in Sao Paulo This menace from within really exists when the distribution of goods is grounded only in the economic laws of growth and a bigger profit when the results of progress reach only superficially the huge layer of the population there persists a big gap between a minority of the rich on the one hand and the majority of those who live in want and misery on the other The Popes emergence as an international spokesman coincides with the apparent rise in religious conflicts in scattered parts of the world  between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland between Christians and Moslems in Lebanon between Moslems of different stripes in Iran and Iraq between Jews in Israel and Moslems in neighboring Arab countries Sometimes religion seems to turn fanatic as in Irans Islamic revolution But in most such cases religion seems more a rationalization for other underlying grievances or a means of rallying support in the name of a higher principle And Christians and Moslems in such areas of conflict have been quick to condemn violence in the name of religion as a perversion In making his appeal for moral causes the Pope emphasizes that he is speaking as a Christian and as a churchman but rarely as a Catholic However his remarks to President Marcos his stand on abortion his ban on clerics in politics  all indicate a realization that some positions have to be taken some things have to be said some enmities perhaps have to be risked
THE TRIUMPH OF COGNITIVE DISSONANCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/17/opinion/l-the-triumph-of-cognitive-dissonance-122292.html,To the Editor Cognitive dissonance which is the belief in two or more mutually exclusive ideas is not unusual What is less common is a political philosophy based on such logical contradictions Today American conservatives seem to believe that  In technology America is falling behind the rest of the world funding for education and scientific research should be cut  Government should stay out of peoples private lives what is needed is a constitutional amendment prohibiting abortion  Federal spending causes inflation because it is wasteful and inefficient military spending should be increased  The military cannot keep enough trained dedicated people in service resume the draft see also private lives above  The free market should determine the worthiness of any product or service curtail Japanese imports  America needs efficient transportation subsidize Lockheed and Chrysler Cancel Conrail Most serious is the belief that the way to reduce the likelihood of nuclear war is to build more nuclear weapons I realize that the republic in which logic rules has yet to be founded I hope that the republic in which illogic rules is not upon us One concern I have is whether like the village in Vietnam America will be destroyed in order to be saved JOSEPH WALKER Philadelphia May 11 1981

Introduction by Sondra J Stang Illustrated 245 pp Philadelphia University of Pennsylvania Press 20 THE LIFE IN FICTION OF FORD MADOX FORD By Thomas CMoser 350 pp Princeton NJ Princeton University Press Cloth 2250 Paper 895 THE posthumous literary career of Ford Maddox Ford is surely one of the saddest of stories not the saddest for we must not indulge in Fordian hyperbole and how characteristic of it that a volume of essays edited by Sondra J Stang was conceived as a memorial for the fortieth anniversary of his death no special notice having been taken of the hundredth anniversary of his birth The rot set in the moment he died incidentally in 1939  the timing is off a little Janice Biala his last love recalls in a biographical note that he died a lonely and terrible death There were three people at his funeral a few flowers and a little bunch of thyme and bayleaves on his coffin  And the Manchester Guardians obituary claimed that The Fifth Queen Crowned and Ladies Whose Bright Eyes  were probably the best known of his many novels faint and uncomprehending praise indeed Reminiscences like those of Hemingway in A Moveable Feast compounded the injury wrought by time and even Arthur Mizeners massive biography was greeted in Britain at least with comments like Why waste such research on a secondrate writer and Well we always knew he was a liar but

paid to him by American scholars as witness Thomas C Mosers The Life in the Fiction of Ford Madox Ford but even in America we find complaints of books out of print or kept in print only through the enthusiasm of devoted academics In Britain the Bodley Head edition with Graham Greenes introductory essays reprinted by Sondra Stang is being kept alive not by popular request but by a grant from the Arts Council and Greene himself an influential admirer omitted The Last Post from the Parades End sequence on the grounds that it was a disaster that revealed the lurking sentimentality of the previous three volumes With such friends who needs enemies I must declare myself at once a less than wholehearted friend and my attempts to come to terms with Ford after reading these two critical works and rereading his bestknown novels have caused me as much bewilderment as enlightenmentBut this much I have gained I realize that I am not alone in my confusion It is good to learn for example from Mr Moser that the chronology of The Good Soldier is hopelessly muddled and not only to a lazy reader This novel a masterpiece of the storytellers art a locus classicus for discussion of the unreliable narrator is full of contradictions They can be explained in terms of the authors impressionistic approach his dwelling on the uncertainty of any objective knowledge of the acts of others but they linger disturbingly nevertheless Writing about The Good Soldier Denis Donoghue argues that tropes of correction and ignorance arise from Dowells he is both the central character and narrator sense that the event and his impression of it do not necessarily coincide  which is fair enough but did Ford really intend his factual impossibilities Similarly in Parades End was it mere carelessness or forgetfulness that occasioned so many reprises of issues once satisfactorily settled such as the paternity of the son of Christopher and Sylvia Tietjens In No More Parades Mark Tietjens appears to have accepted that the son is Christophers but in The Last Post he is back to square one assuming the opposite This is psychologically possible of course for one can change ones mind irrationally on these necessarily indeterminable matters but Marks subsequent doubts recall to the reader the somewhat unsatisfactory nature of Fords or is it Christophers conclusion that the son is indeed legitimate There is much talk of dates that does not seem to have much gynecological backing but seems rather to cloud in typical Fordian manner with facts One could wish that Mr Moser had devoted some time to this issue And what about Edith Ethel Duchemins abortion in Parades End This too is shrouded in a mystery that may well spring more from Fords confusion than from his desire accurately to render the confusion of his characters Impressionism is a dangerous technique Mr Moser spends much time as do writers in Mrs Stangs volume on Fords hereditary relationship to the PreRaphaelites with their sharp clear outlines and their love of high hard colors When Ford can see colors he is for the moment secure in the twin illusions of eternally happy romantic love and successfully mastered fictional technique But he knows too that worry makes colors dim Perhaps one of ones anxieties about Ford stems from this oscillation between sharpness and dimness between the PreRaphaelite attempt at detailed objectivity however subverted it may be by a faith in courtly love and a Rossettistyle passion for adultery and the sultry lips of Astarte Syrica and a faith that nothing is but what it fleetingly seems In one of the most impressive passages in Some Do Not  highly praised in both these books on Ford Valentine Wannop wearing improbably an otterskin toque jumps down from a dogcart into a silver mist vanishing more completely than if she had dropped into deep water into snow  or through tissue paper From high definition into obscurity This is highly characteristic of Ford as is his alternation between presenting his hero Tietjens as physically repulsive and physically endearing This must represent on Fords part a profound anxiety about his own acceptability Mr Moser makes much of the fact that Fords father Francis Hueffer thought of him as a stupid donkey an allegation which Ford and his characters do their best to refute by their passion for Latin mathematics statistics botany and horsemanship he must similarly have labored to counteract uncertainty about his appearance in his own words a meal sack an elephant a carp a goldfish and in the words of others not dissimilar by his early elopement and his succession of affairs But there is something weirdly arbitrary and violent about the passions he describes why is mathematics acceptable astronomy not and the sharpness of facts is frequently dimmed by a hazy pulsating blur of furious and yes anxious emotion For a writer claiming impressionistic objectivity Ford employs a vocabulary with a high moral charge He is constantly drawing distinctions between the pure and the impure the clean and the beastly the straight and the crooked Beastly is a term of public school slang not of delicate moral definition yet we find it again and again apparently in serious contexts Dirtyminded is another favorite and appears revealingly in an interesting pamphlet printed in Edward Naumburgs essay on his Ford collection in Womens Suffrage and Militancy 1912 Ford states that for most of his life he has been nagged swindled and worried out of his life by women that most middleclass men approaching middle age support at least five women  all carefully doing my dirty work and of course they are lowminded creatures Every one of them is an inferior animal They bow down before me they are mendacious they have no real sense of right or wrong  Their business in life is to do my dirty work It is wonderful that they are not dirtyminded as well as inferior This of course is Shavian paradox polemical journalism in favor of womens suffrage but it is oddly phrased and recalls the language of Valentine Wannop the pure straight clean hockeyplaying suffragette in describing her experiences as a slavey and an ashcat that is a domestic servant  in Ealing with a drunken cook as her superior and the salacious middle classes as her employers There is no feeling for fellow ashcats nothing but physical revulsion Throughout the novels there is a curious emphasis on sexual purity and its corruption Some of the characters do not perhaps feel this but in fact Tietjens and Valentine do after a volume or so and it is hard to see why their union is considered so straight and pure while those of others are dimly beastly I find it hard to share Roger Sales enthusiasm for Valentine as one of the great heroines of English fiction for if she were more plausible I think I would disapprove of her rather strongly One might note that HG Wells and Arnold Bennett get short shrift from these Ford admirers Wells dismissed in a footnote for his nononsense obtuseness no doubt because of their lack of interest in modernism but Bennetts Hilda Lessways and Wellss Ann Veronica seem to me more spirited more convincing and more honest as heroines than Valentine Would either of them have reacted with such exaggerated horror at the news of a friends unintended pregnancy And their creators grasp of social issues is certainly sounder Perhaps I am taking Ford in the wrong spirit Maybe despite his language he is not a moralist at all William H Pritchard in an essay on Ford as critic quotes his praise of Jane Austen as one who does not denounce or scarify the vices of her age adding in parenthesis nor did the author of The Good Soldier Mr Moser and others make out a good case for Ford as comic novelist with Tietjens as buffoonhero and there is also much talk of his interest in form effect impressions angles of narration none of which has anything to do with Ford the social critic and historian or Ford the nostalgic lamenter of lost values known to be lost RP Blackmur It is true that Ford like Conrad was excited by form true also that he was excited by visual shape for his vocabulary contains many words rare in fiction such as rhomboid and lozenge which appear to carry some esthetic and emotional charge from his past But the startling rhomboids and lozenges frequent though they are are far outnumbered by apes monkeys dogs bitches and swine by references to lewdness depravity thrashings and whippings A great deal of whipping threatened fantasied and actual goes on in Ford Are we intended to admire Tietjens for whipping a groom who ill treats a horse Or simply to take it that this was so  this was how the upper classes behaved And what about the hostile references to Jews Are they simply period color And what of the scene where Dowell kicks the darky Julius An unresisting negro can make a deplorable noise and a deplorable spectacle says Dowell with perhaps excessive neutrality Let us end on a more temperate note conceding that Fords capacity to enrage and engage may well be one of his virtues as a writer Another virtue less controversial and more widely acclaimed was his great genius as an editor Edward Krickel provides a very useful summary of his achievements with The English Review and the transatlantic review reminding us of his talent for spotting and supporting the gifts of others and for enlisting the help of the famous In this role his protean sympathies and his passionate partisan spirit were exerted to the good of literature as a whole and his contribution deserves a wide recognition Rightly in Mrs Stangs volume he receives tribute not only from critics but from poets and novelists  Alison Lurie William Trevor Robert Lowell Howard Nemerov and a few scratchy lines from Jean Rhys A poem Homage by Richard Howard sums up a great deal of what is said in both Stang and Moser Meanwhile you ditched your legacy the dry glare of preRaphaelite masters and the wet mist of Impressionism steeping yourself instead  To discover where we stand  in that inclusive negative the Modern  Without Ford the map of the Modern would have been very different
TUITION TAX CREDITS: OTHER VIEWS IN THE DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/17/nyregion/tuition-tax-credits-other-views-in-the-debate.html,SUPERINTENDENT Candes article ignores two fundamental issues The first is whether the state or the parents have the right to determine the type of education their children get Associated with the issue is the constitutional position of the public school system The second issue Mr Cande failed to address is whether the majority of public school systems in this country have lived up to their responsibilities in providing a quality education As to Mr Candes assertion that public schools do not in any way engage in indoctrination my only answer is what nonsense On most controversial issues such as womens rights the creation of man abortion the draft etc the public schools have failed to fairly set forth both sides of the issues Tuition tax credits would return to parents a significant control over the education of their children For some it would provide them with a measure of support that would permit their children to enter the schools of the socalled elite As to this latter point it would be a step forward in eliminating the economic bias that exists in our educational system The movement toward tuition tax credits would not be so strong if the public schools had lived up to their responsibilities Many parents are disgusted with the quality of education their children are getting and with the cost as well Tuition tax credits give them some of the freedom they were guaranteed by our Constitution We want government off our backs We want the ability and the right to choose the type of education we believe is in our childrens best interest without having to pay a penalty I have raised three children in the public school system and while that was my choice I believe others who choose a private school education should be permitted to do so without a penalty

THE SURGEON GENERAL'S PRAGMATIC BOSS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/19/science/the-surgeon-general-s-pragmatic-boss.html,While most public and press attention has focused on Dr C Everett Koop an outspoken opponent of abortions whose nomination as Surgeon General is bottled up in Congress the real responsibility for health and medical policy in the new Administration lies with a lowkey administrator from Texas who is widely regarded as a political moderate and pragmatist He is Edward N Brandt Jr a 47yearold former medical educator and biostatistician who was sworn in last Thursday as assistant secretary for health in the Department of Health and Human Services Dr Brandt has built a reputation as a brilliant administrator and firstrate scientist Friends say they have never heard him speak out on abortion or other moral and religious issues that have entangled Dr Koops nomination Knowledgeable officials in the Administration and in Congress say that even if Dr Koop was ultimately confirmed he would be given little real authority and would serve mainly to satisfy the righttolife groups who are politically allied with President Reagan He would report to Dr Brandt Richard S Schweiker the Secretary of Health and Human Services has told people in Congress that he was personally opposed to having Dr Koop as the Federal Governments top doctor but agreed to accept him if the Reagan Administration would allow him to appoint another physician above him His choice was Dr Brandt whose name was advanced by both the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association The Brandt appointment adds to other evidence that the Reagan Administration is likely to steer a much more moderate course on health matters than many people had believed As his assistant secretary for planning and evaluation Mr Schweiker has designated Dr Robert J Rubin a nephrologist from Tufts University who is regarded as a moderate The selection of Dr Koop who is internationally respected as a pediatric surgeon stirred alarm among both liberals and organized medicine because of his outspoken views against abortion population control homosexual rights and prenatal diagnosis of birth defects He was also opposed by the American Public Health Association because he lacked publichealth expertise Nominees View of Role In an interview after his nomination Dr Koop said that he would control the National Institutes of Health the Health Resources Administration the Centers for Disease Control the Alcohol Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration and other components of the Public Health Service In fact department officials say he will have no such authority Dr Brandt would operate the entire Public Health Service and its six agencies which include the Food and Drug Administration The duties of Dr Koop as Surgeon General remain unclear At his Senate confirmation hearing on April 29 Dr Brandt said that Dr Koop would serve as his deputy and perform those duties that he is qualified to carry out under the direction of the assistant secretary for health A spokesman for Dr Koop and Dr Brandt said that they were not available for comment for now While the public generally thinks of the Surgeon General as the Governments chief health spokesman the true powers of the post have been drastically curtailed in recent years About the only statutory role he has is as head of the 7000member Public Health Service Commissioned Officers Corps and as a regent of the Uniformed Services Medical School in Bethesda Md Policy responsibility has been shifted to the assistant secretary that is Dr Brandt Under the last Administration the two posts were filled by one person Dr Julius B Richmond Stress on Other Issues Dr Brandt according to friends is unlikely to speak out in opposition to Mr Reagans stated policy on abortion But those who know him well say they doubt that he will pay much attention to the issue either preferring instead to dwell on the less incendiary but crucial and complex issues of setting policy in biomedical research and enhancing preventive care and family medicine in the nation Close friends say that he is so apolitical in the partisan sense that they are uncertain whether he is a Democrat or a Republican if either What is known is that he is a workaholic He has a remarkable capacity to pull together all the data on an issue very quickly and in an orderly way and to synthesize out of it the possible solutions to a problem said Dr William C Levin president of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston where Dr Brandt once served as executive dean He formed his views on what was the proper solution not what was most acceptable politically Dr Brandt who was born and educated in Oklahoma has both an MD with his residency in internal medicine and a PhD in biostatistics He became dean at Galveston in 1970 and later vice chancellor for health affairs for the entire University of Texas system As an educator he stressed preventive and primarycare medicine While Dr Brandts appointment has been greeted well by most groups he is likely to clash politically with many of them as the Reagan Administration attempts to reduce much of the Federal Governments role in health and return responsibility to the states The details of most of these efforts remain undefined and Dr Brandt is likely to play a large role in shaping them In a speech last month before surgical educators he defended the Administrations proposals to end Federal aid to medical schools and other efforts to stimulate doctor production as no longer of high priority Only recently as a medical school dean he was arguing for more such money He said however that the reduced investments would be channeled into a few areas of special need such as preventive medicine pediatric care and family medicine He also complained about overspecialization in medicine My concern he went on is that we may be producing specialists for whom most of the human mind and body is still a mystery

RAUSCH, 52, BISHOP OF PHOENIX",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/19/obituaries/james-s-rausch-52-bishop-of-phoenix.html,Bishop James S Rausch head of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix since 1977 and a former general secretary of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops died yesterday of an apparent heart attack He was 52 years old He suffered an attack while on his way to northern Arizona with an aide the Rev John Flannery who drove him to Deer Valley Emergency Center where the Bishop died Bishop Rausch played a major role in giving purpose and prominence to the conference which was organized after the Second Vatican Council as a means of discussing issues of particular importance to the Roman Catholic Church in the United States In his tenure as general secretary in Washington from 1973 to 1977 he encouraged many progressive programs took initiatives to strengthen ties with other Christians and addressed social concerns such as racism and abortion In 1976 when the church marked the nations Bicentennial by holding a Call to Action consultation of hundreds of Catholic clergy and laity Bishop Rausch was a key organizer of the event The consultation held in Detroit registered a striking array of views from a diverse group of Catholics and produced many controversial resolutions such as those calling for a married priesthood and the ordination of women Leading Liberal in Church Such activities reinforced Bishop Rauschs reputation as a leading liberal in the hierarchy But his close associates included a wide variety of bishops priests and lay people As general secretary he worked closely with two former presidents of the Bishops Conference John Cardinal Dearden the retired Archbishop of Detroit and Archbishop Joseph L Bernardin of Cincinnati as well as Archbishop Jean Jadot who was then the Papal Delegate In his years in Phoenix Bishop Rausch reportedly become somewhat more reserved and cautious in his views The Bishop a robust man with a ruddy complexion and a broad sometimes impish smile acted diplomatically weighing his words carefully while exuding confidence and friendliness He gave new visibility to an office that requires a delicate balancing of the interests of the bishops and the demands of the wider church As a spokesman for the bishops he felt the heat of critics who considered him too liberal Bishop Rausch extended the prerogatives of the office and tested its limits He was born Sept 4 1928 in Albany Minn He was ordained in St Cloud Minn on June 2 1956 He received a masters degree in education from St Thomas College in St Paul in 1963 and a doctorate in pastoral sociology from the Gregorian University in Rome in 1969 He was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of St Cloud on April 26 1973
THE FINAL PROTECTOR OF OUR LEGAL RIGHTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/20/opinion/l-the-final-protector-of-our-legal-rights-125621.html,To the Editor Present efforts by conservative Congressmen to prevent the Supreme Court from hearing abortion cases are not a newly discovered political tactic as some of your correspondents have recently suggested Rather attempts to deprive the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over particular types of cases are an established practice in the American political system For example in 1958 the Jenner bill would have prevented the Supreme Court from hearing any case concerning the authority of Congressional committees particularly over alleged subversives In 1964 the House of Representatives passed a bill which would have prohibited the Federal courts from hearing any case concerning legislative reapportionment Other attempts have been made in criminal law Selective Service immigration and many others While almost all such attempts have been unsuccessful and no matter how illiberal they may have been politically they do reflect Congressional dissatisfaction with positions taken by the Supreme Court The constitutionality of attempts to restrict the Supreme Courts jurisdiction has been the subject of much contention among legal scholars and the answer is far from clear However it may safely be said that at least where constitutional rights are concerned and abortion is clearly such a case the Supreme Court may not be deprived of its power as the final protector of such rights RICHARD A ALTMAN New York April 29 1981
HOUSE PANEL VOTES $9 BILLION SLASH IN SOCIAL PROGRAMS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/20/us/house-panel-votes-9-billion-slash-in-social-programs.html,The House Ways and Means committee voted today to slash more than 9 billion out of the major social programs enacted in Congress under Democratic control over the last generation While the committee action followed the Reagan Administrations broad budget recommendations the lawmakers differed significantly with the Presidents priorities The bill which passed today by voice vote makes less drastic cuts than Mr Reagan had suggested in programs such as welfare  But it cuts more heavily out of Medicare a program that provides medical care for all elderly patients regardless of their income In another slap at President Reagans legislative program Senate Democrats issued a statement today opposing any change in Social Security that would precipitously and unfairly deny benefits to recipients approaching retirement age Last week the White House proposed reducing Social Security benefits to workers who retire at the age of 62 a suggestion that has evoked a firestorm of criticism on Capitol Hill and now seems unlikely to become law Democrats generally agree that some changes will have to be made in Social Security and the senators pledged to enact reforms that would insure the longterm solvency of the system But they are gleeful that Mr Reagans specific proposals have attracted so much opposition First Mistake for Reagan Representative Bill Alexander of Arkansas the deputy Democratic whip summed up the feeling when he said The President has made his first political mistake The debate in the Ways and Means Committee was punctuated by a flurry of regional rivalry as Representative Thomas J Downey Democrat of Suffolk County proposed an amendment that would cut the Federal share of the welfare bill in 29 states many of them in the South Representative Sam Gibbons Democrat of Florida warned that cutting welfare benefits in the South could set up a vigorous migration to New York because you all have been so generous with your benefits Mr Downey retorted that the House needed a bargaining chip to use in conference with the Senate when their two bills will eventually be reconciled The Senate adopted language that would cut Federal payments for Medicaid recipients in a number of Northern states including New Jersey and Connecticut Vote on Regional Lines The Downey amendment carried 18 to 13 with the vote split almost entirely along NorthSouth lines The cuts adopted today for the fiscal year beginning Oct 1 are only slightly below the target of 924 billion assigned to the committee by the budget resolution that should pass Congress this week The Senate Finance committee passed 1033 billion worth of cuts but the two committees do not deal with exactly the same programs The biggest difference between the two bills is in social services a broad category providing money for social workers day care foster care and aid to parents who adopt poor children The Senate committee slashed almost 1 billion and lumped all the remaining funds into a block grant leaving the states to make key spending decisions The House committee cut almost nothing and rejected the block grant idea Differences on Welfare The Senate bill also cuts almost 1 billion out of welfare while the House version trims only 570 million In addition the Senate would combine programs that pay the fuel bills for poor families into another block grant The House would keep them as separate categorical programs meaning that the Federal Government determines how the money is spent After the Ways and Means bill passes the House it must be reconciled with the Senate bill which should reach the Senate floor in the next week or two The legislation for these specific programs will follow Congressional action tomorrow on the budget resolution which sets an overall spending ceiling The Senate Republicans meanwhile delayed consideration today of a 129 billion supplemental appropriation bill because of an intraparty dispute Senator Jesse A Helms Republican of North Carolina had threatened to introduce antiabortion language that would bar abortions for Federal employees except to save the life of the mother Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut had threatened to filibuster against the Helms amendment Senator Howard H Baker Jr Republican of Tennessee the majority leader had supported the position of Senator Mark O Hatfield Republican of Oregon and chairman of the Appropriations Committee who sought no amendments to the bill Senator Baker threatened to keep the Senate working over next weeks scheduled Memorial Day recess if need be to complete action on the supplemental appropriation bill needed to keep the Government operating through Sept 30

"OF ACORNS, BABIES AND SIMPLE DEFINITIONS",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/20/opinion/l-of-acorns-babies-and-simple-definitions-125630.html,To the Editor I go along with Arthur Steinbergs simple definition of a human being letter May 12 The bill being considered by the Senate subcommittee that is designed to provide that human life shall be deemed to exist from conception is simply an arbitrary dictum Such dictum is the equivalent of mandating the concept that an unhatched egg is deemed to be a chick or that an acorn upon being planted is deemed to be an oak tree WALTER SILVER Brooklyn May 13 1981
OBSERVER; Whose Business Is Sin?,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/20/opinion/observer-whose-business-is-sin.html,Modern governments have a muddled record when it comes to legislating against sin Killing proscribed by the Commandments is punishable by law if undertaken as a private enterprise but not if done professionally as a soldier or an executioner say  in the service of the state Coveting a neighbors wife and cattle is forbidden by the Commandments but not by law The history of government efforts to suppress the sin of adultery is a model of the muddle politicians can wander into when they try to legislate divine pronouncements into public policy From a sin so grievous that in barbarous states it called for public execution adulterys sin rating has declined in the United States to a point where it is rarely prosecuted outside the divorce courts Other sins specifically defined by Gospel are not only tolerated by government but also officially protected against the forces of moral uplift Despite biblical prohibition for example every American is authorized if he so chooses to worship graven images If Congress tried to enact laws to imprison you for worshipping a golden idol the Supreme Court would save you  as well as the nations financial structure  by pointing out that the Constitution forbids legislating against religious practices In short the history of politicians efforts to legislate against sin shows no enduring principle at work It seems to be pretty much a matter of whether the voters want action against a given sin at a given time The Governments position on sin to paraphrase Mister Dooley seems to follow the election returns One of the most passionate uprisings against sin in this century was the campaign against alcohol which resulted in enactment of Prohibition The country was by no means agreed on the sinfulness of taking wine and spirits any more than it is now agreed on the sinfulness of abortion but the political passion generated by people persuaded that they were fighting the Lords battle carried everything before it Boozing was officially certified as sin by democratic process and draped with criminal status If it was indeed a sin sin has seldom triumphed so hugely For evidence consult any history of the boozehappy Roaring Twenties But of course legislation against sin has never succeeded in stopping it The most persistently outlawed and most vigorously prosecuted sins murder and theft  flourish today as never before if the crime statistics prove anything at all beyond the fact that crime statistics are compiled more assiduously nowadays than they used to be Doubtless the great majority of Prohibitionists devoutly believed that the law would save the country from the scourge of alcohol Many still clung to the faith long after events proved that the law was spawning not only a generation of gangsters but also a generation of otherwise respectable Americans who were learning to treat law as a joke Doubtless the great majority of Americans now so passionate against legal abortion believe just as devoutly that law will save the country from what they regard as another sinful scourge In the present rage in which this debate is conducted they are unlikely to be moved by suggestions that a second Prohibition may produce results as nasty as the first Aside from the predictable increase of criminality as otherwise respectable Americans are forced to find relief outside the law we can probably anticipate a further growth in popular contempt for law which is already corroding the civility of the society But the tone of most antiabortion literature and mail creates doubt that such considerations can deflect many persons determination to see their passionately held beliefs codified into law Generally the antiabortionists appear to be persuaded beyond argument that they are arrayed against the sin of killing as private enterprise and believe it intolerable that such killing should be done as in the case of the soldier and the executioner without punishment by the state Impassioned people confronting what they take to be sins most evil shape are seldom apt to ponder the consequences of smiting it In the case of abortion they are more likely to suppose that whatever the consequences life will be better for being lived in a society that has enacted formal statements of resolution against intolerable sin The difficulty of course is that a substantial portion of the population has a differing view of sin rejects the idea that destroying a recently fertilized egg is murder and passionately detests the idea of government authority being extended into the most personal realms of private and family life As a result there is no middle ground for compromise at present Eventually we will probably arrive back at the old conservative solution  let the politician tend to the nations earthly existence and the pastor tend to its soul In the meantime we can anticipate only great heat and little light
LEGAL SCHOLARS ASSAIL LEGISLATION TO CURB POWER OF FEDERAL COURTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/21/us/legal-scholars-assail-legislation-to-curb-power-of-federal-courts.html,A group of bills that would strip Federal courts of power to enforce Supreme Court interpretations of the Constitution on several issues came under fire today from four prominent constitutional scholars testifying before a Senate subcommittee Some of the bills would take away the jurisdiction of all Federal courts including the Supreme Court to decide cases involving such issues as abortion and school prayer or to order busing as a means of achieving racial balance in public schools Others would affect only the lower Federal courts and would leave intact the Supreme Courts appellate jurisdiction to review state court decisions in such cases All of these bills were denounced as unconstitutional by Telford Taylor who teaches constitutional law at Columbia Law School and two of the three other scholars who testified today Todays testimony opened two days of hearings by the Constitution Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the broad question of whether Congress can or should challenge the historic supremacy of the Federal judiciary over Congress and the states in matters of constitutional interpretation 2 Other Law Professors Testify The three other constitutional scholars who testified today were Leonard G Ratner a law professor at the University of Southern California George J Alexander president of the Society of American Law Teachers and Paul M Bator a Harvard Law School professor Only Mr Bator testified that some or all of the bills were within the constitutional power granted to Congress Mr Taylor testifying on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union contended that all of the bills were unconstitutional despite what he called Congress plenary control over the jurisdiction of the Federal courts because on their face they are intended to make more difficult the vindication of constitutional rights Terming efforts to take away court jurisdiction over issues on which Congress disagrees with court decisions a dangerous game which can be played at both ends of the political spectrum Mr Taylor said that such efforts could alter radically the longestablished relation and balance among the legislative executive and judicial departments Similar sentiments were expressed by Mr Ratner who said that some of the bills would destroy the essential role of the Supreme Court in the constitutional scheme and the uniformity and supremacy of Federal law by allowing the courts of different states to interpret the Constitution in conflicting ways Bator Disputes Colleagues Views Mr Bator disputed the other scholars and said that he had no doubt whatever that Congress had the power to take away the jurisdiction of the lower Federal courts to decide cases involving abortion and other matters of constitutional interpretation so long as the state courts remained open to such cases He also testified that Congress might have the power to take away Supreme Court jurisdiction to review state court decisions involving such issues But he said that such legislation would violate the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution The bills limiting court jurisdiction were also denounced as unconstitutional at a news conference today by five organizations that said they were concerned about the threat to the independence of the Federal courts The organizations were Common Cause the American Civil Liberties Union the American Jewish Congress the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs Meanwhile Project Prayer a group of organizations and individuals lobbying for a bill that would remove the power of the Supreme Court and the lower Federal courts to review state laws that provide for voluntary school prayer said that 10 of the 18 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee had indicated that they would support the bill

8 DOCTORS AT SENATE HEARING CRITICIZE ANTI-ABORTION BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/21/us/8-doctors-at-senate-hearing-criticize-anti-abortion-bill.html,A group of prominent doctors and geneticists opposing legislation that would make abortion illegal today criticized attempts by Congress to define when human life begins As Senate hearings on the abortion issue resumed Dr Lewis Thomas chancellor of the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center in New York City testified that the question of when human life begins could be resolved only in the domain of metaphysics It can be argued by philosophers and theologians but it lies beyond the reach of science said Dr Thomas leadoff witness at hearings of the Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on the Separation of Powers whose chairman Senator John P East strongly opposes abortions At issue is a bill sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina and Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois declaring that human life shall be deemed to exist from conception thus allowing states if they choose to prosecute abortion as murder The bill is based on a clause of the 14th Amendment empowering Congress to enforce guarantees of due process and equal protection Bill Backed by One Witness Senator East a North Carolina Republican who was strongly criticized last month for calling witnesses largely opposed to abortion promised exhaustive hearings on all aspects of the abortion issue Of the nine physicians called today only one Dr Mildred F Jefferson assistant clinical professor of surgery at the Boston University Medical School expressed support for the bill Dr Jefferson a key medical figure in the righttolife movement said the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion gave my profession an almost unlimited license to kill and added With the obstetrician and mother becoming the worst enemy of the child and the pediatrician becoming the assassin for the family the state must be enabled to protect the life of the child born and unborn Other physicians assailed the bill maintaining that it was scientifically insupportable to prove that life begins at conception and that the measure if enacted would bar tests for hereditary disorders and congenital defects Beyond this the doctors said the bill would effectively bar the use of the intrauterine device and the birth control bill which are believed to act after conception If this legislation is passed and if a state views the intrauterine device as an abortifacient what will I as a physician do when a pelvic examination reveals that my patient has an IUD in place asked Dr George M Ryan Jr president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Do I request that she have it removed What if she refuses Do I report her to a law enforcement agency Or am I indeed a party to a criminal act if I do not report her Only 2 Senators at Hearing Dr Ryan echoing the views of several other witnesses told Senators East and Max S Baucus Democrat of Montana the only two of the five committee members who attended the hearing  that when Congress equates cellular life to personhood it is taking a substantial leap beyond the current views of the medical and scientific community that will have a major and lasting effect upon the health care of women in this country the practice of medicine in this country and the personal health practices of a large portion of our population Senator East clashed at the threehour hearing with Dr Mary Ellen Avery chief physician at the Childrens Hospital Medical Center in Boston who said that if pressed on the issue she would express the belief that life probably began  and that fetuses were viable  at the end of the second trimester of pregnancy The Senator said he found it morally and ethically repulsive to suggst that life is based on this vague thing of viability Moments later Dr Avery asked Who are we to conceive of putting into legislation rules that will affect every woman who ever becomes pregnant to say to her You must carry out your pregnancy to term because its a life  She added Senator East I think thats nonsense Throughout the hearings Senator East said he was troubled by the cavalier attitude toward the life of the unborn by supporters of the womens right to choose an abortion At one point the Senator wondered aloud whether his own mother would have considered aborting him if she had known that he was going to get polio when he was 24 years old and remain confined to a wheelchair Warns of Illegal Abortions One of the strongest opponents of the HelmsHyde bill Dr Jessica G Davis director of the Child Development Center at the North Shore University Hospital in Manhassat LI said I have great faith in the institution of Congress but I have no respect for this bill or its unstated goal of suppressing alternatives medically safe to women who elect them Under the bill she said our ability to diagnose treat and cure numerous diseases will be stopped cold and illegal abortion will flourish and take its toll of life Thus the net effect of this bill predictably will be to take life and prevent cures of horrendous birth defects Other physicians who testified today were Dr Clifford Grobstein professor of biological science at the University of California San Diego Dr James Neel a geneticist at the University of Michigan Medical School Dr Daniel Callahan director of the Hastings Center for Society Ethics and the Life Sciences at HastingsonHudson NY and Dr Carl W Tyler a family planning specialist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta As the panel met the House agreed to a legislative maneuver designed to open the way for President Reagan to nominate Dr C Everett Koop an antiabortion leader from Philadelphia as Surgeon General On a voice vote the House approved a motion directing House conferees to accept a Senate amendment that would eliminate 64 as the maximum age for the Surgeon General Dr Koop turned 64 on Oct 14 The motion was offered by Representative Edward R Madigan Republican of Illinois who said the age limit represented the kind of age discrimination Congress sought to eliminate and called Dr Koop an outstanding person
SENATE PASSES NEW ABORTION AID CURB,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/22/us/senate-passes-new-abortion-aid-curb.html,In the midst of granting approval to a 6955 billion budget plan sought for the fiscal year 1982 by President Reagan the Senate today changed its focus to abortions and voted more stringent restrictions on Federal payments for abortions for the indigent The restrictions would strike down payments for two remaining categories of abortion in cases of rape and incest and would allow Federal payments for abortions for poor women only in cases where the life of the prospective mother was considered to be at stake The changes were passed by a vote of 52 to 43 as part of a supplemental appropriation for the remaining four months of the current fiscal year and would thus be in effect until October at least Extra Funds for Food Stamps In another element of the supplementary appropriation the Senate voted to spend 17 billion on food stamps 538 million more than in the House version The Agriculture Department has said that the extra money is needed to avoid reducing food stamps by 17 percent for Americans receiving them from June through September A HouseSenate conference committee will have to meet next month reconcile these and other differences between the two versions The tightening of the abortion restrictions a move previously approved in the House was led by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina over the objections of his partys fiscal leaders who said that fullscale debate on the issue was to be held later in the year and that it should not be treated now as a postscript to the major budgetwriting process The sudden abortion action the tightest restrictions on abortion aid ever adopted by Congress was a further indication of the conservative tone in the Senate and the House In previous years when the Democrats controlled the Senate similar measures were struck down in committee The Republican majority leadership tried the same tactics this time but Senator Helms warning that the antiabortion lobby would be attentively watching the vote prevailed The restrictions would have to be enacted again if they are to carry beyond the end of the fiscal year 1981 on Sept 30 The vote came near the end of a long day in which the Senators obviously weary of the harsh tone and the numbers of the budgetcutting process voted final approval of a 6955 billion budget for the next fiscal year thus completing the first stage in President Reagans budget reorganization plan Vote on 1982 Budget The Senate voted 76 to 20 to accept the budget measure for 1982 that was adopted yesterday by the House The joint action set a tentative range of program cuts and spending priorities The more difficult process of deciding specific cuts and appropriations still lies ahead As it now stands the 1982 budget would provide Mr Reagan substantially what he sought in the spending area including 36 billion in cuts across the spectrum of social health and education programs as well as 25 billion in additional military spending The latter increase would put military spending at 188 billion the largest peacetime military budget in history The Senate showed its enthusiasm for defense spending by approving by a voice vote a 20 million appropriation to provide manufacturing facilities for the production of binary nerve gas My God is there no limit to the voracious appetite of the military machine that wants to suck up every dollar we have here complained Senator Mark O Hatfield the Oregon Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee Proponents led by Senator John Tower Republican of Texas insisted however that the only certain way to discourage the use of nerve gas in warfare was to make sure that the nations manufacturing potential was ready He and others noted that any decision to go ahead with actual production of the gas would have to come in a separate action The losing fight against further abortion restrictions was led by Senators Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut and Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon There is growing in this country a Cotton Mather mentality Senator Packwood declared to the few senators who were present for the debate Senator Helms saying that the abortion issue was rooted in the JudeoChristian tradition and the Ten Commandments of Mount Sinai rejected arguments that up to 15000 pregnancies result from rape each year This is a red herring Senator Helms declared as a full gallery of tourists watched from above a red herring whereby people come up four months later and say Oh by the way I was raped four months ago  Before the Senates action the existing law allowed payments in cases of rape reported within 72 hours of the incident and in cases of incest The action goes next to a joint meeting with conferees from the House and then to the President who already is on record as favoring tight restrictions The supplemental appropriation providing an estimated 128 billion in further spending for this fiscal year was adopted unanimously Its spending level remains under the existing ceiling of 6614 billion The next major steps in the budget process will be action on the Presidents taxcutting plan which is expected to be amended significantly and then the detailed phase of Congresss action in enacting the budget cuts

SENATORS HEAR CONFLICTING VIEWS OVER PLAN TO PROHIBIT ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/22/us/senators-hear-conflicting-views-over-plan-to-prohibit-abortions.html,Legal authorities and Congressional figures clashed today over the constitutional implications of a bill that seeks to ban abortion and decree that all human life starts at conception Appearing before a Senate panel Lawrence H Tribe a Harvard University specialist on constitutional law said that antiabortion legislation that sought to overturn a Supreme Court ruling has inspired an unprecedented unison of voices against the bill among legal experts Virtually all careful students of the Constitution  those who write and teach about it as well as those sworn to enforce it  are likely to concur on the overarching value of taking the document seriously on the overriding danger and illegitimacy of toying with it of using it as an endrun ploy even in the noblest and most humane of causes Mr Tribe added that the bill sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina and Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois is too palpably unconstitutional to permit reasonable persons plausibly to argue the contrary Congressional Action Supported The major legal architect of the antiabortion measure Stephen H Galebach a lawyer with the Washington firm of Covington  Burling strongly disagreed He said that if the people of the United States wanted to undo the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that gave women the constitutional right to abortion all Congress had to do is pass a statute defining life Accordingly the HelmsHyde amendment declares that human life shall exist from conception therefore allowing states if they choose to prosecute abortion as murder Mr Galebach appearing today before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Separation of Powers noted that before 1973 the states had power to determine at least in the first instance what protection should be extended to unborn children By recognizing unborn children as persons the human life bill will give states a constitutional justification for protecting unborn children once again he added Court Decision Called Radical John T Noonan of the University of California School in Law in Berkeley termed the 1973 Supreme Court ruling Roe v Wade one of the most radical decisions ever made by the Court and essentially supported the human life bill William Van Alstyne of the Duke University School of Law in Durham NC opposed the measure The political panel of witnesses included three persons who spoke out strongly against the bill These were Representative Millicent Fenwick Republican of New Jersey and Senators Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon and Daniel Patrick Moynihan Democrat of New York Mr Moynihan said he could not support the bill which he said I hold to assault fundamental constitutional concepts and processes Senator Packwood said heatedly There is a growing force in this country fueled by a Cotton Mather mentality that wishes to impose on this country a Cotton Mather mentality Supporting the bill were Representative Romano L Mazzoli Democrat of Kentucky and Charles F Dougherty Republican of Pennsylvania who insisted that it was totally in Congresss domain to declare human life status at conception

"ON ABORTION, ITALIAN VOTERS ARE LESS CATHOLIC THAN THE VATICAN",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/24/weekinreview/on-abortion-italian-voters-are-less-catholic-than-the-vatican.html,When Italians voted by a margin of more than 2 to 1 last weekend to reject a churchbacked proposal for repeal of Italys liberal abortion law virtually all independent commentators regarded it as a defeat for the church and a severe personal setback for Pope John Paul II Roman Catholic spokesmen however saw it differently Presiding at a meeting of Italys 300 bishops the day the results were announced Alberto Cardinal Ballestrero said the church would refuse to bow to political vicissitudes and would continue its consciencebuilding mission Urgo Cardinal Poletti the Popes Vicar for the city of Rome added We are deeply saddened and perplexed but also serene Many voters he suggested apparently were not fully conscious of what they were doing The Italian clergy was totally committed to repeal Antiabortion posters many showing stark pictures of a fetus in the womb had been put up in most of Italys many thousand churches Some rural priests led demonstrations Priests spoke out against the law from the pulpit and in Genoa a pastoral letter urging repeal was read in all churches Only a handful of Italian prelates including the Bishops of Milan and Ivrea stayed aloof or actively oppposed the campaign Nevertheless only one of Italys 20 regions  TrentoAlto Adige  voted for repeal and then only by a bare 503 percent Alto Adige is in the northeast where church influence is strongest and which is the home region of the last three Italian popes The economically backward southern rural areas voted solidly against repeal The repeal forces got only 329 percent in Sicily and they didnt fare much better in Calabria and Abruzzi where women go to church regularly and where according to conventional wisdom they vote as the priest advises This time they evidently did not In many families elderly women were said to have made a deliberate decision that the church was wrong on this issue Many otherwise nonpolitical younger women volunteered to speak at public meetings against repeal Italians have compared last weeks abortion vote with the 3to2 rejection in May 1974 of a churchsupported proposal for the repeal of Italys first divorce law But there were important differences In 1974 Pope Paul VI stayed personally aloof from the campaign and merely praised the clergy near the end for its fight against divorce John Paul II by contrast took personal charge speaking out strongly and often against the abortion law At least once he characterized the law as an offense to human rights and a violation of the biblical commandment thou shalt not kill This was seen by many Italians as interference in Italian affairs In hindsight however many Italians said the Pope had overestimated his influence on public opinion and underestimated Italians desire to run their political affairs without help from the clergy We are a modern lay country the leftist newspaper La Repubblica concluded after the vote When the Pope was shot four days before the vote Italians felt deep compassion for him There was speculation that a wave of emotional identification with him would be reflected at the polls but it wasnt Another important difference between the defeats last week and in 1974 concerned the role of the ruling Christian Democrats Led by former Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani their president they threw themselves wholeheartedly into the divorce referendum When the law was overwhelmingly upheld the Christian Democrats and Mr Fanfani were seen as the chief losers The clergys loss seemed secondary This time however many Christian Democratic leaders remained cautiously in the background Although the RighttoLife Movement leading the campaign for repeal was founded by Christian Democrats and the party secretary Flaminio Piccoli supported it actively the party as a whole did not fully commit itself The political damage to the Christian Democrats was thus limited and the church was judged as the main loser Bettino Craxi the Socialist Party leader has been strengthened by the abortion referendum outcome it is generally agreed Mr Craxi who hopes to be the first nonChristian Democrat Prime Minister since World War II was one of the most outspoken opponents of repeal of the law He also was one of the politicians who most openly criticized the Pope Mr Craxi accused him of seeing Italy through Polish glasses and added  correctly as it turned out  that the hold that the church has on the Polish people simply does not exist in Italy The abortion law was passed in May 1978 as a compromise measure after several years of debate The ruling Christian Democrats were opposed but allowed it to go through without an allout fight Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti did not consider the action a vote of nonconfidence and did not resign Under the law women over 18 years old can ask for an abortion within the first 90 days of pregnancy if there is a threat to the physical or psychological health of the mother Abortions may also be obtained for reasons such as rape and the danger that the child may be deformed One of the authors prime objectives was to reduce the number of illegal abortions Before the law was passed many rural women regarded abortion as the only way to stop having children Sex education in schools was nonexistent then Under the clergys influence relatively few women had access to birth control information or the possibility of purchasing contraceptives This taboo has been broken the laws defenders say Under a provision of the law womens advisory clinics have been opened Considering the fact that it is Catholic Italys first abortion law it has functioned fairly well  at least in the north Feminists complain that in rural areas particularly in the south it is still difficult to obtain an abortion The law gives physicians the right to list themselves as conscientious objectors who may refuse to perform abortions When it was first passed twothirds of the gynecologists in state hospitals and all medical personnel in Italys many Catholic hospitals declared as conscientious objectors Since then however the law has gained acceptance in state hospitals In the first half of last year 112187 abortions were reported by the Health Ministry Twice as many illegal abortions took place in the same period the ministry estimates
ADVOCACY PROGRAMS- SOCIAL ACTION GROUPS ARE WEILDING A POWERFUL WEAPON,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/24/arts/advocacy-programs-social-action-groups-are-weilding-a-powerful-weapon.html, Myron Berger is a freelance writer with a particular interest in television BY MYRON BERGER Increasingly during the past four years socialaction and political groups have been discovering that television can be as effective in promoting ideas and causes as it is in peddling soaps and soups Programs forcefully advocating a particular organizations viewpoint frequently show up on the schedules of independent stations around the country The trend is also carrying over to the networks  Last year The SALT Syndrome a halfhour documentary produced by a Washingtonbased organization called the American Security Council and warning of alleged dangers in the limiting of strategic arms was televised on 500 stations including WNEWChannel 5 and WPIXChannel 11 in New York City  War Without Winners a halfhour rejoinder to The SALT Syndrome produced by the Center for Defense Information another Washingtonbased specialinterest group was subsequently televised on 200 stations including WNEW  Last December Whatever Happened to the Human Race a 90minute antiabortion program was shown in prime time on WJLA the ABC affiliate in Washington DC in January the affiliates of all three networks in the Nebraska Panhandle telecast the same program immediately following the Superbowl Game  Beginning in July the American Broadcasting Company will accept oneminute issue advertisements for network distribution sometime after its lateevening Nightline news program Such programs are remarkable because traditionally news and documentaries on television  whatever their other faults  have striven to be fair and impartial and to avoid propaganda To be sure the major network news organizations still strive to meet this standard but increasingly advocacy programs are creeping onto the screen There is of course one obstacle to the spread of advocacy programs Under the Fairness Doctrine the showing of a program or commercial advocating a particular position requires that other viewpoints be given a reasonable opportunity to respond which in some instances could mean providing free time to a number of opponents The big stations for obvious reasons are reluctant to do this At some smaller stations however officials often take a fairly lax view of adherence to the doctrine The distributor of one liberal program contacted the station manager of a small CBS affiliate that had just broadcast the conservative SALT Syndrome to ask for response time Fairness Doctrine response replied the official Listen we run Walter Cronkite every night The SALT Syndrome was in response to that The point is that what the Fairness Doctrine calls for is balance and balance is subject to individual interpretation It is on this basis that many local stations rationalize telecasting advocacy programs to balance network programs Indeed there appears to be little or no problem in finding stations willing to broadcast advocacy programs Mike Thompson president of Long Advertising a firm that specializes in producing and distributing this type of program claims to have identified some 350 stations  there are only 1000 commercial and public stations in the entire country  that will regularly accept them One advocacy program currently being distributed around the country is the Attack on the Americas Were it not for the unmistakable bias of this professionally crafted halfhour program which argues forcefully that Soviet strategists are orchestrating a domino plan of local revolution and resistance in Central America and the Caribbean it might well be taken for a network documentary An unseen announcer recites figures and alleged facts while the screen shows footage of ragtag guerrilla troops toting semiautomatic weapons military and political experts are interviewed and on a map of the Western Hemisphere danger zones such as Cuba El Salvador and Nicaragua glow ominously while the announcer issues dire warnings about subversion threatening the security of the United States The producer and sponsor of Attack on the Americas is the same group that made The SALT Syndrome the American Security Council ASC  a private organization formed at the height of the cold war to warn American businessmen of a danger looming east of the Iron Curtain While no one seems to know quite how many of these programs are in current distribution it seems fairly certain that before 1981 is finished every television viewer in the United States will have been exposed to at least one ideological appeal at an aggregate cost to their sponsors of millions of dollars Because of the economics of television and the limited budgets of many specialinterest organizations more advocacy programs will be televised in smaller cities than in larger ones Many if not most broadcasts will be paid for by the producing organization some groups however will attempt to get their efforts televised at no cost by claiming a right of response under the Fairness Doctrine of the Federal Communications Act or by offering their production as a publicservice or publicaffairs program At least two advertising agencies Long Advertising in Miami and A Eicoff in Chicago  have developed a specialty in the distribution of advocacy programs two other agencies  WinnerWagner in Los Angeles and Smith Harroff in Washington DC  concentrate on advocacy advertising generally brief commercial spots but occasionally fulllength programs Probably the most successful advocacy effort to date has been The SALT Syndrome which according to the American Security Councils records has been televised more than 2000 times in many instances just prior to Election Day on some 500 television stations  which is greater than the number of times and stations transmitting a given episode of Dallas or an average of four showings per station Also according to the ASC The SALT Syndrome received 850 paid showings 200 free telecasts as a publicservice or Fairness Doctrine program 650 exposures on Public Broadcasting Service outlets and 450 plays on cabletelevision stations Philip Cox an official of the ASC says the program cost a total of 250000 in production fundraising administration and management expenses When the cost of distribution ie buying air time is added the project according to Mr Cox runs into several million dollars Figures published by the ASC indicate that 5 million had been earmarked by the council for its television activities alone in 1980 The council considered this sum a good investiment In its Guidelines for Survival the council stated If the past ratio between money spent on television and new contributors continues we would gain over 1000000 new contributors which  after allowing for attrition  will prouduce an income of 10000000 a year The SALT Syndrome and many other advocacy programs contain a fundraising commercial that generally offers a pitch along these lines If you agree with us that this message is important to the American people please send a contribution to help pay for more showings of this program Mr Thompson of Long Advertising maintains that five of the six productions his agency has been involved with have either broken even or made money for the sponsoring group And as he points out to prospective clients If it pays for itself youre getting two things Youre getting your message across at no cost and youre getting a list of prospective members  a longterm benefit As a rule sponsors find that network affiliates in larger cities will not carry their programs According to Mr Thompson Weve never been able to buy network affiliates in the top 20 markets You just cant offer them enough money  time is simply not for sale So the distribution pattern that has evolved is to approach independent stations in large cities and network affiliates elsewhere The reluctance of the large affiliates derives in part from the networks policies against advocacy programing from the less than sensational ratings political documentaries tend to draw and from the possible eventual availability of a balanced network program on the same subject One notable exception is the ABC affiliate in Washington DC Carol Myers program manager of WJLATV has twice permitted advocacy programs on the station the 90minute antiabortion production entitled Whatever Happened to the Human Race shown in prime time at a cost of only 30000 to the Hosanna Ministries Inc and a 30minute program entitled Pornography You Are Its Victim sponsored by Morality in Media this last group incidentally is so pleased with the success of their first show they are now producing a 13part series of 30minute programs on pornography for broadcast late this year or in early 1982 Miss Myers alone makes the decision on whether to televise an advocacy program after consulting with the stations legal counsel and general manager  a procedure common at many stations How does she decide Basically she says you ask Is this subject of public importance Is it an ongoing discussion Then you look at all your programming in the past and what youve covered and how youve covered it Then ask Are you prepared to provide free response time and free production facilities Or even produce a reply yourself At Channel 5 in New York Muriel Reis assistant general counsel of Metromedia and vice president of WNEW makes the decision in conjunction with the program director and general manager What did we do When How did we do it are the key factors she says Mrs Reis believes advocacy programming stimulates debate Its a tool for getting a marketplace of ideas  which I think is positive Other station managers particularly at network affiliates view advocacy programs with considerably more alarm I dont think advocacy programming is in the public interest its tantamount to propaganda says Chuck Gingold program director of WABCTV in New York Dick Lobo the station manager at WNBCTV in New York quotes from the networks policy manual Time will not be sold for the presentation of views on controversial issues and advertisers may not use their commercial positions for addressing such issues New Yorks publictelevision station WNETChannel 13 takes the position that if were going to cut out every show with a point of view we might as well hang it up according to Liz Oliver who oversees the acquisition of independently produced works As a principle she said I cant air a film produced for an organization with a vested interest in the subject Were not in the business of presenting propaganda but in the business of presenting a variety of viewpoints Despite the potential difficulties in finding stations willing to televise advocacy programs political groups are entering the field in dramatically increasing numbers James Norell director of communications for the National Rifle Association NRA says Since the media isnt going to do the job well cover it ourselves The NRA has just completed It Cant Happen Here and expects to have the show televised around the country later this year Not unexpectedly Charles Orasin executive vice president of Handgun Control Inc which has produced The American Handgun War vows If the NRA buys time for their show well buy time for ours Andy Messing executive director of the Conservative Caucus and a veteran of eight advocacy programs on behalf of a number of conservative organizations is fond of referring to the projects as flicks and considers himself to be something of a Cecil B de Mille of the right wing Technology is one of the things you have to use as a helpful tool he notes the left has been doing it for years Theyve been dominating the airways If we have to buy the time to get our point of view on the air well do it And so of the 3 million budget of the Caucus a little under 1 million will go to all costs of our TV projects he says Liberal and leftwing groups meanwhile do not agree that they have been as successful with television as conservatives suggest Leah Sayles executive director of the Womens Health Services clinics in Pittsburgh was involved in the production of So Many Voices a program advocating the right to abortion We felt she said that the antichoice groups were getting a lot of effective media and our side had to be reactive Our people havent used the media very much or very effectively The Center for Defense Information CDI an organization dedicated to the deescalation of the arms race produced War Without Winners directed by the Hollywood cinematographer Haskell Wexler because The success of conservative films convinced us of the need for a more balanced film says Arthur Kanegis who oversees the organizations film projects The program he says cost 150000 to produce was seen by an estimated 145 million viewers and was carried by most stations without charge Not surprisingly many of those involved with the trend would like to see a change in the Fairness Doctrine Mike Thompson of Long Advertising I think when twothirds of the television stations in this country refuse advocacy programs its a bad sign for democracy There is also feeling among some broadcasters that the doctrine should be revised or modified one advertising agency claims to be preparing a court move to have it revoked Whether or not the Fairness Doctrine remains in effect it seems unlikely that specialinterest groups would be willing to surrender this new tool just when they are mastering its uses and reaping its benefits Indeed the stronger likelihood is that advocacy programming will increase The films Im talking about says Andy Messing are seen by millions of people Were not talking about taking this flick to a Kiwanis Club and letting 300 people see it Were breaking into the media market And if we cant break into a network well pyramid it one affiliate at

The Nation In Summary; SENATE RESTRICTS ABORTION FUNDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/24/weekinreview/the-nation-in-summary-senate-restricts-abortion-funds.html,Even before Election Day when Republicans were put in charge the Senate had become increasingly receptive to restrictions on the right of women to obtain Federally financed abortions Last week after its first debate on the issue the Senate voted 52to43 for tighter limits The margin probably didnt accurately reflect the depth of the Senates sympathy for antiabortion measures  or its fear of the righttolife movements political clout At issue was a proposed amendment to a supplemental appropriations bill Many Senators voted nay only because they felt that the amendment sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina would be an inappropriate appendage to a money bill Senator Mark O Hatfield Republican of Oregon and chairman of the Appropriations Committee was one such reluctant opponent he was a cosponsor of the first constitutional amendment to ban abortions Lets put the appropriations process into perspective Mr Helms argued We cant walk away from this issue Abortion is the deliberate termination of human life His amendment similar to language already adopted by the House of Representatives would permit the Government to pay for abortions only if a womans life was endangered by pregnancy rape or incest would no longer be acceptable grounds Meanwhile a Senate subcommittee headed by one of Mr Helmss conservative homestate disciples John P East provided equal time for opponents of a proposal that would sharply restrict all abortions The subcommittee last month heard five medical witnesses say they were convinced as the proposal states unequivocally that a human life is created at the moment of conception One of last weeks witnesses Dr Lewis Thomas chancellor of the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center in New York testified that the question could be resolved only in the domain of metaphysics not in the realm of partisan politics and singleissue pressure groups Several other doctors and geneticists said that the legislation  which would among other things allow states to prosecute abortion as murder  would mean the end of much medical research and endanger the lives of countless women The legislation is intended to effectively overturn Roe v Wade the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion in the early months of pregnancy
STAGE: 'FARMYARD' LOOKS AT ELEMENTAL HUMANITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/24/theater/stage-farmyard-looks-at-elemental-humanity.html,The people who inhabit Franz Xaver Kroetzs compulsively fascinating Farmyard at the Theater for the New City are inarticulate peasants who are unable to understand or explain their actions Some of the events of their lives are grotesque to the point of seeming bestial at times the characters behave like dumb animals and there are sounds of livestock in the background to remind us of the environment There is a humanity here but of the most elemental nature In this play as in his Request Concert at the Interart Theater the author denudes life of all its theatricality Monstrous things just happen and Mr Kroetz records them without averting his gaze As with Request Concert a silent monodrama in which a woman goes home to her apartment and her private routine there are moments in Farmyard when we feel like voyeurs  and for some theatergoers the experience with its emphasis on the sexual and the excretory may prove oppressive Any attempt at summarizing the plot is bound to seem like an obscene rural fable a middleaged hired man rapes the retarded daughter of a farm couple But such a view would omit the authors unconventional artistry and his radical line of vision Farmyard is a slice of life in the same sense that Diane Arbuss portraits are simply photographed images Mr Kroetz turns his camera eye on man and woman at the most basic level and though his observations seem dispassionate his play is suffused with primitive emotions and there is even a kind of beauty The encounter between the girl and the hired man becomes a love story Each reaches out to the other because of loneliness awakening sexuality and instinct The hired man is dismissed not in anger but because there is no recourse For a brief moment it appears as if the father may kill his pregnant daughter but he decides otherwise an act of instinct rather than mercy Similarly the wife prepares to perform a homemade abortion but when she sees her placidly accepting child naked in the kitchen awaiting her fate she too retreats With the birth approaching the girl is flooded with a look of peacefulness As civilized beings we are conditioned to apply our code of morality to the situation but the lonely girl seems to regard her condition as a fact of life and her motherhood as something of a blessing As adapted by Michael Roloff and Jack Gelber the dialogue is homely sometimes coarse and unpoetic The play is a nonstop series of episodes some as brief as blackouts In the bleakness of the surroundings and the inevitability of the outcome  ordinary people buffeted by the wind of events the play reminds one somewhat of Woyzeck Lawrence Sacharows production is dutifully understated the approach is the opposite of melodrama On a rude setting by Abe Lubelski the actors are rooted in rusticity Joel Rooks and Anita Keal as the farmer and his wife Tom Noonan and Pamela Pascoe as the hired man and the daughter Mr Noonan plays his character with a sadeyed gentleness Miss Pascoe an adult actress with her hair in pigtails and her socks drooping effectively conceals herself within the guise of an adolescent On the basis of Farmyard and Request Concert it is evident that the young playwright is in the direct line of German modernists in the theater a genealogy that runs from Buchner to Brecht through Handke and now to Kroetz These are not plays that one is likely to forget The Cast FARMYARD by Franz Xaver Kroetz American version by Michael Roloff in collaboration with Jack Gelber directed by Lawrence Sacharow setting by Abe Lubelski costumes by Deborah Benson lighting by Joanna Schielke Presented by the Theater for the New City George Bartenieff and Crystal Field At 162 Second Avenue Wife Anita Keal Beppi Pamela Pascoe Sepp Tom Noonan Farmer Joel Rooks Dog Jonesy
Abroad at Home; COTTON MATHER POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/24/opinion/abroad-at-home-cotton-mather-politics.html,One of the important elements in Ronald Reagans election was rightwing fervor on social and religious issues The Moral Majority and other groups roused a lot of voters with their calls to end abortion put prayer back in the schools and resist the womens movement as a threat to the family Since Jan 20 the Reagan Administration has done its best to keep those questions on the back burner in Congress It did not want its economic program obstructed by an emotional fight over social issues But now the fight is on And we can already see that it represents a danger to the President  not to his economic package which is on its way but more deeply to the political climate in the country Abortion that most divisive of issues has led the way Senator Jesse Helms and others have been pressing for action on a bill to get around the Supreme Courts decision that it is unconstitutional to make early abortions a crime by a simple declaration that human life begins at conception Then last week the Senate by a vote of 52 to 43 attached to an appropriation bill the strictest antiabortion rider it has ever approved The language forbids the use of Federal funds to pay for a poor womans abortion unless the pregnancy threatens her life It rules out abortions under Medicaid even in cases of rape or incest In the debate on the rider the issues were ones not of party but of faith really of religious belief The chief debaters were all Republicans on one side Senator Helms on the other Senators Bob Packwood and Lowell Weicker Senator Helms specifically rejected appeals for the approximately 15000 women who become pregnant as the result of rape each year Under existing law they are eligible for Medicaid abortions if they are poor and have reported the rape within 72 hours But Senator Helms spoke of a red herring whereby people come up four months later and say Oh by the way I was raped four months ago  Senator Packwood said There is growing in this country a Cotton Mather mentality  narrow unforgiving He spoke of a feeling that God speaks to me I will tell you what He says Tough luck if youre not on the same wavelength  Senator Helms answered Were talking about the deliberate termination of human life If thats a Cotton Mather mentality so be it There is a set of instructions that came down from Mount Sinai about that That drew from Senator Weicker Were not running this country from divine commandments or instructions from Mount Sinai My guess is that most Americans do not want this country run by divine commandments  or rather by politicians who claim exclusive knowledge of those commandments the intolerance that motivated Cotton Mather in the Salem witch trials is not the basis of the American political system Fundamentalist religion is gaining strength in the United States But I do not believe it follows that religious Americans want a theocracy as their form of government Many even of the strongest personal beliefs would hold to the countrys tradition of diversity in faith and separation of religion from government It happens also that a guarantee of diversity  a prohibition on the mixing of church and state  is written into the Constitution And most Americans when they think about it are not likely to favor radical change in that aspect of our fundamental law Then there is the place of the Supreme Court in our system Americans rallied in 1937 to protect a Court whose decisions they did not like against the courtpacking plan of a highly popular President I think the feeling for the Court as an institution as a safeguard is just as strong today Most Americans will feel uneasy about changing the Courts reading of the Constitution by simple legislation The public then may come to see those who raise the social issues not as conservatives but as radical zealots And the mood of friendly tolerance for conservative experiment in Washington could turn sour In the same week that the antiabortionists were pushing to the extreme in Washington Italians by a 2to1 margin rejected a tightening of their moderate abortion law  and did so despite the emotional circumstance of the attack on the Pope It would be ironic if a country with a First Amendment were to let religion command politics more than it does in Rome Another irony is that some of the same men who talk about translating the word of God into American legislation show little concern for the godless cruelties of other governments Senator Helms indicates no desire to have the United States speak out against torture in Uruguay or official antiSemitism in Argentina There again I doubt that the rightwing zealots speak for America The more the extreme right sets the pace the more danger there is that Ronald Reagans Washington will lose its rapport with the country
Life Proscribed,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/24/opinion/life-proscribed.html,The Senate seconding the House has put further restrictions on Federal funding for abortions for the poor Medicaid payments for ending pregnancies resulting from rape or incest were struck down now only those poor whose lives are at stake are eligible But since what God does or does not want came up often during the debate its safe to assume that there will soon be attempts to abridge the reproductive freedom of women who live above the poverty line Surely those Congressmen who speak for God will not claim that He makes one rule for those who can afford medical help and another for those who cannot There is another issue however that those so deeply involved in deciding who should and should not bear children have chosen not to discuss And that is when is a womans life at stake Establishing the proper medical definitions for an endangered life is hard enough Establishing philosophical definitions has been the preoccupation of centuries One that was thought to be settled eight years ago when abortion was ruled legal by the Supreme Court is being questioned again Has a female who is forced to incubate a fetus against her will and who is thereby robbed at least for a time of the choosing self also been robbed of her life The answer is still yes
VIEWING THE VISUAL ARTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/24/books/viewing-the-visual-arts.html,YOU CANT KEEP A GOOD WOMAN DOWN By Alice Walker 167 pp New York Harcourt Brace Jovanovich 1095 LIKE the Victorians we consider certain subjects fit for fiction and others too hot to handle Unlike the Victorians however we dont know we think that  were too busy congratulating ourselves on our sexual frankness to see that there might be other sorts of blindness and prudery Nowhere is this more clearly demonstrated than in the contemporary short story Anyone browsing among a recent years worth of American magazines might reasonably conclude that short fiction is by definition a medium in which white middleclass writers express elegiac and seemly sentiments about such noncontroversial topics as divorce and the deaths of relatives and that when those same writers want to talk about what is really on their minds they turn to journalism  as have many think their readers For this reason I give Alice Walker the noted black poet and novelist much credit for daring to engage in fictional terms well quasifictional terms more on that later some of the major racialsexualpolitical issues of our time Advancing Luna  and Ida B Wells examines the rape of a white civil rights worker by a black civil rights worker from the point of view of the black woman who is the victims best friend The Abortion dissects the complex effect on a black middleclass marriage of the wifes abortion Coming Apart and Porn deal with male sadomasochistic sexual fantasies as experienced by puzzled and insulted wives and girlfriends Its important frankly political semitaboo subject matter should automatically make You Cant Keep a Good Woman Down fascinating to anyone black or white with his head not completely entrenched in the sand Miss Walker has moreover at least one priceless literary gift that of sounding absolutely authoritative And there was the smell of clean poverty  a sharp bitter odor almost acrid as if the women washed themselves in chemicals She was attractive but just barely and with effort Had she been the slightest bit overweight for instance she would have  faded into the background where even in a revolution fat people seem destined to go Then too she has a watchful eye for such quirky small details as the church pew straight and spare as Abe Lincoln lying down lugged up from the rural South to decorate an East Village living room or the overdressed Mai Tais in an Alaskan bar in addition to the traditional umbrella there were tiny snowshoes These qualities give edge and sparkle to the more conventional stories the ones in which Miss Walker has imagined herself into one version or other of the spunky tough irrepressible good woman of the title I was not surprised perhaps but I was charmed by Nineteen FiftyFive in which we hear an old black blues singer read Big Mama Thornton contemplate the young white rockandroll singer read Elvis Presley who has risen to stardom by singing her song read Hound Dog Equally vivid and a little more unusual is Fame in which a crotchety vain and brilliant old black writer receives an award  her 111th literary honor  from a collection of academic toadies she takes great pleasure in privately despising These comparatively modest stories though are outweighed by those that are at once more overtly political and more stylistically innovative But as Miss Walker aims for more she achieves less These latter stories occupy a sort of middle ground between personal statement political parable conventional story and vaguely experimental fiction  and this is not a comfortable place for short stories to find themselves As fiction they must be about particular people but as parable they must be about people as types As personal statement or as conventional fiction they lead us to think we are hearing the voice of the author the experimental techniques that Miss Walker employs subvert that assumption by calling our attention to the author as inventor and manipulator of every aspect of what we are reading Perhaps in order to cover over these conflicts Miss Walker has relied heavily on the use of an elaborately detached sardonic flatsounding prose style But this tone is completely wrong for these stories they are too partisan the black woman is always the most sympathetic character They are also too unfocused too full of loose ends and unanswered questions and of characters that are half odd and interesting individuals and half political or narrative conveniences I never believed for a minute for instance that the black woman narrator was really the best friend of poor Luna who allowed herself to be raped by a black man in Georgia rather than scream and possibly precipitate a lynching A friend would have felt some human sympathy along with however much political angst or if not would have had to confront this lack Instead Luna the person is quickly bundled offstage dismissed in irritating ironyladen tones for playing at poverty for radical chicness for wanting to reduce human complexities to politics  all qualities as it happens that are shared by the narrator Why So that Miss Walker can spend the rest of the story on disjointed sections with pretentious titles like Afterwords Afterwards Second Thoughts and Luna Ida B Wells  Discarded Notes that put forward a confused welter of thoughts and feelings about interracial rape including the unhelpful suggestion that it is paid for by the FBI Only the most coolly abstract and rigorously intellectual writer can bring off this sort of fictionalessayistic hybrid Those who admired Miss Walkers previous work in particular her fine novel Meridian and her earlier volume of short stories In Love and Trouble will know that her strengths lie elsewhere As a storyteller she is impassioned sprawling emotional lushly evocative steeped in place in memory in the compelling power of narrative itself A lavishly gifted writer in other words  but not of this sort of book
Where Chastity Is Not Virtuous,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/25/opinion/where-chastity-is-not-virtuous.html,Liberals are not the only ones capable of mischief in the name of good intentions It is time to apply the same standard to conservative doctrine Who after all opposes the values of the profamily movement Who denies the desirability of a society freed from abortion broken families and pregnant teenagers But lofty aspirations do not justify programs that do more harm than good Take the latest effort to legislate teenage morality This benighted piece of profamily legislation sponsored by Senators Jeremiah Denton and Orrin Hatch is known as the chastity bill but it is no joke The proposal purports to address the huge and worrisome increase in sexual activity among teenagers and one of its byproducts abortion The senators would spend 30 million a year to counteract teenage promiscuity which they define to mean sexual intercourse outside of marriage They know of course that this definition would be applicable to about half the nations 17yearolds How would they counteract promiscuity With a new array of Governmentsponsored projects mainly educational encouraging abstinence Precisely what these might be is not spelled out in the bill which leaves a great deal to the discretion and imagination of the Secretary of Health and Human Services To youngsters who nonetheless ignore this Governmental instruction in morality the program would offer pregnancy tests and a limited form of counseling it would discourage pregnant youngsters from having abortions and encourage them to give their children up for adoption There is a clear assumption in the bill that teenagers make poor mothers and a bias that if chastity is foregone adoption is best There are two things wrong with the idea First it would give Government an ideology about sex and lead it to substitute its values for those of family and church What an odd way of promoting the family Moreover a counseling program would be redundant There already exists a program expressing societys clear economic interest in preventing unwanted children Why then start another Because Senators Denton and Hatch and the profamily movement do not approve of the broad range of counseling that teenagers get through the threeyearold Adolescent Pregnancy Program Its 27 centers talk frankly about the options of birth control and chastity and of abortion and adoption The new program with three times more money than the old would deny funds to agencies that persist in suggesting abortion as one legal course Adoption is certainly a reasonable choice but it is only one choice There would be no need for starting a brand new Federal program merely to inform teenagers about adoption  unless the real aim were to punish the agencies that also mention abortion If the existing program were biased as no one has demonstrated it could be improved If it is too small it can be enlarged What pregnant teenagers need most however are honest advice and decent support not lectures from Government intended to change their morals and to deny them their rights
Abortion Debate Evokes Heated Schweiker Reply,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/25/us/abortion-debate-evokes-heated-schweiker-reply.html,Health and Human Services Secretary Richard S Schweiker in a heated exchange about the Reagan Administrations polices on abortion said today that he had difficulty understanding why we can get all wrought up about tadpoles and not unborn kids Asked in on the NBC News program Meet the Press whether the Administrations promise to get Government off the backs of the people contradicted its belief that abortion even in cases of rape or incest should be outlawed Secretary Schweiker responded I think where actually I see the contradiction is that we have a proposal that in essence says we are going to save the baby seals we are going to save the baby whales we are even going to save the snail darters and stop a dam but we wont save the unborn child I have trouble understanding why we can get all wrought up about tadpoles and not unborn kids Carl Rowan a columnist for The Chicago SunTimes interjected Im talking about women not tadpoles So am I Secretary Schweiker retorted and Im talking about unborn babies and the right to kill them The Secretary said the Administration believed the fetus has the same right as the mother once the fetus is on its way
Time for a New Surgeon General,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/26/opinion/time-for-a-new-surgeon-general.html,Initially the nomination of Dr C Everett Koop to be Surgeon General the head of the Public Health Service had been stalled on a technicality He was under present law seven months too old for the job The House now seems to have removed the age barrier But there is and always has been a far more important reason to resist Dr Koops nomination What should stop this appointment altogether is thoughtful consideration of the doctors credentials He is simply the wrong man for the job Dr Koop is indisputably a distinguished pediatric surgeon But unlike previous Surgeons General he has had virtually no experience in public health It is hardly surprising then but surely significant that his nomination to the post is the first the American Public Health Association has opposed in its 109 years Dr Koop holds many opinions that make him attractive to the Reagan Administration above all his opposition to abortion But opinions are not qualifications The nomination is a disservice not only to the Public Health Service and the public but also to Dr Koop He is being honored for the most cynical of reasons  not for his medical skills but for his political compatibility
ITALY'S CABINET QUITS AS MASONIC SCANDAL RUPTURES COALITION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/27/world/italy-s-cabinet-quits-as-masonic-scandal-ruptures-coalition.html,The Cabinet of Prime Minister Arnaldo Forlani resigned today as a result of the revelation that hundreds of highranking officials were members of a secret Masonic lodge The Governments fall became inevitable when the Socialists the key partners of the Christian Democrats in the fourparty coalition refused to go along with Mr Forlanis plans for a small Cabinet reshuffle Mr Forlani is a Christian Democrat The Socialists want a new Government They have served notice that they will insist that their own leader Bettino Craxi be given a chance to become Prime Minister If he succeeds it would be the first time since the end of World War II that a Christian Democrat was not Prime Minister Italy has had 40 Governments since the war Law Against Secret Groups There is a law in Italy against secret organizations Italys 550 Masonic lodges are not regarded as secret organizations because their membership lists while not made public are presumed to be available to the authorities upon request But authorities said today that Licio Gelli grandmaster of the lodge that the highranking military and civilian officials belonged to had kept his membership list secret thus exposing the people on his list to prosecution for membership in an illegal secret organization Investigating magistrates have linked Mr Gelli to the fake kidnapping of the financier Michele Sindona and have charged him with criminal association and espionage Other lodge members are suspects in currencylaw violations espionage and the assassination of a journalist Refusal Leads to Resignation Salvatore Formica a leading Socialist and a former Cabinet member said today that the Socialists bid for the post of Prime Minister was logical and inevitable The Italian Socialists have been buoyed by the victory of Francois Mitterrand a Socialist in the French presidential election as well as the fact that the Italian voters last weekend voted overwhelmingly to maintain the nations abortion law even though both the Roman Catholic Church and many Christian Democrats campaigned for repeal Mr Craxi refused to attend a meeting of the leaders of the four coalition parties that Mr Forlani called to discuss the crisis The Prime Minister was left with no choice but to submit his resignation to President Sandro Pertini He did so this morning Mr Pertini will consult with all the political parties tomorrow and then name a new Prime Minister By custom Mr Pertini will first have to give Mr Forlani a second chance If Mr Forlani is not able to put a Cabinet together Mr Pertini will probably name another Christian Democrat as the party has the most seats in Parliament Mr Craxis turn may come if the second Christian Democrat fails Mr Pertini himself a Socialist turned to Mr Craxi once before in July 1979 after Giulio Andreotti resigned But the Christian Democrats were able to block Mr Craxi and after a crisis that lasted several months another Christian Democrat Francesco Cossiga became Prime Minister Since then however Mr Craxi has improved his political position His party has regularly if modestly been gaining ground in local and national elections Inside the party Mr Craxi won a protracted power struggle against the partys left wing He has given his party an increasingly centrist cast and led it into the Government in a partnership with the Christian Democrats after dropping his earlier insistence that he would do so only if the Communists were also permitted to participate in the Government But the Socialists are still only the third party in the country and a poor third at that They have about 10 percent of the seats in Parliament The Christian Democrats have 38 percent and the Communists 30 percent The scandal that provoked Mr Forlanis resignation is regarded by many Italians as the worst that Italy has endured in the last 30 years It intensified last Thursday when Mr Forlani on the advice of magistrates in Milan who are investigating the case made public a list of 953 names of men reportedly belonging to Masonic Lodge Propaganda 2 The list was found in the country house of Mr Gelli a millionaire industrialist The names included Cabinet ministers members of Parliament judges generals bankers journalists and other powerful figures Masonic lodges played a prominent role in Italy in the 19th century and at the start of the 20th century They were banned under Mussolini but became legal again after World War II The magistrates charged that Gelli had constructed a very real state within the state They linked Mr Gelli to the fake kidnapping of Mr Sindona the convicted financier who had sought to avoid trial in New York by fleeing to Europe Mr Gelli who is in hiding was also charged with criminal association and espionage A leading Milan banker Roberto Calvi a member of the lodge and friend of Mr Gelli and Mr Sindona was arrested on charges of illegally taking large sums of money out of Italy a charge also placed against Mr Sindona Another member of the lodge Col Antonio Viezzer was arrested and charged with espionage Colonel Viezzer is also under investigation for possible involvement in the assassination of a journalist Mino Pecorelli who was the author of an obscure newsletter that often dealt with police and secret service matters Many of the people on Mr Gellis list have denied being members of his lodge Others said that they had contacts with him but had done nothing wrong Of the three Cabinet ministers on the list only one Adolfo Sarti a Christian Democrat has resigned But he has maintained his innocence as do the two others one of whom is a Socialist

IN THE NATION; Reagan's Rusty Edges,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/29/opinion/in-the-nation-reagan-s-rusty-edges.html,If Ronald Reagans proposals for reduced expenditures for Social Security mark the beginning of a downturn in his political fortunes as seems likely the irony will be as thick as Jesse Helmss Southern accent As Lyndon Johnson might have said Mr Reagans Social Security plan appears to be a dog that wont hunt thus the Democrats could hardly resist flogging it black and blue But the truth is that something does have to be done about Social Security it has to be done this year since the money will run out by the fall of 1982 and responsible Democrats had been importuning the President to put forward a plan so that the pension system then could be rescued on a bipartisan compromise basis Thats still the necessity since neither Mr Reagan nor the opposition can pass an unpopular Social Security bill without the others help But the White House broke every rule for springing a controversial program on an unsuspecting populace It failed to consult with Congress or the most affected groups it failed to get a reading from its own political oracles and it appeared to break faith with Mr Reagans campaign pledges Compounding these felonies White House operatives broke the news just before a Congressional byelection in Maryland apparently one good reason why the Republicans lost it and only days before senators and representatives went home to feel the public pulse Inevitably theyll come back with the word that the substance of the Reagan Social Security plan is as politically damaging as its proclamation The proposed restrictions on disability benefits go much too far the planned reductions in benefits for those retiring early are Draconian and begin unfairly soon and the Reagan scheme for setting future benefits for all recipients would raise far more money than needed for the systems stability In fact the only good things about the proposals are that they might make possible 1 a badly needed reduction in workers payroll taxes and 2 the needed bipartisan compromise to rescue the system But so adverse has been the publics reaction and so opportunistic the Democrats that historians may have to judge the Social Security fiasco as Mr Reagans Bay of Pigs That would be the irony since the plan was a goodfaith response to a real need while the other omissions and commissions of this amiably scary Administration should long since have started its inevitable slide from the early peaks In any case the road ahead of Mr Reagan is suddenly looking rocky His less inspired nominations to high office are beginning to seem less conservative than ludicrous Warren Richardson had to withdraw from a subCabinet post owing to an unsavory association with the antiSemitic Liberty Lobby Dr C Everett Koop was named as Surgeon General with no visible publichealth qualification  unless his opposition to abortion is a qualification John B Crowell was chosen to manage the national public forests and the Forest Service despite his advocacy of voracious timbercutting while general counsel to LouisianaPacific Ernest Lefever as watchdog against human rights offenses would be barkless toothless and unable to track And these are only the worst Only now is the overall budgetary limit Mr Reagan was so successful in imposing being broken down into the individual programs that will be cut or eliminated so only now is the public getting a real look at the specific consequences Similarly after months of silence on the Presidents grandiose military spending plans critics finally are beginning to focus on both the inflationary and the security aspects of this warlike buildup His proposed tax cuts have lost rather than gained support A United States clearly less eager for arms control negotiations than its allies or the Soviet Union  a United States casting the lone vote against international restrictions on the promotion of baby formula in areas where it might be inappropriate  an Administration that announces its refusal to seek pupil busing or affirmative action even to enforce constitutional rights  an Administration that opposes abortion and sex education while promoting family values  such an Administration is bound to be edging itself into deep political trouble Not that all or even most Americans necessarily oppose such positions but clearly enough of them are dubious so that generous first attitudes toward Mr Reagan he deserves a chance are being affected for the worse The bottom may not yet be out of the tub but the rust around the edges is beginning to show Meanwhile far over there to the Presidents right the radicals of his party  Helms Denton East the Moral Majority etc  are perched with their intrusive abortion school prayer courtstripping antivoting rights and family force bills Ultimately Mr Reagan will control them or lose control to them Prudent men wouldnt yet bet on it either way
CONGRESSIONAL ASSAULT ON HIGH COURT; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/30/us/congressional-assault-on-high-court-news-analysis.html,Since the early 1800s the United States Supreme Court has reigned virtually unchallenged by Congress and the President as the ultimate authority in interpreting and enforcing the Constitution Nevertheless a combination of continuing popular frustration with certain Supreme Court decisions and increasing conservatism in Congress has given a formidable push this year toward enactment of legislation that would challenge this traditional allocation of powers as never before More than 20 bills pending in Congress would remove the power of the Justices and of the lower courts as well to enforce their constitutional rulings on abortion school prayer and busing or to consider the constitutionality of the allmale draft These bills raise questions that transcend the emotional public debate over the social issues and go to the core of the nations system of government For this reason they have aroused widespread concern and opposition among many conservatives and liberals alike in the legal establishment as well as abortion rights groups and others with a more direct stake in the Supreme Court precedents that the bills seek to undermine Pressure on Congress Members of Congress who are being lobbied from one side by angry constituents waving photographs of aborted fetuses found themselves being gently courted from the other side in recent Senate subcommittee hearings by selfappointed professorial guardians of judicial independence armed with esoteric historical allusions and worrisome scenarios of majority rule run amok The outcome is uncertain On one level the attention focused on the Courtstripping bills this year reflects a simple matter of arithmetic It takes a twothirds vote in each House of Congress to propose a constitutional amendment but only a majority to pass a bill taking away Court jurisdiction Groups that want to ban abortion and school desegregation through busing have been frustrated in their efforts to push through constitutional amendments and know that any act of Congress attempting to overrule Supreme Court precedents on these issues directly would almost certainly be struck down by the Supreme Court Therefore many of these groups are urging Congress to invoke its seldomused ultimate weapon for striking back against unpopular Supreme Court decisions a clause in Article III of the Constitution that grants Congress the broad and unqualified power to carve out exceptions from the Supreme Courts appellate jurisdiction which is the basis of its power to review decisions of state courts and the lower Federal courts Bills to Curb Lower Courts Many of the bills would also bar the lower Federal courts from hearing certain constitutional cases such as challenges to the constitutionality of laws regulating abortion or providing for voluntary prayer in school or from ordering busing as a means of desegregating schools The lower Federal courts unlike the Supreme Court were established by Congress not by the Constitution Congress could presumably abolish them although some scholars argue that Congress cannot selectively rule particular constitutional issues off limits to them Although past Supreme Court decisions on such constitutional issues as school prayer would technically remain binding precedents even if bills depriving the Federal courts of power to enforce them were enacted and upheld supporters of the bills hope that many state courts would feel free to disregard them The Senate Courts Subcommittee an arm of the Judiciary Committee recently heard two days of scholarly debate by eight constitutional experts in the absence of most of its members all of the time and all of its members some of the time on whether it would be wise or constitutionally permissible for Congress to strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to enforce rulings with which Congress disagrees Perils Seen in Legislation Seven of these experts concurred that the Courtstripping bills were dangerous and should be defeated although only four said that such legislation would itself violate the Constitution The scholarly disagreement on the extent of Congress power to bar the Supreme Court from deciding selected categories of constitutional cases reflects the absence of any definitive precedent Although voters and legislators have often been outraged by the Supreme Courts constitutional decisions striking down state and Federal laws it has been more than a century since Congress has passed a law designed to block the Court from enforcing its view of the Constitution Most of the scholars who testified on the bills said that this history of restraint served the interests of Congress itself as well as the stability of the constitutional separation of powers If a majority in Congress strips the Supreme Court of power to enforce constitutional rights it has declared in one area such as school prayer or abortion the scholars cautioned pressure will build to do the same in other controversial areas such as legislative reapportionment affirmative action and freedom of political association If taken to the extreme they said such legislation if upheld could subvert the Supreme Courts longstanding role in protecting minorities against the abuses of majority rule It could all but destroy the coordinate judicial branch and thus upset the delicately poised constitutional system of checks and balances in the words of Prof Leonard G Ratner of the University of Southern California Law School The scholars also predicted that such legislation would lead to a chaos of constitutional uncertainty in the words of Prof William Van Alstyne of Duke Law School by allowing the courts of the 50 states to interpret identical constitutional provisions in conflicting ways with no higher authority to resolve the conflicts Prof Charles E Rice of Notre Dame Law School on the other hand advocated legislation removing Supreme Court jurisdiction over such subjects as abortion and school prayer as a surgical device for curbing judicial usurpations of power preferable to cranking up the mmachinery of amending the Constitution It could teach the Supreme Court a lesson Professor Rice said We have been unduly deferential to the Supreme Court
60'S ACTIVISM STILL STRONG IN ALBANY BISHOP,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/30/nyregion/60-s-activism-still-strong-in-albany-bishop.html,The spirit of the 1960s is alive and well here and living in the Bishops residence And the man who occupies the residence is doing what he can to keep that spirit alive in a more forbidding building a few blocks down the street the State Capitol In fact Bishop Howard J Hubbard head of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany is well known around the Capitol for his involvement in matters of public policy ranging from the recently enacted welfare grant increase to reorganizing the states mental health agency He is known as a firm liberal but also as a conciliator  and the combination has led many politicians to fancy him one of them Give me this guy for a week said David Burke who once was Governor Careys top aide and I could make him Governor The Bishop is not new to public battles but he discounts his influence in government and seems a bit uncomfortable at times with the idea of being close to the powers that be That is not surprising for someone who reached priestly maturity as an activist who organized tenants started drug housing and job training programs and even did battle with the late Gov Nelson A Rockefeller over the construction of the Albany Mall Bishop Hubbard was against it he said because it knocked down the neighborhoods of what he called the poor the powerless He became known as the fighting street priest in Albanys tough South End a predominantly black neighborhood that welcomed this unusual white cleric When he was named Bishop in 1977 at the age of 38 one black activist exclaimed Praise Jesus They named one of us Central Role Bishop Hubbard says his basic commitments have not changed greatly He has said that he wanted to be known as the street Bishop and his allies say that his new role is that of a behindthescenes battler for the same causes he espoused in the South End As chairman of the public policy committee of the State Catholic Bishops Conference he has helped to shape the churchs political agenda He has played the kind of point role for the church on that said Robert J Morgado Mr Careys top aide Ilene Margolin the executive director of the New York State Council on Children and Families said the Bishop also played a central role in helping organize the states delegation to the White House Conference on Families That was the controversial meeting last year in which conservatives and opponents of abortion battled bitterly with liberals on a wide range of issues It was a polarizing experience in most places Miss Margolin said It wasnt here thanks largely to him She said Bishop Hubbard and the New York Catholic delegates opposed abortion but saw the overriding need to build coalitions on other issues with other members of the New York delegation The Bishop assumed an important part in yet another sensitive matter recently when Evangeline GouletasCarey Mr Careys wife petitioned the marriage tribunal of the Albany Diocese to have her previous marriages annulled by the Catholic Church The Albany tribunal shares the Bishops reputation for liberalism according to the Rev Joseph A Persich a Fordham University professor who has been involved in many annulment cases Albany is a lot faster than many he said They handle people very sympathetically The agenda Bishop Hubbard has helped to shape for the states Conference of Bishops is generally favorable to viewpoints associated with liberals in support for example of welfare spending increases and in opposition to the death penalty The wellknown exception to this pattern is the abortion issue Here the Bishop states firmly that he is on the side of those opposed to abortion some of whom argue that theirs is the genuinely liberal position But the Bishops role in the abortion battle is a complex one He was embarrassed late last year when Joseph F ORourke a leader in a proabortion organization Catholics for a Free Choice said that Bishop Hubbard was sympathetic to that cause Mr ORourkes statement caused a stir in the church around the country and the Bishop denied it vehemently Mr ORourke later withdrew the statement saying he had misinterpreted misinformation Range of Issues On the other hand Bishop Hubbard has been a leader of the bloc of liberals in the Catholic hierarchy who want the abortion issue to be just one among many on which the Church will take strong stands The liberals speak of a broad prolife agenda which includes support for a wide array of government services for the poor For some people Bishop Hubbard said in an interview recently the abortion issue is the only issue that should be addressed at the present time and that until that is resolved all other issues should be put on the back burner But there are a whole range of other issues on the prolife or respect life agenda that have to be addressed if we are going to be credible Like many veterans of activism in the Sixties Bishop Hubbard believes that those who are now working for change have arrived at a maturity they lacked then We got caught up in a romanticism  we were going to root out all the ills of society and we were going to do it in a threeyear period he recalled with a grin The new activism is tempered by realism he said adding I think thats OK
OBSERVER; Dreams Of Dimes And Palms,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/30/opinion/observer-dreams-of-dimes-and-palms.html,It becomes increasingly obvious that very few Americans can afford to grow old anymore What with inflation eroding your nest egg impending crackdown on Social Security and so on old age has become a luxury for the few A lot of people who are busy growing old right now are just going to have to stop it I lunched the other day with a fellow who spent the hour grousing about how retirement was going to drive him into poverty It was hard to sympathize with him You wouldnt have to retire if you hadnt gone ahead and gotten old I was tempted to tell him but didnt You have to make allowances At the time he was dashing around getting old it was considered the sociable thing to do Everybody did it not just the swells I had parents and uncles and aunts people who were not at all in the Rockefeller classes and they got old Sure it was foolish We all know that now but it was considered the thing to do then like hopping into your 300horsepower automobile and burning 25 gallons of gas because it was Sunday afternoon The gasoline companies did not tell anybody Hey go easy on that gasoline because the stuff is running out Later they said that was all that was on their minds but what they were saying then was Put a tiger in your tank and burn up the old highways Same with getting old Get that nice old wrinkledleather look they said Not the gasoline companies though they would doubtless have said it if it took 50 gallons of gas a week to wrinkle a hide attractively Golden years Senior citizen Bask in the hazy glow of Retirement Village under the palmshaded desert seashore No wonder people could hardly wait to get old They had all experienced youth in the Depression and seen those annual news photos of John D Rockefeller looking as ancient as Ramses dispensing the annual birthday dimes under the palm trees Is it any wonder that old looked like the place to be after allowing for the decline of zest I even anticipated growing old myself at one time Gosh anybody could do it In silvery dignity with voice creaking like Lionel Barrymores I would pass the golden years dispensing sound advice to foolish youngsters and tipping flunkies with dimes on my birthdays In this state of mind which was encouraged by the Government if not by the gasoline industry I never thought to reprimand parents aunts uncles never thought to say Look here dont you think youre behaving very foolishly by growing old In fact I flung myself rather vigorously into the pursuit of the vice and even tried to speed up the process I well remember  what fools we were in those days  monkeying with a draft card to become 21 when I was only 19 Beer was illegal under 21 at that time Fortunately the truth has dawned in the nick of time It took the Arabs to wean us from the gasoline the Government has done the job for oldness Finally it confesses that it was fooling us all those years Aint gonna be no dimes to give the flunkies on birthdays under the palm trees Aint gonna be no palm trees either oldtimer unless you spent the useful years studying tax avoidance and got dimes tucked away in a Swiss bank I dont need much telling When the gas companies started charging primesirloin prices to put tiger in tanks I abandoned my tank When the retirement people started saying that growing old was strictly for the bigmoney set I stopped getting old I went off it three weeks ago and the results have been remarkable After three weeks of giving up aging I look only two weeks and six days older At this pace I can age 17 days per year slower than in the old days If I had started 21 years ago I would already be a full year younger than I am at present Eventually Congress will probably quit dillydallying with the problem of growing older and enact laws to end it once and for all There is already a bill in the works sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms and Representative Henry Hyde to make life begin by act of Congress at the moment of conception This bill has something to do with outlawing abortion but the principle has farreaching applications A Congress with the power to enact biology should have no trouble keeping us all from growing old An act of Congress declaring that human aging ceases after the age of 40 would do the trick nicely A bit farfetched you say But you always say that Thats what you said when they told you that youd soon be paying 150 for gas and 8000 for a car no bigger than your grandmothers breadbox And look at you now Foolishly growing old How much nicer to be able to say Would you believe it Forty years old by act of Congress and dont feel a day over 75 Mark my words

LOW TURNOUT EXPECTED IN 21-CANDIDATE PRIMARY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/31/nyregion/low-turnout-expected-in-21-candidate-primary.html,TRENTON COME Tuesday New Jerseys experiment with the public financing of primary elections will be over with fewer voters than four years ago expected to go to the polls to pick nominees for Governor from among 13 Democrats and eight Republicans Despite the expenditure of nearly 6 million in public funds and 4 million in private contributions  the most expensive campaign in state history  surveys taken by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University less than a month before the election found that fewer than 20 percent of enrolled Democrats and Republicans could name even the leading candidates in the two contests With no statewide issue emerging the candidates simply presented themselves as best qualified to meet the problems of crime and the economy identified in voter surveys as the pressing concerns of the day With no issues such as an income tax or public financing of abortions to separate the candidates they appeared to run in lockstep frequently echoing each other in public forums and in position papers In this atmosphere the electionfinancing law which appeared to have inspired the record field of candidates was discussed in print and on television at least as much as the candidates positions were Neil Upmeyer director of the states Division of Elections said that an examination of voting patterns indicated that 576000 Democrats and 368000 Republicans would vote Tuesday compared to 615000 Democrats and 375000 Republicans in 1977 In addition to voters enrolled in each party independent registered voters who have never declared themselves may go to the polls and vote in either primary Such a voter will have to declare himself a member of the party in whose primary he wants to participate He may then return his status to independent after the election if he wishes but can never just show up on Primary Day in the future and repeat this procedure In Mr Upmeyers view the number of independents who might do this on Tuesday is negligible and will not affect the turnout predictions No candidate in either race has emerged as anything resembling a favorite but Joseph A Sullivan of Essex Fells an industrialist and Thomas H Kean of Livingston a former Assembly Speaker were familiar to one of every five Republicans polled by the Eagleton Institute between May 6 and 18 Among the Democratic voters polled John J Degnan the former Attorney General Representative James J Florio of Camden and Mayor Thomas FX Smith of Jersey City were the most familiar In the Republican race Mayor Lawrence F Kramer of Paterson and State Senator James H Wallwork of Short Hills were mentioned by one of 10 likely voters polled while State Senator Joseph P Merlino of Trenton the Senate President Mayor Kenneth A Gibson of Newark and Representative Robert A Roe of Wayne were named by about one of every seven voters None of the other candidates in either party was mentioned by more than 4 percent of those surveyed In another part of the poll most of the candidates were viewed favorably by those questioned the usual margin was 20 percent favorable and 5 percent unfavorable The two notable exceptions were Mr Gibson who ranked favorably with 23 percent of those polled and unfavorably with 18 percent and Assemblyman Anthony Imperiale Republican of Newark who was rated favorably by 22 percent and unfavorably by 25 percent Cliff Zukin the poll director cautioned against trying to predict voting strength on the basis of the surveys He noted that they simply tested recognition and imagery and were completed before the final media campaigns by most candidates The crowded field made the campaigns difficult for newspapers and radio and television news organizations to cover and Mr Zukin said that the voters were getting a good deal of their information from the spot advertisements and direct mail underwritten by the publicfinancing law This has resulted in weakly held impressions of the candidates based on scant information he saidThe field of candidates includes a number of Federal state and local officials who could claim a base even a limited one on which to build a campaign With the large fields and low anticipated turnout a Democrat who attracts more than 120000 votes could win and a Republican could capture his partys nomination with fewer than 100000 votes Two candidates who have no real political base in a territorial sense have relied heavily on television with considerable success Mr Sullivan who was finance chairman of the Essex County GOP went on television in January to establish his identity as a successful businessman  he is president of Bomont Industries which manufactures computer and typewriter parts  and this image has served him well through the final stages of the campaign Mr Degnan has depended almost entirely on a media campaign that depicts him as successful fighter against crime and corruption In the Eagleton survey he had a high favorable rating of 23 percent and attracted no unfavorable comments The test of his strategy will come on Tuesday when Mr Degnan admits he will not have the resources to match the get out the vote effort of the other frontrunners The former Attorney General will have to hope that voters brought to polls by whatever means will pull his lever once they are inside the voting booth With assistance from Governor Byrne Mr Degnan was able to claim some momentum in the final days To no ones surprise Mr Byrne endorsed Mr Degnan last week and then joined him in some campaign appearances Mr Florios name appeared most consistently near the top of surveys taken by various campaign organizations but the results of these polls varied so widely as to render them suspect as barometers of voter sentiment Then too they usually reported a high undecided vote One contender who surprised observers by failing to fare as well as anticipated in the campaign surveys was Mr Roe This was due in part to his having turned down public financing in an effort to try to make it a major issue in the campaign He thus did not have as much money for television advertisements as his opponents Mr Roes attacks on the financing law as a giveaway of taxpayers money in a time of tight budgets aroused some mild interest but it does not appear to have become anything like the issue he hoped to create On the other hand Mr Roe who finished second to Mr Byrne in the 1977 primary is banking heavily on efforts to target his support and get his vote to the polls on Tuesday In addition to the candidates who showed up near the top of the Eagleton surveys the Republican field also includes State Senator Barry T Parker of Mount Holly Mayor John K Rafferty of Hamilton Township and former Judge Richard B McGlynn of Short Hills The Democratic column has Senator William J Hamilton Jr of New Brunswick Senator Frank J Dodd of West Orange Assemblywoman Barbara W McConnell of Flemington Ann Klein of Morristown former State Senator Herbert J Beuhler of West Allenhurst Rose Z Monyek of Rahway and Stella E Mann of North Caldwell Mrs Klein is the states former Commissioner of Human Services The Democrats generally hit hard at the crime issue and the Republicans emphasized economic programs although candidates in both parties often talked about both issues Mr Kean and Mr Sullivan both called for cutting back on corporate taxes and reducing the sales tax although Mr Kean projected a schedule of cuts and Mr Sullivan said that the rate of tax reduction would have to depend on economic conditions Mr Wallwork also called for tax cuts and Mr Kramer emphasized reducing the state bureacracy first and then translating this into tax reductions Mr Degnan highlighted his tough enforcement of gambling casino regulations the establishment of a toxicwaste task force and the deployment of state troopers in high crime areas in Trenton Mr Merlino emphasized his sponsorship of medical and taxrelief programs for the elderly and his opposition to the sale or importation of handguns into the state His handgun position was his alone and not supported by any of the other candidates

The Nation In Summary; CONSERVATIVES' SOCIAL AGENDA IS REFUSING TO REMAIN HIDDEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/31/weekinreview/the-nation-in-summary-conservatives-social-agenda-is-refusing-to-remain-hidden.html,The cover of the current issue of Conservative Digest a political journal of the right depicts the Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr standing under a huge wave labeled social issues The headline reads Howard Baker Bucks the Tide Earlier this spring Mr Baker asserted that Congress should concentrate on the economy and set aside till later such social issues as abortion school prayer and busing His position won wide backing among Republican moderates and at the White House but not among those farther out on the partys right wing They never abandoned their legislative agenda And now that the Federal budget onehalf of the Reagan economic recovery program has been tentatively adopted and even before the issue of tax cuts the second half of the Reagan program is settled debates on social issues are blossoming on Capitol Hill like so many spring wildflowers Two weeks ago for instance the Senate passed legislation virtually banning the use of Federal funds to finance abortions Meanwhile Senator John P East Republican of North Carolina was conducting hearings on a bill that would allow states to outlaw abortions by defining the start of human life as the moment of conception The bill is the brainchild of Mr Easts colleague from North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms This week when Congress returns after its Memorial Day recess the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to consider a bill to restore the death penalty for certain Federal crimes The bills Democratic opponents concede that they lack the votes to stop it Not so long ago when Democrats controlled the Senate liberals were able to prevent most such initiatives from ever reaching the floor But the election of 1980 changed all that now hardline conservatives such as Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina chairman of the Judiciary Committee are in control We have to assume that Pandoras box is now totally open said Representative Robert W Kastenmeier a Wisconsin Democrat and senior member of the House Judiciary Committee stating the liberals position All the monsters will be flying at us over here At the same time supporters of the conservative social initiatives find their own ranks fractured Formerly when they could join together in opposition bearing no responsibility of authorship their differences were easily papered over Now they are troubled by the same rivalries that have long splintered liberal forces That was nicely illustrated in the flap over the lifebeginsatconception bill Even some fervent opponents of abortion such as Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah worry that the bill is unconstitutional and feel that Senator East plunged ahead too quickly Righttolife has been a pretty successful political movement said one Republican lawmakers aide Now all of a sudden it finds itself torn in half The White House is also less than delighted with the emergence of such issues Richard Wirthlin the chief Reagan pollster believes the Administration has only 18 months to make its mark and he fears that the Presidents political capital could be squandered in battles on social issues Theres no question he said recently that the Presidents mandate was fueled by the desire to change the economic policies and not necessarily the social policies Advocates of social initiatives may disagree on the nature of the mandate but they are eager to move quickly for the same reason as Mr Wirthlin They know that the Reagan honeymoon will last only so long Senator Paul Laxalt the Nevada Republican who is a close friend and adviser to the President told Conservative Digest I think the social issues such as righttolife busing capital punishment family protection and the like should be vigorously pursued Thats what the election was all about It is part of the Reagan mandate The social issues agenda is broad and complex But the big three are abortion busing and school prayer and for the moment abortion is clearly at center stage If you agree with the righttolife movement its hard to say that shouldnt be the number one priority said a knowledgeable Senate staff member Its a matter of life and death But a number of other social issues also seem to be coming forward and they share a couple of characteristics They deal with ideology more than economics  though ideology seems often as important as economics in discussions of say the virtues of a constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget  and the thrust behind them often comes from outside Washington In addition to his death penalty bill for instance Senator Thurmond is pushing a package of crimecontrol legislation including mandatory sentences for criminals using firearms Senator Jeremiah Denton Republican of Alabama recently suggested legislation to promote chastity among teenagers The Senator offered few specifics but such family concerns from sex education to pornography rank high on most conservative agendas The differences begin to appear when it comes to tactics Historically supporters of many of these initiatives have favored the constitutional amendment route Steam is already building in the House behind an amendment to ban busing for school integration and a Senate subcommittee voted out a bill that would balance the budget by amendment earlier this month But amendments are difficult to enact and some activists are now trying to accomplish the same ends through simple statutes Conservatives have long blamed Federal judges for causing or encouraging what they consider abuses As a result many bills have been introduced to restrict the jurisdiction of the courts over such things as prayer in the public schools But some conservative lawmakers are reluctant to tamper with the legal system and agree with Lloyd N Cutler former President Carters White House counsel who told a hearing that such legislation could destroy the balance of constitutional authority among our three branches of government Another possible approach is to restrict the authority of certain Federal agencies to deal with certain matters For example some conservatives would like to restrict the ability of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to impose affirmative action programs or hiring quotas based on race or sex Congress is still far from consensus on many ofthese matters But it seems clear that the tide of social issues cannot be bucked indefinitely
Letters; HIPPOCRATIC ADVICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/31/opinion/l-letters-hippocratic-advice-138223.html,To the Editor Soma Golden is quite correct in her analysis that the abortion debate is centuries old In fact a firstcentury Roman philosopher once wrote to a friend Men of science and nearly all the physicians have asked themselves if one must consider embryos as living things Moreover all available evidence demonstrates that techniques for inducing a miscarriage were well advanced even by Aristotles day fourth century BC [ TEXT OMITTED FROM SOURCE ] ot define the precise point when a fetus became a person He noted for example in one of his treatises dealing with the formation of the fetus Nature proceeds little by little from things lifeless to animal life in such a way that it is impossible to determine the exact line of demarcation All Aristotle could conclude therefore is that the fetus in its advanced state at least held the potential of human life However he also believed that menstrual fluid and semen were living and thus imbued with some sort of soul Miss Goldens analysis is faulty however with regard to her statements on the Hippocratic oath In the first place the oath does not include a refusal to give women instruments for abortion Rather it reads I will not give a woman a pessary to cause abortion Pessaries were designed like a tampon soaked in some allegedly effective drug Needless to say by ruling only specifically against pessaries the way is left open to use other remedies According to ancient sources abortions could be brought about by gynecological operations intrauterine injections vaginal suppositories poisons and pessaries which seem to have been the most popular Thus the implication that a woman could not be given instruments to provoke her own abortion is unjustified Nowhere in the Hippocratic oath is there mention any instruments let alone to be given to the woman by the physicianstatement that Hippocrates advised women to end unwanted pregnancies without instruments by the use of shaking movements is not entirely correct It is true that in one of the Hippocratic treatises we find a physician advising the use of violent movement to produce an abortion However this treatise was written at a different time by a different author than was the Hippocratic oath and the possibility exists that the physician advising abortion was sician advising abortion was unaware that any such oath existed In later Roman times many physicians became confused over the conflicting Hippocratic statements The great Roman gynecologist Saranos noted that one group of physicians refused to give abortions on the testimony of the oath while others prescribed abortion but with discrimination only when the womans life was in danger As one can see the past is prologue to the contemporary debate surrounding the morality of abortion and the question of fetal life RICHARD H FEEN Washington May 20 1981 The writer is a postdoctoral student at the Harvard Divinity School

CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL COMMITTEE EVOKES BOTH FEAR AND ADORATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/31/us/conservative-political-committee-evokes-both-fear-and-adoration.html,The National Conservative Political Action Committee which got more attention and spent more money on politics in 1979 and 1980 than any other political action group typifies a critically important new force in American politics nurtured by the growth of directmail technology and developments in campaign finance laws The group whose initials are pronounced Nickpack  with loathing by Democrats concern by Republicans and adoration by the political right  spent 7463833 in those two years according to records of the Federal Election Commission That was the single biggest total but four out of the top five spenders among political action committees and eight out of the top 20 were groups created to appeal to ideological or singleissue constituencies Of the eight five support conservative causes two concentrate on opposing gun control and one backs liberal to moderate candidates The contributors to these eight groups share concerns and goals of a noneconomic nature unlike the pocketbook interests that unite the traditional big spenders in politics such as the real estate agents the automobile workers the doctors or the milk producers Lack of Accountability Found The trend is a source of concern for more traditional politicians such as Richard Richards the Republican national chairman who argues that the new groups cannot be held accountable for their tactics and mistakes in the way the candidates and parties can John Terrence Dolan the 30yearold 30000ayear chairman of the conservative committee agrees with this argument conceding that groups like his in the hands of unethical people could go in and lie through their teeth But after insisting on his groups honesty he argues that their activities especially the television advertising they buy to attack such Democrats as Senator Paul S Sarbanes of Maryland are necessary to overcome the advantages with which he says Democratic incumbents have surrounded themselves The conservative committees advertisements purchased independently of any Republican candidate or organization begin softening up the target long before Election Day which in Mr Sarbaness case is 17 months away Response From Democrats The efforts of conservative groups generally but especially those of what Mr Dolan proudly calls his own gutcutting organization have spurred a Democratic response At least five new political action committees have been created this year frankly saying that they seek to combat the National Conservative Political Action Committee and using it for moneyraising purposes as a terrifying example of what they will oppose much as Mr Dolan is now using Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts These committees are not formally connected with the party But like the longstanding but increasingly active National Committee for an Effective Congress which spent 1420238 in 1979 and 1980 they range from general to exclusive support of Democratic candidates There is no ready list of proposed solutions offered by their critics who acknowledge the free speech protections the conservatives have under the First Amendment The Democratic National Chairman Charles T Manatt has asked Theodore C Sorenson a New York lawyer long active in Democratic affairs to head a committee that will try to figure out what measures can and should be attempted to curb the new conservative groups especially their independent spending Defeat of Four Senators It is those independent contributions that cause the furor In 1979 and 1980 Mr Dolans group bought advertisements to denounce such liberal Democratic senators as George McGovern of South Dakota Frank Church of Idaho Birch Bayh of Indiana and John C Culver of Iowa All four were beaten and the conservative group got some of the credit and blame in each case as much for putting the Democrats on the defensive and setting the agenda of issues in the races as for the total financial involvement of the conservative group or the brilliance of any particular advertisement This spring the group started anew opening a campaign against Representative James R Jones of Oklahoma the House Budget Committee chairman and Representative Jim Wright of Texas the majority leader But its most prominent effort in the Washington area was television advertisements against Mr Sarbanes declaring for example He voted to raise your taxes a staggering 249 billion The sum was based on statistics produced by the National Taxpayers Union another conservative group Those advertisements have been sharply attacked as inaccurate Mr Dolan insists they are not But he conceded some mistakes in directmail pieces Because of printers errors he said a recent fundraising letter mistakenly said that two Democratic Senators John Melcher of Montana and Quentin N Burdick of North Dakota voted to give up the Panama Canal and that Mr Melcher and Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona voted in favor of abortion Democratic Corrections Invited Mr Dolan insists that he is always willing to correct the record and says that in the future he will submit the substance of his attacks to the Democrats attacked so they can set him straight if he is wrong But he contends No one really thinks I distort They just complain because Im effective Ann F Lewis political director of the Democratic National Committee explains the concentration on Mr Dolan and his committee in a different way She says they do indeed think that he distorts the record But she says the concentration comes from a feeling that he flaunts the methods other groups hide He makes explicit what is implicit in the others He brags The rest of us have to live within certain standards He says he doesnt The Congressional Club formed by supporters of Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina and until now more active in that state than in the rest of the country spent about as much as the Dolan group in 1979 and 1980 7212754 as against 7463833 and took in a little more in contributions 7873974 as against 7600637 But it is Mr Dolans organization which is based here in Arlington that leads the parade through the publicity he generates as well as the cash contributions to candidates the independent expenditures and the training schools he runs for wouldbe conservative political operatives This new prominence he says will require more careful checking of future accusations Bigger Growth Than Expected Those training schools were what Mr Dolan Charles Black Jr and Roger Stone had in mind most of all when they founded the committee in 1975 Mr Black and Mr Stone have now left it and are political consultants together But the group has grown beyond their wildest expectations Mr Black observed No one thought about four or five million dollars a year and Terry on the Today show he said The committee is not really a committee in the sense of being a group that can be found and observed in its deliberations There is an executive committee of five including Mr Dolan and his brotherinlaw Robert Shortley but in practice he makes the decisions In one sense the committee is its 350000 contributors averaging 20 apiece though there are 161 members of its policy council an honorary group of 5000 donors The donors who expanded greatly when Ronald Reagan signed fundraising appeals for the organization after losing the 1976 Presidential nomination are Mr Dolan says older than the national average and they are likely to be residents of the Sun Belt They are also Mr Dolan says remarkably normal Herbert E Alexander of the Citizens Research Foundation at the University of Southern California says that in reality the committee is a function of what personalized direct mail with a flamboyant imagination behind it can do in a period when limits on contributions and spending involving parties and candidates have not been matched by restrictions on groups like Mr Dolans This is exemplified by this years major fundraising letter inviting respondents to check off which Democratic senators they wanted the organization to designate for defeat Not Worried About Enemies Mr Dolan says that his group has been able to flourish more than business union or trade association political action committees because the others have to worry about making enemies or gaining a bad reputation for steelworkers or insurance underwriters or whoever while he does not For Mr Dolan whose day and night dedication to his cause leads some friends to compare him to Ralph Nader the consumer advocate neither making new enemies nor jarring allies is much of a concern He says At one point I was a Republican which is perhaps the lowest ebb of my political career Mr Dolan describes his personal brand of conservatism as constitutional libertarianism He said the Government should do as little as possible especially the Federal Government But he is uncomfortable with some of the social issue attitudes of conservative allies saying The Government shouldnt be concerned with trying to wipe out sin He insists that every candidate he has ever helped elect has disappointed him even such freshmen conservatives as Senator Jeremiah A Denton of Alabama The disappointment to Mr Dolan was Senator Dentons vote for Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee as majority leader In the next few months he says his group will decide which of 22 Democratic Senators up for reelection to select for defeat Or he said it may shift gears and concentrate on House races feeling that capturing the House would lock up a partisan realignment in which the Republicans would take over for a long time But whatever specific decisions he makes and despite the restiveness of leaders like Mr Richards the committee and Mr Dolan seem certain to continue to play a key role in helping the Republicans As Eddie Mahe a veteran Republican political consultant in Washington observed They can and do provide a very beneficial support to Republican candidates conservative candidates It is common street wisdom that if you run a negative campaign there is some kickback some disadvantage to your candidate They do it for us and the NCPAC stuff never ever slopped back against our candidates
JERSEY ASSEMBLY SCHEDULES VOTE ON ORDER TO TEACH SEX EDUCATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/31/nyregion/jersey-assembly-schedules-vote-on-order-to-teach-sex-education.html,Nine months after the New Jersey State Board of Education directed local districts to teach sex education a new effort in the Assembly to overturn the action apparently has enough support to force a vote on the issue Its going to be close said Christopher J Jackman Speaker of the Assembly and Democrat of West New York He added that he had not yet taken a stand on the proposed measure and that it would be scheduled for a vote June 8 The battle is far from over said Assemblywoman Marie S Muhler Republican of Marlborough the bills sponsor The state board drew considerable criticism when it first voted in April 1980 to mandate specific sexeducation courses at all grade levels and relaxed the guidelines somewhat in its formal mandate last August Local districts are still required to draw up plans for mandatory family life courses by September and put them into effect by September 1983 Details of the curriculum are left to the local school districts but the programs must begin no later than the sixth grade and continue through high school The order does not apply to private or parochial schools and parents who object may have their children excused Issue Prompts Unusual Alliances The issue has brought about some unusual alliances Opposing the order for example are three groups that are rarely on the same side of any issue the State Teachers Association the State School Boards Association and the New Jersey Right to Life Committee Supporting the order are such disparate groups as Planned Parenthood the Roman Catholic Church and the Junior League The opponents seem to fall into two categories those who oppose not sex education but the idea of local districts being ordered to teach it and those who oppose sex education or some aspect of it but are not concerned about the mandate My position is that the state board has absolutely no right to usurp the powers of the Legislature Mrs Muhler said adding that she favored the idea of sex education in principle Im a very strong believer in all initiatives in the schools coming from the local level Don Rosser a spokesman for the New Jersey Education Association the state teachers union said that even though we favor sex education his group was lobbying in favor of Mrs Muhlers bill because of the question of the states requiring the courses Right to Life Group Opposes Plan Rita Martin president of the New Jersey Right to Life Committee said We are opposed to the program as proposed not the mandate per se because the boards guidelines would allow abortion to be taught as an alternative Ann Levine a lobbyist for Planned Parenthood in New Jersey summed up the view of those supporting the boards action We believe family life education is necessary for public schools she said because without legal compulsion there are a lot of districts that arent going to do it It is a very serious precedentsetting move said P Paul Ricci president of the State Board of Education Theyve never done this before The overwhelming majority of parents and students want sex education in the schools he contended and only 40 percent of the states school districts now provide it  few as extensively as they would under the boards rule State education officials had no figures on how many of the states 13 million schoolchildren now get sex education
The Masonry's Shaking Italy,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/01/opinion/the-masonry-s-shaking-italy.html,No one can possibly make sense yet of Italys revelations about a secretive Masonic lodge that may have been a cover for power brokerage criminal activities and perhaps even a rightist plot to keep Communists from power What is clear and even more important is that the scandal has opened a new power struggle between Christian Democrats and Socialists in the governing centerleft coalition  only three weeks before telltale local elections The scandal that triggered the third cabinet crisis in 15 months broke when the police discovered a list of 953 alleged members of the lodge The names included three cabinet ministers 43 members of parliament 30 generals eight admirals and other leading figures  most of whom deny involvement Masonic lodges are now legal in Italy but secret organizations are not The immediate questions are whether a politicalcriminal operation was masquerading as a lodge and who actually belonged The drama arising from the scandal is whether the Socialists can exploit it to make their leader Bettino Craxi prime minister he would be the first from outside the Christian Democratic party since World War II Although the Socialists won only 10 percent of the parliamentary vote in 1979 to the Christian Democrats 38 percent they contend that the strong Communist showings since l975  between 30 and 34 percent reflect a yearning for change In the present turmoil Mr Craxi will have a strong claim to lead the antiCommunist coalition He joined with the Christian Democrats last year to reconstitute the centerleft majority thus thwarting a sixyear Communist drive to enter the government Mr Craxi has subordinated his partys leftwing and increased the Socialist vote in local elections to almost 13 percent He has formed an alliance with the small breakaway Social Democratic party The Socialists obviously hope to repeat the success of Frances Francois Mitterrand who doubled the Socialist following and then won votes from the Communists to capture the Presidency last month Italys Socialists are also encouraged by the recent referendum which saw the public vote 2 to 1 to maintain a liberal abortion law despite the opposition of the Vatican and much of the Christian Democratic Party The Christian Democrats cannot form a majority in the present parliament without the 62 Socialist deputies If the two parties dont agree the Christian Democrats might move to early elections in the fall Or they might again try the kind of minority singleparty cabinet that from 1974 to 1980 strongly benefited the Communists at the polls in parliamentary power and in governmental influence The depth of the scandal now unfolding will surely affect the outcome but no one knows how Members of all four coalition partiesbut no Communists appeared on the controversial Masonic lists Christian Democrats bear an added embarrassment because a recently reconfirmed Vatican edict provides for automatic excommunication of members of any branch of Italys traditionally anticlerical freemasonry Scandals are hardly rare in Italy a land that Luigi Barzini says should be known for private virtues and public vices But this Masonic mischief could have the gravest political consequences

FOUNDATION TRIES TO RESCUE THE HUMANITIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/02/science/foundation-tries-to-rescue-the-humanities.html,For Carl Estabrook who has a doctorate in history from Harvard a postdoctoral fellowship at Brown University financed by the Andrew W Mellon Foundation was a godsend The financial realities of his profession are such he said that plenty of folks with PhDs in the humanities are living a handtomouth existence and driving taxicabs History religion and all the traditional humanities departments at universities are terribly overtenured and oversupplied with PhDs he said The undergraduate population is declining and the demand for these classes is down For liberal arts teachers in large and small institutions of higher education times are tough and will get tougher More and more of them will be let go and others now pursuing a PhD will be unable to find jobs Some may find parttime academic positions but will be unable to support their families on the income But the peril to higher education is much broader than the personal misfortunes of young scholars If colleges and universities are unable to hire and promote bright junior scholars there will be a shortage of academics prepared to take over as senior faculty members retire or die Aid for Younger Talent To address this problem John E Sawyer president of the Mellon Foundation said his organization was trying to help maintain an appropriate flow of the best younger talent through graduate schools and onto a faculty ladder In 1980 the foundation provided grants exceeding 35 million for a multitude of programs in support of the humanities at institutions of higher education Of that total 16 million has been provided as part of a Funds for the 80s program The gifts in this program which ranged from 750000 to 15 million went to 16 prominent private institutions according to the foundation The funds are to be allocated to promoting or appointing faculty members providing postdoctoral fellowships subsidizing faculty retirements and helping to pay for faculty training All 16 schools share an acute set of problems economic uncertainty due to inflation lack of funds for the continued appointment of young faculty members and declining enrollments Among the recent recipients of the grants were New York University and a group of small liberal arts colleges in Virginia including HampdenSydney College Hollins Mary Baldwin RandolphMacon and RandolphMacon Womans College and Sweet Briar 2 Previous Grants for NYU NYUs 1 million grant for the development of its humanities faculty was announced last January It follows two previous grants of 750000 each in 1976 and 1979 The earlier gifts were broad grants used to strengthen the humanities in a variety of ways including these  The establishment of a Humanities Council with professors from diverse departments as its members to oversee the introduction of special interdisciplinary seminars for undergraduates  A distinguished lecture series of interest to a cross section of the academic community  Discussion groups that seek to bring together faculty members from the humanities the sciences and the professions to share their specialized knowledge The most recent grant however seeks to meet more basic needs At NYU we will be using the Mellon funds this year to help bring additional faculty members into the humanities said Prof Leslie Berlowitz director of the Humanities Council Mellon money will pay for faculty Earlier grants were used to design undergrad seminars to entice students to explore the humanities and to support faculty seminars Professor Berlowitz said and such programs continue Group of Seminars Offered Among the spring 1981 humanities seminar offerings for undergraduates were Morality and US Foreign Policy Misogyny in Western Literature and Thought and The History of American Medicine as Reflected in American Literature All were twocredit seminars offered free to students already taking a full 16credit course load The monthly faculty seminars embody an exchange of ideas and dialogue with guest speakers At a recent seminar Harriet Pilpel the feminist lawyer and Frances Kamm a philosophy professor examined ethical isues relating to abortion testtube babies and genetic engineering According to Professor Berlowitz the new Mellon grant to New York University to be distributed over the next 10 years will help the university bridge the 1980s when our departments are threatened because of the fully tenured situation The 350000 grants to each of the six liberal arts colleges in Virginia also aims to strengthen the humanities both in the faculty and curriculum The foundation no longer offers funds to small liberal arts colleges but it made an exception in this case because the Virginia colleges made an appealing and economical proposal to revitalize their liberal arts programs Twelve faculty members from each college will come together for two weeks this summer and for the next three summers to participate in one of four seminars Computers Communication Technology and Society Culture and International Relations in the Third World Ethical Issues in Public and Professional Life and Images of Men and Women in the Fine Arts Were all liberal arts colleges in the process of doing curriculum changes said Daniel P Poteet 2d dean of the faculty at HampdenSydney College and we have to ask ourselves how we are different from large state universities or whats different about a liberal arts college The answer is the realization that the various disciplines need to intersect and overlap Our program aims to interest the faculty in multidisciplinary approaches to issues and to make them comfortable with this kind of integration As for the overall aim of the Funds for the 80s program a statement from the Mellon Foundation put it this way Our interest is in the growth and perpetuation of the arts and humanities in the best senses The heart and soul of an academic institution is its faculty If they are alive and vital and knowledgeable in their fields then they will do the best job

CONFEREES TIGHTEN RULES THAT RESTRICT MEDICAID ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/03/us/conferees-tighten-rules-that-restrict-medicaid-abortions.html,House and Senate conferees tonight ratified the most stringent restrictions ever placed on Medicaid abortions after rejecting a measure passed by the House that would have forbidden medical insurance payments for abortions for Federal employees The conferees also rejected a House proposal to prohibit the use of Federal funds to carry out affirmative action programs The action occurred as the conferees approved supplemental appropriations of 13 billion needed to keep the Government operating for the rest of this fiscal year which ends Sept 30 The exact amount will be determined later by conference aides although the conferees were confident that the amount was well within the limits of the budget approved by both houses and endorsed by President Reagan Payment Allowed in Special Cases The abortion restrictions would be in effect until at least the end of September Then they would have to be approved again by both houses of Congress as part of new legislation In the past such approval has often been granted to measures previously added to supplemental appropriations bills Under the bill Medicaid funds cannot be used to pay for abortions except when they are necessary to save the life of the mother Under present law those funds can also be used for abortions in cases of incest and in cases of rape reported within three days Although supplemental appropriation bills nominally deal only with Federal spending commitments they have been used to break new ground in legislation Such bills were used in that way to stop paying for the Vietnam War for earlier restrictions on the use of Federal funds for abortions and to prohibit the use of Federal funds for school busing to achieve desegregation Conferees Resolved 429 Differences In other action House and Senate committees have approved proposals that would make sweeping cutbacks in welfare and health care for the poor Page B8 The House and Senate conferees took 10 hours to iron out 429 differences in the two versions of the supplemental appropriations bills which had identical provisions on abortion A major difference involved defense spending The House had appropriated 22 billion less than the Senate largely on the basis of a lower projection of the cost of programs The Senate on the other hand believed that inflation would drive up the costs In the end the conferees agreed on a figure 800000 higher than the House figure and 14 billion lower than the Senate figure Here too however the exact numbers are to be worked out in the next 24 hours by committee aides although they are said to be in the neighborhood of 10 billion The conferees rejected a measure approved by the House that would have eliminated abortion coverage in health insurance plans for Federal employees The measure sponsored by Representative John M Ashbrook Republican of Ohio had passed the House by a vote of 242 to 155 Senator Mark O Hatfield Republican of Oregon chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee told the conferees that he had voted for restrictions on the use of Medicaid funds for abortions and had even introduced a constitutional amendment to restrict abortions But I do not believe this is the place to legislate the Senator said of the supplemental appropriations bill It does not belong in this bill He Notes Source of Funds Senator Hatfield noted that these are funds contributed by employees as well as by Government He then said Were legislating on labormanagement relations h No House conferees rose in support of the House position although Representative Edward R Roybal Democrat of California said that the House conferees were willing to modify the Ashbrook amendment by allowing health plans to pay for abortions for Federal employees when the mothers life was in jeopardy Under the House amendment no such exception was allowed The conferees also rejected the House proposal that would have barred the use of supplemental funds for affirmative action programs The measure sponsored by Representative Robert S Walker Republican of Pennsylvania had been approved by the House on a voice vote Senator Harrison J Schmitt Republican of New Mexico urged rejection of the Walker amendment because he said This is legislation on an appropriations bill Financing of Waste Disposal Plant Representative William H Natcher Democrat of Kentucky chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor Health Education and Welfare asked Mr Schmitt Are you going to insist that this come out of the bill I insist Mr Schmitt said All right we in the House recede Mr Nacher said The entire discussion took two minutes Senator Alfonse M DAmato Republican of New York one of the conferees succeeded in preserving funds for the West Valley nuclear waste disposal project 30 miles south of Buffalo In the supplemental appropriations for the military the House and Senate conferees agreed to withdraw all items related to the MX missile The reason the conferees said was that those funds were not urgently needed between now and the end of the fiscal year

Soviet Planner Reports Abortions Slightly Exceed Births Each Year,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/04/world/soviet-planner-reports-abortions-slightly-exceed-births-each-year.html,There are slightly more abortions than births in the Soviet Union every year a Government planner said today We try to talk the women out of it but in the end its their decision said Aleksandr I Smirnov deputy chief of the department for social problems in the state planning committee He also said that the mortality rate for infants up to age 5 has increased from 248 per thousand in the 196064 fiveyear plan to 29 per thousand last year Mr Smirnov said the lack of access to medical care in rural areas was a major reason for infant deaths blaming the higher rate on improved reporting procedures There is no medical reason for the increase he said Life expectancy has stabilized at 70 years he said after zooming up from 32 years in 1913
MANY HODGKIN'S VICTIMS FOUND ABLE TO HAVE NORMAL CHILDBIRTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/04/us/many-hodgkin-s-victims-found-able-to-have-normal-childbirth.html,Many young women apparently retain the ability to have normal children after treatment with heavy doses of radiation or drugs for the form of cancer called Hodgkins disease according to a report from Stanford University Medical Center No miscarriages or spontaneous abortions occurred nor were any birth defects found among the 24 children born among the 103 women involved in the study The report from the medical research group said that 20 of 26 women who had tried to have children after their cancer treatment succeeded Thirtyone percent of the 103 women ceased menstruating and were presumably sterile The fertility of such women and the risk of abnormality among any babies born to them has been open to much question Some women among the 103 did not use birthcontrol methods because they assumed they were sterile The broad implication of the results said Dr Henry S Kaplan senior scientist in the research group is that treatment of Hodgkins disease has now moved beyond the objective of mere survival to issues involving the quality of life Altogether there were 28 pregnancies among 20 women treated for Hodgkins disease at Stanford who took part in the fertility study The study was done by questionnaires followed up by interviews with the patients and their physicians and study of the pertinent medical records The pregnancies resulted in 21 normal births including one set of twins two premature infants and one of low birth weight and all babies were reported to be developing normally In five cases the mothers elected to have a therapeutic abortion A report of the study was published in the June 4 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine by Dr Sandra J Horning Dr Richard THoppe Dr Kaplan and Dr Saul A Rosenberg all of Stanford Our results demonstrate that pregnancies ending in normal live births can be achieved after total lymphoid irradiation or combination chemotherapy or both said the report Those women whose treatment had included radiation had also undergone operations called oophoropexy in which the location of the ovaries within the body was shifted slightly This was done so that heavy doses of radiation could be given to lymphatic tissue in the pelvis without damaging the ovaries Hodgkins disease is a form of cancer that attacks primarily the lymphatic system a major factor in the bodys immunological defenses In the Stanford series chemotherapy was more likely to produce sterility than was radiation The study included patients who were treated at Stanford from 1968 to 1979 Although the study is far larger than most that have been done on the fertility of such patients the authors said the results must be interpreted cautiously Larger populations of patients with similar treatment characteristics and longer surveillance times are necessary to completely assess the effects of therapy on offspring said the report

New Jersey Lucks Out,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/04/opinion/new-jersey-lucks-out.html,Fortune smiled on New Jersey Tuesday Primary voters found their way through the confusion caused by 21 candidates to two distinctly worthy nominees for Governor Representative James Florio the Democratic winner has been an impressive legislator with a good grasp of the difficult issues of transportation and toxic waste He rightly calls himself a moderate even though he ran a primary campaign that stressed conservative tendencies He favors the death penalty opposes using public funds for abortion and was the only Democrat endorsed by the National Rifle Association Given the political climate some see a realist Others suspect excessive opportunism as an Assemblyman Mr Florio twice fled from a necessary income tax Thomas Kean the Republican victor has also bent with the political winds outbidding Reaganites with rash promises of a large reduction in New Jerseys payroll and cuts in sales and corporate taxes He also spoke for the death penalty and against gun control But Mr Kean too is a moderate who ran in slightly different costume when he narrowly lost the same nomination four years ago As an effective state legislator he supported consumer causes environmental protection and courageously an income tax Both men possess the intelligence and strength to face up to New Jerseys difficult fiscal problems The state has been dipping into reserves to balance its budget and can now expect a loss of 12 billion in Federal subsidies How the candidates intend to cope with that predicament should be the voters main concern in the contest ahead With the primary ended New Jersey should also turn to rewriting the election laws that produced such a cluttered field Mr Florios plurality was substantial but not broadly based he won almost 60 percent of his votes in South Jersey Robert Roe John Degnan Joseph Merlino and Kenneth Gibson meanwhile were dividing the northern constituencies That Mr Gibson the Mayor of Newark nonetheless ran so well makes him a major figure in the state Public subsidy of campaigns is valuable if the field is limited to candidates whose private fundraising reveals widespread support And with any system in which a bare 15 percent can determine a winner the law should provide for a runoff But this time around the results were better than anyone had a right to expect New Jersey should quit this system while its ahead
HOUSE DEMOCRATS ACT TO EASE HOUSING CUTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/05/us/house-democrats-act-to-ease-housing-cuts.html,Democrats on a key House committee agreed today on a legislative package that would soften some of the more drastic cuts in public housing programs backed by the Reagan Administration and passed yesterday by the Senate The package which will be presented next week to the full Banking Finance and Urban Affairs Committee would cut 131 billion from existing programs for the fiscal year 1982 including 91 billion from subsidized housing efforts But the bill provides subsidies for 176000 housing units 26000 more than the Senate approved The committee was mandated to cut the 131 billion underthe budget adopted by Congress last month And while the Democrats were able to shift priorities a bit to lessen the impact on the poor the committee chairman Representative Fernand J St Germain of Rhode Island termed his own committees bill a total disaster for needy Americans Rent Control Curb Rejected As expected the committee Democrats soundly rejected a proposal to ban the use of lowcost housing funds in cities including New York City that retain rent control laws for newly constructed and recently vacated housing units That measure which passed the Senate yesterday is unlikely to be adopted by the House and the issue would have to be resolved in a conference between the two chambers Committee Democrats also rejected a Reagan Administration proposal to lump a variety of urban improvement and rehabilitation programs under the existing block grant program for community development In addition they refused to loosen Federal control over the programs The Reagan block grant concept which was adopted by the Senate yesterday would transfer more than 4 billion in community development funds from Washington to state and city governments But Democrats in the House see the block grant idea as a thinly veiled attempt by the Reagan Administration to undermine Federal programs to aid the needy Theyre using the budget emergency to kill programs that have been established by Congress over 30 years said Representative Henry B Gonzalez Democrat of Texas chairman of the committees Housing Subcommittee Were trying to prevent rigor mortis from setting in The legislative package advanced today represents a consensus among Banking Committee Democrats according to Mr St Germain The panel will meet next week to ratify the package formally and few changes are expected Reagan Health Policy Assailed Meanwhile the House Health and Environmental Subcommittee rejected President Reagans recommendation to combine a wide range of health programs from mental illness to venereal disease into two broad block grants Representative Henry A Waxman Democrat of California who is chairman of the subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee said that the ultimate aim of the Reagan plan was to demolish the Federal role in health policy Next year or soon they want to cut off Federal participation and wash their hands of health issues entirely he said According to Mr Waxman the biggest fight within the committee concerns a program that aids family planning and birth control efforts All efforts at a compromise with the Republicans he said were torpedoed when the White House insisted on killing off family planning as a separate program while the Democrats were determined to preserve it Mr Waxman added Its unbelievable that an Administration which claims to be against abortion is also against contraception The subcommittee approved Mr Waxmans measures without an actual vote and heard no opposition to them because the panels Republican members boycotted the session to protest the Democrats refusal to put the programs into the two block grants Education Cuts Considered In another development Democrats on the House Education and Labor Committee worked into the night according to a staff aide trying to cut 105 billion from programs under its jurisdiction Some Democrats are still in the mood to defy the budget mandate because they consider the proposed cuts indecent the aide said but a consensus is growing that the committee should try to meet the budget goal and not stonewall The Banking Committee Democrats seeking to provide 25 billion to finance 26000 more subsidized housing units had to cut more deeply into many other programs such as the ExportImport Bank The committee Democrats also decided to increase by 400 million to 164 billion the funds available to help cities operate existing public housing It was an unusual move in a time of extreme belttightening but housing authorities in several cities including Chicago desperately need more money to avoid bankruptcy In another disagreement with the Senate bill the Democrats decided to keep the current law that requires most tenants of public housing to pay up to 25 percent of their income for rent The Senate would raise that figure to 30 per cent  Congress Backs Abortion Curbs WASHINGTON June 4 AP  Congress gave final approval today to the strictest limits ever imposed on Federal financing of abortions for the poor banning Federal Medicaid payments for abortions unless the mothers life is at stake The limits are in a 132 billion supplemental spending bill for 1981 that was approved by voice vote in the House and Senate and sent to President Reagan for his signature The limitations apply only to Federal spending in the supplemental bill which covers the rest of this fiscal year ending Sept 30

BOOKS OF THE TIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/08/books/books-of-the-times-149046.html,By John Leonard GOVERNING AMERICA An Insiders Re port from the White House and the Cabi net By Joseph A Califano Jr 474 pages Simon  Schuster 1695 IT was of course amateur hour Joseph A Califano Jr was dismissed as Secretary of Health Education and Welfare after 30 months because he couldnt get along with Hamilton Jordan Jody Powell and Frank Moore By his own account he was difficult Whether he was opposing cigarette smoking or Federal funding through Medicaid of abortions for women who had been victims of rape or incest he attracted more headlines than the latest crisis in the Middle East His memoir Governing America is his revenge on the bunker mentality of the White House staff Not the least of its virtues is an implicit question is it the nature of a White House staff to develop a bunker mentality He is also asking in a vehement mutter now that Jimmy Carters gone was he ever there Mr Califano a Washington lawyer with a talent for controversy acquainted himself with government in the service of Robert S McNamara and Lyndon B Johnson After the NixonFord interregnum he returned to power as eager as a spaniel in the post for which he longed As Secretary of HEW he could see to administering the very programs he had helped dream up for Mr Johnsons Great Society Since in his own words his disdain for Mr Carter began before the inauguration of 1977 we might wonder why he bothered He certainly had to take a cut in salary Dedication to Liberalism Im trying to chose my words with care Mr Califanos dedication to traditional liberal causes  decent education adequate medical care civil rights a humane welfare program and so on  is obvious We are reminded throughout his book of the notion of social justice it seems almost to be part of the nostalgia craze He sought in his 30 months a reorganization of HEW that at least in these pages looks sensible In the promoting of ideas and the expenditure of energy he was unremitting His book is likely to be reviewed as a text on how everything goes wrong in a preposterous bureaucracy  HEWs budget was more than 200 billion a year more than the budget of any country except the United States and the Soviet Union  that must mediate among pressure groups for the disadvantaged the ImallrightJacks and the fat cats But Mr Califano is injured in his selfesteem It would be a mistake to think about his book without considering the nature of that injury He wanted the job from a man he didnt like and didnt trust from the beginning He was willing to trim  Senator Edward M Kennedys proposal for a national healthcare program was for instance unrealistic given the rate of inflation and the publicopinion polls  but he is reluctant in the green hum of hindsight to permit his President such footwork such a shuffle He is consciencestricken on matters like abortion but unwilling to allow Senator Bob Packwood the Oregon Republican the alternative scruple Governing America is not really a cautionary tale about how hard it is to do right in a tough world although on such subjects as Social Security it is invaluable It is consciously or not a black valentine to a failed Presidency Mr Califano has scores to settle before he sleeps We will not read a lousier report card on the Carter Administration than he has written as if he had dipped his pen in his own slit wrists This is not the appropriate space for a rerun of Carter Administration bungles but was Lyndon Johnson such a bargain Mr Califano sought to borrow his style from Johnson and his managerial technique from Mr McNamara And yet it never occurs to him that something went wrong during their mutual adventure He forgets the guns as he spreads the butter I have no doubt  although I wish there were footnotes doesnt anybody care about verifying history  that the Jordans and the Powells were as meanminded as he describes them nor that Mr Califano is as sincere as a fire hydrant Im simply curious isnt the job of a White House staffer to lick the boots of his boss and consult as though they were the bowels of an owl the publicopinion polls And why work for a man you dont like Questions of Choice What Governing America could have been is a good book on those clerks whose service to the state amounts to a subversion of self it is certainly a book that Henry A Kissinger will never write and his memoirs are the only other interesting literary artifact of such service since Dean Acheson retired Mr Califano instead chews on a Georgia peach From Mr Kissinger we expect elegant extenuations After all a good portion of the modern world is his fault For Mr Califano whose idealism is perhaps the hope of a better arrangement among our many peoples we expect a more exacting account of the expense of spirit He is most vexed by abortion he would have abolished it for any woman except those likely to die as a result of the pregnancy This huge issue would vex an Einstein or a Freud not to mention the fathers of the church It is confined here to an early chapter Mr Califanos position is declared the question is not addressed I am as serious as I possibly can be Governing America makes me wonder about choice Why work for Jimmy Carter if you dont like him Why then reduce other peoples choices According to a California bumper sticker Against Abortion Dont Have One I wish this were a better book
About Washington,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/08/us/about-washington.html,The Senate began deliberations the other day with a chaplain praying that the deity strengthen the lawmakers against relentless pressure from constituents lobbyists and special interests The prayer should have been especially heartfelt for a newly evolving and rather puzzled group of lawmakers those who place themselves relatively foursquare against abortion yet now find themselves targets of some of the halfdozen very active antiabortion groups based here You hear about the power of the National Rifle Association and its communications system in reaching Congress says Senator Mark Hatfield Well let me tell you theyre pikers compared with these outfits These seem strong words from a Senator who personally and officially opposes abortion except to save the life of the prospective mother and who was among the first sponsors of the constitutional amendment route as an antidote to the Supreme Court ruling upholding the legality of abortion But Mr Hatfield an Oregon Republican has been feeling the sting of antiabortion groups They struck soon after he lost a tactical parliamentary fight to them a couple of weeks ago when he sought to keep a major budget bill clear of the abortion issue He and the rest of the Republican leadership failed despite promises that there would be a fullscale debate of the issue in the coming months after fiscal matters were settled The impressive aspect was in how they failed The strength of the antiabortion issue was suddenly clear as Senators hearing from groups based in their states hurried to the chamber after a desultory and lightly attended debate They formed a majority to cut Federal funds for abortions further denying them to impoverished women impregnated through rape or incest Among the majority according to pleased and watchful lobbyists were a halfdozen Senators up for reelection next year who had voted otherwise in past years The scene had the quiet but careful air of a lifeboat drill and it dramatically displayed what many agree is the growing power of the antiabortion lobby Senator Hatfield Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the Senate majority leader and others contend that the arrogance of the lobbys power is growing too I see some younger members almost terrified by these groups Senator Baker said I try to tell them Look youre going to win Youre going to get some language on this but why try it with every ball that comes across the plate  Howard Baker is terrible says Paul A Brown director of the Life Amendment Political Action Committee a lobbyist who recalls not getting his phone calls returned in the Capitol five years ago but who now reports easy access to many lawmakers offices Mr Brown is planning a 1 million campaign against a dozen senators in next years elections And he looks confidently beyond that saying Im giving real thought about what to do about Mark Hatfield Mr Hatfield resents just that possessive tone on the part of the antiabortion lobby He contends that invective and misinformation about his position has been nonstop lately reaching its cruelest point last week in a visit from an old friend Mother Teresa the Nobel laureate who has spent most of her life working among the poor in Calcutta According to the Senator her entourage included two antiabortion workers After a warm greeting Mr Hatfield said Mother Teresa asked Tell me are you for abortions Thats the kind of stuff going on with this the Senator says sounding more angry with the antiabortion lobby than wary of it He responds to his critics by asking whether their compassion extends beyond the fetus to other human concerns of mine birth control nutrition programs the arms buildup Senator Hatfield is in a relatively strong position in his home state compared with the situation of Senator George J Mitchell a Democratic appointee from Maine up for election next year who suddenly found himself on an antiabortion groups hit list despite his own clear opposition to abortion except to save the pregnant womans life They never even asked to speak to me Mr Mitchell said of the group that targeted him the National ProLife Political Action Committee We dont have to talk to him responded Peter B Gemma Jr the groups executive director who insists that there can be no mushy middle on the abortion issue The true test for a lawmaker he said is to cosponsor a constitutional amendment banning abortion not merely to vote against Federal funds for abortions Senator Mitchell a former Federal judge says he is studying that question but Mr Gemma insists that the Senator has had enough time to decide This alleged hesitation and Mr Mitchells politically vulnerable position next year make him an ideal target in Mr Gemmas view Senator Mitchell questions whether the conservative group might simply be looking for easy scalps to claim regardless of the abortion issue but Mr Gemma denies this In a measure of the alarm expressed by some members of Congress after the antiabortion lobbys announcement of hit lists against relatively innocent lawmakers several antiabortion Congressmen have just withdrawn their names from Mr Gemmas letterhead of advisers Thats all right Mr Gemma said adding that one of them later called privately with reassurances Theyre still our friends We understand politics

own life has acted immorally Suicide is seen as an intrinsic evil because it destroys a life that was created by God At the same time there are many factors that may cause uncertainty about the nature and morality of a given case In modern times theologians who deal with moral attitudes have given increasing attention to the psychological condition of a person who is ending his life It has become widely accepted that such a person could not have been able to make a responsible decision Many Catholics welcome this approach as one that is more positive toward the individual Reluctance to Make Judgments On the ground that only God can know the truth there is also growing reluctance among Catholics to judge someone who commits suicide Whereas the clergy once commonly denied a Catholic funeral to those who appeared to have caused their own deaths that sanction is rarely invoked nowadays Thus the four Irish hunger strikers were buried under approved church rites But the suicides of the strikers who refused food despite pleas from church officials have left many Catholics wondering about their moral justification Moreover the response of the church has reflected the complexity and ambiguity that has largely characterized discussion of the issue over the last several decades The issue of the hunger strike as a form of social and political protest asserts an article in the June 6 issue of the Jesuit periodical America has not been treated extensively by the moral theologians After all actual instances of fasting to the death are extremely rare 1920 Example Is Recalled The article appearing under the pen name Carroll Edwards notes that the tradition of fasting as protest stretches back two centuries in Ireland Perhaps the most celebrated example was Terence James MacSwiney the Lord Mayor of Cork He died on Oct 25 1920 after 73 days of fasting in jail after his arrest on charges of possessing materials sympathetic to Irish nationalism Mr MacSwiney insisted to the end that he did not want to die According to Catholic thinking death as a result of promoting a virtuous goal or a greater good is permissible if it is an indirect result and not an end in itself It has also been justified in some cases as having been unintended Short of aiming at death as an end fasting itself has been considered an approved means of attempting to redress injustice Months before the latest wave of hunger strikes the Rev Denis OCallaghan a leading Irish theologian defined three types of such strikers in an article in The Irish Press a Dublin daily newspaper First he said was the type who intended his actions to lead to death and this therefore was definitely suicide Second was the type who uses the tactic to dra matize political pressure but who does not intend to die The third type he said indirectly brings about his demise by being prepared to tolerate death if his opponents refuse to concede Referring to the position among Catholic moralists the Rev John Connery a theologian with the United States Catholic Conference of Bishops said The common opinion is that refusal to eat and trying to achieve a purpose by death is wrong and would have to be classified as suicide The problem for many Catholics is how to define the recent cases in Northern Ireland Sensitivity to the plight of Catholics in Northern Ireland appears to have had a restraining influence on public statements issued by Catholic leaders But some have commented among them the Catholic bishops of Ireland the president of the Catholic Bishops Conference and Terence Cardinal Cooke of New York Comment by Irish Bishops Immediately after the first death of a hunger striker Robert Sands on May 5 the Irish bishops released a statement saying that the church teaches that suicide is a great evil but adding that there is some dispute about whether or not political hunger striking is suicide or more precisely about the circumstances in which it is suicide The bishops continued The Catholic church shares with all the other Christian churches the view that ultimately only God can judge the true intentions and motivations of any man and Christian burial is almost never denied to suicides today Cardinal Cooke suggested that within the context of compassion Mr Sandss death was nonetheless suicide I beseech God who loves every human person the Cardinal said to enlighten our minds with the realization that peace cannot be established by violence even by the violent taking of ones own life Cooke Joins in Appeals On May 12 after the death of another striker Francis Hughes Cardinal Cooke in another message to Tomas Cardinal O Fiaich the Catholic Primate of Ireland prayed for mercy and eternal rest for Mr Hughes and joined Cardinal O Fiaich in his appeals to the hunger strikers to give up their fast as well as in his pleas to the British Government to abandon their inflexible attitude On May 22 Cardinal Cooke again sent a message to the Irish Cardinal deploring violence and urging reverence for life Within that framework of the sacredness of life a theme echoed in the churchs efforts to end the practice of abortion the situation of the hunger strikers has emerged as another aspect of the same basic moral responsibility At the time of the death of Mr Sands Archbishop John Roach of Minneapolis president of the bishops conference wrote to Cardinal O Fiaich expressing profound regret at the tragic death of Bobby Sands despite the efforts of the Holy Father and yourself and others to avert this useless sacrifice

"A VIEW OF ABORTION, WITH SOMETHING TO OFFEND EVERYBODY",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/08/opinion/a-view-of-abortion-with-something-to-offend-everybody.html,I feel like saying something about this abortion issue My credentials as an expert on the subject None I am an MD and a novelist I will speak only as a novelist If I give an opinion as an MD it wouldnt interest anybody since for one thing any number of doctors have given opinions and who cares about another The only obvious credential of a novelist has to do with his trade He trafficks in words and meanings So the chronic misuse of words especially the fobbing off of rhetoric for information tends to get on his nerves Another possible credential of a novelist peculiar to these times is that he is perhaps more sensitive to the atrocities of the age than most People get desensitized Who wants to go about his business being reminded of the six million dead in the holocaust the 15 million in the Ukraine Atrocities become banal But a 20th Century novelist should be a nag an advertiser a collector a proclaimer of banal atrocities True legalized abortion  a million and a half fetuses flushed down the disposallUNSPELLED  is yet another banal atrocity in a century where atrocities have become commonplace This statement will probably offend one side in this already superheated debate so I hasten in the interests of fairness and truth to offend the other side What else can you do when some of your allies give you as big a pain as your opponents I notice this about many socalled prolifers They seem prolife only on this one perfervid and politicized issue The Reagan Administration for example professes to be antiabortion but has just recently decided in the interests of business to let infantformula manufacturers continue their hard sell in the third world despite thousands of deaths from bottle feeding And Senator Helms and the Moral Majority who profess a reverence for unborn life dont seem to care much about born life poor women who dont get abortions have their babies and cant feed them Nothing new here of course What I am writing this for is to call attention to a particularly egregious example of doublespeak which the abortionists prochoicers that is seem to have hit on in the current rhetorical war Now I dont know whether the human life bill is good legislation or not But as a novelist I can recognize meretricious use of language disingenuousness and a con job when I hear it The current con perpetrated by some jurists some editorial writers and some doctors is that since there is no agreement about the beginning of human life it is therefore a private religious or philosophical decision and therefore the state and the courts can do nothing about it This is a con I will not presume to speculate who is conning who and for what purpose But I do submit that religion philosophy and private opinion have nothing to do with this issue I further submit that it is a commonplace of modern biology known to every high school student and no doubt to you the reader as well that the life of every individual organism human or not begins when the chromosomes of the sperm fuse with the chromosomes of the ovum to form a new DNA complex which thenceforth directs the ontogenesis of the organism Such knotty and arguable subjects as the soul God and the nature of man are not at issue What we are talking about and what nobody I know would deny is the clear continuum which exists in the life of every individual from the moment of fertilization of a single cell There is a wonderful irony here It is this The onset of individual life is not a dogma of the church but a fact of science How much more convenient if we lived in the 13th Century when no one knew anything about microbiology and arguments about the onset of life were legitimate Compared to a modern textbook of embryology Thomas Aquinas sounds like an ACLU member Nowadays it is not some misguided ecclesiastics who are trying to suppress an embarrassing scientific fact It is the secular juridicaljournalistic establishment Please indulge the novelist if he thinks in novelistic terms Picture the scene A Galileo trial in reverse The Supreme Court is crossexamining a high school biology teacher and admonishing him that of course it is only his personal opinion that the fertilized human ovum is an individual human life He is enjoined not to teach his private beliefs at a public school Like Galileo he caves in submits but in turning away is heard to murmur But its still alive To proabortionists According to the opinion polls it looks as if you may get your way Buy youre not going to have it both ways Youre going to be told what youre doing
Rescuing Legal Services,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/08/opinion/rescuing-legal-services.html,Some sunshine is finally peeking through the clouds that have hung over the Federal Legal Services program since February when President Reagan recommended its abolition The House Judiciary Committee refuses to go along It has instead approved a slimmer budget and new restrictions that are regrettable but not fatal Legal Services provides free lawyers for some 14 million poor people a year The bulk of its work in child support divorce and other civil cases goes unnoticed But every so often the poverty lawyers win a farreaching class action that forces reforms in benefits credit practices or hiring procedures Such triumphs also regularly stimulate conservative pressures to curtail or kill the program The most famous effort in the early 70s was by a governor of California named Ronald Reagan Now he is intent on eliminating the program from the Federal budget altogether The Administration piously suggests that states are free to pick up the slack with the social service block grants it proposes to give them That is a ruse Many social welfare agencies having lost direct funding will be clamoring for allocations from these block grants Governors are sure to favor safe recipients like day care centers over poverty lawyers who make nuisances of themselves by suing state officials Thankfully Congress appears to regard the principle of law for the poor more highly than the White House does Not long ago the Senate overwhelmingly defeated an attempt to eliminate a proposed 100 million allocation for the Legal Services Corporation from its budget resolution Now the House Judiciary Committee with a majority of Republican members voting affirmatively recommends extending the program albeit with a cut of 60 million out of its 320 million budget In a concession to conservative members the committee would impose new constraints on class actions lobbying abortion and immigration cases Committee member M Caldwell Butler a conservative Republican from Virginia endorsed the action because he believes in the rule of law in reasonable access to the legal system There are heartening signs that his colleagues in both parties and both houses will agree
New York Political Notes; 3 NEW G.O.P. CHIEFS CITY UNLIKELY TO ALTER STATUS QUO,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/08/world/new-york-political-notes-3-new-gop-chiefs-city-unlikely-to-alter-status-quo.html,In an unusual turnover of party leadership three of the five New York City Republican leaders have been elected in the last month  Alfred S Pantaleone in Brooklyn Thursday evening State Senator Roy M Goodman in Manhattan 10 days ago and George M Hart in Staten Island three week ago That leaves only State Senator John D Calandra of the Bronx and City Councilman Jack R Muratori of Queens as the oldtimers among the Republican county chairmen But since the three new leaders generally reflect the stances of their predecessors there are not likely to be any major ideological changes in the city Republican leadership Mr Pantaleone and Mr Hart are considered conservatives while Mr Goodman is closer to the center of the political spectrum However the new leaders except for Mr Hart are considerably more cautious and less colorful than were their predecessors notably George L Clark Jr of Brooklyn who will now concentrate on state affairs as state Republican chairman and the late Vincent F Albano Jr in Manhattan As county chairen Mr Albano and Mr Clark did not hesitate to speak out publicly and colorfully In the race for the atlarge seat on the City Council that goes to a nonDemocrat in Brooklyn Vito P Battista who has made a career of loudly battling City Hall is making his latest political comeback as the Republican candidate His principal competition will be another vocal politician Michael Long the Conservative Party leader in Brooklyn and one of the leaders of the state party The seat must go to someone who is not a Democrat because no party may hold both atlarge seats in a single borough The Democrat holding the other atlarge seat is Robert Steingut The Conservatives captured the seat that is now vacant four years ago when Vincent A Riccio a Republican who ran on their line and defeated the Republican candidate Donald Pemberton Mr Riccio lost his seat last month when he was convicted of payroll padding while having served previously as a State Assemblyman Assemblyman John A Esposito who is challenging Mayor Koch for the Republican mayoral primary is not likely to get the endorsement of the Right to Life Party Mr Esposito said that he believed in the antiabortion goals of the party but would not sign a loyalty oath that the party requires of its designees The candidate must put in writing his agreement with such party goals as a constitutional convention to ban abortion Mr Esposito lost the partys designation for the Assembly last year when he also refused to sign the loyalty oath Rabbi Balfour Brickner of the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in Manhattan is assuming an influential role in the LIberal Party as the newly designated chairman of the partys national issues committee The rabbi has been active in national Jewish affairs and is a veteran of the civil rights movement and the actions against the Vietnam War Another clergyman the Rev Dr Donald S Harrington is state chairman of the party but he is nearing retirement age Richard M Nixon has accepted an invitation to be a guest at the Republican State Committees 200aperson fundraising party June 15 in Manhattan Mr Clark the GOP state chairman said he had invited the former President despite a stir that resulted from a Nixon appearance at an Ohio Republican fundraising event in February Mr Clark said that he had received only one protest from Senator Warren B Rudman of New Hampshire who had said he was reconsidering whether he would attend because mr Nixon had been invited The state chairman said he hoped to have at least 1000 paying guests at the cocktail party where there will be no formal speeches Suffolk County will seek a primary date all its own from the State Legislature The reason is that the countys bipartisan reappointment commission has been so delayed in drawing new boundaries for the County Legislature that there will not be time for circulating designating petitions to qualify for the Sept 10 primary ballot In that case party leaders will designate candidates and very likely deprive two or three Republican incumbents who are at odds with their leaders of the opportunity to seek renomination through the primary process Suffolk officials say publicly that they will ask the State Legislature to approve a primary date later than Sept 10 for that county only Privately they doubt the Legislature will set such a precedent The reappointment delays are attributed to late census figures and lastminute disputes over district boundaries
Prenatal Blood Test TO SCIENCE TIMES:,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/09/science/l-prenatal-blood-test-to-science-times-149823.html,Your article on a new maternal blood test for prenatal diagnosis of serious birth defects Simple Test Could Affect Most Expectant Mothers Jan 13 appears to have given casual readers the false impression that the test is a doityourself kit for home use In an April 9th Wall Street Journal article inveighing against what the author perceived as antilife philosophy Carol Cameron Shaw stated A recent New York Times article also reported that parents can now treat themselves to a doityourself kit to detect possible birth defects in their unborn child We believe it is vitally important to set the record straight even at this late date The original Times report clearly stated The test kits would be sold only to commercial laboratories that would accept blood samples from physicians It then described the complex sequence of steps required to verify an initial finding of an increase in a substance called alphafetoprotein AFP in maternal blood which may indicate the presence of serious neural tube defects such as open spine or anencephaly in the fetus Those steps may include a repeat blood test to rule out falsepositives ultrasaound scans to determine whether a persistent high AFP level is caused by two or more fetuses and withdrawal by amniocentesis of a small amount of fluid for analysis which can indicate that the protein is leaking into the fluid through n open spinal lesion Hardly simple and clearly not doityourself The March of Dimes has supported research on alphafetoprotein in neural tube defects and has been the major funding agency for development of genetic counseling services which provide the necessary additional diagnostic procedures We have consistently testified that the maternal serum test should be used primarily for women at increased risk with assurance of adequate counseling Routine use in every pregnancy without competent followup could lead some families to opt for abortion when they would otherwise not do so It has been well documented that 95 to 97 percent of women who seek amniocentesis can be reassured that the disorder they fear is not present Facts substantiated by reliable laboratory studies are a powerful prolife reality for many fearful parents who would not undertake or continue a pregnancy without reassurance Recent reports show dramatic decreases in abortion among families at risk of diagnosable conditions following the introduction of specific prenatal tests It would be a tragedy if a misreading of the facts sbout AFP testing were to deprive families at risk of neural tube defects of another source of reassur anceARTHUR J SALISBURY MD March of Dimes White Plains
AN ABORTION VOTE VS. PUBLIC WILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/09/opinion/l-an-abortion-vote-vs-public-will-149813.html,To the Editor I must express my organizations extreme disappointment at and emphatic disapproval of the latest antichoice abuse perpetrated by Congress I refer of course to the HouseSenate agreement to eliminate from the 1981 Supplemental Appropriations bill Federal funding for all abortions except those to save a womans life By voting for this most restrictive ever antichoice rider to a funding bill Congress demonstrates its evergreater insensitivity to the suffering of women who need assistance the most The danger of the restrictions in the supplemental bill is that they wont end on Sept 30 with the end of the fiscal year They will probably continue in the new appropriations for the 1982 budget Although some in Congress might claim that eliminating Medicaid funding for abortion will help balance the budget and lessen the burden on the taxpayer the real reason lies elsewhere The antiabortion riders have become more restrictive each year since the original Hyde Amendment Now that Congress refuses to accept even incest or rape as a justification for Medicaid funding for abortions it is evident that our elected officials have become so intimidated by the strident antichoice forces that they will listen to them more than to the opinion polls Their results year after year demonstrate that a majority of Americans continue to be prochoice Abortion as defined by the Supreme Court is a medical procedure and deserves the same opportunity for Medicaid funding as any other medical procedure I am sure that hundreds of thousands of women of all faiths and beliefs would agree that the truly democratic process of an elected Congress is being thwarted by ramrodding restrictive legislation through on the coattail of an already restrictive budget bill Of the 37000 abortions paid for out of Federal Medicaid reimbursement funds from Oct 1 1979 to Sept 30 1980 31000 were deemed to be medically necessary according to the Health Care Financing Administration Projecting these figures upward and ahead to 1982 and beyond it can be seen that Senate and House by their action effectively continue to place in jeopardy the lives and livelihoods of thousands of women and all ostensibly to help balance the budget The collective voices of those who are prochoice must continue to convince Congress and the Administration that we are in the majority SHIRLEY I LEVITON National President National Council of Jewish Women New York June 5 1981
"HOUSE, BY 265 TO 122, VOTES TO END JUSTICE DEPT. ROLE IN BUSING CASES",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/10/us/house-by-265-to-122-votes-to-end-justice-dept-role-in-busing-cases.html,The House voted overwhelmingly today to prohibit the Justice Department from pursuing court cases that could lead to the busing of schoolchildren to promote racial integration The tally 265 to 122 reflected the continuing shift among lawmakers against the concept of busing A similar amendment passed the House two years ago by a margin of less than 20 votes and a bill containing the proposal was eventually vetoed by President Carter This has always been a close issue said Representative James M Collins Republican of Texas who sponsored the measure But boy its not close anymore No One Likes Busing They can put these amendments in all day and get them approved conceded Representative Don Edwards Democrat of California who led the opposition to the amendment No one likes busing very much The Collins amendment was added to a bill authorizing funds for the Department of Justice and the bill later passed by a vote of 353 to 42 Similar language is also likely to pass the Republicancontrolled Senate and after any differences between the two measures are resolved eventually become law In other legislative action today the House Banking Committee rejected a Senate proposal to withhold Federal subsidies to areas that impose rent control on new housing or on housing that becomes vacant and several other committees rushed to meet a Friday deadline to achieve a total of 36 billion in budget cuts Page A26 Restraint on Education Officials According to Representative Edwards Federal education officials are already barred by Administration policy from pursuing desegregation cases through administrative procedures such as by withdrawing Federal aid As a result the amendment would leave the Justice Department as the only governmental agency free to fight segregation in education However the Collins amendment does not prohibit private individuals or groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People from bringing desegregation cases Neither does the amendment disturb existing busing plans The role of the Justice Department is somewhat moot at the moment since the Attorney General William French Smith has said that the Reagan Administration would not ask the courts to impose busing plans as a way of desegregating schools But todays vote could foreshadow the Congressional mood on future fights over busing and other socalled social issues including abortion and school prayer Opponents of busing are gathering signatures on a petition that could force the House to vote on a proposed constitutional amendment to ban busing entirely Hearings have already been held on other bills that would limit the jurisdiction of Federal courts to deal with certain issues such as abortion Achieved Exactly the Opposite In arguing for his amendment Representative Collins asserted that school busing had been a major contributing factor in lowering the quality of education in many cities In his own city of Dallas the Republican said the nonwhite school population had increased to 71 percent from 38 percent since busing was introduced in 1968 They wanted to achieve racial balance Mr Collins said but what they achieved was exactly the opposite Representative Edwards retorted that the Collins amendment would be setting back the cause of desegregation in this country by 25 years He also charged that the bill was unconstitutional because it used a simple statute to abridge the right of equal educationYou can only take away a constitutional right through a constitutional amendment maintained Mr Edwards who heads the House subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights I dont think busing is popular anywhere said Representative Peter W Rodino Jr Democrat of New Jersey who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee But to say its unpopular doesnt mean that its not right
ANTIABORTION BILL SEEN AS 'DEVASTATING' IN NEW YORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/11/us/antiabortion-bill-seen-as-devastating-in-new-york.html,New Yorks City Council President Carol Bellamy told a Senate panel today that proposed legislation to bar abortions in the nation would have a devastating effect on New York State especially its teenagers Miss Bellamy one of six witnesses to appear before the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Separation of Powers said that she was particularly concerned that the socalled human life bill would if enacted increase the mortality rate of teenagers and infants in New York and elsewhere and would sharply increase health and social welfare costs This bill would bar local decisions to fund abortions and certain methods of contraception and would prohibit the provision of these services at public health facilities Miss Bellamy told the panel At issue is a bill that would define human life as existing from conception in a move to enable states to treat abortion as murder The bill is a Congressional attempt to get around a Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortions in 1973 The legislation is strongly supported by Senator John P East the freshman Republican from North Carolina who heads the panel A Key Part of Policy Miss Bellamy testified that in 1970 three years before the Supreme Courts action New York State and New York City determined that access to abortion was not only a womans right but an essential element of our health and welfare policy The overwhelming evidence of 11 years of experience with legal abortions in New York State is that safe and legal abortions have not denied life but affirmed it by protecting the hundreds of thousands of women who would otherwise be forced to seek out illegal and unsafe abortions Miss Bellamy said She said that there had been a sharp decline in maternal and infant deaths in New York State since abortions were ruled legal In New York she said women most likely to terminate their pregnancies are those under the age of 15 or over the age of 35 Last year she said women under the age of 19 in New York City had 18000 abortions and gave birth to 14000 children Not only will the teenage birth rate rise if legal abortions are no longer available she said but the mortality rate of teenage mothers will also rise She noted that the mortality rate of teenagers who suffer complications in pregnancy was 60 percent higher than that of older women The legal debate at todays hearing centered on a portion of the bill that would prevent Federal courts from ruling on state laws that bar abortions Norman Dorsen a law professor at New York University who is president of the American Civil Liberties Union testified that that part of the bill was beyond the power of Congress and was constitutionally impermissible Senator East in turn strongly criticized what he termed the serious intrusions by the Federal judiciary into the policymaking function and asserted that the legislation was a fairly modest thing Its just the little old Congress trying to assert its policymaking function Senator East said

THEOLOGIANS SPLIT OVER ABORTION ISSUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/13/us/theologians-split-over-abortion-issue.html,Theologians expressed opposing views on the abortion issue today as a key Senate supporter of a bill to bar abortion predicted a new round of hearings on what he called a deeply emotional issue Senator John P East chairman of the Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on the Separation of Powers said later in an interview that although the panel was scheduled to end hearings next week on the bill he expected further discussion before another Judiciary Committee panel on a proposed constitutional amendment on the issue Senator East a North Carolina Republican said that the level of emotion is even higher than I had anticipated His comments after todays hearing underlined the divisions among lawmakers seeking to overturn the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion Backdoor Approach Sought Some antiabortion lawmakers like Senator East and his Republican colleague in North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms are seeking a backdoor approach to overturn the High Courts ruling This involves a legislative measure declaring that actual human life exists from conception and would effectively allow states to ban abortion However other conservative Republicans such as Senator Orrin G Hatch of Utah have expressed reservations about the constitutionality as well as the propriety of legislation designed to outflank a Supreme Court decision Senator Hatch who favors a constitutional amendment banning abortion is chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee which is likely to hold hearings on the issue The threehour hearing today before Senator Easts subcommittee was marked by strongly conflicting views among theologians Dr Rosemary Radford Ruether a Roman Catholic professor at the GarrettEvangelical Theological Seminary in Evanston Ill said that she favored a womans right to have an abortion and cited the recent popular vote in Italy that favored abortion Safe vs Unsafe Abortions The issue is not prolife versus proabortion Dr Ruether said The issue is legal safe abortions versus illegal unsafe abortions Legal abortions do not force anyone who does not approve of abortions to have one Rabbi Seymour Siegel of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America said that Jewish law did not permit abortion except to save the life of the mother The viewpoint of traditional Judaism he added is that the fetus possesses a human dimension  it is a human life on the way A contrary opinion was expressed by Rabbi Henry Siegman executive director of the American Jewish Congress The proper role of government in a free society Rabbi Siegman said is to allow the different religious traditions to inculcate their own beliefs about the appropriateness of abortion and to leave the final decision to the woman answering to God and conscience

GOING BACKWARD,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/13/opinion/going-backward.html,Kazin I was astonished on May 18 to discover that the President of the United States speaking at the Notre Dame University commencement heralded such private universities as the only independent universities If ever the great independent colleges and universities like Notre Dame give way to and are replaced by taxsupported institutions the struggle to preserve academic freedom will have been lost The President paid the tribute customary on such occasions to our Founding Fathers A group so unique weve never seen their like since they rose to such selfless heights They gave us more than a nation One of these Founding Fathers was Thomas Jefferson who was prouder of having founded the taxsupported University of Virginia than of anything else except having written the Declaration of Independence and the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom In the midst of a terrible Civil War July 2 1862 the Congress of the United States provided that the Federal Government give portions of the land it owned within the states to the states themselves for state universities The Morrill Act is virtually the most important piece of legislation on behalf of America education ever passed Thirteen million acres of the public domain were given to the states To imagine America today without the benefits of the great universities of California Michigan Minnesota Indiana Iowa Missouri etc etc is impossible To think that any private university especially one founded by a clerical order is more independent than a great state university with its healthy pluralism of religious and nonreligious inspirations its concern for the public weal its basis in the constitutional separation of church and state is to recognize among other signs that the American mind in high places is going backward these days The Senate in its wisdom voted the other day to prohibit the victim of rape from being assisted by public funds in obtaining an abortion A Republican senator Lowell Weicker remonstrated with the leader of the move to prohibit assistance Jesse Helms by pointing out that his harshness was not only unconscionable but had no sanction in our moral tradition Such a prohibition said Senator Weicker can hardly be said to come down to us from Mount Sinai On the contrary replied Senator Helms it does come down from Mount Sinai and if this smacks of Cotton Mather so be it The chairman of Moral Majority in Illinois the Rev George A Zarris encourages his members to monitor libraries I would think he said moralminded people might object to books that are philosophically alien to what they believe If they have the books and feel like burning them fine In Abingdon Va the Rev Tom Williams objecting to novels by Harold Robbins Philip Roth Sidney Sheldon insisted that on his sayso books be removed from the local library He threatened to file charges against the librarian if minors were allowed to check out the books The librarian pointed out that under Virginia law the library did not have to show Mr Williams a list of people who had checked out the books What a victory is that for democracy The other day Secretary of State Alexander M Haig Jr justified our present indulgence toward the Government of Argentina despite the terror it practices against many of its citizens on the ground that Argentina and the United States are philosophically akin Both nations believe in God An official of a scholarly thinktank the Hudson Institute claims to have figured out that in the event of a nuclear war only 20 million Americans will be killed which happily leaves 204 million survivors This is a time when everyone now in power professes a great distaste for the Big State for Federal controls The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities are being slashed on the grounds that their concerns are better taken care of by the states Student loans are cut and in many cases eliminated Every hardwon modern provision for the general welfare is contemptuously discarded from the budget Every day sees an attempt to indoctrinate the American people from Washington about matters essentially private whether it is birth control or the freedom to believe or not believe Where is the American mind these days to point out that all these pressures and even threats from Washington enjoining us to uphold individualism and free enterprise are just the opposite of American freedom and individualism  Alfred Kazin is professor of English at the Graduate Center The City University of New York and at Hunter College He was visiting professor of English at Notre Dame in 197879 This article is adapted from his recent commencement address at the Center
THE G.O.P. BID FOR MAJORITY CONTROL,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/14/magazine/the-gop-bid-for-majority-control.html,Adam Clymer is a national political correspondent for The New York Times By Adam Clymer The elections of 1980 were a ReaganRepublican landslide and Congressional votes on the budget this spring seem like reenactments But those defeats of liberal lawmakers and programs may be only the overture to a far more fundamental political change in the United States If Republicans capture the House in 1982  something they plausibly hope to do and Democrats realistically fear  for the first time in half a century or since Ronald Reagan grew old enough to vote they may bring about a major and enduring political realignment replacing the Democrats as the dominant party in the United States Rather than planning a broad offensive the Democrats are worrying about avoiding further losses Divided and uncertain they cannot agree whether their approach should be one of opposition or skinsaving compromise And there is no obvious leader as the party tries to regain its footing With population prosperity and political power shifting to the Sun Belt the political geography clearly favors the Republicans When people move to the Sun Belt they seem to grow more Republican And the Democrats of the South and Southwest are less inclined to fight Ronald Reagan than those in the Northeast the only region the Democrats can still claim with some confidence And while it may be true that political parties mean less than they used to it would be mistaken to believe that all Americans who call themselves independent are in fact indifferent to party lines Often the claim to independence is a socially acceptable veneer and beneath it is a partisanship that polls show is becoming more Republican than ever In fact independent status has provided for many Americans a halfway house on the road to Republicanism  the same Republicanism they were brought up to distrust This change in attitude toward President Reagans party is most pronounced among the grownup children of the postWorld War II baby boom There are many ways the Republicans may bungle the opportunity to establish the preeminence of their party most of all by fighting among themselves or failing to revive an ailing economy But the current political forecast is certainly favorable as Richard B Wirthlin Mr Reagans polltaker reported when he went to the White House on May 29 with news that the number of Americans calling themselves Republicans is roughly the same as those claiming to be Democrats It was raining hard outside but mostly on the Democrats Exaggeration is not foreign to politics and the Republican successes in 1968 and 1972 stirred much excitement just as the partys defeats in 1964 and 1974 fanned fears of imminent extinction But the talk of realignment in 1981 is the result of more than the Presidential landslide and Republican control of the Senate Every major national poll reflects quite clearly that the Republicans are closing in on the Democrats in the percentage of the public whose allegiance they claim Almost every political event and development over the next year will play a role in the Republicans success or failure Realignment will take hold or wither because of everything from the energies of the religious right to redistricting based on the 1980 Census from Republican tensions over social issues like abortion school prayer and busing to Democratic attempts to develop political technology and ideas  that can speed their party ahead if the Republicans stumble Most important of all will be the public perception of President Reagan not only of his dealing with the troubled economy but also of his efforts to shrink government and whether these seem liberating or callous The realignment that Republicans wish and Democrats fear is not a simple matter of officeholders changing from one party to the other That rarely happens in a relatively nonideological country where politicians seek broad blurred allegiances Realignment in American politics means a vast shift in voters preferences The Civil War and the industrial expansion that followed it established the Republican Party In the years just before and during the Depression first urban Catholics then laborers blacks and Jews made the Democrats the dominant force in the country That coalition at long last seems to be crumbling as individuals like Anton Kaplan attest A retired millwright who lives in the Cleveland suburb of Warrensville Heights Mr Kaplan grew up in a Slovenian neighborhood and cast his first vote for Franklin D Roosevelt in 1936 Now he is a registered Republican who says Republicans dont believe in spending money foolishly The Democrats he believes are lots of big spenders lots of welfare programs Senator Howard H Baker Jr the new majority leader thinks realignment is coming He points to polls showing Republicans gaining an edge among swing voters a necessity in these days of loose party allegiance He argues that the Republican theme of opposition to big government has struck a chord in the nation giving his party a greatly underestimated cause comparable in historic impact to the New Deal or even abolitionism Youd be amazed how I find people real excited about cutting the size of government he comments To achieve a dominant position according to Mr Baker the Republicans have got to avoid failure in getting Mr Reagans economic program translated into law So far their success with the budget resolution makes it likely that this condition will be met although the Senators accompanying warning that the party must avoid distracting itself with divisive social issues such as classroom prayer may be harder to observe Peter D Hart one of the Democrats leading polltakers and most thoughtful strategists does not dismiss out of hand Mr Bakers optimism The opportunity is always there for a political party to become dominant he said and the Republicans are clearly in a better position to control their own destiny than at any time in the last two decades He is skeptical however about the appeal of opposition to government as a realigning issue and argues that the theme has been around for some time He also doubts that Mr Reagan can personally lead a realignment contending that such a process would require many years Democrats Mr Hart contends must define their issues and figure out exactly what they want to be translating the ideals of Jefferson and Jackson and Franklin D Roosevelt into the idiom of the 1980s Vice President George H Bush after a Florida speech in which he overenthusiastically told Republicans that realignment was already a fact later said in an interview that he thought we have a real shot at it because people are prepared to root for us to be successful The 1982 House elections are the next major yardstick in our success We havent had the House in a long long time Needing 26 more seats to control the House the Republicans would have to record the first major gain by an incumbent party in an offyear election since 1934 There are several things happening that may make it possible The redistricting changes dictated by the Census shifting seats from region to region and from city to suburb will probably deliver a dozen seats Republican money and organization should enhance that advantage Thomas P ONeill Jr the Speaker of the House was not just seeking to spur on the troops when he told a meeting of the Democratic National Committee that 1980 was not a realigning election but 1982 may be He was reflecting the stark fears of the House Democrats he leads The House is just one piece of the equation John Deardourff a leading maker of Republican television commercials points to the state governorships where the Democrats now hold a 27to23 edge and can challenge several Republican incumbents in 1982 If the big state governorships remain split he says then the Republicans havent really taken over Eddie Mahe a top Republican campaign manager poses a different kind of caveat As long as we have nothing much in the South or the big cities are we really a governing party The older big cities may be an impossible nut for the Republicans to crack The newer urban centers of the Sun Belt however are clearly fair game As Mr Baker noted Jeremiah A Denton Jr Alabamas first Republican Senator since Reconstruction won his race with votes from Birmingham Miami looks like a possible target San Diego has been in Republican hands for years Increasingly the South has been voting Republican in Presidential elections and in some statewide races But Charles Overby a newspaperman who is now Republican state chairman in Tennessee is on the political circuit most Saturdays spreading this message Until we start winning the courthouses we wont be a party with a lasting future One approach he is considering to encourage grassroots development is institutional television advertising proclaiming the virtues of the Republican Party in Tennessee just as the Republican National Committee did last year across the nation Listen to Robert V Main the Middlesex County NJ Republican chairman If we can prove to the bluecollar worker that the Republican Party represents him youre going to see a realignment a turnaround This time I think were going to break into the assembly districts Mr Main was sitting in his office in Perth Amboy a small city that reflects the stepbystep progress of the last realignment Perth Amboy was Republican when Mr Mains Republican grandfather was first city and then county chairman After the immigration of a substantial Slavic population the city shifted when Al Smith ran for President in 1928 and it has voted Democratic ever since except in 1972 Even some big cities were once Republican Chicago was until the Smith candidacy made it a tossup and Roosevelt nailed it down in 1932 Philadelphia did not join the Democratic list until 1936 The realignment of the 1930s was more a matter of new voters some of whom had been eligible for years entering the electorate and voting for Roosevelt than it was of individuals changing their allegiance from one party to the other Realignment this time may involve such a shift especially among independents who according to some polls are twice as numerous as they were in the 1930s when a Gallup poll discovered they accounted for 16 percent of the voting population David Barnhart a computer technician in his late 20s who lives in Glendale Ariz said he was an independent a year ago but now admits to leaning toward the Republican Party Sounding like one of Senator Bakers examples he says that the Republicans stand for less government smaller government Because of people like David Barnhart realignment may be measured most accurately by combining the numbers of declared party adherents with those independents who say they lean toward one party or the other This tally provides dramatic evidence of change see box on page 114 In 1980 according to the combined results of six New York Times CBS News Polls Democrats and Democraticleaning independents accounted for 53 percent of the public The comparable Republican grouping at the time was 34 percent But 15 months later by the end of this April the edge had shrunk to a 4941 margin with 10 percent of the public still insisting they were independent independents In the South the Democratic lead had shrunk from 5929 to 5140 In the West a 5335 Democratic edge one that has produced precious few Democratic electoral votes lately but a good number of legislators congressmen and governors had slipped to 4742 Nationwide among those voters 65 years of age and over a 5037 Democratic margin had vanished the Republicans now lead 4744 Indeed the narrow Democratic edge now depends on black voters who still prefer the Democratic Party by a margin of 76 percent to 16 White Americans who in the 1980 election year favored the Democrats 49 to 37 percent are split evenly today 45 percent Republican and 45 percent Democratic The most enticing aspect of the numbers game for the Republicans is the change among 25 to 34yearolds In 1980 they were solidly Democratic 56 percent to 30 percent This April they were evenly divided Attracting new voters was a crucial part of the realignment of the 1930s these numbers suggest it may be again Just as there were millions of children of immigrants ready to join the voting pool in the 1930s the 25to 34yearolds are the leading edge of the millions in the babyboom generation who now vote sparingly but who could be tapped by a party that can find the message to attract them These statistics could still signify a highwater mark not a rising tide The Republicans after all cannot count on easy progress now that they are in a position to be blamed when things go wrong But the Republicans seem wellequipped to shape their own future They have money a permanent and skilled field staff regular polling services computers and 12 years practice in direct mail Their new committee leadership is relatively untested and inevitably will find itself subordinated to the White House But Richard Richards a former Utah national committeeman and longtime Reagan supporter has approached his new job as chairman of the National Committee with curiosity and a refreshing lack of pomposity He has convened a series of planning meetings involving county chairmen campaign aides polltakers ad men and other kinds of Republican professionals to try to develop a plan to win what he calls our majority by 1990 Implementation of this plan is likely to include a heavy emphasis on sophisticated political technology and a strong push to build the party in the South The blueprint acknowledges some key Republican problems observing that we have been called the party of the rich and the party of business Both epithets are generally true Such an identification with big business concerns some Republican thinkers but business is plainly not the political bugaboo it was in the 1930s and the party is not doing anything to change its probusiness image This does not bother Anton Kaplan the retired millwright who explains I think our country was founded on big business But it does matter to a Republicanleaning independent such as Arthur Rice of Allentown Pa A middleaged welding supervisor who has not yet bothered to change his formal party registration from Democratic Mr Rice prefers Republicans because he thinks they represent strength in foreign policy and change while Democrats just represent poor people But Mr Rice still sees the Republicans as the party of big business and concedes I dont really like that The Republican National Committees most innovative step last year was a national television campaign with the message Vote Republican For a Change Simple themes are easier to broadcast when one is opposition but a renewal of this general effort seems certain as Congressional elections draw near The highly publicized effort to win black votes last year was generally a failure though many top Republicans believe it helped Mr Reagan win over moderate and liberalleaning suburban whites who were reassured that the party was not indifferent to the problems of minorities Mr Baker for example thinks the campaign erased that remnant of racism from the Republican image The Republicans approach the Congressional elections with the unaccustomed advantage of party harmony In Detroit this February Gov William G Milliken of Michigan one of the partys remaining moderates and a Bush supporter last year won reelection of his choice for state chairman over surprisingly feeble conservative opposition He argued tellingly that unity puts this party in a rare position to reassert itself as the majority party in this country The absence of bitter fights for control of the party in the states has been paralleled in Washington In the Senate conservatives voted  reluctantly to be sure  for raising the ceiling on the national debt It is true that the conservatives seem to be growing restive and less than keen on following the advice of Paul Laxalt the Nevada Senator who is Mr Reagans closest friend in politics to backburner the social issues for a time And there are other flaws in the partys unity Mr Baker while promising to permit issues like bussing and capital punishment to be ventilated insisted that if we invested our political capital in issues that dont matter much to the country wed squander it Such a course carries some risk of displeasing conservative and religious groups who are already grousing about a few Reagan appointments Nevertheless the New Right seems generally content with the present Administration William A Rusher publisher of the National Review told a conservative conference on March 21 Unless we are chronic complainers its got to look very good to us The GOP will have effective allies in the propaganda and election fights ahead The National Conservative Political Action Committee hopes to spend 12 million over the next two years on Senate and House races blasting Democrats with televised denunciations of their voting records Its tactic of targeting Democrats for defeat even before their opponents are nominated is sure to be repeated and copied though at this point the Harrison Williamses and Howard Metzenbaums up for reelection in 1982 list seem less commanding figures than the McGoverns Churches Culvers and Magnusons on the 1980 casualty list The religious right is another powerful ally Its bestknown component the Moral Majority may enlist even more new Republican voters in 1982 than it did in 1980 Ronald S Godwin the groups vice president and chief operations officer said in a recent interview By 1982 Id like to have selfsustaining functioning affiliates down to the county level active in every state While he said that he wanted state affiliates to seek out acceptable Democrats Mr Godwin added The Democratic Party has got to change or weve got to look for mavericks The most important task facing the Republicans is getting the Reagan program enacted and then doing everything possible to make it work Control of the Senate has pretty much deprived the party of the handy excuse that Republican Presidents have had since 1954  that if things went wrong it was because the Democrats controlled Congress In other periods of Republican ascendancy such as the Eisenhower era the Democrats could check Republican advances Today however while the Republicans plan for elections in this decade and the next the Democratic National Committee looks at the imminent problems of office holders and state parties in the words of one top aide as triage  this one we cant help and this one probably will surive without us so well try to help on the third one The Democratic National Committee hopes to raise and spend 9 million this year compared with the Republican National Committees 21 million The budget disparities between allied organizations such as House and Senate campaign committees are even greaterThis sort of gap has resulted from the Democrats decade of inattention to modern techniques in fund raising Since the Republicans began rebuilding their national apparatus in 1964 after Senator Barry Goldwater and his party suffered an overwhelming defeat in the Presidential election the Democrats have been content to let their national committee operation serve as a front for the White House when they are in power and a battleground for their specialinterest groups when they are out The 1968 campaign debts of Robert F Kennedy Hubert H Humphrey and Eugene J McCarthy  a crushing burden for years  have almost been paid off but it will take more than money and a new and energetic chairman Charles T Manatt to make the Democrats competitive There is an equally clear if less quantifiable disparity in the area cited by Mr Hart the Democratic pollster  the realm of ideas Neither supplyside economics nor slashing Federal programs may be profound or successful ideas in the long run but just now they are more compelling than anything offered by the Democrats in rebuttal The Democrats can blame their situation in part on an awkward tactical position They might be better off as a parliamentary minority able to denounce the Reagan program as unfair and unrealistic but powerless to alter it and thus able to say We told you so if it fails But because they retain control of one House the Democrats are obligated to oppose what they think is wrong  risking the charge of obstructionism and at the same time to propose alternative legislation that has little chance of being enacted But the uncertainty that Congressional leaders display has become a source of pointed complaiants from the national committee whose meeting in Denver nine days ago was a forum for grumbling Politically this amounts to treading water Were drifting into the same problem the Republicans had in the 1950s of saying Were for everything theyre for only a little less of it  warns Richard G Stearns a toplevel aide in the McGovern and Kennedy Presidential campaigns who is now working in the District Attorneys office in Dedham Mass The Republican Governor of Tennessee Lamar Alexander agrees The Republican Party stands for something The Republican Party is the party of reform The Democratic Party is reduced to the role of standpatters screamers and hollerers  which is what the Republicans were for 50 years Through such institutions as the Center for Democratic Policy a research organization created to rival the conservative American Enterprise Institute the Democrats hope to develop attractive new approaches to American problems But saleable political ideas cant simply be willed and if it takes the Democrats only half as long as it did the Republicans they may have to wait a generation The biggest obstacle to realignment may come if the Republicans get what they want on Capitol Hill this summer and supplyside theory turns out to be in practice what Mr Bush called it when he was a Presidential candidate last year  voodoo economics The theory that a big tax cut will spur investment and confidence in the economy argue its proponents was proved by President John F Kennedys tax cuts in 1963 Others counter that 1963 was a period of relatively low inflation Mr Laxalt concedes that if the theory proves wrong failure will question our essential philosophy of relying on private enterprise not Washington People will say We gave the private sector and those greedy businessmen their shot  To forestall such a reaction Mr Laxalt expects Mr Reagan to have a second selling job to do after a tax cut passes urging the wealthy to use their extra money for productive investment not consumption Whether the tax cut works or seems to work is only one Republican risk The cuts in Federal spending on everything from food stamps and welfare to pollution controls and protein supplements for pregnant women when set against a tax cut that deliberately favors people in the top tax brackets are another gamble The American public is not prepared to do much for the poor these days but doing something to them may be another matter and Mr Reagans critics are eager to capitalize on the distinction Whether he succeeds or fails Mr Reagan is at least for now central to any Republican realignment Charles Overby the Tennessee Republican state chairman talks of invoking his name and his programs in Tennessee courthouse races In New Jerseys gubernatorial primary this month Thomas H Kean formerly a moderate and a suporter of Gerald R Ford won the Republican nomination handily with conservative rhetoric clearly patterned after Mr Reagans If the move toward realignment depends heavily on Mr Reagan however the question arises as to whether it can outlast his Presidency If Mr Reagan serves eight years he will have had time to turn his approach into Republican dogma now it has that status for some Republicans while others simply think it is worth trying But if the oldest man ever to take the oath of office does not seek another term the future is uncertain Conservatives would fight Mr Bush for leadership of the party and many of the Midwestern governors from the notyetextinct moderate wing of the party would oppose Mr Laxalt or Representative Jack Kemp of Buffalo Mr Baker or Mr Alexander might be in the middle of that wrangle A bitter fight for the 1984 nomination could undo the partys recent gains But if Mr Reagans plans work if the economy flourishes and the Democrats cannot use as artillery his brilliant closing in the Cleveland debate Ask yourself Are you better off than you were four years ago if Mr Reagan is still around to lead his party then we may indeed be in for a Republican era Would it make any difference Fortyfour percent of those surveyed by the Times CBS News Poll said that there were no important differences in what the Democratic and Republican parties stand for but most respondents were able when pressed to pick a party they thought could handle one major problem or another better than its rival Dorothy Boswell a housewife and former secretary in Rock Island Ill is a good example of those polled A year ago I didnt think there was too much difference she said But as she followed the 1980 campaign she decided that Republicans stood for less government more individual initiative balancing the budget People can have a little more control over their own lives She contrasted this to the Democrats who represent more programs more government control just plain more government The players in the political arena express the differences more eloquently though perhaps less bluntly than the spectators Former Vice President Walter F Mondale declared at the Democratic meeting that elected Mr Manatt party chairman Im proud to be a Democrat part of a political party that since its beginnings has been unashamed to fight for the needs and aspirations of the poor to fight for social justice to fight against discrimination Three weeks later at another Washington hotel President Reagan made the most revealing speech of his Presidency to a conservative meeting We are not cutting the budget simply for the sake of sounder financial management he said This is only a first step toward returning power to the states and communities only a first step toward reordering the relationship between citizen and government We can make government again responsive to people but only by cutting its size and scope and thereby insuring that its legitimate functions are performed efficiently and justly He continued We have one agenda Just as surely as we seek to put our financial house in order and rebuild our nations defenses so too we seek to protect the unborn to end the manipulation of school children by utopian planners and permit the acknowledgement of a Supreme Being in our classrooms just as we allow such acknowledgements in other public institutions The Reagan analysis of what he intends to do  which extends so much further than simply cutting programs because of financial exigency represents change a departure from the policies of Democrats like Mr Mondale as well as from those of Republicans like Presidents Nixon and Ford Mr Reagan also said that night Our victory when it was achieved was not so much a victory of politics as it was a victory of ideas not so much a victory for any one man or party as it was a victory for a set of principles Bob Main echoed those sentiments in describing Mr Reagans victory in New Jerseys Middlesex County last November The people didnt vote for the Republican Party They voted for change But now the Republicans have the opportunity SHIFTING POLITICS BY AGE GROUPS Between 1980 and 1981 many Americans shifted their political identification a change that often seemed to be linked with their age The figures below for Democrats and Republicans also include independents who lean toward either party Those people without a pattern of party preference are listed as independent The figures are based on six New York TimesCBS News Polls taken in 1980 with a total of 9904 respondents and two Times CBS Polls in January and April 1981 totaling 2951 1980 1981 Voters

THE LESSONS OF CAPITOL HILL LIFE ARE NOT WASTED ON THE YOUNG L. Dorgan,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/14/weekinreview/the-lessons-of-capitol-hill-life-are-not-wasted-on-the-young-l-dorgan.html,THE 97th Congress may be remembered as much for its relative youth as for its combativeness over budgets and taxes Most senators are in their first terms most members of the House have served less than six years The Week in Review asked four members of Congress  three of them brand new to Capitol Hill one fresh to the Senate  to discuss some of the implications of the change The four were Senator Slade Gorton a moderate Republican from Washington Senator Christopher J Dodd a liberal Democrat from Connecticut and a former Representative Representative Bobbi Fiedler a conservative Republican from California and Representative Byron L Dorgan a Democrat from North Dakota who sometimes calls himself a prairie populist The following are excerpts of their discussion with Martin Tolchin and Francis X Clines Washington correspondents of The New York Times and Michael Wright an editor of The Review Question Youre surrounded by a lot of new faces arent you Mr Dodd Only 10 states have the two Senators they had six years ago of the 20 committee chairmen in the Senate 14 of them are in their first terms or the beginning of their second terms I left the House after six years I ranked in the top 50 percent in seniority out of 435 people Its an incredible phenomenon The youth is fine but what were missing to some degree is an institutional memory And part of our problem as Democrats is that we have only three members who remember serving in a minority in the Senate Stennis Jackson and Long That has contributed significantly to our uncertainty as to how were supposed to act as a minority Further many of us have come from an environment where no one wants to identify with a political party I would go so far as to say that 95 percent of the Democratic candidates last year didnt identify their party on their bumperstickers or their brochures Miss Fiedler I think the point Senator Dodd made is important Candidates didnt run on their party so much as they did on their policy Maybe my attitude is colored by the fact that Im from California People there are switchhitters They will vote on the issue and on the personality at the drop of a hat I think if something concerns me back here it is the continuing influence of a given party and in particular the influence of the Speaker He represents one Congressional district the same as the rest of us yet hes able to control the appointments to chairmanships consequently control the flow of legislation I think that is out of balance with the real interests of the public Q What about the politicking youve encountered here Mr Gorton One pleasant surprise has been the fact that Ive found the Senate to be less partisan than the Washington State House of Representatives where I spent 10 years The majority party caucus often met as frequently as three times a day Everything was determined by the party caucus Members of the minority party rarely got to contribute to debate Here the equivalent of the caucus meets very rarely The ability of an individual to contribute something to the ultimate process if he or she wishes to do so and wishes really to participate significantly is much greater Mr Dodd I think this Congress is far more political far more partisan than anything Ive ever seen before Whatever else any Democrat may have to say about the Administration the Congressional Republicans discipline and cohesiveness far outstrips anything Ive ever seen in the Democratic Party Miss Fiedler I think youre talking about leadership not partisanship The President has exerted a tremendous amount of direction Because of his personal popularity as well as his policies his supporters have been quick to coalesce around him I was very involved in helping to push the Reagan budget through the House Budget Committee I also helped form the coalition between the conservative Democrats and the Republicans We stuck together very tightly all the way through the budget process because we were convinced that major changes had to be made Republicans are in the minority in the House but our philosophy was in a majority And we felt the change was so important that there was more urgency to it I dont think were going to see that level of cohesiveness once we turn to human rights and we get into abortion and other issues You wont see as strong a Republicanconservative Democrat coalition Legislation Isnt Understood Q Why cant House Democrats stick together Mr Dorgan Whats happened is that a political condition has been created thats been extraordinarily difficult for Democrats I think that we vote on the budget and we vote on tax issues without having a very clear understanding of what the substance really is This is the case largely because the President and the press have created a condition in which minuets are danced not over substance but whether or not the President has the votes or whether Tip can keep his Democrats in line I dont think one member in 20 understands the tax bill If anybody understands it I dont think they support it from the perspective of the Presidents philosophy or from the Democrats philosophy Thats probably been the most frustrating part of being a member of Congress I wake up in the morning and read the newspaper and whats the story The story isnt whos been subjected to the highest tax increases in the 70s and therefore should get the most tax relief and how does that match whats in the Presidents program The story is how the President had 33 conservatives at the White House and will he get their votes Its easier to report whos ahead in the race than whos running and why Mr Dodd This town is so narcissistic that all we talk about is each other When was the last time anyone at home asked you whether or not Danny Rostenkowski was going to be a palm tree or an oak They want to know whats in the tax package am I going to support it or not And yet were just as guilty as the press in focusing on the personality parade rather than on the substantive issues I think we could have engendered that kind of a discussion and yet failed to really address the important issues The issue was more about the personality of Dr Lefever than it was the question of his views and the views of the Administration on human rights Q If you had the power what about the Congress would you change Mr Dorgan I havent had a chance to reflect much on the structure or the organization of Congress largely because I think that once you are here you have to run to try and catch up But I find Congress much like any other collection of Americans Ive found a generous dose of the best and the brightest and also some of the dull and dullest Ive discovered that there arent any higher truths in Washington The Congress is fairly closely controlled a lot of us run around and a few run Congress And we have to try and get some attention to try and make a dent in the conciousness of the few who determine the agenda and the issues My experience before Washington had been pretty much rooted in public life although I worked for a large corporation and owned a couple of businesses in the middle But at one point I was in a position called the state tax commissioner In an executive branch position like that you have dozens of staff assistants and a staff of a couple of hundred You make decisions Here you make speeches Ive found that change frustrating My district takes in 43 million acres It is extremely difficult to get to and you have to be there a lot if youre going to serve your constituents Mr Gorton One remarkable change I have noticed since I came to Washington was less control over my time In the Senate at least we are assigned to so many committees that we cant become experts on much of anything Im a member of five committees and more than half a dozen subcommittees Its very frustrating to have to miss at least 50 percent of the meetings of committees of which youre a member because of scheduling conflicts you can only be in one place at a time A reform in the Senate which cut down at least mildly on the number of committees would strengthen the system Another impression is the inability to delegate As Attorney General of Washington State I had 205 attorneys working for me Obviously I did the things I found most interesting I argued cases across the street in the Supreme Court of the United States but the overwhelming bulk of the work of an office like that was delegated I was primarily a recruiter and an administrator Mr Dodd Ive come maybe 180 degrees from since I was a member of the freshman class of 1974 that was sometimes charged with trying to destroy the institution Id like to see the committees strengthened I can remember vividly in the House cases where a committee would vote out a bill 39 or 40 to zero And then on the floor of the House 60 percent of the proposed amendments came from the members of the committee That goes on more in the House I think than in the Senate Maybe we just havent dealt with enough issues yet But the committee structure really needs to be reinforced  and my concern is that the committees mean less and less each year  so that there is a greater allocation of time and respect of your colleagues work In the House there was a greater sense of collegiality than there is in the Senate despite all of the rumors to the contrary about the club You dont get the opportunity to spend much time with your colleagues in the Senate except for the people you sit next to in committee Miss Fiedler Theres far too much legislation and not enough plain gut work being done around here I resent the fact that my time which I consider to be valuable is wasted running back and forth to the House chamber for routine votes We could perhaps meet fewer days of the year and concentrate our workload Its much too fragmented now Before coming to Congress I was a member of the Los Angeles School Board representing 35 million people The district is the equivalent to the 11th largest state in the country The differences between that and Congress are more geographical than in terms of political sophistication Still the travel back and forth  and I make a trip every two weeks  creates a kind of schizophrenic existence The Costs of Campaigning Q Are you as concerned about singleissue politics and political action committees as many of your more senior colleagues Mr Dorgan Oneissue politics is the scourge of the system I think its going to ruin politics someday unless we start getting people to understand you have to have a broader view The fundraising that goes along with it and all the pressures brought to bear on every politician of every philosophical stripe are I think a real disservice to politics Miss Fiedler I think getting people involved in the process is terribly important If a given issue is the thing that motivates them to get involved then thats well and good I was involved in a single issue in the city of Los Angeles But I often think single issues become the focus of whats wrong in other areas so they become symbolic as busing did in my particular situation On the area of PACs political action committees I had substantial PAC contributions  probably one of the largest in the House  and I think that again this is a very important participation on the part of the public When you take a look at PAC contributions what you really get is an average of 10 per person The more people involved in the political process the better I dont care if its one issue that brings them in as long as they care as long as they get involved and they become educated about whats happening Mr Gorton The PAC in one sense is a terribly difficult thing because of the pressures that that amount of money can bear on individual votes In another sense Miss Fiedler is right  the PAC has involved more people in making contributions to political candidates than has ever been the case in the past So it seems to me that what we need to do is not just say this is a terrible situation we ought to try to move on to the next step How do we retain the advantages and get rid of some of the disadvantages of the present system I tried to run a campaign last year without taking any PAC money That lasted until about July when I got opposition in the primary as well as in the general election I simply had to raise a lot of money The paradox of the present system is that a PAC can come up with 5000 and an individual can only come up with 1000 Mr Dodd Singleissue politics and the PACs are extremely destructive to the twoparty system which is the glue basically of this society The facts speak for themselves Last year 75 million eligible voters failed to participate And I think in large part that was due to singleissue politics and to the really obscene cost of campaigns Dick Bolling chairman of the House Rules Committee may have said it best in a debate several years ago Too many people in Congress have come to believe that the sum of the special interests equals the national interest It does not And the fact is thats destroying our ability to act as legislators its making it almost impossible for an overwhelming number of people to participate in the political process as candidates I think its driving a significant number of people away from the polls on Election Day The Democratic Defeat Was Overdue Q Are you pleased with the directions your political parties are taking Miss Fiedler Generally speaking from an economic standpoint I support the direction and the thrust of the Republican party I do not support the thrust of the party in the area of abortion in the area of equal rights amendment I think that its out of step with the interests of the American people and with their attitudes and opinions Mr Dodd As far as the Democrats are concerned were sort of a party in search of itself Its been some years since we suffered the kind of defeat that occurred last November It probably would have happened frankly years earlier had it not been for Watergate There is a debate going on over whether or not we ought to be looking for new principles or whether we ought to try and take old principles and apply them to the 1980s Im more inclined to go with that latter view I think the principles upon which the Democratic Party was established some 50 years ago beginning with the New Deal were sound But they need to reflect the conditions in the 1980s Mr Gorton I come from exactly the opposite kind of background than Senator Dodd comes from He comes from a strong party state and I come from a state in which the party system influence over politics is the weakest We have no more agreement now within the party on many of the social issues which we may be dealing with later this year or early next year than the Democrats do and perhaps even less So again what is that direction Im pleased with the direction as far as economics is concerned To the extent that we have a party platform which takes very very rigid positions on some of the social issues I dont like it particularly Mr Dorgan Well Im not very pleased I think the Democratic Party had been a big hitter and now were sort of reduced to counterpunching The President has the initiative But I dont think this is the death knell for the Democrats In 74 we wondered whether the Republican Party would be in existence anymore and it is Its strong And the Democratic Party will be back I fly airplanes a little and occasionally you drift and youre happy until you find out where youve drifted I think that in time the country will turn back to the center Were in for some interesting times It would be fun for us to sit around this table in 83 and see who is on top then
"Ideas & Trends; THIS TIME, IT'S A CLOSE CALL ON ANTI-ABORTION",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/14/weekinreview/ideas-trends-this-time-it-s-a-close-call-on-anti-abortion.html,BILL By BERNARD WEINRAUB WASHINGTON  It was the intent of Senator John P East a freshman Republican from North Carolina to move an antiabortion bill rapidly through his subcommittee in April restricting the witness list in two mornings of hearings to eight doctors only one of them opposing the bill But the issue  arguably the most emotional in politics today  could not be dismissed in that way The flood of criticism which followed the hearings held in the Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on the Separation of Powers led Senator East to extend them through the end of this month with a more evenhanded witness list Last week for example New Yorks City Council President Carol Bellamy testified that legal abortions have not denied life but affirmed it by protecting the hundreds of thousands of women who would otherwise be forced to seek illegal and unsafe abortions At issue is a bill sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina and Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois declaring that human life shall be deemed to exist from conception thus allowing states if they choose to prosecute abortion as murder The hearings mark the opening of a major political battle in which abortion foes seek to overturn the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that a woman has a constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy Although the drive for congressional action to ban abortion began days after the ruling the antiabortion forces are for the first time sensing triumph The reason is President Reagan who strongly opposes abortion except in cases where the mothers life is endangered and who is the first President to align himself with the righttolife movement The Administrations attitude was summed up in a recent television comment by Richard S Schweiker the Secretary of Health and Human Services We are going to save the baby seals we are going to save the baby whales were going even to save the snail darters and stop a dam but we wont save the unborn child he said I have trouble understanding why we can get all wrought up about tadpoles and not unborn kids As if to underscore the gains made by abortion foes House and Senate conferees recently approved stringent curbs on Medicaid abortions Under the bill Government funds can only be used for abortions in lifethreatening cases and not as under present law in cases of rape and incest At first glance then it would seem that the optimism of the prolifers seems justified At second glance however what Senator Easts hearings make clear is not only the vigor of the prochoice groups but also the unexpected tremors of opposition within conservative ranks about the HelmsHyde bill Senator Orrin C Hatch of Utah for example the chairman of the Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on the Constitution and a strong opponent of abortion prefers a constitutional amendment because of his constitutional concerns about the implications of the bill Several prominent conservative legal experts such as Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago Law School Charles Alan Wright of the University of Texas Law School and former Solicitor General Robert Bork of Yale Law School also opposed the bill on constitutional grounds In a letter to the Judiciary Committee 11 constitutional scholars including Mr Kurland and Mr Wright said that the legislation to ban abortions was an attempt to exercise unconstitutional power Indeed it seems that both sides may have initially miscalculated each others weaknesses and strengths Senator East swept into office on the Reagan landslide obviously saw the conservative sweep as a mandate for a ban on abortion But prochoice advocates are plainly hopeful that recent polls indicating substantial support in the nation for abortion rights will sway legislators A CBSNew York Times poll this year indicated that 63 percent of the people believe a woman ought to be able to get an abortion if she wants one and if her doctor agrees The antiabortion tone of the Administration has resulted in major fund raising efforts by organizations such as Planned Parenthood the National Abortion Rights Action League and the National Organization for Women who have marshalled their forces through dramatic campaigns One of their key points is that the proposed legislation would make illegal such birth control methods as the intrauterine device and the pill which are believed to act after conception People are shocked said Eleanor Smeal president of the 125000member National Organization for Women Its gone way beyond the abortion issue Prochoice advocates however may not have counted on Mr Easts and abortion foes determination to tackle the issue so quickly even before the Administrations budget and tax proposals are resolved Once the hearings end Senator East will seek a vote on the fivemember panel and if the bill is approved the measure will go to the Judiciary Committee In spite of many conservatives ambivalence about the bill and the intense desire of many on Capitol Hill to avoid the issue entirely prolife leaders remain adamant about placing the HelmsHyde bill on the House and Senate floor We now have the votes said Mr Hyde
DEMOCRATIC DIFFICULTIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/14/books/democratic-difficulties.html,GOVERNING AMERICA An Insiders Report from the White House and the Cabinet By Joseph A Califano Jr 474 pp New York Simon  Schuster 1695 JOSEPH A CALIFANO JR may have been the only Secretary of Health Education and Welfare who truly wanted the job for itself alone and not because like any Cabinet post it provided prominence and perquisites As an aide to President Johnson Mr Califano had been instrumental in shaping the Great Society programs These had grown enormously in the succeeding Administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and had made the HEW budget by far the largest in Government Meanwhile Mr Califano looked forward to managing improving and completing these programs someday In the first sentence of this fascinating memoir  a unique account of the making or the failure to make social policy at the Secretarial level  he tells us From the time I left my job at the White House as President Lyndon Johnsons staff assistant for domestic affairs in January 1969 I knew that if I ever returned to government service I would like to be Secretary of Health Education and Welfare Mr Califano was eventually given the job in 1977 though not because he could have been expected to know as much as anyone about these programs or because he was their enthusiastic advocate or because his energy and ebullience suggested he could administer the enormous department Instead he was first approached because candidate Jimmy Carter wanted help in shaping a profamily speech Too much Federal policy is antifamily Mr Carter said in his first phone call to Mr Califano in July 1976 I want to make it profamily Who better to help him than a Catholic like Mr Califano And how better to appeal both to liberals and progressives and to conservative bluecollar workers An excellent choice And yet every domestic initiative of the Carter Administration was stalemated in Congress and every problem that HEW hoped to resolve remained just about where it had been before Mr Califanos 30 hectic months in office or Mr Carters 48 months Except that by 1980 the economy was in much worse shape the electorate had shifted markedly to the right and the two departments that replaced HEW  Health and Human Services and Education Mr Califano had opposed this separation of power  were specifically targeted for the most radical budget cuts What went wrong First as Mr Califano begins his account HEW was endlessly bedeviled by the abortion issue Mr Califano and Mr Carter were both strongly on record as antiabortion but this did not help them in Congress The Administrations various constituencies and its cadre of women appointees for Mr Carter in the end was firm about only one thing appointing blacks and women identified the Secretary and the President as squarely on the proabortion side The abortion question dominated Mr Califanos preparations for his confirmation hearings But that was only the beginning continued Congressional disputes over restrictions on the use of Federal funds for Medicaid abortions again and again held up the huge HEW appropriations He could not even escape the issue after Congress finally settled on the circumstances that would permit Federal funding for an abortion a threat to the life of the mother rape incest the possibility of incurable genetic defects Then came the arguments over the regulations What was prompt reporting of rape and incest The regulations finally specified that a report must be filed within 60 days Mr Carter was not happy with such an extended period It is now down to 72 hours What does it mean when tens of billions of dollars for health education welfare research and other domestic programs can be held up by an issue such as abortion Was it simply an accident Whatever its intrinsic importance the abortion debate epitomizes the problems created by the expanding role of the Federal Government The Supreme Court had made abortion a Federal concern with a decision Roe v Wade that cavalierly wiped out the laws of 50 states the Federal Government then took it upon itself to fund abortions as routinely as any other medical procedure The growth of government not only meant that such issues became unavoidable It also meant government could not resolve them because expansion had created so many special constituencies each looking for different benefits and each protected by its own Congressional committees that any Administrative movement  whether forward backward or simply for the sake of reorganization and economy  led again and again to a stalemate Mr Califano writes at the end of his discussion of this question I came away from the abortion controversy with profound concern about the capacity of national government  to resolve issues so personal and so laced with individual moral and ethical values Not every issue of course raised the moral and ethical problems that abortion did But where there were no moral and ethical problems economic interests took over and so everyt major domestic initiative attempted by the Carter Administration failed National health insurance for example had been the one great hole in the work of the Great Society and Senator Edward Kennedy had made the issue his own Mr Carter had promised that he would expand health insurance He had also promised to balance the budget But there was no plan that could satisfy Senator Kennedy without making impossible any hope of a balanced budget So both the Kennedy and the Carter proposals eventually failed Mr Califano properly recognized that national health insurance had to be accompanied by a reorganization of health services to control costs But this effort also failed and here Mr Califano can be faulted for not taking seriously enough the questions raised by those opposed to his costcontainment proposals He blames the selfinterest of proprietary hospitals and notes their election contributions to various Congressmen Mr Califano describes how David Stockman then a Representative from Michigan used a computer terminal in his office to help lead the fight against the Carter bill But Mr Califano does not tell us that there were philosophical as well as pragmatic reasons such as resistance to the regulatory burden that would result for Mr Stockman and other Congressmen to oppose the initiative When it came to welfare unlike health insurance the Administration was not pushed into battle by the liberals Mr Carter firmly believed that the welfare program was antifamily and antiwork as did Mr Nixon as did everyone else and he had promised reform But the President had promised to balance the budget as well and wanted nocost reform which would rationalize the system without adding any new expenditures He also failed in Mr Califanos account to understand the problem Mr Carter was shocked to discover how much an income guarantee that makes sense nationally would increase benefits in the South with the wages lower there welfare would be a much more serious competitor to work The President was also shocked to learn how high the cutoff point at which a family worked its way off welfare would have to be set if any reasonable work incentive were to be built into the program For example if a worker on welfare had his benefit reduced by 50 cents for each dollar earned and if his minimum benefit were set at some reasonable figure then he would be on welfare until he earned a fairly high wage In addition everyone now earning that wage or less would find it advantageous to go on welfare These dilemmas had already been faced by the Nixon Administration and explained well by Daniel P Moynihan in The Politics of a Guaranteed Income so there was no reason for Mr Carter to be taken by surprise if he had understood the issues he would have been more cautious in his promise of comprehensive reform In addition by 1977 the results of the Seattle and Denver incomemaintenance experiments conducted by the Stanford Research Institute under Federal contract were in Although Mr Califano barely mentions it this research showed that family stability one of the major objectives of rationalizing welfare through increased and standardized benefits  would be undermined by expanding the guaranteed minimum income The increased benefit apparently led to more family breakups because of the greater financial independence it offered mothers For all these reasons leading authorities warned against hoping for major reform when Mr Carter assumed the Presidency Mr Califano either did not learn as much as he should have from the experts or tried to ignore the difficulties that had to be faced As for education no great new changes were on the agenda only expansion of existing programs which grew enormously Here the Administrations problem was heading off a major initiative  the MoynihanPackwood bill for tuition tax credits which almost passed that embodied skepticism about the Governments proper part in education To be sure Mr Califano himself questioned the expanded Federal role I came to HEW he writes enthusiastic about the opportunity to improve education in America and determined to step up Federal funding sharply In this he succeeded I left alarmed over the deterioration of public education in America and troubled by the threat to academic freedom that the Federal role enlarged and shaped by special interests poses And after his account of the various issues that he dealt with in education he concludes citing Lyndon Johnson that the Federal Government should leave elementary and secondary education to the local communities and he criticizes the representatives of higher education for not being sufficiently concerned about academic freedom But Mr Califanos concern for the autonomy of education seems a little odd coming after his chapter on civil rights in which he is most pleased with and enthusiastic about his accomplishments After all the threats to the academy that now worry him came principally from the enforcement of expanded civilrights requirements as interpreted by HEW and its Office of Civil Rights Yet he remains unaware of this contradiction It was imperative to breathe life into HEWs Office of Civil Rights he writes and thus the Administration leaned hard on local school districts to redistribute teachers by race to introduce bilingual programs and to undertake busing all to the extent that these could be required under the limitations placed on HEW by Congress But what then happened to local control of education One of Mr Califanos major efforts was to get the University of North Carolina to desegregate its campuses which had once been allwhite or allblack by moving academic programs around from campus to campus Leaving aside the question of whether such reorganization would have any major effect in determining which campus students in North Carolina chose what was HEW doing telling the University of North Carolina how to arrange its academic programs Mr Califano is eager to present his administration of HEW as a sharp break from that of his predecessors under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and at least in the case of civil rights he can show a strikingly different attitude toward Federal enforcement and the expanding Government role in the details of administering local school systems and state highereducation systems Yet from the viewpoint of the schools and universities involved very little changed Government played as powerful and intrusive a role under Republicans who theoretically eschewed such a role as under a Democrat who  except for his qualms about academic freedom  was basically enthusiastic about it One is struck again and again in Governing America at how little HEW changed between the Nixon and Ford Administrations and the Carter Administration and one is left wondering how much domestic policy will differ under Ronald Reagan There seem to be three reasons for this surprising continuity despite the very different Administration philosophies One is that specialinterest groups the handicapped womens groups civilrights groups can either through direct political pressure or through court order force the Government to act regardless of whether it wishes to and can even force the Government to issue detailed regulations it disagrees with As Mr Califano tells us In mid1979 there were 225 continuing court orders against the Secretary requiring periodic reports to judges and judicial oversight Presumably he agreed with more of these court orders than his predecessors did  yet whether he agreed or not he was compelled to act just as they were A second reason for the lack of change is that the major problems remain the same and their intractabilities and difficulties persist regardless of Administrations The contradictions of welfare were no different under Mr Nixon than they were under Mr Carter  or they are under Mr Reagan The problem of skyrocketing medical costs continues and the CarterCalifano effort at cost control might well have been a Nixon effort one wonders whether before four years are up it will also become a Reagan effort The crisis now facing Social Security was already evident in the Carter Administration and the range of alternatives available to meet it is no different today than two years ago The final source of continuity is perhaps the most surprising part of Mr Califanos book The attitudes of the leaders of the different Administrations were remarkably similar I am not trying to make Mr Califano out to be a Republican or a neoconservative He believed in Big Government he believed Government could do more for people than it was doing he believed that Government could do good and more of it What is news to me from reading Governing America  as I am sure it will be to many readers  is how much alike were the fears and concerns of both activistic Democrats and skeptical Republicans how the concrete reality of the problems shaped their responses regardless of political philosophy As I have noted Mr Carter and Mr Califano were as uncomfortable with Governmentfunded abortions as the present Administration is What was different was that the Carter Administrations supporters disagreed with its position and had to be mollified Mr Califano was just as unhappy as his Republican predecessors were or his Republican successors are at administering his department under court orders won by interest groups incapable of achieving their aims through elections He did not for instance like being pushed around by the bilingualeducation lobby which had become the captive of the professional Hispanic and other ethnic groups Mr Carter was even tougher although his supporters might not have been aware of his convictions He wanted schoolchildren taught English not ethnic culture etc And Mr Califano was also concerned about the more general blight that results when Government tries to do good He was deeply moved by the hospice movement for the dying and wanted HEW to help But one of its strengths was in the genuine grass roots inspiration  I did not want to smother the movement with HEW support There were too few islands of human dignity left at the end of life to bureaucratize this one Many supporters of the present Administration could have said the same thing We now have an Administration that has a remarkable mandate to cut Government expenditures and clearly wants to withdraw the Federal Government from many areas of social policy Whether it will be allowed to do so is another question In his conclusion Mr Califano notes the danger of special interests  not those independent of the Government the creationists antiabortionists and others on whom journalistic attention has recently been focused by the Reagan victory but those the Government itself helps create by providing benefits the education establishment the handicapped and so on What is most pernicious as we enter the 1980s he tells us is that we have institutionalized in law and bureaucracy single interest organizations that can accede only in the narrow interest and are incapable of adjudicating in the national interest But that is not how he begins Governing America In the first chapter he writes Next to the President the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare had the greatest opportunity to help the most people particularly the weakest Indeed But in doing so he also helped create all the pressure groups that in the end stalemated him Mr Califano does not highlight this contradiction but his readers will ponder it A way must be discovered for the Government to do good without becoming entangled in a web of interests and passions that prevent it from doing anything at all We shall see whether such a path can still be found as the Reagan Administration tries to move the Federal Government out of many of the areas into which Mr Califano helped thrust it with such enthusiasm
THE NEW RIGHT: A LIBERAL VIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/14/nyregion/the-new-right-a-liberal-view.html,WHEN the Democratic Town Committee of Westport asked me to speak at Staples High School on June 28 my first reaction was appreciation at being asked Many political organizations are  understandably  more interested in hearing from incumbents than from former Senators  My second impulse was to say Thanks  but no thanks These days I am spending much of my free time speaking out on what I see as the threat posed to American institutions by some of the more extreme elements of the New Right Because I have never seen too much point in preaching to the already converted I have tried to appear in forums where I could confront those whom I oppose or to take advantage of the invitations I receive to talk about this problem in the newspapers or on television Fairfield County usually votes Republican But it has always been on the whole a bastion of common sense and moderation in politics and ideology Why discuss the New Right the Moral Majority the proposed abortion legislation and other parts of the rightwing agenda in a region where extremism has never gotten much of a foothold But then I reconsidered the nature of the threat and the people with whom I might share my thoughts if I went to Westport Southwestern Connecticut contains a concentration of some of the most influential people in the country It is not simply a matter of money Fairfield County possesses an unusual blend of wealth communications mastery and corporate power The people who live in Fairfield County make things happen They are accustomed to decisionmaking and they have the means to reach and influence thinking across the country This concentration of power in finance advertising corporate action radio and television publishing and the arts  has always been tempered by strong considerations of responsibility and moderation But moderation can cause blind spots People who are themselves tolerant often cannot take intolerance seriously Moderates may be highly aware of phenomena like the Moral Majority However they may find it hard to believe that such extremism could find its way into the laws we live by Oh there are a lot of fanatics around such people say but they wont really get anyplace with that stuff In other words moderates are people who think It cant happen here In my judgment they are wrong I have seen the face of the New Right up close It is frightening in its countenance because it has real teeth So I was glad to accept the invitation of the Westport Democrats to deliver an address I will share my feelings about this new threat to freedom in the United States I will document my case against those believers who are coming closer to imposing their doctrines on all of us Their agenda goes beyond customary religious bounds their intent is to extend and enforce their rigid views in areas that we always assumed before to be the private business of the individual If I do my job right on June 28 certain things will begin to happen Some highly influential people in the arts communications and business will begin to think in a different way about this threat to our institutions They will begin to see the growing power of the New Right Although the threat is by no means limited to the Moral Majority we can get some idea of its weight by examining the fundamentalist firebrands who lead the movement They are in control of a vast communications network  in fact the largest in the country The people I shall meet with in Fairfield County are particularly aware of the power of the press They may not however be aware of the immensity of the press apparatus now in the hands of those who would use the pulpit to command the state Moderates tend to look for pluses Some may say Of course those people have some pretty wild ideas but you cant just throw out everything they stand for After all theyre for more discipline in the schools right Well so am I It therefore becomes necessary to examine what their kind of discipline would cost in loss of freedom and intrusion into the private lives of children and adults Abolishing abortion though there is great attention being paid to it today  is by no means the only element of the Moral Majoritys agenda Their program comprises a grab bag enforced school prayer capital punishment the defeat of the equal rights amendment and the erosion of childlabor laws The list is extensive At the moment however the criminalization of abortion by constitutional amendment is the focus of the movement Well who of us is not troubled by abortion The point is not whether the people who oppose abortion should be able to practice and propound their views The point is whether the views of one segment of the population  and I maintain a distinct minority not majority  are to be allowed to make criminals of all who refuse to abide by their strictures If this can be done in the case of abortion then it can be done in other areas as well And this is much closer to happening than many now realize The threat is imminent And to describe the threat in its most vivid manifestation within a short time  if the extremist agenda carries  we could be putting raped teenage girls who have gotten abortions on trial for murder That last statement is the kind of thing which often evokes the response Well I know its bad but surely it would never get as bad as all that My information says it can get as bad as all that which is another reason why I feel compelled to voice a warning to those who influence attitudes across the land We are looking at the encroachment of a New Inquisition The members of the New Right are of course by no means all partisans of the Moral Majority But the New Right joined in alliance with the Moral Majority to ride to power And he who rides a tiger can never dismount It can happen here It has happened  within our lifetimes  in other countries not just

AFTER 50 YEARS IN POLITICS ROSSETTI CALLS IT A CAREER,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/14/nyregion/after-50-years-in-politics-rossetti-calls-it-a-career.html,Frank G Rossettis halfcentury of service with the Democratic Party is ending where it began  at the corner of First Avenue and 116th Street That block was his first constituency when he was an election district captain 50 years ago and it is on that corner where his small fading Kanawha Democratic Club occupies what was once a dentists office For the first time in a halfcentury the name of the former Tammany leader and East Harlem Assemblyman will not be on the primary petitions that will begin circulating next week The district has changed and Im getting on in years said the 73yearold Mr Rossetti who still looks like the boxer he once was His adult life has been totally identified with the Democratic Party It gave him party and public offices and the financial and emotional rewards that lifted him from the poverty he had known as an orphaned immigrant A Union Leader Too As he advanced in the party Mr Rossetti also advanced in the labor union movement eventually becoming a vice president of the Operators Plasterers and Cement Masons international union The party even gave him his friends But the party of which Mr Rossetti speaks no longer exists Surrounded by the past  pictures of himself and various politicians covering the paneled walls of the Kanawha club  he spoke of a party in which the late Clarence Neal Mr Rossettis predecessor as district leader told his allies in 1944 that he had not decided which Democrat to support All of you follow the leadoff Mr Neal told his followers according to Mr Rossetti When the leadoff who happened to be a new Greenwich Village district leader Carmine G De Sapio  voted for Edward Loughlin all the other district leaders fell into line like sheep A few years later Mr Rossetti as an Assemblyman was called on to vote on the sensitive bill legalizing abortion The Difference Is Loyalty I went along with the party said Mr Rossetti My church was against it but my party was for it The difference is loyalty and trust he said comparing the old and new Democratic Party When the Ohrensteins and the Blumenthals came along everything changed  they became their own party When you were a county leader or a district leader you meant something all the patronage cleared through you A leader needs power and theres nothing wrong with that power if its used in the right way said the man who was a district leader for 37 years and Tammany leader for 10 years from 1967 to 1977  the longest service of a Tammany leader since the fall of Mr De Sapio in 1961 A Coordinator of Factions Even then political organizations were on the decline and Mr Rossetti was more of a coordinator of warring factions than a leader Mr Rossetti blamed the decline of the parties on Mayors starting with William ODwyer who he said had tried to select party leaders and control patronage themselves and on President Lyndon B Johnsons Great Society which set up community antipoverty organizations that rivaled political clubs for local allegiance but had the advantage of the Federal Treasury behind them Why should someone join the club he asked Ive got nothing to give them However the party is still giving to Mr Rossetti even in his semiretirement He holds a patronage job as a parttime labor consultant for the Assembly and is paid as much as 10000 a year His District Is Home He regularly dines with Mr De Sapio and Michael H Prendergast the onetime Democratic state chairman who was Mr De Sapios close ally at the height of Mr De Sapios power Also in their 70s both have offices at the Biltmore Hotel once the Democratic hotel in town He still lives in his district  unlike many politicians who represented areas that have seen better days  in a fourstory apartment house he owns on Pleasant Avenue around the corner from the club Mr Rossetti left his Assembly seat in 1972 when he was reapportioned into a largely black district and now he is leaving as a district leader because only two of his 26 captains are white Mr Rossetti had already fended off several Hispanic challenges to his leadership and expected more He said that the Hispanic politicians will be the same as us looking for their rewards  they know its there for them theyre entitled to it and theyll get it Mr Rossettis greatest reward from politics came not to him but to his son who was appointed a State Court of Claims judge by Gov Nelson A Rockefeller Despite their political differences the Republican Governor and the Democratic leader had cooperated That was the biggest thrill of my life said the man who entered politics in East Harlem in 1932 because he was a plasterer who wanted to be another kind of judge  a boxing judge
Ideas & Trends in Summary; LAWYERS GROUP DEFENDS LEGAL AID,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/14/weekinreview/ideas-trends-in-summary-lawyers-group-defends-legal-aid.html,Last week the New York Lawyers Committee to Preserve Legal Services delivered to members of Congress a 100page brief on the Legal Services Corporation  the latest in a series of statements by the legal establishment defending the 16year old program which dispenses Federal funds for legal aid to the poor We suspect that many who argue against funds for legal services lawyers the document stated are in fact opposed to the substantive rights the poor have been granted in our society and which Legal Services Corporationfunded Lawyers only enforce The Administration circulated a paper of its own defending the plan to eliminate the corporation Its author Michael Horowitz counsel to David Stockman director of Office of Management and Budget attacked the Legal Services Corporation as a movement of the left imposing a liberal ideology on poor people and shifting the responsibility for pro buono publico work from the legal profession to the Government The corporation won a temporary lease on life when committees in both houses of Congress moved to exempt it among other programs from President Reagans proposals to provide states with block grants of Federal aid A reauthorization bill for the Legal Services Corporation calling for a budget reduced from the current 321 million to 260 million and for restrictions on class action suits and cases involving abortion homosexuality and illegal aliens is scheduled to come before the House within the next two weeks If the legislation passes The Office of Management and Budget is recommending a veto
THE EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK; WHO KNOWS THE MEANING OF ABORT?,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/15/opinion/the-editorial-notebook-who-knows-the-meaning-of-abort.html,The first time I ever heard of an abortion I was too young to understand the procedure too young even to quite understand how one got pregnant The person having the abortion however was even younger she was 12  an odd lonely child who was just the kind to be detoured on her way home from grade school by a promise of affection Growing up I heard little more about abortions although a chronic eavesdropper on adults I was aware of various operations for appendicitis But I do remember a girl who bore a child in secret another who blamed her swollen belly on tainted fruit juice until she too went into hiding and two high school seniors whose long graduation dresses the first they ever owned doubled a few days later as wedding gowns and in a sense as shrouds for dead hopes  for more education and a life beyond our small town None of those girls was over 17 and the time was nearly 30 years ago when according to the new revisionist view of American sexual history everyone was a virgin until a clergyman sanctified the alternative Recently on the opposite page a novelist of great distinction  65 years old and thus a member of a generation The Novelist Imagines Too Much And Too Little presumed even more innocent than mine  wrote about abortion in a way that he promised would offend everybody To a description of the controversy surrounding the question of when human life begins Walker Percy brought what he calls the writers only obvious credential He trafficks in words and meanings And so he wrote as a novelist I can recognize meretricious use of language disingenuousness and a con job when I hear it There is however another credential he claimed to bring to the discussion about abortion namely that a novelist is perhaps more sensitive to the atrocities of the age than most Abortion being yet another banal atrocity in a century where atrocities have become commonplace it is his duty to proclaim them But why I wonder does this collector of atrocities not mention the ones that so often precede abortion sexual ignorance or assault or contraceptive failure or the unequal burden for contraception borne by women Concluding his contribution to what he calls this already superheated debate heated further by his definition of legal abortion as a million and a half fetuses flushed down the Disposall every year Mr Percy told those who favor free choice According to the opinion polls it looks as if you may get your way But youre not going to have it both ways Youre going to be told what youre doing Does he really think that women undergoing abortions dont know what theyre doing That they dont realize it is a fetus they are aborting That women and men dont hope for riskfree contraceptive devices or reliable natural family planning methods Or that most parents while wishing against odds that sex werent such a fact of adolescent life wouldnt welcome their childrens having access to birth control information which they are often too shy too awkward or too uninformed to give them The women I know whove had abortions were very aware of what they were doing Except that 12yearold I dont think she understood anything at all MARY CANTWELL
A CONGRESS OF MEN ASKS EQUALITY FOR BOTH SEXES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/15/style/a-congress-of-men-asks-equality-for-both-sexes.html,Declaring that men as well as women are victims of sexual stereotyping and of a serious pervasive sexual discrimination that flows from it delegates from 21 states launched this weekend what they hope will become a national mens liberation movement The objective of the National Congress for Men as it emerged during two days of discussions speeches and resolution making is not to fight feminism or roll back its gains but to extend sexual equality to both sexes We must not reverse the womens movement 34yearold Frederic Hayward of Cambridge Mass said in a keynote speech that was widely taken as a manifesto we must accelerate it Mens liberation Mr Hayward said is not a backlash for there is nothing about traditional sex roles that I want to go back to Rather he said let us simply introduce the innovation that these principles of sexual equality be fully applied not onesidedly applied With that the approximately 125 delegates representing some 200 local grass roots organizations with thousands of members and including a few women went to work to set out the ways in which they believed men to be the victims of sexism to adopt policy positions and to create a national organizational network Discrimination in Employment As the basis for their cause they asserted that men among other things are sexually discriminated against in employment sometimes and in military service almost all the time They argued that the stereotypical image of men as domineering protective strong and aggressive limits their options in life as much as the opposite equally false image of women limits theirs They said that mens unequal economic burden reduces their life span making it eight years shorter than that of women and partly on this ground argues for equal pay for women so that mens burden might be eased I do not want to stop women from going out and finding highpaying jobs Mr Hayward said in his keynote speech I want to demand that women go out and find highpaying jobs I am tired of being their wallet They stood fast on the principle that abortions performed unilaterally by women often trample on the legitimate rights of the fathertobe Mr Hayward for one even reasoned that because men for the most part still must take the initiative in forming malefemale relationships and because women consequently tend to offer no spontaneous attention the male bears the risk of rejection and psychological harm But most emphatically the delegates asserted that the false view of men as being hard and insensitive rather than tender and nurturing contributes directly to the greatest single inequity of all the frequently automatic arbitrarily imposed loss of a mans children home and an unfair portion of his assets upon divorce  on the assumption that women are inherently better parents Both parents should be treated equally in such situations they strongly asserted A Powerful Issue This last was by far the most powerful and emotional issue uniting the delegates In fact the great majority of them were divorced fathers and many of those were said to have been left by their wives often in response to feminist urgings The movie Kramer vs Kramer is about many of them they said Swapping war stories as they called them and often expressing the outrage of people who feel deeply wronged they were generally given credit for infusing the fledgling mens movement with an obvious emotion and intensity Weve been burned badly enough so that were the ones who are looking inside each other said Justus Baird a delegate from Houston Questions were raised during the conference as to whether the movement would turn into a oneissue crusade Many delegates conceding the danger said that the fathers rights issue was the crystallizing agent but said also that they believed and hoped broader concerns would rule in the long run This year we are mostly divorced men in the congress Next year no said Ken Lewis of Glenside Pa who wore a Tshirt reading Happiness is being a single father Were concerned about all men Mr Lewis said Indeed the resolutions that were adopted today displayed a certain breadth of subject matter Many of them rested on the assumption that except for reproduction men and women are capable of fulfilling most of societys roles interchangeably A similar assumption undergirds the womens movement But although both Mr Hayward and the conference generally sought to dovetail its philosophy with that of the feminists the feminists nonetheless came in for some hard words Feminism Mr Hayward asserted is too often sexist itself That is he explained it insists on a female perspective is monopolized by female concerns and perpetuates myths about males  for example that all men are privileged all are rapists all are dominant We must give full credence to the seriousness of womens problems and be willing to work toward their solution he said But if the others do not return the favor it is they who are the sexist pigs It is they who are reactionary He added When I look at feminists today I dont want to call them names  I only want to call their bluff From the beginning of the conference the idea of a return to the traditional male role to a patriarchal society was overwhelmingly and resoundingly rejected In its place was adopted a resolution later endorsed by the full congress that both males and females should be encouraged to have a full range of behavioral options open to them as parents workers and members of society Additionally it was resolved that pressure be brought on the mass media to portray males and females in a variety of roles that the congress support the passage of the proposed Federal equal rights amendment and insists that it be applied equally to males and females
TO ATTACK THE PROBLEMS OF ADOLESCENT SEXUALITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/15/opinion/l-to-attack-the-problems-of-adolescent-sexuality-157922.html,To the Editor Your editorial against chastity Where Chastity Is Not Virtuous May 25 must have surprised others as it did us We do not wish to create and promote a Government ideology about sex We wish to change the ideology that the Government is promoting with which you apparently agree Government should not endeavor to come between parent and child on issues of adolescent sexuality But that is what the Government does In the past decade we have spent 15 billion of taxpayers money on family planning What have we purchased for Americas adolescents Over 5000 clinics provide family planning services to teenagers using Federal money in whole or part they provide sex education contraceptives and abortion counseling without the parents knowledge or consent Teenagers now comprise 35 to 40 percent of those served by these clinics Many clinics have a clientele of over 52 percent teenagers The goals of some family planners spread far beyond providing contraceptives They frequently promote their own version of morality which implicitly if not explicitly includes the following tenets Teenagers sexual activity is inevitable and acceptable so long as no pregnancy results contraceptives should be made available to teenagers at Government expense if unwanted pregnancy does occur and according to this mentality virtually all pregnancies are unwanted abortion is the only logical alternative The deep pocket of government has funded this intervention between parents and their children in schools and clinics for 10 years it is little wonder that problems of adolescent sexual activity grow worse Partially as a consequence of these activities abortion for women under 20 is rising dramatically there will probably be over 500000 abortions performed on teenagers this year Outofwedlock births to women under 20 are increasing The percent of nevermarried teenagers in US cities who have experienced sexual intercourse almost doubled between 1971 and 1979 Sexual activity among 16yearolds in this group is up by 80 percent The major portion of S 1090 the Adolescent Family Life legislation continues 27 pilot programs which were set up in 1978 to provide services to pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents Parts of the bill encourage parents and their adolescent children to work together to obtain parental permission before services are provided We encourage adoption instead of abortion as a positive option for many adolescents who are unable or unwilling to raise their infants We encourage new services emphasizing prevention This is completely within the Presidents budget limits We seek workable compassionate familycentered solutions to these problems What a pleasant change that will be from government interference which seems to make the problems worse And what of chastity Personally we still think it should be considered even in 1981 The most effective oral contraceptive yet devised is the word no It costs nothing has no harmful side effects and is 100 percent effective Some of our liberal colleagues and apparently at least one editorial writer at The Times however feel that mentioning chastity in a piece of legislation is intolerable Most law is a moral statement of value whether about theft murder civil rights or adolescent sexual behavior but it never has been our intent to legislate chastity For those still concerned the bill now reads The purposes  are to find effective means within the context of the family of reaching adolescents before they become sexually active in order to maximize the guidance and support available to adolescents from parents and other family members and to promote selfdiscipline and other prudent approaches to the problems of adolescent premarital sexual relations and adolescent pregnancy We fear though that if you dont like chastity you wont like this approach either ORRIN HATCH US Senator from Utah JEREMIAH DENTON US Senator from Alabama Washington June 12 1981

HOUSE ACTION NEAR IN FIGHT OVER LEGAL AID,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/16/us/house-action-near-in-fight-over-legal-aid.html,The increasingly bitter ideological struggle over President Reagans drive to abolish the Legal Services Corporation is slated to reach the House floor tomorrow amid charges and countercharges that lobbying activities have been misleading The issue could result in a major defeat in Congress for the Administration and Mr Reagans first veto according to supporters and opponents of the program which provides legal aid for the poor The contest pits the Administration and many of its more conservative supporters against an unusual alliance Led by the American Bar Association the programs advocates include most of the legal establishment moderate and conservative Republicans in Congress and the usual champions of social programs Michael J Horowitz special counsel to David A Stockman the budget director today reiterated charges he has made in writing to members of Congress He said that the Legal Services Corporation had knowingly concealed and understated the extent of its lobbying and support for litigation that he said was designed to further the political goals of the left  Response to Opposition Responding to the charges Dan J Bradley president of the corporation today accused Mr Horowitz of distributing inaccuracies distortions an misrepresentations supplied by fanatical rightwingers like Howard Phillips head of the Conservative Caucus The corporation distributes Federal funds for legal aid to the poor in noncriminal cases such as disputes with landlords employers and welfare agencies The Administration wants to eliminate all direct Federal financing for such programs letting the states decide whether part of their Federal block grants should be used for this purpose Both houses of Congress seem likely to reject the Reagan plan and vote to continue the program at a greatly reduced level of financing as the relevant committees have recommended according to most persons close to the issue But prospects in the Republicancontrolled Senate are far from certain and Mr Horowitz has asserted that Mr Stockman and the Presidents senior staff have decided to urge a veto of bill providing Federal financing for the corporation Last week the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee recommended a 100 million budget for the corporation as against the current 321 million In a bipartisan vote the House Judiciary Committee 22 to 6 rejected the Reagan plan and approved 260 million in funds for the corporation Strong Lobbying Efforts The strong lobbying effort against the Reagan plan by groups of lawyers law school deans law students groups representing poor people and even judges has intensified as a House floor vote expected this week draws closer Opponents of Mr Reagans plan today distributed to members of Congress petitions signed by almost 600 state and Federal judges in California including four of the five current members of that states Supreme Court The petitions called for continuation of the federally financed legal services program Last week House members were sent copies of a letter signed by 21 business leaders supporting continuation of the program on the ground that the availability of legal services is essential in a society that depends on respect for the law and that all Americans must have access to our system of justice regardless of their ability to pay Among those who signed the letter were Robert O Anderson chairman of the Atlantic Richfield Company Walter A Haas Jr chairman of Levi Strauss  Company Felix Rohatyn senior partner of Lazard Freres  Company and Reginald Jones former chairman of the General Electric Company Alternate Idea Advanced In a 47page discussion paper that he distributed to members of Congress Mr Horowitz asserted that the outpouring of support for the program from the legal profession was motivated in part by selfinterest He cited the employment possibilities that the program offered both for legal aid lawyers and for those whose clients were sued by legal aid lawyers and he suggested that requiring lawyers in private practice to provide more free representation for poor people would make more sense than asking Federal taxpayers to pay for legal aid Mr Horowitz said that the Legal Services Corporation had encouraged the 6200 legalaid lawyers in the programs it finances to act as selfdesignated tribunes pursuing their own liberal causes He accused the corporations officers and supporters of concealing their true activities by distributing deliberately misleading information and statistics Charges Assailed by Bar Group Such charges have brought angry retorts from leaders of the American Bar Association as well as from Mr Bradley who said today that they reflected ignorance of this program and an unstated desire to subvert the poors legal rights The 260 million bill to be taken up by the House tomorrow would keep the corporation alive for at least two years while imposing new restrictions on the activities of lawyers in the program The new rules would increase control over local programs by the corporations 11member board which Mr Reagan can replace completely next month Existing restrictions on the use of classaction suits representation of known illegal aliens women seeking abortions and persons seeking to legalize homosexuality among others would be retained or tightened
BAKER ENDS EFFORT TO BAR SOCIAL ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/18/us/baker-ends-effort-to-bar-social-issues.html,Howard H Baker Jr the Senate majority leader conceded today that he could no longer hold off the intrusion of such social issues as abortion and school busing into the midst of debates on the budget The dam is breaking on this stuff and he admitted as much to the members at yesterdays policy luncheon a Senate Republican said of Mr Bakers fivemonth policy of trying to put off debate on emotional social issues until budget matters were settled Senator Baker had proposed separate fullscale debate of these issues later in the session but tighter restrictions on Federal spending for abortions were approved last month in an amendment suddenly brought into an appropriations debate against his wishes In similar fashion the Senate is now involved in extended debate being used as a tactic by opponents of a ban on the Justice Departments participation in cases of busing for school desegregation which was introduced as an amendment yesterday to the Justice Departments appropriations bill Itll go on for a while Senator Baker said this morning with a tolerant shrug toward the busing debate He said he had no plan yet to seek a cloture vote to cut off the openended speechmaking of the chief opponent of the ban Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut A Break in the Speechmaking Mr Weicker yielded to the leadership temporarily for the conduct of some routine business but protected his right to resume his oratory against the Justice Department ban On the crucial question of whether this stand might interfere with President Reagans economic package Senator Baker said he thought the budget bill would be moved on schedule next week I had once thought it was possible to get through our routine and regular authorizing and appropriating process without these amendments but I have to tell you that I was wrong Senator Baker told the chamber last evening As Senator Weicker continued his resistance to the ban on the Justice Departments participation in school busing cases other senators prepared to raise additional substantive issues as amendments to the Justice Department appropriations bill Proposals were pending for mandatory sentences for handgun crimes for additional prison construction and for a loosening of the current strictures on criminal trial evidence seized illegally by the police This is a shabby way to proceed said David E Landau legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union as he searched out the rare liberal willing to help Senator Weicker in trying to talk the busing ban into retreat The Senates appetite for social issues was clearly whetted by the House approval last week of the ban on Justice Department busing cases The ban is considered to have enough votes in the Senate for passage and President Reagan has said he will sign it but Senator Weicker has threatened to talk indefinitely Any effort to cut him off through a cloture vote would require at least 60 votes What is perhaps the most significant bill on social issues for the conservatives was refiled this morning in somewhat modified form in both houses as the family protection bill The measure which extols the value of the family and the need for the Government to encourage and protect it covers a number of delicate issues including school prayer contraception abortion divorce homosexuality and proposed defenses of the role of women as it has been historically understood The House sponsor Representative Albert Lee Smith Jr Republican of Alabama contended that the Federal Government had been bent on the wholesale destruction of family rights The Senate sponsor Roger W Jepsen Republican of Iowa who introduced himself as a father of six children and a grandfather denied that the measure would further Federal interference in family life rather than easing it Last years chief sponsor Senator Paul Laxalt the Nevada Republican who is considered a close political ally of the President said that he had received no specific signal from the White House on the bill but that it basically reflected Mr Reagans appreciation of family life
REPUBLICANS' ELUSIVE PRIZE; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/18/us/republicans-elusive-prize-news-analysis.html,The announcement by Senator Howard H Baker Jr that he had given up efforts to keep legislation on busing abortion and other social issues off the Senate floor may imperil a prize Republicans hold dearer than President Reagans economic program attaining majority status in the nation The Tennessee Republicans earlier argument that such bills would divert the Senate from Mr Reagans agenda is clearly not a problem As majority leader Mr Bakers power to change the Senate agenda from hour to hour means for example that the busing filibuster will not obstruct the budget reconciliation bill But the decision which was more an acknowledgment of reality than a deliberate choice by Mr Baker worries strategists planning the Republicans future dominance and cheers Democrats at least on tactical grounds To both sides it is clear that recent Republican gains in the allegiance of Americans have come because of Mr Reagans stand on economic issues The new Republicans as one pollster after another emphasizes are economic conservatives but as liberal as many Democrats on social concerns Lure for New Republicans Richard B Wirthlin the Presidents pollster concludes from his polls that Republicans have now drawn even with Democrats in the number of Americans identifying with the party But the major things that attracted new Republicans he said were inflation the economic slump and to a lesser extent crime and American strength internationally The new Republicans joined up he said today despite much more liberal views on social issues than most Republicans hold Mr Wirthlin said that the partisan shift in the Republicans favor could be checked if Senate Republicans came to be seen as concentrating on social issues and taking a conservative position on them Some Democrats are surer of it Eugene Eidenberg director of the Democratic National Committee said that Mr Bakers admission of defeat and the likely repetitive debate on subjects such as abortion would dismay the country particularly new tentative Republicans He said that the debate would show that the wing of the Republican Party that this Administration is based on is the ideological wing Baker Calls Pressure Great Mr Baker interviewed in his Capitol office said that he had told Republican Senators yesterday at lunch that he would no longer urge them not to bring up these issues as riders to appropriations bills He said that though the Senators as well as President Reagan had agreed that it would be more responsible to wait until the fall for freestanding debates on the social issues the pressures on many Senators had become too great One person responsible for the pressure Paul Weyrich president of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress said he was pleased that Mr Baker had bowed to reality but that the majority leader should have never tried to block such legislation in the first place Mr Weyrich was interviewed after three Republicans  Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada Senator Roger W Jepsen of Iowa and Representative Albert Lee Smith Jr of Alabama  announced the reintroduction of the family protection bill a measure that amounts to the flagship of the conservatives legislative fleet Breakdown of Bakers Strategy The bill as Mr Jepsen said is many months away from the Senate floor but other similarly disputed issues are ahead of it In fact the Baker strategy began breaking down when the Senate took up and passed a very strong antiabortion rider to the latest supplemental appropriations bill last month A rider to the Justice Departments appropriations bill would limit the agencys role in cases involving busing to achieve school desegregation but busing may in fact be one of the less divisive of those issues In a January New York Times CBS News Poll 77 percent of the public said that they opposed courtordered busing But an April New York TimesCBS News Poll illustrated the problem Mr Wirthlin discussed The poll indicated that the respondents who had recently become Republican were at least as strongly in favor of Mr Reagans tax proposal as Republicans generally but that they were significantly more strongly proabortion than Republicans generally Patrick H Caddell head of Cambridge Survey Research a leading Democratic polling organization said that a Republican focus on issues like abortion could be perceived as a threat by the constituency the Republicans hope to have the younger suburban residents who have stayed out of the voting electorate because the issues did not seem to matter with them For a group to perceive that they are threatened he said is the greatest incentive to vote

TWIN FOUND DEFECTIVE IN WOMB REPORTED DESTROYED IN OPERATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/18/us/twin-found-defective-in-womb-reported-destroyed-in-operation.html,Doctors at Mt Sinai School of Medicine reported yesterday that they had punctured the heart of an abnormal fetus to destroy it in the womb while leaving its normal twin to survive and be born more than four months later as a healthy baby The procedure done last year was the first successful surgery of this kind in this country and the second in the world The objective doctors said today at a news conference was to give a childless 40yearold woman with fertility problems a chance to have a normal baby She had decided to have both fetuses aborted if there was no way to save the normal one alone the doctors said The abnormal fetus was killed by withdrawing about half its blood through a hollow needle inserted in its heart which then stopped beating A Difficult Operation The operation was described as extremely difficult The needle had to hit a moving target less than an inch across which was accomplished on a second attempt And there was the risk of killing both fetuses damaging the abnormal one without killing it or even killing the normal one by mistake A report in the June 18 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine said The mother desperately wanted to have the normal child but could not face the burden of caring for an abnormal child for the rest of her life The reports authors were Dr Thomas D Kerenyi clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology and Dr Usha Chitkara The decision on the procedure was left to the parents after counseling by physicians However the medical school sensitive to the ethical and possibly legal implications of case insisted that the woman go to the Supreme Court in New York City to get an opinion in advance confirming she had the right to consent to the procedure for the benefit of the normal fetus The report said that the decision to go to court was made out of an abundance of caution It was the mothers opinion the doctors said that the presence of an abnormal twin would be an unhealthy experience for the normal one Abortions are commonly done by infusing a salt solution into the fetus which dies and is expelled from the womb However the objective in this case was to avoid an abortion and it was impossible to abort only one fetus with the salt solution Survivor Now 7 Months Old The surviving infant is now more than seven months old and was described as normal and healthy Doctors said that the other fetus which had the extra chromosome characteristic of Downs syndrome would have been mentally retarded and possibly afflicted with serious physical defects Shortly after the normal birth the defective fetus was delivered as a fetus papyraceus a fragile paperthin nonliving fragment of tissues Because of her age the woman had undergone amniocentesis in the 17th week of pregnancy In this procedure small samples were taken for testing from the fluid in each of the sacs surrounding the fetuses The tests showed that both fetuses were male that one had no detectable abnormalities and that the other had the chromosome abnormality called trisomy 21 characteristic of Downs syndrome The fetuses were fraternal twins thus they did not have identical genetic endowments The original amniocentesis was done at another medical center The woman who was not named in the report at the news conference was referred to Mt Sinais division of perinatology or prenatal medicine because of the possibility of attempting to save the normal fetus At the news conference Dr Kurt Hirschhorn chairman of the medical schools pediatrics department said the prospective parents were given intensive genetic counseling to acquaint them with the risks Six Other Cases Reported Six other cases in which one fetal twin was found to have a severe abnormality have been reported in recent years Dr Kerenyi said The only known previous success with this kind of operation was reported from Sweden several years ago An abnormal fetus was destroyed by heart puncture at 24 weeks of gestation Its normal twin was born successfully but prematurely at 33 weeks With amniocentesis becoming more common particularly for older prospective mothers the detection of twins with one having a congenital abnormality is considered likely to become greater in the future Dr Kerenyi said that the proceduressuch as the one the doctors performed should be attempted only at medical centers equipped for and experienced in difficult fetal problems Although they were confident that the procedure was successful the doctors did not have proof that they had destroyed the fetus with Downs syndrome until three days later when using ultrasound scanning they observed that the normal fetus had continued to grow while the other had wasted away
KNOWING JUSTICE WHEN YOU SEE IT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/19/opinion/knowing-justice-when-you-see-it.html,Potter Stewart who will retire from the Supreme Court next month wrote a classic line though he may rue the day he did so that says much about the man and the Justice The occasion was a 1964 obscenity case that showed the Court divided many ways and vainly searching for clear guidelines It took Justice Stewart to concede that some issues simply dont yield to lofty proclamations He said he might never succeed in intelligibly defining hardcore obscenity but I know it when I see it and the motion picture involved in this case is not that Even people who wish for more philosophic breadth from a jurist have found Justice Stewart refreshingly candid and scornful of ideology His pragmatism has helped to keep him at the Courts powerful center for many of his 23 years there He will be missed at this time of sharp controversy over Court decisions and the judiciarys role in American life Justice Stewart was a dissenter from many of the Warren Courts most adventurous rulings on criminal law and political equality But he later opposed overruling those decisions if the only basis for it was a change in the Courts membership Such cavalier treatment of precedent would have exposed the Court which he revered to avoidable political attack Last falls Presidential campaign caused widespread concern for the Court as an institution The Republican platform pledged the appointment of judges who would vote right on family matters Candidate Reagan rejected that crude litmus test promising instead to find jurists who shared his general philosophy That could move the Supreme Court now right of center but near the mainstream of social thought a jarring distance On the other hand the President could nominate someone who agrees with Justice Stewart who voted with the majority in the 1973 decision striking down state antiabortion laws yet delivered the Courts opinion last year rejecting any Government obligation to fund abortions He may nominate someone who like Justice Stewart thinks Congress has carried affirmative action too far But in any case we would also hope for a candidate who could write what Justice Stewart wrote in a 1968 ruling against private discrimination in housing At the very least the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the 13th Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy the right to live wherever a white man can live If Congress cannot say that being a free man means this much then the 13th Amendment made a promise the Nation cannot keep A jurist in short who knows a constitutional right when he or she sees it
STEWART WILL QUIT HIGH COURT JULY 3; REASONS NOT GIVEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/19/us/stewart-will-quit-high-court-july-3-reasons-not-given.html,Associate Justice Potter Stewart announced today that he would retire July 3 after 23 years on the Supreme Court and the Reagan Administration moved to fill the vacancy before the end of the summer The unexpected retirement of Justice Stewart who has often been a swing vote between ideological camps created the first High Court opening since 1975 as Justice Stewart has seen himself as a lawyer rather than a philosopher focusing on fact and precedent instead of theory News analysis page A14 well as an opportunity for President Reagan to appoint a conservative as he is expected to do High Priority to Campaign Vow In the Presidential campaign last year Mr Reagan also said he would name a woman to fill among the first Supreme Court vacancies in my Administration Today a senior White House aide said that Mr Reagan would place high priority on fulfilling that commitment with this appointment but he cautioned that the pledge doesnt guarantee that a woman would be found Justice Stewart who is 66 years old and is apparently in good health gave no reason for his retirement He disclosed that he informed Mr Reagan of his intentions last May 18 at a meeting at the Oval Office of the White House but waited until today to inform his own startled clerks and fellow Justices Preparation for Appointments The onemonth advance notification to the White House was evidently aimed at giving Mr Reagan more time to assemble a list of prospective nominees Presidential aides said that both Attorney General William French Smith and Fred Fielding the White House counsel had already compiled some names but not yet forwarded them to Mr Reagan The President asked about the vacancy while making a tour of offices in the Old Executive Office Building said We have been for quite some time just basically preparing for any future appointments and there will be an announcement shortly Among the names mentioned by among Republicans as possible candidates were Carla Hills Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Ford and Elizabeth H Dole assistant to the President for public liaison the wife of Senator Bob Dole the Kansas Republican Today Larry Speakes the deputy White House press secretary said that Mr Reagan would nominate someone who shared with the President one key view the role of the courts is to interpret the law not to enact new law by judicial fiat A White House aide said that with this statement the President was clearly referring to the conservative view that the Court had gone too far in ordering school busing and expanding the rights of criminal defendants and in the area of statutory construction which refers to Court decisions on what was intended by certain laws and regulations Mr Reagan has been highly critical of recent Supreme Court decisions At a news conference early last year he said that the public had seen the Supreme Court override public opinion on such issues as school prayer school desegregation and the treatment of criminals Each time he said Our great respect for the Court shielded those Justices who put themselves above the law Lyn Nofziger Mr Reagans liaison to conservative political groups said today that he would recommend the selection of Joan Dempsey Klein a Superior Court judge in Los Angeles County and a former member of the California Council on Criminal Justice Judge Klein was associated with various criminal justice groups organized by Edwin Meese 3d the White House counselor who once served as a criminal justice adviser to Mr Reagan when he was California Governor Although Mr Reagan utilized county and statewide panels to screen judicial candidates when he was Governor Presidential aides said that no special screening panel would be created for the filling of the Stewart vacancy Instead members of an informal working group that has been meeting weekly on various judicial selections were seen as likely to be the group screening names for Mr Reagan Key Members of Group The key members of this group are Attorney General Smith Mr Fielding Edward C Schmultz the Deputy Attorney General and Mr Reagans three top aides at the White House  Mr Meese James A Baker 3d and Michael K Deaver Despite the White House emphasis on putting together a list of what one Reagan aide said would be the best qualified people from all across the country it was considered certain that Mr Reagan would strongly consider picking someone from his own team Among the Reagan Administration members likely to be considered were Mr Smith Mr Meese and William P Clark the Deputy Secretary of State whom Mr Reagan once named to the California Supreme Court Some Republicans were already said to be pushing for consideration for Judge Cornelia Kennedy a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati who was originally appointed a Federal judge by President Nixon in 1970 No SingleIssue Test At the White House Mr Speakes reiterated that Mr Reagan would not seek to impose any singleissue test on a candidate In the campaign Mr Reagan refused to be bound by a plank in the Republican Party platform interpreted by some to be an assertion that it required all judicial appointees to oppose abortion Mr Speakes said that Mr Reagan will not seek only candidates who necessarily agree on every position White House officials who had been looking informally at names of possible appointees were doing so more intensively this afternoon One aide said Mr Reagans choice was unlikely to be announced at least for a week but he said the aim would be to have someone confirmed in time for the beginning of the Courts term in October As a practical matter he said this meant submitting the name for the approval of the Senate before the summer recess which is due to begin Aug 1 In his resignation letter to Mr Reagan Justice Stewart noted that he had served 27 years as a member of the Federal judiciary the last 23 on the High Court And now that it is time to go he said I leave with the hope that the Supreme Court will be in good and wise hands as it works in the years ahead to preserve and protect the constitutional structure of our republic Outstanding Service Cited Mr Reagan accepted the resignation with the deepest regret and appreciation for your long and outstanding service to our nation He went on to praise the Justice for his special grace and lucidity and said Your opinions have reflected concern for striking appropriate balances between Federal and state authority between individual freedoms and the legitimate interests of community and government and between preservation of our timeless values and the need to allow for reform and change Supreme Court Justices have lifelong appointments and usually retire for reasons of health Justice Stewart was planning to discuss his reasons for retiring at a news conference tomorrow Today he made clear only that after retiring he would maintain an office at the Supreme Court and might sit as a senior judge on Federal courts of appeal around the country riding circuit as this practice is called But I cannot look forward to serving ever again with you he said in a letter to his eight fellow Justices This is not the time to try to say what these years as a member of the Court have meant to me he said Probably you know Let me only thank each one of you for our friendships and help Assets of at Least 1 Million According to a financial disclosure statement last month Justice Stewart owns assets worth at least 1 million much of it in family trusts of which he is the beneficiary Justice Stewart was born in Jackson Mich on Jan 23 1915 and was reared in Cincinnati where his father served for nine years as Mayor His father later was a judge on the Ohio Supreme Court Justice Stewart graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville Conn in 1933 from Yale College where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1937 and from Yale Law School in 1941 After wartime service in the Navy he returned to Cincinnati to practice law and enter local Republican politics He was elected to the City Council and spent two years as Vice Mayor before President Eisenhower named him in 1954 to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit In 1958 President Eisenhower named him to the Supreme Court vacancy created by the retirement of Associate Justice Harold H Burton After Chief Justice Earl Warren retired in 1969 there was speculation that President Nixon might name Justice Stewart to be Chief Justice But Justice Stewart asked the President not to consider him for the job The last vacancy on the Supreme Court was created by the resignation of the late William O Douglas in 1975 President Ford filled that vacancy with Justice John Paul Stevens President Carter thus was not given the opportunity to make any Supreme Court appointments
THE OUTLOOK OF FEMMINISM DEBATED BY VASAR PANELS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/19/style/the-outlook-of-femminism-debated-by-vasar-panels.html,Feminism the cultural patterns that perpetuated male dominance the irrelevance of much of the current womens movement to women in minority groups and the dangers of a return to the antifeminism of the 1920s and 30s were among the themes dominating the Fifth Berkshire Conference on the History of Women which ended here today The threeday meeting with 136 panels and workshops on womens history since medieval times was sponsored by Vassar College and drew almost 1500 historians teachers librarians psychologists sociologists and anthropologists from the United States Canada and Europe A warning that conservative forces have captured the power to fulfill our gloomiest predictions was voiced by Joan W Scott professor of history at Brown University in her keynote address She said the Surgeon Generaldesignate Dr C Everett Koop was a foe of abortion that the Attorney Generals office was being staffed with assistants whose careers have been dedicated to the abolition of affirmative action and that the only highranking woman in the Administration gives no cause for celebration Jeane Kirkpatrick is not someone I want to represent feminine accomplishment she said speaking of the chief delegate to the United Nations Citing examples of women in academic fields Professor Scott observed that although there was little reason for optimism about what had been gained in the 1970s the situation today was even less hopeful The circumstances of the 1980s bring to mind the 1920s and 30s she said Then after the triumph of winning the vote women faced a wellorganized antifeminist movement which struck at the cultural and political bases of female solidarity Participants in a panel on The Subordinate Role agreed that women neither accepted nor rejected it but rather created strategies of survival and liberation somewhere between subordination and rebellion Bonnie S Anderson of Brooklyn College the chairman pointed out too the panelists unanimous belief that women attempting to emerge from traditional subordinate roles found cultural restraints even more burdensome than economic limitations Kathleen Stassen Berger reported that five studies of more than 600 highachieving women had found that a supporting network was of more assistance than education and paid employment in helping women realize their potential Fathers who encouraged autonomous development were found to be more influential in their daughters lives than were mothers Elder siblings were important by their absence A disproportionate number of the women surveyed were firstborns and of those who had elder siblings they were more likely to be elder sisters than big brothers I suspect that big brothers themselves slow down the independence of the little sister as they denigrate her accomplishments and protect her from the outside world said Professor Berger of Bronx Community College of the City University of New York She mentioned as well the prevalence in the lives of the women studied of a relationship with a mentor usually a man and the lack of husbands and children Gerda Lerner professor of history at the University of Wisconsin at Madison was one of the star attractions at the most widely attended panel More than 500 people heard the new president of the Organization of American Historians outline A General Theory of Women in History The hourlong talk a condensation of a book in progress advanced the thesis that the oppression of women was the model for the invention of slavery The oppression of women antedates slavery and made it possible she said The difference in the aspirations of the womens movement as it is perceived and those of women in minority groups was outlined by Marquita L James Eleanor Smith and Shirlene Soto in a panel entitled Toward Sisterhood Problems and Goals The womens movement seems to be too white too middle class too much a reflection of the larger society It embraces stererotypes about minority women too readily said Professor Soto who is in the history department at the California Polytechnic State University She said To the chicana it makes little difference if she is unemployed because she is a woman or because she is chicana Black women believe they are oppressed not by black men but by white society said Professor James of Nassau Community College in Garden City LI Black women are almost unanimous in their insistence that their own liberation depends on the liberation of their race and the improvements of the life of the black community White feminists must immediately begin to recognize that black women are foremost victims of oppression in this country because of their color not their sex Professor Smith of the University of Cincinnati offered suggestions to further mutual respect and reciprocal support White women should examine their roles in contributing to a racist society she said black women should take greater strides against allowing others to speak for them and nonwhite women should cease trying to be white and become politically conscious of their plight as a minority and accept themselves historically and culturally Feminist perspectives on womens higher education were discussed by Florence Howe of the State University of New York Old Westbury LI Elizabeth A Daniels and Barbara J Page of Vassar Laurel Furumoto of Wellesley and Grace Haddad of Lake Erie College in Painsville Ohio Outlining conclusions based on studies of Stanford and Wellesley Professor Howe said that higher education still resides in a universe in which maleness and femaleness are ranked and in which womens colleges continue to be seen as not mainstream without the power to effect change Sandi Cooper president of the conference was chairman of Government Surveillance and the Control of Women one of the most discussed panels of the conference Among the participants were Blanche Wiesen Cook of John Jay College who spoke on The Repression and Resistance of Women in America from the FBI to the Moral Majority and Amy Swerdlow of Sarah Lawrence College who discussed the 1962 confrontation between the Womens Strike for Peace and the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities Bettina Aptheker of the University of California at Santa Cruz told of her own experiences of surveillance imprisonment beatings and rape as a political activist during the 1960s Other panels included papers by Elizabeth Pleck of the Wellesley College Center for Research on Women on how life in the United States challenged the patriarchal authority of the Old World family and by Diana Grossman Kahn a clinical psychologist at the Bunting Insitute Radcliffe College who raised the possibility that some womens aspirations were related to their mothers lost ambitions
"STEWART: A LAWYER, NOT A PHILOSOPHER; News Analysis",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/19/us/stewart-a-lawyer-not-a-philosopher-news-analysis.html,In his 23 years on the Supreme Court Potter Stewart has been a lawyer rather than a philosopher Throughout the Courts history some Justices have used the Court as a platform from which to shape doctrine and take American law in new directions Potter Stewart has not been such a Justice Intelligent somewhat patrician instinctively conservative he has taken his job to be that of deciding cases rather than pronouncing theory As a result Justice Stewart has often been a swing vote on the Court open to persuasion reaching decisions on the basis of the facts and the precedents rather than on how the case fits into an overall vision of where the Court should be going Whether as a cause or a result of that approach Justice Stewart has been neither a predictable member of any ideological camp on the Court nor a leader in his own right Should President Reagan replace him with a doctrinaire conservative interested in shaping the direction of the Court Justice Stewarts departure could lead to an ideological shift on a Court that has existed in a delicate political balance for a decade An Apt Phrasemaker If Justice Stewarts opinions for the Court do not fit into neat categories there have been a number of important ones The Justice a former chairman of The Yale Daily News who once considered journalism as a career is an apt phrasemaker with a flair for capturing the essence of a murky legal problem in a few words The dichotomy between personal liberties and property rights is a false one he wrote in a 1972 opinion Lynch v Household Finance that broadened the meaning of an important civil rights law Justice Stewart concluded Property does not have rights People have rights Justice Stewarts concurring opinion in Furman v Georgia the 1972 case that invalidated many state death penalties provided the epigram by which the nine separate opinions in the case totaling 230 pages were remembered I simply conclude he wrote that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments cannot tolerate the inflicting of a sentence of death under legal systems that permit this unique penalty to be so wantonly and so freakishly imposed HardCore Pornography Opinion Perhaps his bestknown phrase came in a concurring opinion in Jacobellis v Ohio a 1963 case that overturned the conviction of a movie theater manager for exhibiting a film that the state said was obscene Prosecutions for obscenity he said must be limited to hardcore pornography He concluded I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so But I know it when I see it and the motion picture involved in this case is not that It was in the First Amendment area that Justice Stewart did develop a new doctrine one that earned him a reputation as a special protector on the Court of the interests of the press Explicit Protection of Press Justice Stewart believes that the framers of the Constitution by guaranteeing both freedom of speech and of the press intended to give explicit protection to the press as an institution So far as the Constitution goes he said in a 1974 speech at the Yale Law School his alma mater the autonomous press may publish what it knows and may seek to learn what it can But while the press is free to publish virtually anything Justice Stewart said there is no constitutional guarantee of access to governmental information The Constitution itself he said is neither a Freedom of Information Act nor an Official Secrets Act His press opinions reflected this view Justice Stewart joined the majority that upheld the right of the press to publish the Pentagon Papers and he wrote the majority opinion in a 1979 case Gannett v DePasquel holding that the press was not entitled to access to closed pretrial proceedings He does not regard the Court as the proper forum for threshing out difficult social issues He wrote in Dandridge v Williams in 1970 that the Court should not intervene in the area of economic and social welfare saying The intractable economic social and even philosophical problems presented by public welfare assistance programs are not the business of this Court Stands in Abortion Cases Justice Stewart wrote the opinion for Court last year in the Medicaid abortion case in which the Court ruled 5 to 4 that Congress has no constitutional obligation to pay for abortions for poor women He had joined the majority in Roe v Wade the 1973 case that established a womans constitutional right to have an abortion However he wrote last year It simply does not follow that a womans freedom of choice carries with it a constitutional entitlement to the financial resources to avail herself of the full range of protected choices Justice Stewart wrote some important civil rights opinions including Jones v Alfred H Mayer Company which held that a law of the Civil War could be used to ban racial discrimination in housing However he parted company with civil rights advocates on the question of special preferences for members of minorities dissenting last year from the decision that upheld setting aside for minority contractors 10 percent of the funds for Federal construction programs There are those who think that we need a new Constitution Justice stewart said and their views may someday prevail But under the Constitution we have one practice in which government may never engage is the practice of racism not even temporarily and not even as an experiment 
SENATE HEARINGS ON ABORTION CLOSE ON EMOTIONAL NOTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/19/us/senate-hearings-on-abortion-close-on-emotional-note.html,Senate hearings on a bill designed to ban abortion ended today on an emotional pitch with a wide range of medical and religious groups calling the measure unconstitutional scientifically unsound and potentially damaging to the health of American women However supporters of the measure such as Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois who is sponsoring the bill with Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina said there was nothing wrong with a little Congressional activism to overturn a 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion Mr Hyde called abortion a sort of humane holocaust of the unborn and said that such endangered animals as the snail darter the white whale and the dolphin were given more protection under present law than unborn children A blade of grass has more protection under our law Mr Hyde said in a packed chamber on the final day of hearings of the Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on the Separation of Powers whose chairman Senator John P East is a strong opponent of abortion Could Come to Floor in Autumn Mr East a North Carolina Republican said that the fivemember panel would put the bill into final form in midJuly If approved by the panel and the full Judiciary Committee the bill could reach the Senate floor in late autumn Senate aides said Since yesterday opponents of abortion have been buoyed by the decision of Senator Howard H Baker Jr the majority leader to give up efforts to keep controversial social issues such as abortion off the Senate agenda during the debate on the budget Those who consider it a womans right to choose an abortion had hoped the issue would be kept off the Senate floor indefinitely The HelmsHyde bill declares that human life shall be deemed to exist from conception thus allowing the states if they choose to prosecute abortion as murder Opponents of the measure say it would make illegal such birthcontrol methods as the intrauterine device and the pill which are believed to act after conception but Mr Hyde said today that it was not his intent to ban these contraceptives Sarah Weddington former assistant to President Carter a lawyer who argued the 1973 Supreme Court case that legalized abortion served as key witness on behalf of 75 national organizations with 34 million members opposing the bill She Says They Wont Be Reduced Miss Weddington said that reversing the Supreme Court ruling was unconstitutional and that any attempt to ban abortion will not reduce the number of abortions because you will not have eliminated the reasons that women feel compelled to seek abortions Speaking in a quavering voice Miss Weddington said You have not heard from the family of the 11yearold girl in Nebraska who became pregnant and had to have an abortion last month but who might not have had that choice if this bill were law You have not heard from the Virginia mother who is watching her child die an agonizing death from TaySachs disease who is pregnant again and who if this bill were law would face the possibility of condemning another infant to the same torture Testifying on the other side of the issue Dr Carolyn F Gerster a physician in Scottsdale Ariz and former president of the National Right to Life Committee broke into tears when recalling her own miscarriage and realization that the fetus was male The statement that life begins at conception is not a religious dogma but a biological fact said Dr Gerster If one is prepared to give the woman the unrestricted right to kill her unborn daughter she added one had better be prepared to some day give the daughter the unrestricted right to kill the aged mother Euthanasia has followed abortion as the night follows the day Physicians Oppose the Bill Strong opposition to the bill was voiced by representatives of the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association The practical effects of the proposed legislation are staggering said Dr Joseph F Boyle chairman of the medical associations board of trustees Under the bill the physician would be responsible for the welfare of every fetus whose legal and health interest would in the eyes of the law be equal to but may be in conflict with those of the woman He added that it was not correct to assume that life begins at conception as the bill states Dr Naomo Goldstein clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the New York University Medical School representing the psychiatric association said children of unwanted pregnancies were often at high risk for abuse neglect mental illness and deprivation and that in the absence of legal abortion women who are pregnant but do not want a baby suffer higher rates of death from suicide and medical complications of selfinduced and medically incompetently performed abortions Judy Collins Reads Letters Others appearing before the panel included the singer Judy Collins who read letters from parents of children suffering from severe genetic defects and from women who underwent abortions after detecting that their fetuses were gentically damaged The detection technique called amniocentesis would be barred under the bill Appearing in support of the bill were Mary Meehan who identified herself as a Washington

TEEN-AGE SEXUALITY AND INVOLVEMENT OF THE FAMILY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/20/style/teen-age-sexuality-and-involvement-of-the-family.html,Professionals concerned about changing Federal directions in the area of teenage pregnancies and the possible mandating of family involvement and consent in sex education contraception and abortion were told yesterday by a Reagan Administration official that the Administration would carry out its stated policy decisions in a consistent manner Some here may not like it but its a fact of life and it is best that we recognize it said Marjory Mecklenburg director of the Department of Health and Human Services adolescent pregnancy programs Mrs Mecklenburg cofounder of the antiabortion American Citizens Concerned for Life spoke to 75 professionals who had gathered for a symposium on Preventing Adolescent Pregnancy The Role of the Family The oneday meeting sponsored by the Center for Population and Family Health of the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University was attended by representatives from organizations as diverse as the Salvation Army the Child Welfare League the Greater New York Fund the Vincent Astor Rockefeller and Ford Foundations the Planned Parenthood Federation the Urban League the Christian Church and city state and Federal agencies A report of the findings and suggestions will be circulated later Noting that the Administration was dedicated to having families involved in and consulted on adolescent contraception she asserted that the days are over for using important Federal funds for programs whose efficacy was uncertain We will ask hard fiscal questions as well as hard human questions about what happens to these young women she said However she continued I find it hard not to be encouraged being in this audience that we will work together regardless of some differences we have Frank F Furstenberg professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania noted that teenage sexuality and childbearing were not unprecedented Citing the immediate postWorld War II period he said that about a quarter of all first births involved white teenagers then and that half of all first births to black adolescents were premaritally conceived In short sexual activity was successfully covered up by early marriage illegal abortion and discreet placements for adoption interestingly enough the very same techniques which are proposed in some quarters for dealing with the issue today he said Thus the family was only slightly more effective in regulating sexual standards than it is today He acknowledged that many early programs for adolescents were designed to minimize family involvement Some did so deliberately out of an ideological commitment to the teenagers right of privacy he said Other program services were directed to individuals with little regard for the social context in which those individuals operated There are winds of change he went on not only on the political front but also among family planners who are doing some soulsearching One of the most damaging misconceptions circulating among Federal legislators particularly those of conservative persuasion is that most family planners are currently opposed to family participation in their programs he said But no standardized procedure for involving the family is likely to have much effect he said adding It is far more sensible to build into proposed legislation more flexibility rather than mandate programs not yet tested for effectiveness Other speakers noted that there was an absence of data on the percentage of parents who wanted to become involved and the percentage who would want to undertake the sole responsibility for sexual education Carol Bellamy who gave the keynote address said that 4 of every 10 girls in the United States would become pregnant as teenagers and that 33000 girls under the age of 19 became pregnant in New York City last year Regardless of our personal moral beliefs teenage sexuality with all its dangers is here to stay she said Teenagers need honest answers and meaningful support They dont need lectures from Washington The plain fact is that parental consent will rob many teenagers of their rights force them to tell their parents and they wont seek help she said They will continue to have sex but with the blind hope that pregnancy can be avoided Jeannie Rosoff president of the Alan Guttmacher Institute had the last word Why dont we teach the boys not to ask as well as the girls to say no she inquired
WHEN A NOVELIST CHOOSES TO WRITE ABOUT THE ISSUE OF ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/20/opinion/l-when-a-novelist-chooses-to-write-about-the-issue-of-abortion-174282.html,To the Editor It was with a mixture of astonishment and regret that I read A View of Abortion With Something to Offend Everybody by Walker Percy a novelist whom I greatly respect OpEd June 8 v hat astonished me most was that in his account of the abortion issue Mr Percy never once mentions the other important character in the abortion drama  the mother He writes as if conception gestation and birth take place on an abstract plane totally divorced from the complexities and subtleties of human society This kind of reductive description is perhaps typical of a scientist but certainly not of a novelist whom we rightfully expect to be conversant with the ambiguities of moral dilemma Surely a novelist of Mr Percys prodigious talents must realize that the abortion issue is more than a simple question of biology GARY KRIST New YorkJune 81981

"WEICKER WINS FIRST ROUND, STALLING DRIVE TO BAN BUSING",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/20/us/weicker-wins-first-round-stalling-drive-to-ban-busing.html,Amid a contorted procedural fight over school busing the Senate today defeated 45 to 30 a brief but stark proposal that neither the courts nor the Justice Department be limited in enforcing the Constitution of the United States The proposal a simple endorsement of the Constitution worded to be as irresistible as a statement of support for motherhood was offered in a spirit of irony as much as argumentation by Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut It was part of his long campaign to block the expected final passage of a ban on school busing suits by the Justice Department Here it is Friday and they still havent passed a busing ban that everyone said would whistle through here last Monday Senator Weicker said after a successful week of holding off the apparent majority favoring the busing ban and its chief spokesman Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina When Senator Weicker waving a copy of the Constitution sought to amend Mr Helmss busing ban with his endorsement of the Constitution Senator Helms waving his own copy of the Constitution argued that the Weicker tactic would gut the busing ban I Aint Gonna Hurt You The little fish is in the hand Senator Helms declared depicting a slippery creature in his hands And here you say Hold still little fish I aint gonna hurt you Im just gonna gut you  The week ended with Senator Helms frustrated in getting the busing ban through but hardly defeated as he maneuvered late today amid the Senate rules for a fresh assault next week Mr Weicker promised to be ready with more long speeches and delaying tactics The scene presented a variation of the civil rights fights of the 1960s with an isolated Northern liberal this time resorting to openended lastditch oratory to hold off the strong conservative tide to cut back on busing The Helms ban which would bar the Justice Department from cases involving any sort of action directly or indirectly touching busing was approved easily by the House and President Reagan is expected to sign the legislation if it passes the Senate Blocking the Ban This is only the first barrier Senator Weicker said in an interview There will be a series of barriers He has been willing to yield temporarily to other noncontroversial bills counting them as profitable delay While some Senate workers are surprised that it was Senator Weicker who resorted to filibusterlike tactics others note that he sometimes has shown the profile of a modulated maverick in dealing with his own party and the Senate majority Theyre using up a lot of energy and time and theres no Helms amendment passed yet he said with satisfaction On Tuesday when he first took the floor for three hours of nonstop speechmaking he had little help from either side of the aisle I think Im getting help now he said today At first they were all busy with the budget issue but now theyre starting to listen Concern for Constitution Senator Weickers basic argument in the fight has been that with school prayer abortion and other emotional issues still to come in similar debates the truly big issue of this Congress isnt something like busing but the Constitution itself The Helms proposal is before the Senate not as a separate bill but as an amendment to an appropriations bill for the Department of Justice Howard H Baker Jr the Senate majority leader had cautioned his fellow Republicans against such a sidedoor treatment of major social issues and he could only smile in exasperation this afternoon as the Senate experienced a gridlock of stratagems with even a motion to recess being eyed suspiciously by rivals in the busing issue Mr Weickers proposal was an amendment to Mr Helmss amendment and when the Connecticut Senators attempt failed Senator Helms quickly offered to amend his amendment thereby blocking others from using the same tactic The Senate ground to a halt A clot of parliamentary advisers visited with Senator Baker and Senator J Bennett Johnston a Louisiana Democrat wanted to outdo Senator Helms with an even stronger busing ban I recognize I probably wont be recognized Senator Johnston said summarizing a confusion clear to all the visiting tourists and constituents in the gallery The outcome was that Senator Helms refused to yield to Senator Bakers compromise and so when the busing fight is renewed next week Senator Helms will have an extra bargaining chip Its been rather fluid out here Senator Weicker told the chamber I think its getting a little too fluid
INDIA'S PROPER MOVE TO LIMIT BIRTHS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/20/opinion/l-india-s-proper-move-to-limit-births-174288.html,To the Editor In a June 8 letter Jeff Grant of Somerset County Right to Life characterized as barbarism the recent calls by Prime Minister Idira Gandhi and industrialist JRD Tata for the strengthening of Indias family welfare program He advises that the United States steer clear of it Mr Grants moral judgment is based on three false premises He thinks that Indias birth limitation program is inherently coercive because peasants are too poor to resist cash incentives to participate The fact is that cash is given only to those who undergo sterilization as compensation for travel expenses and loss of earnings A large cash incentive may be a debatable issue but the proposed compensation increase to 25 from the current 10 to 15 is surely not a coercive measure Mr Grant thinks that abortion has become a widespread means of population control under Mrs Gandhi The fact is that in 197879 the latest year for which figures are available about 300000 abortions were performed under the family welfare program This contrasts with the 1966 findings by a Government appointed committee that then the annual number of illegal abortions  almost all performed by nonprofessionals  were four to six million According to Mr Grant the USAID funding of population control and other programs in India a large sum even by US standards is vast by Indian standards The fact is that there has been no USAID funding of population programs in India during the last several years In August of 1980 USAID agreed to provide 40 million for a fiveyear Integrated Rural Health and Population Project This contribution is about 23 percent of the total expenditure India expects the program to cost 174 billion The 1981 census has revealed that Indias 2475 percent population growth in the past decade was virtually identical to that in the previous decade 2480 percent The Governments family welfare program cannot solve all of Indias population and development problems but it needs to be strengthened not only to reduce the population growth rate but also to provide the facilities to all women and men to realize their own reproductive rights MONI NAG Senior Associate The Population Council New York June 9 1981
BUDGET AS BECOMES A TOOL OF SOCIAL CHANGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/21/weekinreview/budget-as-becomes-a-tool-of-social-change.html,In recent months the White House has inundated Congress with numbers  budget cuts tax rates spending ceilings But while the battle cry has been Control the Federal budget a growing number of lawmakers in both parties now believe the real purpose of the Administrations campaign is to enact a second agenda that goes far beyond mere figures The real struggle in this town and around the country is one of political philosophy maintains Senator Gary Hart Democrat of Colorado They dont just want to cut the budget they want fundamental changes in the role of Government And the President has been very straightforward about what hes up to no one should be surprised Were so used to changes of 5 or 10 degrees around here that when someone says hell change things 90 or 100 degrees we dont take it seriously To some the Presidents intention  to remove decisionmaking from the Federal level and center it in local communities  is a welcome return to the Jeffersonian ideal of smaller more efficient less intervening Government in the words of Representative Phil Gramm of Texas who has been the White Houses strongest Democratic ally in the House To others the Reagan ideology represents a wholesale attack on the principle that government has the right and the responsibility to care for the needy and improve the general welfare House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr put it this way last week Its the first time that a handful of American people  wealthy in fact extremely conservative  think they can change the policies of this country The real struggle is being fought on many fronts Last week the most significant involved the proposals to transfer large blocks of Federal money to state governments for them to set specific spending priorities within general categories such as education and health The stated purpose of such block grants is not just to improve efficiency but to further conservative ideals Conservatism Close to the People No doubt said Representative Gramm the conservative philosophy gets stronger as government gets closer to the people White House support for the idea was reemphasized Friday with a proposal for a new package of budget cuts that contained sweeping block grant language The block grant strategy flows partly from a deeplyheld Republican belief that Washington contains a powerful network of liberal power centers  lobbyists and bureaucrats Congressional staff members and national news reporters Dispersing decisionmaking responsibility to the states goes the argument would undermine such forces and thus change the basic priorities of government Representative Silvio O Conte of Massachusetts the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee said that Mr Reagan discussed this very issue with Republican leaders at breakfast 10 days ago As the lawmaker recalled the Presidents words Its far easier for people to come to Washington to get their social programs It would be a hell of a lot tougher if we diffuse them and send them out to the states All their friends and connections are in Washington A related issue surfaced last week when the House passed a bill retaining the legal services program as a separate entity rejecting a Reagan plan to fold its funding into a block grant Over the years legal services lawyers have represented their poor clients by organizing support for expanded social welfare programs and bringing class action suits that often broadened their eligibility standards Unraveling the Liberal Network As the floor debate showed this has outraged conservatives who see legal services as the heart of the liberal network they are trying to unravel A typical comment was that of Representative F James Sensenbrenner Jr Republican of Wisconsin as he argued for an amendment that banned legal services from bringing class action suits against government agencies The amendment was necessary Mr Sensenbrenner said to halt the indirect raid on the Federal treasury conducted by lawyers bringing such suits Representative Barney Frank Democrat of Massachusetts countered that the block grant proposals made the assault on legal services doubly serious Without legal service lawyers monitoring state decisions on how they spend their block grant money he said there would be no guarantees that the funds would find their way to the poor The third item on the second agenda is an attack on the power of the executive and the courts to decide issues such as school prayer Last week Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut filbustered through the week against a plan apparently favored by the majority to bar the Justice Department from pursuing school desegregation cases that might result in busing orders Senator John P East Republican of North Carolina concluded hearings on legislation that would allow states to ban abortions by stating that life begins at conception The rejection of the courts past role was highlighted by President Reagans comment that his choice for a successor to retiring Associate Justice Potter Stewart would be dedicated to the ideas of interpeting law not enacting new law by judicial fiat The fourth item on the agenda is a tax bill that provides large cuts and large deficits over a threeyear period Representative Jim Wright House majority leader charges that the real purpose behind this bill is to put pressure on Congress to destroy additional social programs Asked about these charges Representative Barber B Conable ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee said There is something to that There will be pressure on Congress not to give on the budget cuts if the third year is in place The President talks about that too Partisan and ideological wrangling pervade Capitol Hill Many members would prefer to be somewhere in the middle Theres a basic philosophical difference between the two parties said Representative James Blanchard Democrat of Michigan Theyre talking about Herbert Hoover were talking about FDR And were both wrong
Ideas & Trends in Summary; DCOTORS ABORT ONE OF TWIN FETUSES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/21/weekinreview/ideas-trends-in-summary-dcotors-abort-one-of-twin-fetuses.html,Medical techniques that detect a genetic defect of a fetus in the womb sometimes present parents with a difficult decision abort or carry the abnormal fetus to term But if such a choice is the stuff of which moral philosophy is made it can also be the stuff of which medical feats are fashioned Learning that one of the twin fetuses she had carried for 17 weeks would be born mentally retarded and possibly with serious physical abnormalities a 40yearold woman last year wanted to abort only that fetus In a procedure reported in last weeks New England Journal of Medicine doctors at Mt Sinai School of Medicine in New York were able to puncture the fetuss heart and kill it by withdrawing about half its blood through a hollow needle The surviving infant is now more than seven months old and was described as normal and healthy The operation required doctors to catch a moving target less than an inch across with the risk of killing both fetuses killing the normal fetus by mistake or damaging without killing the abnormal fetus The procedure was successfully performed only once before in Sweden several years ago But the mother said the report desperately wanted to have the normal child and could not face the burden of caring for an abnormal child for the rest of her life She said she would abort both fetuses if there was no way to save the normal one alone Out of an abundance of caution and sensitivity to the ramifications of the case the report stated the medical school insisted that the mother first get an opinion from the Supreme Court in New York City confirming her right to consent to the procedure on behalf of the normal fetus
SOVIET AFFIRMS RISE IN INFANT MORTALITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/21/world/soviet-affirms-rise-in-infant-mortality.html,A Soviet statistician has acknowledged that infant mortality rates last published here in 1974 and considered one of the barometers of a societys wellbeing have remained high since an upward turn 10 years ago Aleksandr I Smirnov deputy chief of the department dealing with statistics of social problems and population in Gosplan the State Planning Commission said the annual number of Soviet babies dying before the end of their first year had been about 28 per 1000 since 1978 The Soviet infant mortality rate reached a low of 229 per 1000 in 1971 then rose quickly to 279 in 1974 Thereafter such rates were omitted from Soviet statistical reports apparently to conceal the high figures The United States rate by contrast has been steadily declining and is now about 13 or 14 deaths per 1000 births Speaking at a recent news conference and in a subsequent telephone interview Mr Smirnov said that Soviet demographers had found no evidence to suggest that the high rate of Soviet infant deaths was caused by medical family or social factors He attributed it to improved statistical reporting especially in areas of Central Asia State Promoting Larger Families At the news conference Mr Smirnov also touched on Soviet concern over a lagging and geographically varied birth rate and outlined a series of new Government programs designed he said to inspire larger families especially in the western and northern areas of the country The Soviet birth rate stands at 183 a year per 1000 people compared with 157 in the United States The trend in Soviet baby deaths was documented in a United States Commerce Department study Rising Infant Mortality in the USSR in the 1970s by Christopher Davis and Murray Feshbach who used Soviet figures through 1974 and then resorted to estimates By 1976 the study said 311 out of 1000 Soviet infants were not reaching their first birthday Although Mr Smirnovs data contradict the American studys contention that the rate continued to rise after 1974 the figure he cited still substantially exceeds that of most Western developed countries In their study Mr Feshbach and Mr Davis said Soviet explanations that the higher mortality rate reflected better statistical reporting were unconvincing Alcoholism May Be a Factor They contended that the reported rise in infant mortality up to 1974 had not been confined to Central Asia the region where Mr Smirnov said statistics were most inaccurate The American authors suggested that the rise in infant deaths in the Soviet Union might be attributed to such factors as alcoholism among pregnant women frequent abortions pollution influenza epidemics and the large proportion of Soviet women who work Mr Smirnovs reference to mortality rates was part of a broader and unusually frank discussion at the news conference of problems in Soviet population trends There is no catastrophe he said The situation is not worse than in other developed countries Nonetheless he said that at the 26th Soviet Communist Party Congress a decision was made to adopt an active demographic policy The main elements of the program he said would be to inspire larger families through a variety of financial and other incentives Moslem Peoples Expanding Several of the issues raised by Mr Smirnov have been the focus of recent American studies notably by Mr Feshbach a demographic analyst with the Commerce Departments Census Bureau The American reports have noted that Soviet Moslem populations in Central Asia are growing at a far higher rate than the Russian and other Slavic peoples Western analysts have suggested that the resulting change in ethnic patterns could generate new problems for the now dominant Slavs Mr Smirnov acknowledged that many of the incentive programs he outlined were designed primarily for European Siberian and Pacific regions of the Soviet Union Among reasons Mr Smirnov advanced for the lower birth rates in the north were some that Mr Davis and Mr Feshbach had given for the high infantmortality rate These were the large number of working women 93 out of each 100 a shortage of housing the high number of abortions which Western experts say outnumber live births at least two and a half times and alcoholism which Mr Smirnov described as one of the most serious problems of all our demographic social economic and spiritual policies Finanical Aid and Housing The incentive programs he outlined included giving mothers a year off from work with a state stipend of 50 rubles a month a 50ruble reward for the first child and 100 for the second increased maternity leaves and vacations for mothers a guarantee of a room for newlyweds under 30 or a oneroom apartment for parents with one child and a tworoom apartment for those with two children The incentive programs were thus seeking to cope with a common reason given by Russians for having at most one child  lack of living space Mr Smirnov said the program would cost the state 9 billion rubles or about 125 billion over five years The Soviet concern over flagging birth rates was further highlighted last week by an announcement that a plant using technology developed by the United States concern Abbott Laboratories to manufacture infant formula would open June 29 in the Ukrainian city of Balta Robert A Schoellhorn president and chief executive officer of Abbott said the Soviet investment in the plant more than 25 million  suggested a determination to encourage working women to have babies
SEX EDUCATION CURRICULUM GUIDE DEBATED,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/21/nyregion/sex-education-curriculum-guide-debated.html,HARTFORD FOUR of every 10 girls across the United States will become pregnant before reaching age 20 according to educators and family planners That kind of statistic and the recent release of a state report on family life education has reopened debate among Connecticut officials on sex education in public schools According to a 1978 Gallup survey 43 percent of students between the ages of 13 and 18 reported having had sex education in school but only 31 percent said they were taught about contraception Fewer than a dozen states require or even encourage sex education In Connecticut about 12 school systems out of 165 offer comprehensive classes in sex education while most others incorporate the subject into other courses In a 1977 study the Alan Guttmacher Institute a New Yorkbased public policy research group reported that 8 out of 10 Americans believe that sex education should be taught in the schools and 7 out of 10 believe that such courses should include information about contraception In Connecticut however a substantial number of parents actively oppose such programs in the schools The General Assembly in June 1979 ordered that the State Board of Education help local and regional boards of education develop family life programs The boards final product a report entitled A Guide to Curriculum Development in Family Life Education was released earlier this year It was prepared by a 19member advisory council consisting of representatives of parent groups local boards of education educators physicians and religious leaders including representatives of Protestant Catholic and Jewish faiths Roberta Howells physical education consultant to the State Department of Education and head of the council said that the report contained information that could be helpful to the local school districts as a guide for setting up sex education programs She stressed that it was not a state mandate for sex education Because of the high pregnancy rate among teenagers nationwide many school systems in the state that do not have comprehensive sex education courses are starting to deal with the issue In Milford for example sex education has been debated intermittently for 10 years The issue came up again last fall when the Milford Parent Teachers Association asked for a family life education program The Board of Education appointed a committee of teachers students school administrators parents clergymen and physicians to make a recommendation The group known as the Committee on Family Relations and Human Sexuality recently reported to the board that while sex education would be better left to the parents of school children many parents are unable or unwilling to provide necessary instruction and so we believe that the schools must share responsibility with the family for family life and human sexuality The committee called for the adoption at the earliest possible time of a program in sex education and interpersonal relationships for students in kindergarten through 12th grade But three members of the committee filed a minority report with the board on behalf of a small but vocal group of Milford parents who are fighting to stop such a program The report maintained that there is no evidence that Milford parents are unwilling or unable to educate their children in matters of family life and human sexuality Therefore the report said for the public schools to assume the right and responsibility to educate children in human sexuality and family life would be to usurp the rights of the parents Carole Boughton one of the three committee members who filed the minority report said that there were already sufficient programs in health Its really not the sex part of it that concerns us she said We just feel that the kids are learning the reproductive system already and our fear is that the teachers will probably go into abortion contraception things like that The Milford school board has yet to vote on the matter Miss Howells the State Department of Education consultant agrees that family life education goes beyond reproduction As proposed the states suggested curriculum would deal with human relations planning for family life being a parent and proper nutrition as well as sexuality Terms under which the state guide was written specify that the curriculum guide shall not include information pertaining to abortion as an alternative to family planning Miss Howells said that such topics as the definition of abortion and natural abortion can be discussed and she added that school districts are free to do as they wish in this area The only form of birth control it mentions is abstention she said She added that the law did not indicate what teachers could or could not do in their own districts Mrs Boughton said that instead of sex education for students programs should be set up to educate adults in ways to teach their children and she said the church and community must become more involved in the teaching of morality Not everyone agrees with that view Richard A Herman assistant superintendent of schools for secondary education in Milford and cochairman of the Family Relations and Human Sexuality Committee said that sex education was the schools responsibility because parents simply arent doing it Mr Herman said however that he had doubts about how much the schools can actually do He said values and attitudes were adopted primarily through observation and imitation not from instruction and that the schools were by no means the most influential source of information about sex We show a filmstrip on sex education were no match for a couple of hours of restricted films which kids can see on cable TV he said Miss Howells too is not convinced that sex education is going to bring about any radical changes in the attitudes of young people toward sex Dont make the mistake of saying Have the schools solve the social issue of youngsters engaging in sexual intercourse and becoming pregnant Dont make the mistake of thinking that

WEEK,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/22/us/400-rightist-groups-national-coalition-start-boycott-tv-wildmon-sponsors-this.html,No one in the bustling barber shop off Main Street had ever heard of the Coalition for Better Television or its chairman the Rev Donald Wildmon The coalition has its national headquarters just two blocks up the street but the offices are unmarked and unimpressive three sparsely furnished rooms that rent for 125 a month But if Mr Wildmons operation seems slight and anonymous in this town of about 23000 its tactics are kicking up quite a controversy in New York and Los Angeles Im not trying to be known here Mr Wildmon said This is a national organization Indeed one week from today the coalition a group of about 400 mostly rightist groups led by the Moral Majority will announce a national boycott of one or more companies that sponsor shows the coalition deems offensive because of excessive sex violence and profanity Monitoring by Volunteers According to Mr Wildmon approximately 4000 volunteers around the country have spent the last three months monitoring the content of every primetime television series and noting the products advertised on them The results have been fed into a computer to determine which companies most frequently sponsored objectionable shows The networks are plainly concerned about an economic boycott This spring in separate speeches before a convention of advertising executives all three network presidents used very similar language to denounce the coalition The presidents of ABC CBS and NBC warned that a boycott aimed at influencing program content amounted to censorship and threatened freedom of choice for viewers If a boycott proved successful they said the coalition might next seek control over all programming including news NBCs president Fred Silverman described the tactic as a sneak attack on the foundation of democracy Mr Wildmon bridles at such suggestions arguing that it is the network executives who control what viewers see and who act as censors I just want to express my opinion Mr Wildmon said sitting behind his desk and puffing on the pipe he calls his most intractable vice A boycott is as legal and as American as apple pie Didnt Martin Luther King lead boycotts Im not seeking to have a law passed These are public airwaves and Im just saying that if an advertiser wants my business he has to treat me with respect If theres no public support for our position the boycott will fail and well disappear Mr Wildmon declines to estimate how much the coalition will spend to promote its boycott but the Rev Jerry Falwell head of the Moral Majority said that his group would give at least 2 million We plan to buy fullpage ads in major newspapers publicize it in thousands of parishes and reach 10 million more people through a direct mailing he said Speeches by Network Executives Last week ABC and NBC released studies suggesting that most viewers do not object to program content and would not support a boycott But some companies are taking no chances In a speech last week the chairman of the nations largest advertiser Procter  Gamble said that the coalition was expressing some very important and broadly held views and that I can assure you we are listening very carefully The networks are listening to such views too When ABC NBC and CBS announced their new fall schedules sexual themes had been significantly cut back Frederick S Pierce executive vice president of ABC explained to the networks affiliates last month that the ABC schedule reflected an important national trend an evolving mood based on a renewal of traditional values home and family courage and honest respect for authority and teamwork Idea Came in 1976 It was back in late 1976 while still serving as a minister in a United Methodist Church in Memphis that Mr Wildmon conceived his cause As he has often recounted he was watching television one evening with his wife and four children On one channel there was sex he says On another there was profanity and on the third a guy was preparing to work someone over with a hammer He soon resigned his ministry moved his family back to Tupelo where they had once lived for eight years and founded the National Federation for Decency At first Mr Wildmon said the networks reponse to his letters and petitions was sheer arrogancy A boycott was the last resort he said The one thing the networks care about is the bottom line Last fall Mr Wildmon called his old friend Cal Thomas a former NBC broadcaster who is now a vice president of the Moral Majority who suggested teaming up and out of that conversation came the idea for a national coalition By the time it was announced in January the coalition included other groups such as the ProFamily Forum in Fort Worth Phillis Schlaflys Eagle Forum and the antiabortion American Life Lobby Previous Critics Divided The boycott plan has caused deep divisions among other groups who were raising concerns about the quality of television long before the coalition was formed For example Everett Parker head of the United Church of Christs office of communication and perhaps the dean of broadcast reformers opposes a boycott calling it justified only for a very large issue where there is no other recourse I think its a very dangerous precedent to say Were going to put a company out of business because we disagree on a single issue  he said Youll see it wont just be one type of programming theyll oppose If theyre successful with violence theyll go after other social issues and political issues And Peggy Charren head of Action for Childrens Television and a longtime critic of the networks has started a national petition campaign to oppose a boycott complaining that the coalition is trying to dictate what the American public may or may not watch on television Neither Miss Charren nor Mr Parker suggest that broadcasters are without fault I think all these speeches theyre making about censorship are hypocritical Mr Parker said For years theyve been putting out all these sleazy programs and thumbing their noses at people who object to them Theyve never listened to sensible people because they know sensible people wouldnt attack them this way The coalition has gone for the jugular Emphasis on Sex Questioned And even some broadcast reformers who advocate the tactic of boycotting advertisers are uneasy with the coalition I am troubled said Dr Thomas Radecki head of the National Coalition on Television Violence by the Wildmon groups ignoring the violence problem but using it as a vehicle to get attention for their antisex campaigns Mr Wildmon agrees that the coalition is emphasizing the sex question but says that it would be redundant to focus on violence since groups like Mr Radeckis are already doing so Its not sex per se I object to Mr Wildmon said Its the constant gratuitous dwelling on it Im saying there ought to be more balance Some coalition critics including network executives and several advertisers have raised questions about the credibility of its monitoring techniques Mr Wildmon acknowledges that the monitors chosen were likely to be sympathetic to the coalitions aims and that in some areas particularly sex and profanity the definition of objectionable is necessarily subjective For example the coalition defines such words as damn God and whore as profanities and counts against a show any sexually suggestive comment inside or outside marriage Lists of Programs Compared But Mr Wildmon defends the validity of his overall conclusions and points to their compatibility with studies done by other groups When the National Federation for Decency released its fall monitoring results seven of the 10 programs Mr Wildmon listed as least constructive were also on the National ParentTeacher Associations fall list of most offensive shows Of Mr Wildmons 10 least constructive program sponsors six were rated by the PTA as either poor or most offensive However only two of the companies on the National Federation for Decencys list also showed up as sponsors of the most violent shows as listed by the National Coalition on Television Violence The companies that made both the PTA and the National Federation for Decency list Beecham Dow Chemical Gulf and Western Nestle RichardsonMerrill and Warner Lambert have to be considered the leading candidates for boycott when the coalition makes its announcement next week

WHEN DOCTORS ABORT AN ABNORMAL TWIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/24/opinion/l-when-doctors-abort-an-abnormal-twin-173268.html,To the Editor As the brother of a mentally retarded person I feel compelled to comment on the fetal surgery that resulted in the killing of an unborn twin with Downs syndrome news story June 18 he doctors said it was the mothers opinion that the presence of an abnormal twin would be an unhealthy experience for the normal one So we have come to this in our slide into the pit Women will be allowed to determine what is healthy not only for themselves but also for brothers and sisters of their other children My brothers life though not normal by medical standards has been an incredible blessing and benefit to my family We have been made more sensitive to the handicapped because of his life Regardless of that when doctors become the new executioners and rationalize that killing this retarded baby was a prolife act because the woman would have aborted both babies how far are we from the next step of infanticide and euthanasia What moral standard will be used to hold off these and other abominations Unless we have a humanlife amendment to the Constitution there will be no stopping those of the throwaway generations from increasing the human carnage in years to come CAL THOMAS Vice President for Communications Moral Majority Inc Lynchburg Va June 18 1981 
No Headline,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/24/opinion/l-no-headline-173194.html,To the Editor As a woman pregnant with her first child and proabortion I must try to examine objectively the ramifications of aborting a Downs syndrome twin I myself underwent an amniocentesis knowing full well that if a genetic deformity was found I would opt f or abortion The twins mother was willing to sacrifice both fetuses if the afflicted one was not aborted The shock arises primarily from the manner in which the abortion was performed and from the subsequent delivery at term of the dead fetus along with the healthy baby Although prolifers will equate this procedure with murder genetic manipulation and a host of Orwellian themes we must look at the positive aspects of what genetic outbreeding can achieve We are pitifully sympathetic to genetically deformed persons and their families and out of touch with the emotional and financial burdens they endure along with society as a whole Perhaps one day with scientific breakthroughs such as this we will be able to eliminate all genetic defects and abortions for this reason will no longer be necessary RANDI W KONNER New York June 17 1981

JUSTICE ON THE RUN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/26/opinion/justice-on-the-run.html,Not content with the Houses move to prohibit the Justice Department from advocating busing in school desegregation cases Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana wants to forbid such Federal court orders altogether His proposal is only the latest in a series of killtheumpire ideas all of dubious constitutionality Other senators want to adorn the Justice Departments budget authorization with amendments to permit preventive detention of criminal defendants before trial and the use at trial of illegally seized evidence The objectives are worrisome enough the method for attaining them is flagrantly out of order The Constitution does give Congress authority to regulate the jurisdiction of Federal courts But denying the courts the right to order busing is clearly excessive It is bad enough that even without a Congressional prohibition the Reagan Administration is unlikely ever to ask any court for a busing order Forbidding the courts even to consider busing would in some cases leave no remedy whatever for deliberate and illegal segregation in a public school district So conservative a scholar as former Solicitor General Robert Bork has questioned the constitutionality of the restriction it would leave the victims of discrimination with a clearly established right but no means to realize it Above all such controversial measures deserve orderly consideration and reasoned Congressional debate They are wholly inappropriate in the push to pass a budget authorization Last weeks romp on these questions was so unruly that Senator Weicker of Connecticut had to resort to a blocking filibuster His own amendment a modest restatement of executive and judicial powers to enforce the Constitution was treated as quaint and soundly defeated Some senators seem to be making the most of the acknowledgment by Howard Baker the majority leader that he cant control them They cant wait despite the pleas of the White House that nothing be allowed to interfere with budget matters to move into the social issues that are sure to tie up Congress  issues like the right to abortion and mandatory prayer in public schools If moderate leaders dont reassert themselves more than one unpopular court remedy will be lost

HELMS TAKES AIM AT 'SECULAR HUMANISM',https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/28/weekinreview/helms-takes-aim-at-secular-humanism.html,The timehonored image of the United States Senate as a club where members preen one another with baritoned rhetoric and genteel agreements may be fading if the things being said lately about Senator Jesse Helms are any indication Under pressure of the North Carolina Republican who has made a career of pursuing relentlessly his own conservative agenda the club may be evolving into a jungle where some of the Senate lions watch in beadyeyed anxiety for the stalker among them With Jesse Helms theres no more of the club if it ever really existed  hes made the place Darwinian Senator Paul E Tsongas a Massachusetts Democrat said earlier this year when Mr Helms a tall backslapping man was still warming to his role as a conservative zealot and strategist enjoying majority power in the new Reagan era Last week fresh from a victory in tightening the law on Federal payment for abortions of women on welfare Senator Helms was midwifing the birth of another of his legislative babies a ban on Justice Department involvement in school busing suits Senator Lowell P Weicker a Connecticut Republican had ended his filibuster against the measure but he still managed to hold off a final vote last week Eventually however Senator Helms expects his bill to be voted on and probably to be passed Since Jesse Helms started his warfare against those who disagree with him theres a meanness in the Senate now that I dont think has been since the days of Joe McCarthy said Senator Alan Cranston the assistant Democratic leader Helmss tactics make him a kind of time bomb for Reagan I think the way McCarthy was for Eisenhower The mere utterance of such criticism bespeaks an erosion in the Senates clubbiness even if Senator Helmss contrary view  that he is just a dedicated warrior finally winning a few battles and alarming the opposition in the process  is allowed But his tactics leave liberal Democrats now willing to complain for the record And Mr Helms responds Im just a passenger on the train referring to the Reagan juggernaut But he may occasionally nudge the throttle too for he speaks to President Reagan every week he says and some of his tactics in opposing Administration nominees Kissinger retreads in the name of fidelity to what he says are Mr Reagans true views have perplexed White House aides His actions in his new role as chairman of the Agriculture Committee illustrate Mr Helmss special approach to politics He often stresses ideological purity at the expense of compromise victories His attempt to double the Administrations cuts in the food stamp program were soundly rejected by his committee in a bipartisan blow to his leadership But Mr Helmss more extreme position served the President well leaving Democrats more willing to retreat to Mr Reagans moderate cuts Senator Helms has two impressive sources of power First he holds a position of deepest respect in the conservative evangelical and political movement Basically he says were talking about faith in God versus secular humanism Secondly he has had enormous success in raising money through the directmail techniques polished in conservative causes His instinct for folksy but highpowered public relations honed through 12 years of Deep South radio and TV editorializing as the Voice of Free Enterprise and a diehard critic of the civil rights movement gave him priceless entree to smalldollar contributors As the champion of the tobacco industry he is not without big lobby money either In 1978 his organization ran the richest reelection drive in Senate history spending more than 7 million against weak opposition Last year the outfit raised more than 4 million for President Reagan and applying the technique that fellow senators denounce as unsporting and mean Senator Helms turned his funding machine on several Congressional and Senate incumbents seeking reelection as well Some senators complain that he attaches controversial riders on social issues to bills to build a rollcall record then his cohorts flood the states of legislators who vote against him with fundraising letters pegged to emotional issues Senator Helms emphasizes that his efforts on social issues are hardly fruitless He won on denying Federal abortion funding to women on welfare who become pregnant through rape or incest he is close to winning on his busing proposal The business of the Senate is the clash of ideas and ideals says Mr Helms We should make substantial changes now unless we lose heart and I dont intend to let that happen In targeting his fellow senators Mr Helmss organization last year helped to defeat his colleague from North Carolina Robert Morgan a conservative Democrat in favor of John P East a very conservative Republican Senator Morgan was attacked in ads for such things as the Panama Canal giveaway Senator East won narrowly and now as Carolina political cartoonists depict him ensconced firm and tiny in Senator Helmss handkerchief pocket he has become point man for one of Mr Helmss pet bills an attempt to outlaw abortion by defining the start of human life as the moment of conception Hes reaching out building a subspecies of Republicans Senator Cranston says In person Senator Helms is a courtly man no less a contradiction than any other politician He can dwell with sincerity on the plight of an elderly neighbor newly widowed a man who needed the Senators companionship in grief Then again he can utter a startling anachronism when he describes his floor fight over busing On the floor we fight hard were both free white and 21 as we say in North Carolina As the selfdefined keeper of Ronald Reagans flame and as a wily floor battler more interested in his cause than in any particular bill Senator Helms backslaps generously as he enters the Senate these days enjoying his opponents consternation All those years conservatives fought hard and didnt win much he says Now liberal Democrats find it mean for us to be winning one or two The wheel turns Jesse Helms declares sounding resolute if not quite Darwinian
"SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY, INCLUDING THE LIKELY LOSERS",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/28/weekinreview/something-for-everybody-including-the-likely-losers.html,Hows it going a caller asked Bernard Rome recently Not well Mr Rome replied dolefully He was preparing to withdraw from the mayoral race So on the day Republican party leaders announced their endorsement of the Democratic incumbents candidacy for Mayor of New York City Mr Rome former head of the Off Track Betting Corporation and former friend of Mayor Koch announced that his pursuit of the nomination had ended His withdrawal established the 1981 Republican primary as a oneonone contest between Mr Koch and Assemblyman John A Esposito of Queens And it established Mr Rome as a rarity in New York City politics this year Unlike the swarm of others who would be  but probably wont be  mayor council president or comptroller Mr Rome quit before he got beaten The rest of the declared candidates for the three citywide jobs waging campaigns that reflect varying degrees of quixoticism persist Oh Im an underdog said Jim Smith a printer who gives campaign speeches in subway cars in his quest for the Democratic mayoral nomination I admit that Im a long shot said George H Strauss a management consultant who churns out position papers for his campaign against City Conmptroller Harrison J Goldin Its a tough race said Guy J Velella an Assemblyman from the Bronx who bowed to the blandishments of Republican leaders and agreed to run against Carol Bellamy the Democratic incumbent for president of the City Council Most of them are given little chance to win and a few publicly admit it but each expects to accomplish something even in defeat  Mr Velella a career politician is putting his name on the line to assure a Republican presence on the ballot and perhaps to position himself for a future Congressional race  Mary T Codd a City Council member from Staten Island who is the Liberal candidate for mayor wants to call attention to Mr Kochs multiparty coronation which she calls undemocratic  The Right To Life Partys slate of candidates does not expect to make much of a dent in the New York City vote said party spokesman Vincent Euk a medical technician from Queens Rather he said it intends to use the campaign to make the city more sensitive to the partys antiabortion cause Opposing Koch from Both Sides  And there are those like the two major party candidates pursuing Mr Koch from opposite ends of the ideological spectrum who seem certain they can win Mr Esposito a conservative Republican argues that he is the only Reagan Republican in the mayoral contest Assemblyman Frank J Barbaro a Brooklyn liberal kicked off his campaign last week as the only true Democrat in the race With five established parties crowding New York voting machines and with the citys customary morass of political feuds and crossendorsements the lineup for the September 10 primary as petition gathering starts looks like this Democrats Mr Smith Mr Barbaro and Mr Koch for mayor Mr Strauss Assemblyman John A Dearie and Mr Goldin for comptroller Miss Bellamy unopposed for council president Republicans Mr Esposito and Mr Koch for mayor Richard Bernstein a Manhattan millionaire for comptroller Mr Velella for council president Conservatives Mr Esposito for mayor William Powderly a Brooklyn banker who heads the Right to Life Party in the borough for comptroller Mr Velella for council president Right To Life Jeronimo Dominguez a Bronx doctor for mayor Mr Powderly for comptroller Margaret Chiffriller a housewife for council president Liberals Mrs Codd for mayor Mr Goldin for comptroller Miss Bellamy for council president Most of them will still be around for the general election in November but only three will be standing on the City Hall steps Jan 1 to be sworn into office And most politicians believe that it will be the three incumbent Democrats The professionals make a possible exception in the case of Mr Dearie in his bid to unseat Mr Goldin Mr Dearie is unusual among the challengers not only in that the pros think he could win but also in that he has said he may spend a million dollars or so in the attempt Most of the others will run threadbare campaigns seeking visibility through party newsletters whatever news coverage they can get and the occasional radio or television debate The welltodo Mr Bernstein said he intends to make a handsome contribution to his own campaign as Republican candidate for comptroller But most  excepting incumbents  do not expect to spend much What someone asked Mr Esposito will he do for campaign money He shrugged eloquently God provides he said The candidates in the center ring  the one occupied by the Mayor  each argued that Mr Koch could lose even if he outspends them Said the Democrat Mr Barbaro Ive put together a coalition of tenants senior citizens straphangers people who can see through Kochs rhetoric and see that hes been a terrible Mayor Koch has sold his soul to George Clark the Republican state chairman Im a Democrat I wont accept any other partys support Said the Republican Mr Esposito Im going to win in September Republican voters are traditionalists Their mental processes are going to be Johns a Republican So vote for him Then in November my argument against the Mayor will be that were not getting our moneys worth Mrs Codd the Liberal candidate said her motivation was to deny the bosses in both parties the chance to foist a single mayoral candidate on the city she loved Besides she added being in a City Hall run by Mayor Koch simply was no fun You know the old saying that politics is the art of compromise she said Here its the art of capitulation Vince Lombardi  the football coach famed for his dictum Winning isnt everything its the only thing  would have hated New York City politics In this arena it seems losing counts for something
DEMOCRATIC FOES TESTING STRENGTH FOR PRIMARY RACE TO OPPOSE PURCELL,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/28/nyregion/democratic-foes-testing-strength-for-primary-race-to-oppose-purcell.html,IN their first test of organizational strength the two Democratic candidates for Nassau County Executive began circulating designating petitions last week for the Sept 10 primary The signaturegathering is viewed by politicians as one measure of the effectivness of the campaign organizations of John W Matthews of Long Beach the Nassau Democratic organizations designee for County Executive and his challenger Assemblyman Lewis J Yevoli of Plainview The Republican incumbent County Executive Francis T Purcell will have the luxury of watching the Democrats battle each other initially He is unchallenged in the Republican primary and also has the endorsement of the Conservative Party All three candidates have started to put together the staffs to run their campaigns the budgets to pay for them and the themes to distinguish them The 43yearold Mr Matthews owner of an insulation business and a vice chairman of the Nassau Democratic organization said recently that he had raised some 115000 toward a goal of 700000 for both the primary and the general election He has hired a New York City campaign consultant Michael Nussbaum and a New York City publicist Morton Matz His campaign manager is Judith Hins of Long Beach and Franklin H Ornstein president of the Central Federal Savings and Loan Association and a veteran of Nassau campaigns will be the chief fundraiser Mr Nussbaum said Mr Matthews would center his campaign on the asserted shortcomings of the Purcell administration and presumably try to ignore Mr Yevoli Theres no reason to attack Yevoli Mr Nussbaum said Nassau is the highest taxed county in the country Mr Nussbaum said It should be run by a business executive not a boss an allusion to Joseph M Margiotta the powerful Nassau GOP chairman who would be a target of both Mr Matthews and Mr Yevoli in the campaign Mr Nussbaum also emphasized that the candidate must reach out beyond the Great Neck and Five Towns faction in the Democratic Party a reference to liberal Democrats who supported his designation Mr Matthews a Roman Catholic made a point in his acceptance speech of supporting legalized abortion a move that was widely seen as an effort to attract liberal Democrats His strategy of concentrating on Mr Purcell and trying to ignore Mr Yevoli is standard for a candidate who has almost all the party leaders in his corner and thus starts out as the frontrunner Any shift toward attacks on Mr Yevoli could be taken as a signal of worry in the Matthews camp The 42yearold Mr Yevoli although better known than Mr Matthews because of his service in the Assembly and on the Oyster Bay Town Board conceded that he was probably the underdog because of Mr Matthewss organizational support Another element is money and Mr Yevoli says he plans to raise only 70000 for the primary William Keneally the only Assembly District leader supporting Mr Yevoli will be his campaign cochairman along with Roma Connable the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for County Clerk four years ago and a veteran of many campaigns Hillard Boss a Plainview teacher and former State Senate candidate will manage the campaign Mr Keneally said that Mr Yevoli would have the support of about onethird of the countys 2000 Democratic County committeemen just as he did at the county convention two months ago and that he did not consider Mr Yevoli the underdog Mr Yevoli said he would center his primary campaign on a beat the bosses theme He charged that the Nassau Democratic chairman Stanley Harwood supported a weak candidate for County Executive Mr Matthews in exchange for the expected Republican endorsement of Mr Harwood for the State Supreme Court in the November election Mr Harwood has argued that Mr Matthews is the stronger candidate and can raise more campaign funds The judicial endorsement will be made in September shortly after the primary and Mr Harwood is almost certain to be the Democratic and Republican nominee as a result of a twoyear bipartisan agreement on judgeships that went into effect last year As is customary for an incumbent Mr Purcell intends to run on his record and will emphasize budget and tax restraints to counter the Democratic thrust In a campaign brochure just printed the 62yearold Mr Purcell who is seeking his second term asserts that he has set Nassau County firmly on the road to fiscal stability He boasted that he had kept increases in county spending down to 5 percent in the face of a 31 percent inflation rate over his fouryear term cut county sales and property taxes reduced the welfare caseload to its lowest point in 14 years and turned the Nassau Coliseum from a money loser into a moneymaker As is the custom in Nassau the Purcell campaign will be run and financed by the county Republican organization in conjunction with other countywide and town contests Nassau Republicans are probably the only candidates in the state who do not have to finance their own campaigns But as a result they give up much of the control of the campaign itself Named last week as cochairmen of the Purcell campaign committee were Theodore M Black the publisher and former chancellor of the state Board of Regents Patricia Lent mother of Representative Norman F Lent Sid Haber the former Mayor of Cedarhurst and Peter Zuzzalo of the Sons of Italy The candidates brotherinlaw Pat Lerza an employee of the county Board of Assessors will be campaign manager as he has been for other Purcell campaigns Overseeing the Purcell and other Republican campaigns will be Mr Margiotta his executive assistant Robert McDonald and Arthur Finkelstein the pollster and advertising consultant
SURROGATE MOTHERS: WHY WOMEN VOLUNTEER,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/29/style/surrogate-mothers-why-women-volunteer.html,Still filled with remorse over the abortion she underwent two years before 23yearold Alice G answered a personal notice in her local newspaper offering 10000 plus expenses to women who would consent to conceive and carry babies for childless couples I killed a baby she said in explaining her response to the notice Now I could make up for it by giving one to a needy and loving family Alice G is one of more than 60 applicants interviewed by Dr Philip Parker a psychiatrist at Wayne State University in Detroit to learn what makes a woman volunteer as a surrogate mother Money it turns out is only part of the answer at least for 20 percent of those surveyed they said that out of compassion for the wouldbe parents and other considerations they would enter the venture with no fee The remaining 80 percent said they would require a fee Disclosing his initial findings at a recent meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in New Orleans Dr Parker said that half of his study subjects were married and many of those had children of their own They saw surrogate motherhood as a chance to earn income for their families while rediscovering their joy in being pregnant Pregnancy made them feel more content complete special adequate feminine and attractive Dr Parker reported A few called it the best experience theyd ever had It gave them an inner glow and made them want to be pregnant for the rest of t eir lives Only 10 percent had no previous history of pregnancy The applicants average age was 25 Half were Roman Catholic half Protestant Among the 60 percent who were themselves employed or had a spouse with a job annual incomes ranged from 6000 to 55000 Most had highschool diplomas or equivalency certificates and a quarter of the group had gone on for courses at a college business or nursing school One woman had a bachelors degree All the women Dr Parker questioned were referred to him by Noel Keane of Dearborn Mich a lawyer who had negotiated several contracts between socalled host mothers and married couples In the typical surrogatemother agreement a woman is artificially inseminated with sperm from a man whose wife cannot conceive At term the surrogate mother relinquishes her parental rights turning the baby over to its biological father His wife may then become its adoptive mother Not Known Before 1970 Although the technology to produce babies without sexual intercourse has existed for more than 100 years surrogate motherhood was virtually unheard of before 1970 Today Dr Parker estimates scores of couples are pursuing the idea He speculates that its growing popularity is a result of an increased demand for newborn white babies for adoption along with a decreasing supply All the parental applicants he interviewed as part of a related study said that they had been trying to adopt for several years but had been unsuccessful Seeking a surrogate mother they said was their last resort One inherent problem in this legally boggy arena is that the biological mother may decide to keep the baby with impunity Early this month for example Denise Lucy Thrane of Arcadia Calif won exclusive custody of the child she bore in April ostensibly for Bjorna and James Noyes of Rochester NY Under certain circumstances the biological mother may even be able to sue the sperm donor for child support according to George J Annaf chief of the Health Law Section at the Boston University School of Public Health who has made a study of contracts to bear children As Dr Annaf pointed out in a recent article in the Hastings Center Report a journal that concentrates on ethical issues in biological and medical research the legal debate has focused on the question of babyselling No state laws prohibit one woman from acting as a surrogate mother as a favor to another as long as she receives no payment in excess of her medical expenses If she gets a fee and the wife of the biological father moves to adopt the child all the parties stand in violation of laws in most states Dr Annaf said that make it a crime to offer give or receive anything of value for placing a child for adoption In a case he has taken to the Michigan Supreme Court Mr Keane argues that the states law is unconstitutional because it undermines the parties right to reproductive privacy A lower court said in ruling against Mr Keane that mercenary considerations used to create a parentchild relationship and its impact upon the family unit strike at the very foundation of human society and are patently and necessarily injurious to the community Mr Keane said in an interview that if the Michigan Supreme Court refused to hear the case he would take it to the United States Supreme Court Dr Parker would like to see all those who apply to be surrogate mothers evaluated psychologically and counseled before insemination His research thus far shows that most applicants have not considered the problem of the loss of the baby at term or thought about how they would explain the loss to their own young c ildren and to colleagues at work When asked Dr Parker found some guessed that they would lie saying that the baby had died Feelings of Loss Most surrogate mothers minimized any expected feelings of loss Dr Parker said in a telephone interview Some totally denied the possibility of such feelings They helped themselves in this belief by discounting their own genetic contribution to the baby He cited a few of their reasons for not expecting any emotional involvement with the infant Im only an incubator Id be nest watching It wont be my husbands and mine Id be doing it for someone else Those few who in discussing the matter with Dr Parker as part of his study did foresee sadness at the loss of the baby withdrew their applications The results convince Dr Parker of the need not only for counseling but for a longterm study of all the parties involved  surrogates parental applicants and children People react strongly often totally negatively to the mere mention of surrogate motherhood he explained It seems to trigger their fantasies about babybuying slavery and black marketeering He said he wanted to provide a real data base so that any social action to prohibit or regulate surrogate motherhood could be founded on information instead of gut feelings and prejudice Meeting the Surrogate Mother Of the more than 60 surrogate mother applicants Dr Parker counseled six were selected by parental applicants partly on the basis of Dr Parkers evaluations He is continuing his reasearch with the four who are now pregnant but he has had less luck following the prospective parents in these cases since they come from various parts of the United States and even from abroad To date only four couples have participated in extensive interviews with him One difference he has already noted is that some couples would welcome the opportunity to meet the surrogate mother while others prefer to remain strangers Whether or Not to Tell Some plan to tell their prospective children the steps leading up to their birth as soon as they are old enough to understand the concepts involved others insist they will keep the child from learning these facts I dont know what to recommend when the parties ask me for advice on these issues Dr Parker said After I followed some cases and have seen the outcome Ill be able to tell them how others fared and this will help them make their own decisions
ADDITION OF CONSERVATIVE TO COURT COULD TIP BALANCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/29/us/addition-of-conservative-to-court-could-tip-balance.html,The philosophical balance of the Supreme Court could tip significantly to the right in several important areas of constitutional law if President Reagan appoints someone who shares his conservative views to succeed Justice Potter Stewart who has announced his plan to retire next month These areas include the death penalty the rights of criminal defendants and the First Amendment rights of the press In considering each of them Justice Stewart has cast crucial votes and gave forceful opinions on issues that might be decided differently in the future if his successor sides with the Courts more conservative members But no radical shift in the Courts approach to most of the politically charged cases it must decide is likely to occur at least not unless and until Mr Reagan has an opportunity to appoint a second or third justice to the ninemember Court The most controversial of the Supreme Court precedents that Mr Reagan has criticized those allowing abortions prohibiting prayers in school and upholding busing as a desegregation tool were decided by wide enough margins that they would probably stand even if Justice Stewarts replacement were to vote to overrule them These conclusions emerge from a review of the voting patterns in some of the more celebrated Supreme Court decisions in recent years and interviews with constitutional experts No Indication on a Successor President Reagan has given no indication whom he will nominate to succeed the Justice Stewart 66 years old who announced last Thursday that he would retire July 3 after 23 years on the Court But the President said last week through a spokesman that he would appoint a constitutionalist a man or woman who shares his view that the role of the courts is to interpet the law not to create new law by judicial fiat In a harsh attack on the Court in a campaign statement in February 1980 Mr Reagan assailed decisions that he said override public opinion and invade the prerogative of the legislature on such issues as abortion school prayer desegregation and treatment of criminals There must be new Justices on the court women and men who respect and reflect the values and morals of the American majority Mr Reagan said Appointed by Eisenhower Justice Stewart has been viewed as a moderate with conservative instincts since he was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Eisenhower in 1958 In recent years he has sided with his most conservative colleagues Justice William H Rehnquist and Chief Justice Warren E Burger more often than with the Courts most liberal members William J Brennan Jr and Thurgood Marshall according to statistics compiled by the Harvard Law Review He has opposed as unconstitutional those Government affirmative action programs that give special preferences to members of minority groups and he has dissented from the Courts decisions prohibiting prayer and other religious observances in the public schools But Justice Stewart has also borne out the truism that Supreme Court Justices do not fit neatly into ideological categories He has joined the majority in several cases the outcomes of which outraged Mr Reagan and other likeminded conservatives Among the case was the 7to2 decision in 1973 upholding a womans right to have an abortion and some but not all of the Courts decisions upholding broad school desegregation orders which included busing In some cases on which the Court was closely divided Justice Stewarts vote or the force of his reasoning may have been decisive Foe of Death Penalty Justice Stewart has been one of five Justices who voting as the majority have invalidated hundreds of death sentences by subjecting capital punishment laws and sentencing to rigiorous constitutional scrutiny In 1972 he joined the majority in a 5to4 decision that invalidated all state and Federal death penalty laws then on the books reasoning that the laws had been wantonly and freakishly administered by the sentencing judges and juries In 1976 after many states had passed new death penalty laws Justice Stewart again joined with four other Justices in striking down those laws that made captital punishment mandatory for certain crimes while he voted to uphold other laws that specified detailed criteria for determining which defendants should be condemned to die If he is replaced by a Justice who believes as Justice Rehnquist asserted in a recent opinion that the Court should help clear the way for the states to get on with executing more of the 780 convicted murderers now on death row the pace of executions might pick up dramatically Justice Stewart has often voted with the majority in decisions to void criminal convictions because evidence was obtained illegally or because of other police misconduct decisions denounced by conservatives as coddling criminals Deciding Vote in Key Cases While some of the most important precedents in this area were decided by large majority votes and seem unlikely to be overruled in other cases Justice Stewart supplied the fifth vote for the majority One example was Brewer v Williams a 5to4 decision striking down a murder conviction in 1977 in which Justice Stewart wrote the majority opinion He said the police had violated the defendants Sixth Amendment right to counsel by playing on his religious feelings while his attorney was not present and persuading him to reveal the location of the victims body Chief Justice Burger one of four dissenters called this result intolerable and said it continued the Court by the narrowest margin on the muchcriticized course of punishing the public for the mistakes and misdeeds of lawenforcement officers Justice Stewarts successor could also make a difference in the Courts approach to the Fourth Amendment which has been used to bar the use of evidence obtained through illegal searches and seizures At least four Justices not including Justice Stewart have expressed a distaste for continuing to apply this exclusionary rule which is also under attack in Congress because it sometimes allows guilty defendants to go free Upheld Press Freedoms According to Floyd Abrams a New York lawyer who has represented press interests in many Supreme Court cases Justice Stewart has in recent years been the Courts leader in articulation of an expansive view of the rights of the press to publish and be free of governmental intrusion by deciding what to publish and what not to publish Mr Abrams called Justice Stewarts resignation a great loss In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case for example Justice Stewart was one of six Justices who upheld the right of The New York Times and The Washington Post to publish a classified study of the Vietnam War despite the Nixon Administrations arguments that publication would damage the national security Only two of the six Justices Brennan and Marshall will remain after Justice Stewart retires next month Mr Abrams says the appointment by the President of the new Justice will be of more than usual importance in determining whether the Court will afford similar protection to the press in any future clashes with the executive branch Of course it is easier for a President to criticize the Supreme Court than to change its course by appointing new Justices No President can hope to control a Justice he has appointed to a life term or predict with confidence how he will vote in particular cases A number of Presidents have been surprised and sometimes horrified by some of the actions of Chief Justice Earl Warren who led the Court through the most liberal activist period in its history Reluctance to Upset Precedents In addition a Reagan conservative on the Court might feel constrained by the customary reluctance of the Justices to overrule the Courts own precedents even precedents they disapprove of On the other hand Courtwatchers stress that if the President does appoint a strong and persuasive figure with views similar to his the new Justice might be able to sway the votes of the others as Chief Justice Warren and Oliver Wendell Holmes did as an associate justice in the late 1800s This might galvanize changes in the law more pronounced than could be produced simply by changing one vote in a few cases Professor Laurence H Tribe of the Harvard Law School said however that the potential for major constitutional change with consequences lasting long past the current national mood would increase exponentially if and when Mr Reagan had the opportunity to replace one or more other Justices Five of the remaining eight are 72 years or older including the Courts two most liberal members Justices Brennan and Marshall as well as the Chief Justice and Justices Lewis F Powell Jr and Harry A Blackmun who are more conservative but not as conservative as Mr Reagan
MAN IN THE NEWS; MINNESOTA BISHOP TO LEAD CONFERENCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/30/us/man-in-the-news-minnesota-bishop-to-lead-conference.html,After receiving a rousing round of applause at the news of his election today as president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops a smiling Archbishop John R Roach quietly resumed his seat to the right of the outgoing president Archbishop John R Quinn of San Francisco For three years Archbishop Roach head of the archdiocese of Minneapolis and St Paul has been the strong righthand man to Archbishop Quinn as vice president and for a longer period has been a mainstay among the moderate members of the American churchs hierarchy The squarely built 59yearold Archbishop has spoken out on a number of social concerns including opposition to singleissue politics and support for civil rights for homosexuals but he prefers to work less conspicuously toward a progressive set of church goals Known as a superb administrator who likes to delegate authority the new president of the bishops conference is described as both open and approachable by those who have worked most closely with him He has also gained a reputation for witty riposte that sometimes contains an acerbic edge Shortly after his election for example he was asked at a news conference how he might combat growing dissent over the churchs teachings on birth control and divorce As you know he replied wryly I havent ordered a public whipping for a long time When Pope Paul VI appointed him five years ago Archbishop Roach became the first Minnesota native to head the Minneapolis archdiocese a fact that has bolstered his popularity among the 550000 Catholics in the 12county region that includes the two major cities their suburbs and more distant rural towns Ecumenical Gestures Though a private man who keeps his own counsel on many matters he has kept in close touch with his Catholic constituents and built solid ties with Protestants and Jews Among his most significant recent ecumenical gestures were a guest appearance in the pulpit at a Lutheran church and his presiding at a LutheranCatholic service to commemorate the 450th anniversary of the Protestant Augsburg Confession On many of the most sensitive and disputed issues among the Catholic laity such as contraception and divorce Archbishop Roach has not chosen to increase friction by repeatedly referring to controversial church teachings He has worked behind the scenes against the practice of abortion At the same time he has encouraged efforts to include divorced and separated Catholics in the church His moderate image stems partly from his less vocal stances on some of the sexuality issues and his more explicit support for programs to fight racism his advocacy of civil rights of homosexuals and his willingness to examine the role of women in the church Fought for Homosexual Rights In 1978 the city of St Paul voted on a referendum to remove an ordinance that protected the rights of homosexuals Archbishop Roach in a losing cause favored retention while making it clear that he did not approve of homosexual relations At his news conference today the ruddyfaced Archbishop Roach was asked whether a Catholic could remain in good standing with the church even after rejecting the churchs ban on artificial birth control With his customary respect for the rights of conscience he said he could expect that people can maintain integrity and union with the church and not follow the praxis of something like Humanae Vitae referring to Pope Paul VIs 1968 encyclical barring artificial birth control He later added that in his view those who practice birth control in violation of the church law must receive absolution before being admitted to communion Ordained in 1946 Born July 31 1921 in Prior Lake Minn Archbishop Roach attended Nazareth College and St Pauls Seminary in St Paul and has a masters degree from the University of Minnesota He was ordained June 8 1946 Of great importance for his threeyear term as chief spokesman for the bishops is the fact that he has established himself as a good listener He attends meetings of the Senate of Priests for example and has instituted sabbaticals higher salaries and programs for advanced studies for them The Archbishops runnerup for the presidency of the conference Bishop James W Malone of Youngstown Ohio was elected vice president
TAKING UP POLITICAL ARMS AGAINST THE RIGHT TO LIFERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/30/weekinreview/taking-up-political-arms-against-the-right-to-lifers.html,The fat man in the advertisement wears a campaign button A cigar stub juts from his mouth as he sits in a clutter of folding chairs bunting and American flags The legend above the picture reads in stark black and white Abortion should be between you and a doctor Not a politician The ad has run in 17 newspapers in New York State since September Its sponsor is that usually restrained educational organization Planned Parenthood whose New York City affiliate has spent 297000 on the effort In South Dakota and Iowa where Senators George McGovern and John C Culver respectively were defeated Tuesday by candidates with RighttoLife backing listeners heard this radio commercial from the National Abortion Rights Action League NARAL What do the words illegal abortions remind you of Coat hangers Kitchen tables Back alleys Pain Death Should we make abortion illegal again like the RighttoLifers want Would it stop women from having abortions or would it just take away the safety of the clinics and hospitals and put our wives and sisters and daughters back in the hands of the butchers After years of defensive responses to the RighttoLife movement the organized advocates of legal abortion took up arms in this election year While Ronald Reagans sweep of the country helped brush aside many prochoice candidates including Senators McGovern Culver and Birch Bayh some officeholders targeted by antiabortion groups pulled through Senators Alan Cranston Gary Hart Patrick J Leahy and Bob Packwood for example While the election led to skirmishes in different states the adversaries expect a national conflict over a constitutional amendment outlawing all abortions The prochoice forces believe there will be an early effort in the new Congress to bring such an amendment to the floor from the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution where Orrin G Hatch of Utah himself a sponsor of an antiabortion amendment will take over as chairman But the next chairman of the Judiciary Committee itself Strom Thurmond of South Carolina has voted for some Federallyfinanced abortions and has already distanced himself from the Republican platform plank that calls for appointing antiabortion judges Organizing Individualism The very nature of prochoice belief  that individuals should be left to their own decisions in matters as private as abortion  has impeded efforts at political organization according to Karen Mulhauser executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League a 12yearold group that claims 80000 members Its been hard to convince them that in order to take the politics out of abortion we have to get political she said Other fighters for legal abortion have organized a host of permanent political or educational groups including the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights Catholics for Choice and the Friends of Family Planning They generally support each others efforts but speak for different constituencies and with different approaches Planned Parenthood a taxexempt nonprofit organization is prohibited from engaging in political as opposed to legislative  efforts Accordingly said Alfred F Moran executive director of Planned Parenthood in New York City We see this as a fundamental human rights issue It is not a political issue to us This is an issue that deals with the Constitution and the Bill of Rights Mrs Mulhausers league registered as a lobbying organization had much more liberty to move into politics According to Mrs Mulhauser its members gave 200000 to candidates this year Weve taken the issue of abortion and treated it as a political campaign she said Weve identified those individuals who support us We bring them to house meetings the way a candidate would bring them to coffee klatches to say how important the issue is how important it is to get involved and we give them some of the basic skills of political organizing George Cunningham campaign manager for Senator McGovern said the league had been very helpful to the Senator providing some balance to the antiabortion forces though not nearly enough Mr Cunningham said he had found the leagues radio advertisement with its coat hangers and back alleys a little harsh I encouraged them to remove that spot from out here he said I frankly cant match the fetusintheMasonjar approach of the RighttoLife people I feel the stronger argument is that it should be a persons choice one that speaks to the privacy of the person and their body Planned Parenthoods newspaper ads urge the reader to get on the Planned Parenthood mailing list or to make a contribution to the organization Mr Moran said several other Planned Parenthood affiliates across the country are borrowing the series of five advertisements We wanted to make sure people understand what the RighttoLife movement really stands for said Mr Moran Our second objective was to provoke public debate and our third to give people a sense that Planned Parenthood saw this as a critical issue and that basically we were not going to stand by with our hands in our pockets and allow the RighttoLife movement to deny women the right to abortion Abortion was only the tip of the iceberg we felt he said The RighttoLife movement basically wants to regulate your personal behavior New York he added is a bellwether state We thought New York had to stand firm on these issues

2 REAGAN ALLIES IN SENATE PRESS THEIR OWN AIMS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/30/us/2-reagan-allies-in-senate-press-their-own-aims.html,A new era began on Capitol Hill today as the topranking Republicans on the Senate Finance and Judiciary Committees started setting their priorities and carrying out the conservative mandate they feel they have received from the American electorate Yet while the Republican euphoria over Tuesdays election victory was still palpable in the Capitol the oratory of the campaign trail was already conflicting with the reality of drafting laws Senator Bob Dole of Kansas who is to take over the Finance Committee in January and Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina the next chairman of the Judiciary Committee both separated themselves from some of Presidentelect Ronald Reagans campaign promises Mr Dole for example termed inflationary a proposal to cut taxes 10 percent a year for three years and Mr Thurmond took issue with a plan to appoint Federal judges who oppose abortion To Push for Tax Cuts At a news conference Mr Dole said the Republicans would not wait until January to deal with the economy but would push for a 39 billion package of tax cuts when the lameduck session of Congress convenes next week Mr Reagan at a news conference in California endorsed that aim saying Itll be just fine with me if they dont wait Mr Reagan also said he would be delighted if some of his programs were taken up by the lameduck session of Congress Senator Thurmond told reporters that one of his top priorities in January would be to pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget but he seemed much cooler toward proposals for an constitutional ban on abortion In his Presidential campaign Mr Reagan supported the threeyear tax proposal but Mr Dole said today that such a bill could feed inflation The tax cut plan that he wants to push next week is more modest and covers one year not three It was approved by the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year On Appointment of Judges Senator Thurmond broke ranks over a part of the Republican Party platform that calls for appointment of Federal judges who oppose abortion and favor traditional family values Mr Reagan said today that it would be cynical and callous to turn his back on that platform now but Mr Thurmond said that in evaluating judges in the Judiciary Committee he planned to consider the person as a whole and not use one issue as a litmus test Both Senators expressed jubilation and surprise at the election results in which the Republicans picked up 12 seats in the Senate giving them control of the chamber with 53 out of 100 seats when the new Congress convenes in January Mr Dole said that he had not believed in his wildest dreams that he would become chairman of the Finance Committee The tax package now before the Senate would reduce personal taxes by 22 billion and business taxes by 17 billion in 1981 Leading Republicans in the House also are said to favor pushing ahead immediately but Democrats in that chamber reportedly oppose the tax cut and could well block the measure in the lameduck session President Carter has denounced the bill as inflationary and could also use his veto to stop it In discussing his plans for the Finance Committee Mr Dole said the atmosphere will be more conducive to profit than under the Democrats In particular he said he would support a softening of the tax passed last year on windfall profits expected to be amassed by oil companies as a result of price deregulation He also said he would like to promote insurance for catastrophic health costs but he conceded that Presidentelect Reagan was not high on the idea Not an Absolute Abortion Ban Looking ahead to January Senator Thurmond said I would hope we can get a balanced budget amendment passed He also supported the idea of encouraging prayers in public schools and seemed to be backing a constitutional amendment that would reverse Supreme Court decisions that ban such ritual prayer Mr Thurmond noted that he had voted for Federal financing of abortions in cases of rape and incest and where the Floridas Republican Senatorelect Paula Hawkins says women in government have an advantage  they stay in touch with reality Page A18 life of the mother was in danger Accordingly he implied that he did not favor an absolute ban on abortion but would consider less restrictive amendments The South Carolina Republican who is also in line to become President Pro Tem of the Senate also reiterated his strong opposition to busing as a means to achieve school desegregation In explaining his position on Federal judgeships Mr Thurmond said he favored conservatives and strict constructionists but that his first criterion in appointees would be unquestioned integrity and character Judgeships he added should not be used to pay off political debts

FEMINISTS TRYING TO DEAL WITH RELIGIONS' CONFINES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/30/nyregion/feminists-trying-to-deal-with-religions-confines.html,Speaking as one Jewish woman to nearly 100 women struggling to practice religion and feminism Inge Lederer Gibel made it clear this weekend that she did not intend to be robbed by a patriarchal hierarchy of a heritage she treasured In spite of the fact that Judaism like its daughter Christianity and its sister Islam has not given women complete equality she said at the conference of Women of Faith in the 80s I cannot reject my heritage and its greatest scholars and sages because most of them were male human and fallible The conference was intended to bring together a leadership group of women of faith  Protestants Catholics Jews Moslems and evangelicals  to talk in a supportive manner about what they have in common what they do not and what the future may bring Mrs Gibel a program specialist for the American Jewish Committee was a coordinator of the conference The conferees who included nuns and rabbis gathered for two days at the Stony Point Ecumenical Center a cluster of low white buildings tucked into the serene hills of Rockland County within walking distance of the Hudson But it was clear from the remarks of many that they were deeply angry and the women they knew were angry at what Dr Virginia R Millenkott of the Evangelical Womens Caucus called the profoundly alienating sexism of most national religious organizations And like Mrs Gibel many were determined to participate substantively in their religions and not be put off by male hierarchies that they said have not and do not take them seriously In addition a number of speakers tackled the views of the Moral Majority a group that opposes among other things the proposed equal rights amendment and legal abortion Political Stance Questioned What does the name imply asked Mrs Gibel that those of us who do not identify with its political stance which their leaders claim is dictated by conformity to the will of God  are the immoral minority Dr Riffat Hassan of Pakistan a professor of religion at the University of Louisville and a Moslem was one of the few women attending from a third world country In Moslem countries she said women are treated at the level of children In China they used to put iron shoes on the feet of girls because they thought small feet were cute Moslem countries put iron shoes on the mind It has victimized us so she said of the Moslem hierarchy Why should we be forced to give it up We can be religious without letting the institutions dominate our lives Dr Rosemary Radford Reuther the author and Catholic theologian called religion sexisms chief mainstay But she rejected abandonment of religion in favor of simply getting on with the liberation of women in society A Change in Authority Religion Dr Reuther argued provides the oldest and most authoritative sanctification of sexism in society So the transformation of that authority by putting religion on the side of liberation is not insignificant Just how to go about putting religion on the side of liberation was not clear although the participants said that it was crucial to keep up an interreligious dialogue among themselves Trying to talk to the male hierarchies about anything more important than altar linens they seemed to agree was close to pointless Sister Ann Patrick Ware who has been engaged in ecumenical work for the National Council of Churches for a dozen years summed up the views of a number of women by saying that she felt caught in an awkward trap Identifying Sexism The thing that makes me recognize sexism she said stems from the Christianity I learned from the church that I now call sexist If racism were as overt in Catholicism as sexism is I wouldnt have any problem at all in saying Im not going to support these racist ceremonies How much longer can I continue to support this overtly sexist system The question is she added  Where do you go The church offers things you cant get elsewhere Nor did she feel that other Christian churches even those that ordain women were much better They put the women priests in charge of religious education or in little parishes where they cant afford to hire the real thing she said The conference planned for a year was the brainchild of Mrs Gibel and was financed primarily by the Nathan Appleman Institute The other coordinators were Sarah Cunningham associate editor of AD a monthly magazine and Sister Ann Gillen a board member of the National Coalition of American Nuns
THE DOCTOR' WORLD,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/30/science/the-doctor-world.html,THE viral illness that the Vatican says has complicated the recovery of Pope John Paul II from an assassination attempt is one of the most common and baffling of human infections The Pontiffs doctors presume the infection was introduced into the Popes body with one of the 10 blood transfusions he received during and immediately after emergency surgery on May 13 It is an infection for which no specific therapy exists and recovery is up to the healing powers of nature The illness is called cytomegalovirus infection or CMV and it infects the overwhelming majority of people at one time or another Yet a medical mystery is why the virus infects so many people but makes so few sick This characteristic distinguishes CMV from other common viral diseases such as measles which causes symptoms in almost every person it infects Epidemiological studies have shown that at least 1 percent of newborns enter the world with an active cytomegalovirus infection The incidence rises thereafter with a peak occurring between the ages of 15 and 30 Although the incidence of CMV varies widely throughout the world cytomegalovirus has left its fingerprints in the blood of about 80 percent of the people 40 years or older in most populations The symptoms and damage produced by CMV vary widely and depend on the age at which an individual is infected Pediatricians commonly detect the virus in the urine of apparently healthy babies However CMV infections can cause abortion stillbirth or death in the early days after birth from bleeding anemia hepatitis or brain damage The infection can also damage the body in more subtle ways CMV is considered an important cause of mental retardation It can also lead to hearing and visual loss as well as other central nervous system and developmental abnormalities that impair learning ability Damage caused by the virus may not be detected until a child is several years old Though most adults as well as most infants may become infected but escape symptoms many infected individuals develop fever fatigue liver and spleen enlargement and lung inflammation The Pope had all these symptoms according to one of his doctors The doctor also said that the medical team was uncertain whether the lung infection was caused by CMV because the type of inflammation seen on his chest Xrays differed from the usual pattern of a CMV pulmonary infection The virus is often diagnosed in patients whose immunological system has been compromised either from chronic diseases or from drugs aimed at helping to prevent rejection of transplanted kidneys and other organs Some such patients die from CMV The virus probably has caused infections for centuries but the disease was recognized only in recent decades In the late 19th century doctors began to notice peculiar cells in the urine and organs of some children Observed through an ordinary microscope the cells appeared enlarged and contained dense particles called inclusion bodies For a long time the cell damage was attributed to a parasite It was only in 1956 with the aid of new virological techniques that scientists discovered that a virus not a parasite produced the cell changes and was responsible for the wide variety of symptoms and damage Accordingly it was named cytomegalovirus from the Greek words cyto for cell and megalo for large CMV belongs to the herpes family of viruses and when examined through an electron microsocope it cannot be distinguished from other members of the family such as those that cause herpes infections chickenpox and shingles The distinction is made by other laboratory tests Diagnosing the virus can be difficult because individuals who have had a silent CMV infection can pass the virus in the urine for years Since isolation of the virus alone does not conclusively link a patients current medical problem to CMV the diagnosis reflects a judgmental decision based on a combination of blood urine and other tests as well as an evaluation of the patients clinical history Doctors have yet to fully determine how the infection spreads The virus can pass from a mothers blood through the placenta to a fetus and it occurs frequently in the cervix portion of the womb and breast milk Still doctors are uncertain when and how some fetuses and newborns acquire the infection Among adults close contact is apparently needed to spread the infection Sometimes CMV is spread by blood transfusions producing an illness that resembles infectious mononucleosis The virus can begin two to four weeks after transfusion and last a month or more There are no tests to screen blood contaminated with CMV The risk of acquiring CMV from blood transfusions varies geographically and is considered very low in the United States Some American experts said privately that they were surprised by the diagnosis of CMV in the Pope because of the small probability that a healthy 61yearold man had never had a CMV infection in the past However CMV was isolated from the Popes urine and increasing amounts of protective antibodies were detected in samples of his blood taken over several weeks according to one of the Pontiffs doctors Although those results do not offer conclusive proof of CMV infection the doctor said the medical team considered it the most likely diagnosis and presumed that it came from the blood transfusions
D'AMATO PLANS REVIEW OF OFFICEHOLDERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/30/nyregion/d-amato-plans-review-of-officeholders.html,Senatorelect Alfonse M DAmato Republican of New York said today that he would not automatically retain the United States Attorneys in New York who had been appointed by the Democrats Instead he said he will appoint a bipartisan screening committee to assess the current officeholders and advise him on possible new appointees United States Attorneys serve fouryear terms but at the pleasure of the President who can remove them at any time Senators suggest the appointment of a United States attorney to the President who almost always accepts them and sends the nominations to the Senate for confirmation Four years ago Mr DAmatos Democratic counterpart Daniel Patrick Moynihan who took office under a Democratic President permitted the Republican appointees to complete their terms Mr DAmatos intentions were stated in response to a question at a luncheon meeting with reporters and came after the disclosure yesterday that Edward R Korman the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York was investigating the activities of Joseph M Margiotta Mr Margiotta is the Republican chairman in Mr DAmatos home area of Nassau County Mr DAmato declined to comment on the Margiotta inquiry but said a decision on whether to retain Mr Korman whose office is in Brooklyn would be made on the advice of a panel of distinguished citizens that he planned to name to consider all appointments of United States Attorneys and marshals Mr Kormans term expires in 1982 A Justice Department official while declining to comment on the Margiotta investigation or even to confirm its existence said it would be difficult for a new United States Attorney to halt any major investigation once it was under way The inquiry is reported to involve the question of whether Mr Margiotta violated Federal law by directing that the insurance broker who wrote municipal policies share his premiums with other insurance brokers who have Republican connections Stands By Plans for Panel When asked whether it would not be better if only for appearances to retain the Mr Korman the Democratic appointee until the investigation had run its course Mr DAmato said he could not answer because his appointment of a screening panel would make the question hypothetical What else would you have me do he asked On a separate matter Mr DAmato said he would continue the practice begun by Senator Moynihan on the selection of judges in the Democratic Administration He will allow Senator Moynihan to select one out of every four as Senator Moynihan had allowed the outgoing Republican Senator Jacob K Javits to name one of four The Senator of the party that holds the White House traditionally names all Federal appointees The DAmato decision on judgeships came after a meeting last week during which Mr DAmato asked Mr Moynihan how he had gone about making his appointments Informed of Mr DAmatos decision Senator Moynihan said This is extremely gracious of Senatorelect DAmato and I thank him Moynihan Reserves Comment Senator Moynihan said he would not be able to comment on the plans for the appointment of United States Attorneys until Mr DAmato had appointed his screening commitee and it had a chance to make a recommendation Of his own practice he said I believe that the procedure I initiated to allow the incumbent United States Attorneys to serve out their full fouryear terms is a sound one In adopting another Moynihan practice Mr DAmato said that his screening panel made up of Republicans and Democrats would determine all appropriate Federal appointments However he said that he would make the final decision The only member of the panel he has named so far Mr DAmato said is Thomas A Bolan a founder of New Yorks Conservative Party which was instrumental in his victory As to whether a judicial candidates position on the use of Federal funds for abortions  a practice Mr DAmato opposes  would be decisive the Senatorelect said that it would be secondary that the important thing is their integrity and ability If the screening panel were to clear one candidate for a judgeship who favored the use of the funds and another who opposed it Mr DAmato said All other things being equal I would support the person who agrees to the position of opposition to Federal funds Besides taking on all questions from the Congressional reporters  and seeming to enjoy the occasion  Mr DAmato made the rounds of the Senate offices visiting his soontobe colleagues One of them was Howard H Baker Jr whom Mr DAmato said he would support for majority leader rejecting the criticism that Mr Baker is not conservative enough

EX-NEW YORKER GETS LIFE FOR CRIMES IN NAZI CAMP,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/01/world/ex-new-yorker-gets-life-for-crimes-in-nazi-camp.html,West Germanys last major Nazi war crimes trial which spanned five and a half years ended today with the conviction of eight former guards of the Maidanek camp including a former resident of Maspeth Queens Seven of the nine defendants were found guilty of complicity to murder at the camp near Lublin Poland where 250000 inmates died Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan who was convicted of murder received a life sentence Mrs Ryan 61 years old is married to an American and lived in Maspeth until she was stripped of her American citizenship in 1971 and deported in 1973 Her husband Russell Ryan who attended most of the trial proceedings said today American Jews demand these trials and this is what happens All of the defendants with the exception of Mrs Ryan received sentences shorter than those demanded by the prosecution A man in the public gallery apparently disappointed by the light sentences yelled Scandal and You have learned nothing absolutely nothing as Chief Judge Gunter Bogen read the verdict at the 474th session since the trial began Nov 25 1975 the longest court proceedings he said in German history Four other defendants for whom the prosecution had demanded life imprisonment  Hermann Hackmann deputy camp commandant Hildegard Lachert accused of direct involvement in the murder of 1196 prisoners Emil Laurich and Fritz Petrick  received sentences of ten twelve eight and four years Three former SS guards for whom the prosecution sought lesser terms received sentences of six three and a half and three years and a ninth defendant was released with the prosecutors acknowledgment that there was insufficient evidence to convict him Since the backs of the defendants all of whom are over 60 were turned to reporters when the verdicts were announced and then throughout the judges statement it was impossible to tell how they reacted Heinz Galinski a West Berlin Jewish spokesman said the prison terms were a perversion of justice and an insult to the victims of Nazism Reactions on the Verdict Vary A television commentator said that many people might share the idea that the verdict was a scandal and that West Germany would not find more understanding in the world because of the verdict One of the prosecutors fighting back his emotions said the sentences were surprising very surprising Judge Bogen in his statement talked about the problem of verifying accusations involving events that occurred 40 years ago The only possible evidence he said were statements of witnesses and the admissibility of some of these statements was narrowed by the limits of the law The length of the trial developed both from delaying tactics of 18 defense lawyers and from legal procedures involving misplaced affidavits challenged writs and the admissibility of depositions The impact of some of the testimony about infants being taken from parents and hurled into the back of trucks or about children being enticed into gas chambers with candy was smothered in the procedural mist Little Press Interest in Trial As a result perhaps no West German news organization showed regular interest in the trial until its last phase Over the years as 254 witnesses were heard the courtroom often had a relaxed atmosphere The defendants were not handcuffed or isolated The map of the Maidanek camp next to the witness stand was inaccurate but the participants agreed to ignore this Today the pattern was much the same A guard leaned forward and whispered in Mrs Ryans ear before Judge Bogen entered the chamber The public address system had been improved and a wall of the chamber painted but there was no large crowd or mood of tension Only the judge seemed nervous He said the defense had unnecessarily dragged out the trial but he said nothing of the tone of the defense This spring one lawyer drew a parallel between the gassing of children in Maidanek and the practice of abortion today Mrs Ryans lawyer Hans Selas complained that she was being tortured by the testimony against her Mrs Ryan May File Appeal Mrs Ryan who was found guilty of two murders had been accused of selecting more than 1000 women and children for the gas chambers Her lawyers said she might appeal Mrs Lachert said in testimony I never killed or seriously injured anyone I behaved very fairly There have been reports that the money to finance the defense has come from rightwing organizations and war veterans groups According to the prosecution the group on trial was a representative cross section of some 1300 guards most of whom have disappeared who served at Maidanek Originally there were 17 defendants but the number decreased through death and illness and the acquittal two years ago of four of the group
UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST REAFFIRMS LIBERALISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/02/nyregion/united-church-of-christ-reaffirms-liberalism.html,Turning aside suggestions that the church moderate its liberal social pronouncements delegates to the general synod of the 17millionmember United Church of Christ reaffirmed the denominations activist stance and chose peace and familylife issues as priorities for the next two years The 700 delegates to the synod meeting which closed today selected those two topics from a list of four possible priorities which included faith and youth A number of members of the denomination one of the most socially liberal church groups in the United States have been pressing for stronger emphasis on more narrowly spiritual concerns A wellorganized group called United Church People for Biblical Witness was active at the synod meeting urging the delegates to take less liberal positions on such issues as abortion civil rights for homosexuals support for the equal rights amendment and opposition to the arms race The Rev Dr Avery Post elected to a second fouryear term as president of the denomination referred to some of the opposition to the churchs pronouncements in his opening address and said he hoped the church will not become suddenly shy in the face of mood and value changes in this society I am of a mind to rock the ark a bit by saying on the spot that I see no reason why this synod should back off on the mission stances we have taken Dr Post said Conservatives Define Views And while conservative positions were occasionally expressed during debate at the fiveday meeting a large majority of the 705 delegates clearly endorsed the churchs liberal stance Spokesmen for the biblical witness organization stressed that conservatives in the United Church of Christ did not identify with the view of conservatives or fundamentalists in some other denominations We would be too liberal for the Moral Majority types said the Rev Gerald Sanders of Hickory NC a member of the board of directors for the biblical witness groups While they strongly disagree with some pronouncements of the United Church of Christ the conservatives do not advocate withdrawing from the organization ousting its liberal leadership or withholding funds from the church The debate on social issues including racial justice voting rights and the need to learn a second language as a form of Christian witness was rarely heated and occasionally dwelt more on the processes involved in passing resolutions than on the content of the resolutions Dr Post commented We have not found it difficult to be brothers and sisters to each other in our very diverse church and its in our blood and bones to hear each other out Choosing family life alongside the peace issue as a priority for the church was seen as a way of responding to the views expressed by the biblical witness organization Reversal of Arms Race Sought The goals adopted by the denomination for its emphasis on peace declare that the church will create programs aimed at reversing the arms race and the dependence of the United States and world economies on the production of armaments Delegates also overwhelmingly approved the declaration stating that the development and use of nuclear biological and chemical weapons be recognized as completely contrary to the will of Christ An attempt to amend the statement on peace by saying that the church endorses a strong trained and equipped military deterrent force for the United States failed and Dr Post said later he did not want the church to qualify its support for peacemaking activities We want to use peace as the pivot from which United States policy is made Dr Post said The pivot now is military preparedness
RELIGIOUS PARTIES IN ISRAEL LEANING TO BEGIN COALITION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/02/us/religious-parties-in-israel-leaning-to-begin-coalition.html,Israels religious parties crucial to the formation of the next government indicated today that they would prefer entering a coalition with Prime Minister Menachem Begins Likud bloc rather than with the Labor Party of Shimon Peres As ballots still being counted from yesterdays elections continued to show a close race Mr Begin went into negotiations on such a coalition with aides predicting an agreement next week The Prime Minister met briefly with the head of the National Religious Party Interior Minister Yosef Burg who said that most of his members wanted a government headed by Mr Begin Rabbi Pinhas Menachem Alter chairman of the other major religious party Agudath Israel was quoted by the Israeli press as calling any arrangement with Labor remote and expressing pride in having been part of the Begin Government for the last four years Hard Bargaining Ahead Labor Party leaders however were reported ready to do some hard bargaining in an effort to attract religious parties away from Likud especially in the event that the final totals give Labor a slight edge in the 120member Parliament Based on the votes already counted plus data from sample precincts the Israeli television poll taker and statistician Hanoch Smith projected 49 seats for Labor and 48 for Likud with some fluctuation possible after ballots from about 100000 soldiers are counted tomorrow With the voting over the White House said the United States would send six F16 fighterbombers to Israel later this month as scheduled In addition according to Administration sources President Reagan will also soon permit the delivery of four other F16s which was suspended after Israel bombed an Iraqi nuclear reactor with Americanbuilt planes on June 7 Page A4 Compromises on Social Issues The Israeli Labor Partys determination to pursue a coalition arrangement is expected to be influenced by the final election tally With a lead of one or two seats one political adviser to the party explained some leaders would apparently be willing to make the compromises on certain social issues that would be necessary to bring the religious parties into a government The issues include abortion autopsies religious teaching in the public schools as well as purely political questions of patronage and power Israeli political reporters doubt that Labor could make much compromise without facing a rebellion in its more liberal ranks The religious parties fared better under Mr Begin than they did under 29 years of Labor governments of which the National Religious Party was also a member Mr Burg for example was not only Interior Minister a key patronage post through which government funds are channeled to religious institutions with little monitoring but he was also head of Israels delegation to the Palestinian autonomy talks with Egypt and the United States an important role that Labor could not be expected to assign him In addition the National Regligious Party was given the key portfolio of Education Minister under the Begin Government leading to complaints by some parents that their children in the nominally nonreligious sector of the public school system were being given a large amount of religious instruction Again liberals within the Labor Party have stated their opposition to the Education Ministry post being given to the Burg party On social issues Mr Begin kept his commitment to Agudath Israel to support the repeal of a law that practically allowed abortion on demand And he went along with a tightening of the autopsy statute which now prohibits organ transplants or autopsies when a relative objects Doctors have criticized the law as an impediment to medical research and the performance of lifesaving functions These changes are anathema to many in the Labor Party Odds in Begins Favor Finally the National Religious Party which once confined its interest to matters of religious observance  insuring that no public transit ran on the Sabbath for example  has grown politicized and involved in foreign policy especially in support of Jewish settlements on the West Bank which Mr Begin favors Consequently the odds seem to be in Mr Begins favor although the negotiations are expected to take at least several weeks Under Israeli law the President Yitzhak Navon is to ask a Parliament member to form a government once the final official returns are in There is no legal requirement that the member asked be the head of the party with a plurality although this has been the custom in the past As a result Mr Peres and his associates are reportedly hoping for at least a oneseat advantage over Likud to enable them to make the case for Labors being the first to be asked to try to form a majority coalition Then there is some slim hope of negotiating successfully with the National Religious Party and several small parties that might provide a bare majority No Nationwide Slates But Mr Burg said today that an agreement with Likud is a strong possiblity the other is a weak possiblity Some of his members had advocated a government of national unity including Labor under Mr Begin as Prime Minister Mr Peres rejected the suggestion The slowness of the count was a result of the lack of voting machines Israelis use paper ballots The voter chooses the ballot marked with the lettercode of the party he wishes to vote for and seals it in an envelope Votes are cast only for nationwide slates not for locally elected legislators The members of Parliament have no geographical constituencies with the result that smallinterest parties have a better chance of gaining seats
WOMEN DISCUSS POWER AND HOW TO USE IT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/style/women-discuss-power-and-how-to-use-it.html,Women who want power should build coalitions even if it means being in a room with people they cant stand They should also try to get on boards join labor unions and support political candidates who are working for womens issues And once they gain power they should not act like men These were some of the things that 800 women and 100 men from 46 states most of them employed in the human services field were told Wednesday during an allday session called Women and Power It was part of the third annual Women in Crisis conference held this week at the Sheraton Centre I believe in the holdyournose theory of coalition building Carol Bellamy president of the New York City Council said at the plenary session Even if you cant stand to be in the same room with certain people join together with them to gain more power and influence Joyce D Miller the first woman to sit on the executive council of the AFLCIO struck a theme that was to be repeated by speakers throughout the day that women who do gain power have an obligation to reach back to our sisters behind the door and help them move ahead It isnt just power to women that matters she cautioned We have to give power to the right women women who use that power to help other women Were behind the times if we think that all women who gain power are good As an example she listed Margaret Thatcher the British Prime Minister who she said did not use her power to help women Then speaking of the politically conservative women who are being mentioned as candidates for the Supreme Court she said And we may soon have a woman Supreme Court Justice who may vote against the interests of women Miss Miller told the audience that twothirds of the women in the work force were not there to build careers and gain power but were there out of desperate necessity She said that 80 percent of the women in the work force were in deadend lowstatus jobs and that women in general still earn only 59 cents for every 1 earned by their male counterparts The session on power was held said Jane Velez executive director of the Women in Crisis conference because of the interest the delegates had shown in workshops dealing with women and power at the first two Women in Crisis conferences Women in the human services field tend to move horizontally rather than vertically she said So this year we decided to have a daylong program about some of the problems they have in common that center around power leadership and management Miss Velez and her staff persuaded some of the most influential women on the East Coast to take part in the program including Mary Burke Nicholas director of the New York State Womens Division Office of the Governor and a founder of 100 Black Women Patricia Carbine publisher of Ms Magazine Nan Talese executive editor Houghton Mifflin Company Liz Claiborne head of her own fashion design business Marife Hernandez former United States chief of protocol in New York Felice N Schwartz president of Catalyst Letitia Baldrige president of her own public relations company Judith Mello president of the First Womens Bank in New York and Colleen Dewhurst the actress Advised to Continue Acting As Women Miss Mello and Miss Dewhurst both stressed in their speeches that women once they gain power should not try to turn themselves into men We should try to bring to any power what we have as women Miss Dewhurst said in a panel discussion on Women and the Arts We will destroy it all if we try to imitate that absolutely unfeeling driving ambition that we have seen coming at us from across the desk Miss Carbine told of the seductive feeling she had had for many years while working at Look magazine and that she had often been the only woman in the room at important staff meetings I think that many women believe in this queen bee syndrome that they are the only woman in the room because they are the only woman qualified to be there I now realize that there were many others up and down 57th Street who were just as qualified as I was who just didnt get the breaks Grace Lichtenstein author of the new book Machisma Women and Daring Doubleday 1495 described the personality traits of dozens of women with power  business executives sports stars and politicians  she had interviewed for her book They all tended to be tomboys as kids she said in a panel discussion and they had a strong supportive father who tended to be the key parent rather than the mother They were often rebellious as kids and ran away from home at least once They are selfconfident optimistic active leaders rather than followers toughminded goaloriented and aware that theyre staking out nontraditional lives as women They often meet men who are threatened by them and try to thwart their ambitions but this only makes them more determined Joyce B Lazar chief of the social science section at the National Institute of Mental Health in Rockville Md also spoke on the reactions of men to women with power in her panel on Women in Authority The relationship with men changes when youre in authority she said Most resent you and feel threatened They will attack and belittle you in public She told about a recent incident in front of a crowd of 40 when a man said to her Tell me little lady whats on your little mind Fortunately she said I was prepared and I told him Another recurrent theme was The Superwoman Syndrome which was mentioned in several panels including one by that name In it Hildy Simmons of New York a working mother in her 30s with a 16monthold daughter said that many women her age believe that they have been misled by the womens movement which told us that we could have it all We were in college then she said and we graduated thinking that we could have a career a husband and children But were finding that it is very very difficult to have it all You can have it all Rea Lubar president of her own public relations firm said in another panel but be prepared to be always tired Polly Rothstein director of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion said in a panel on political power that women should give either their time or money to candidates working for womens issues Look at your checkbook and see what your priorities are she urged Is it

ETHICS OF GENE SPLICING TROUBLING THEOLOGIANS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/05/us/ethics-of-gene-splicing-troubling-theologians.html,The possibility of manufacturing new forms of life or genetically altering human beings who are described in Christian and Jewish Scriptures as created in the image of God is raising new problems for theologians attempting to assess the morality of modern bioethics The rapid advances in genetic research which has succeeded in fabricating living organisms by gene splicing or artificially combining genes mean that those who would play God will be tempted as never before according to a statement issued by officials of the National Council of Churches the United States Catholic Conference and the Synagogue Council of America But theologians interested in science and scientists versed in theology say that what constitutes playing God is as yet undefined The scriptures and traditions of religious communities do not address such modern scientific techniques Genetic engineering enables the scientist to create new life forms by altering existing species through rearranging the genes passed on from generation to generation A relatively new science it has expanded rapidly in the last six years and now has a number of industrial and medical applications Sometime in the future inherited illnesses may be eliminated by replacing abnormal genes carrying the diseases and tests are under way on genetically produced interferon an antivirus agent for humans Although the cloning of higher mammals is still highly theoretical rapid developments in genetic research have caused theologians to begin considering the ethical implications of such a possibility Some religious ethicists see genetic technology as simply another way of healing but others urge caution because they say neither the scientists nor the theologians have fully thought through the philosophical implications of cloning Medical uses of genetic research are generally accepted by religious thinkers and no theologians are worried about whether or not cloned bacteria have souls But ethicists are beginning to look at the more dramatic types of genetic engineering and are considering the social consequences of genetic medicine Most theologians do not want to perpetuate the old animosity between science and religion Many say that humanity is obliged to extend its understanding of creation Hardly anyone argues that the genetic research ought to be stopped provided scientists take appropriate safety measures Dominion Over Living Things Theologians find support for intervention in nature by citing the creation stories in the book of Genesis There after God has created the man and the woman in his own image he directs them to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth The Rev Richard McCormick Rose F Kennedy Professor of Christian Ethics at Georgetown University and author of How Brave a New World a study of bioethics says From the perspective that we are created in the image of a providential God we are free and intelligent beings sharing in our own future creating the conditions of our own growth or betterment Many theologians would agree that expansion of human knowledge that could enable the world to feed and care for itself more efficiently is one way God works in creation If genetic science is used to heal it is not only morally right it is morally imperative according to Dr Michael Weiss a biochemist and an Orthodox Jew studying at the Hastings Institute Dr Lane P Lester a conservative Christian biologist who teaches at Liberty Baptist College in Lynchburg Va says genetic engineering might be one way God is restoring perfection to a world flawed by sin According to Dr Lester the entrance of sin affected every aspect of humanity causing imperfection and disease Christian scientists he says are simply trying to return parts of the creation to their original state by for example eliminating diseases carried in the genes A liberal Christian ethicist Joseph Fletcher who enthusiastically endorses genetic engineering writes that humanity may owe it to posterity to overcome the evils of random reproduction namely genetic defects and the extinction of certain species In his 1979 book Humanhood the popularizer of situation ethics argues that our posterity has a claim on us  both as to its safety and as to its biological improvement Conflicting Views of Nature You have both the view that man is a steward of nature and should not interfere with it and precedents for intervening in nature for the greater good of humanity says Dr Daniel Callahan director of the Hasting Institute of Society Ethics and Life Sciences which sponsors extensive research in bioethics Both concepts have support in the JudeoChristian tradition he stated But among some theologians there remains a nagging uneasiness that creating a new kind of organism or altering the genetic composition of a human being is somehow different from breeding a hybrid potato Genetic sciences raise moral questions about what it means to be human says the Rev Robert Brungs a Jesuit who directs the Institute for Theological Encounter With Science and Technology in St Louis Its partly a question of how we look at ourselves and our bodies he said Are we to view them totally in terms of their function their physical perfection Speaking to 2700 doctors at a special audience last fall Pope John Paul II urged caution in medical research saying Science is not the highest value to which all the others must be subordinated Higher is the right of individuals to their physical and spiritual life and to their psychic and functional integrity A more direct objection to genetic engineering came this spring in an editorial in Sojourners a magazine published by a Christian commune in Washington Genetic engineering contradicts the character and style of Christs redemption which releases the captives to a restored wholeness not a manufactured one the editorial stated The lowly are to be respected and raised up not repaired or wiped out Orthodox Jewish theologians would also oppose producing a physically improved human race said Dr Weiss of the Hastings Institute Concern About Social Applications Many warnings about the morality of genetic research have to do with the social applications of the discoveries In their statement last year Dr Claire Randall general secretary of the National Council of Churches Rabbi Bernard Mandelbaum general secretary of the Synagogue Council of America and Bishop Thomas Kelly of the United States Catholic Conference said that control of such new life forms by any individual or group poses a potential threat to all of humanity The statement continued History has shown us that there will always be those who believe it approrriate to correct our mental and social structures by genetic means so as to fit their vision of humanity Dr Lester fears that some aspects of modern bioethics undercut the Bibles dictates for family life Cloning of humans or artificial insemination using a donor are unscriptural techniques according to Dr Lester a professor at the college founded by the Rev Jerry Falwell the television evangelist And since conservatives like Dr Lester are staunch foes of the theory of evolution he says We cannot believe that there is a better human waiting down the road to evolve Dr Karen Lebacqz professor of Christian ethics at the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley Calif who is working with the United Church of Christs study of bioethics says that by using the new techniques We are beginning to exercise a kind of quality control over children This is more than a practical question she says since traditionally in Christianity children were seen as a gift from God It is now possible to assess the health or determine the sex of a fetus in the womb and then seek an abortion and Dr Lebacqz said We are talking about rejecting a gift because of its quality And when we discuss improving our genetics she adds we arent sure what we really mean The traits we will probably look for  intelligence strength beauty  these may not be the most important characteristics What makes us human is how we relate to one another No ClearCut Answers in Literature People who look to the Bible for direct moral guidance on questions about genetic engineering will not find answers Dr Lebacqz said You will not find in the sources of faith anything but broad answers to these questions said Father McCormick The Christian faith provides certain basic themes and overall perspectives an outlook on the world One of these perspectives found in both Jewish and Christian thought is the view that persons have a relationship to God that gives them what ethicists call alien dignity a value that is not theirs but Gods This perspective has led to the formation of basic human values says Father McCormick It means that the JudeoChristian ethic places high value on caring for others making an effort in their behalf when they are in peril and never chosing against a basic good for humanity This perspective is especially important today Father McCormick contended since the peculiar temptation of a technologically advanced culture is to treat persons functionally The issues of genetic research are so novel you dont have any precedents Dr Callahan observed But he said he believed that some general principles might be found in three moral premises that have arisen in the debate First there is the principle of individual liberty encompassing not only a right to be left alone but a right to seek that which one desires if there is no demonstrable harm to others Hence the creation of testtube babies through in vitro fertilization is not morally abhorrent A second principal is the riskbenefit question which has dominated the scientists debate over research on DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid If the benefits obtained outweigh the risks the action is moral And third it is a common moral precept that it is better to try to do good than merely to avoid harm Dr Callahan said Church Studies Under Way To sharpen the issues and coordinate future research on bioethics some church bodies have established special panels on the subject although most churches give priority to issues they deem to have more immediate importance such as the arms race and human rights Presbyterians Congregationalists and Lutherans have special studies on bioethics under way The National Conference of Catholic Bishops has established a commission on science and technology It will be several years before any policy statements are developed While interest in the subject is growing some scientists believe as does Father Brungs that the religious thinkers are slow to recognize the importance of the topic Huge concepts are thrust upon us all at once he says We are hypnotized by the appliances but we are not getting below the machinery to the metaphysics
Feminism's Next Step,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/05/books/feminisms-next-step.html,The womens movement is over said my friend a usually confident executive who is also a wife and feminist At least she continued in a grim tone it is in my shop The men are making jokes about bimbos again and the other woman in the executive group and I just look at each other It doesnt matter if we get mad they act as if we arent there When a new job opens up all they look for now is men Its as if the word has gone out that weve lost our case there wont be any equal rights amendment after all so they dont need to worry anymore about lawsuits over sex discrimination even though laws against it are still on the books They figure they can do what they want about women now  or do nothing at all  like the old days The womens movement in some form will never be over But the rights that women have struggled to win in the last decade are in deadly danger with rightwing groups in Congress determined to gut laws against sex discrimination and to abolish legal abortion We now have less than 365 days to pass the equal rights amendment which is both the symbol and the substance of womens rights If ERA does not become part of the Constitution by June 30 1982 it may not come up again in this century And there are other signs that we have reached not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning Listening to my own daughter and others of her generation I sense something off out of focus going wrong From the daughters working so hard at their new careers determined not to be trapped as their mothers were expecting so much and taking for granted the opportunities we fought for Ive begun to hear undertones of pain and puzzlement almost a bitterness that they hardly dare admit As if with all those opportunities that we won for them they are reluctant to speak out loud about certain other needs some of us rebelled against  needs for love security men children family home I sense a frustration in women not so young about those careers theyre lucky to have facing agonizing conflicts over having children Can they have it all How I sense a desperation in divorced women and men and an unspoken fear of divorce in those still married which is being twisted into a backlash against equal rights that are more essential than ever for the divorced I sense a sullen impatience among some of those women who entered the work force in unprecedented millions over the last 10 years who are in fact earning 59 cents for every dollar men earn because the only jobs available to most women are still in the lowpaying clerical and service fields Even among the few who have broken through to the executive suite I sense the exhilaration of trying to be superwomen giving way to disillusionment with the tokens of power What is going wrong Why this uneasy sense of battles won only to be fought again of battles that should have been won and yet are not of battles that suddenly one does not really want to win and the weariness of battle altogether  how many feel it I and other feminists dread to discuss these troubling symptoms because the womens movement has been the source and focus of so much of our energy strength and security for so long We cannot conceive that it will not go on forever the same way it has for nearly 20 years But we cannot go on denying these puzzling symptoms of distress If they mean something is seriously wrong we had better find out and change direction yet again before it is too late I believe it is over the first stage We must now move into the second stage of the sexrole revolution which the womens movement set off In that first stage our aim was full participation power and voice in the mainstream  inside the party the political process the professions the business world But we were diverted from our dream by a sexual politics that cast man as enemy and seemed to repudiate the traditional values of the family In reaction against the feminine mystique which defined women solely in terms of their relation to men as wives mothers and homemakers we insidiously fell into a feminist mystique which denied that core of womens personhood that is fulfilled through love nurture home We seemed to create a polarization between feminists and those women who still looked to the family for their very identity not only among the dwindling numbers who were still fulltime housewives but also among women who do not get as much sense of worth or security from their jobs as they get  or wish they could get  from being someones wife or mother The very terms in which we fought for abortion or against rape or in opposition to pornography seemed to express a hate for men and a lack of reverence for childbearing that threatened those women profoundly That focus on sexual battles also took energy away from the fight for the equal rights amendment and kept us from moving to restructure work and home so that women could have real choices We fought for equality in terms of male power without asking what equality really means between women and men I believe that we have to break through our own feminist mystique now and move into the second stage  no longer against but with men In the second stage we have to transcend that polarization between feminism and the family We have to free ourselves from male power traps understand the limits of womens power as a separate interest group and grasp the possibility of generating a new kind of power which was the real promise of the womens movement For the second stage is not so much a fixed agenda as it is a process a mode that will put a new value on qualities once considered and denigrated as  special to women feminine qualities that will be liberated in men as they share experiences like child care These qualities used mainly in the private world of the family until now were previewed for the first time publicly in the womens movement now they will be used in a larger political sphere by both men and women We discovered the firststage limits  and the potential  of womens power in the last election After the momentous passage of the equal rights amendment by Congress in 1972 and approval by 35 of the 38 states needed to ratify a Constitutional amendment ERA had become deadlocked in the 15 unratified states Despite majority popular support as shown by the polls ERA was taken up as a target of rightwing political groups and became a focus for the reactionary political wave that was beginning to sweep the country Discussion of it bogged down in hysterical claims that the amendment would eliminate privacy in bathrooms encourage homosexual marriage put women in the trenches and deprive housewives of their husbands support What the equal rights amendment says is Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex What it would do is put half the population under the full protection of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights for the first time guaranteeing inalienable equal opportunity for women in employment education and other spheres It would also provide the basis for equality in social security marriage and divorce law pensions and military service The Republicans in fact probably lost the votes of the single largest voting bloc in this election as a result of the extreme stand they took on their platform repudiating the equal rights amendment vowing to amend the Constitution to outlaw abortion and pledging to appoint judges who concurred with these views It is noteworthy that there was a 16 percent difference between the voting of women and men in the 1980 Presidential election According to a New York TimesCBS News Poll Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter by an overwhelming 54 to 37 percent among men but only by 46 to 45 percent among women The majority of women 52 percent voted against Reagan  45 percent for Carter 7 percent for Anderson In the years since exit polls have been taken there has never been such a discrepancy between mens and womens voting In the previous Presidential election the male and female percentages were nearly identical Further women who were for the equal rights amendment voted overwhelmingly against Reagan  65 percent to 32 percent or more than 2 to 1 This womens rights bloc constituted 22 percent of the total vote a larger bloc than blacks 10 percent Hispanics 2 percent and Jews 5 percent combined or even than bluecollar workers 17 percent Women who opposed the ERA constituted only 15 percent of the vote and they supported Reagan even more avidly than men 66 percent compared with 29 percent for Carter For women as for men inflation was an overriding issue in the election Nevertheless for the majority of women to have voted against Reagan equality had to be a primary concern Polltakers could not understand why there was a difference between the voting of women and men They could not pin it to the specific issues of ERA and abortion only to a general impression that Carter would be better for women But in the four years of his Presidency Carter had delivered only one new state  Indiana  beyond the 34 that had ratified ERA before his election And he had also opposed Federal funds for poor womens abortions There are many things in life that are not fair he declared in 1977 Nine months before the election the board of the National Organization for Women resolved Anybody but Carter The womens rights groups united to defy Carters own commandos at the Democratic convention and won a stronger support of ERA and womens right to choose in the Democratic platform But Carter himself did not understand the weapon this gave him Only at the very end some of the fine feminists and shrewd female politicians in the Carter Administration  Eleanor Holmes Norton the chairman of the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Anne Wexler the Presidents assistant  enlisted the help of feminist leaders making a commitment to mobilize the full machinery of the White House for ERA and child care next time Too little too late If the Democrats had spent the same amount of energy courting women on the issues of equal rights as they spent courting blacks and Jews and other minorities  not only during the campaign but during Jimmy Carters four years in the White House  we might have had the equal rights amendment and the womens movement might have mobilized in earnest to reelect Carter As it turned out we mobilized in belated panic to defeat Reagan and contained our disgust with Carter But our help was not seriously sought nor deserved But the question must be asked Is the kind of power generated or implicit in the womens movement truly expressed in singleissue specialinterest politics There is a discrepancy between the power of the womens movement as an instrument for fundamental change in the consciousness of and about women and their role in society and the deadlocks and failures of the organized political movement on these single issues Of course it could be argued that the equal rights amendment is more than a single issue Surely half the population is more than a specialinterest group But no matter As the movement focused its energies on those issues it borrowed at least in part the dominant masculine technique of abstracting one issue from the total context and becoming locked into a winlose zerosum confrontation There was always a conflict between the womensorganization leaders who merely wanted to raise money and hire male lobbyists and those feminists who wanted to mobilize the unprecedented power of the womens movement using the actual energies of all the women out there who had changed their lives n the other hand in fighting for the equal rights amendment over the past 10 years women have grown discovered unsuspected strengths and skills and developed a consensus extending from traditional establishment groups like the Junior League and the YWCA the Girl Scouts the League of Women Voters Roman Catholic nuns Jewish and Protestant churchwomen union business and professional women to the new womens caucuses in every field as well as newly organized black and Chicano groups students and farm women and the proliferating mainstream to radical feminist organizations This consensus is infinitely broader than any specialinterest group of men In fact the movement for womens equal rights has won the support not only of the majority of men as reflected in polls but specific political support finally from labor leaders and civilrights and other specialinterest groups As Eleanor C Smeal the president of the National Organization for Women NOW has said Not a moment of it was wasted even if we never win It will take a miracle of political wisdom and survival skills for women to save the equal rights amendment by June 30 1982 The womens movement has made such miracles happen before The great march on Washington by thousands of women in the hot summer of 1979 made their real passion for equality clear enough to Congress to achieve extension of the traditional sevenyear deadline for ratification of Constitutional amendments For a miracle like that in the current reactionary political climate the leaders of every womans organization from NOW and the League of Women Voters to the most careeroriented professional womans caucuses and nonpolitical college sororities  would have to put aside their separate agendas They would have to give not only lipservice priority to ERA but they would have to summon an emergency mobilization of their members their staffs and their own treasuries even mortgaging their buildings to put all possible woman power into states like Virginia Georgia Oklahoma North Carolina as well as Illinois Missouri and Florida dividing the command of different states among the different organizations or agreeing to follow a combined command Republican politicians from President Reagan down would have to be made to understand that their responsibility for killing the equal rights amendment might be the margin for defeat for Republicans in 1984 And Democratic politicians would have to understand that our voting bloc  now larger than the traditional ethnic and bluecollar base  could be their only hope for power again in this century but only if they mobilize their still considerable political muscle expertise and flagging courage for equal rights for women as masterfully as they did to bring about the 960 defeat for cuts in oldage Social Security in the Senate And the seemingly apathetic me generation of students would have to be aroused as they havent been since the Vietnam War the daughters to pay their dues and insure the opportunities they now take for granted the sons to insure their own new dreams for more fulfilling lives The women who have had assertiveness training and learned to dress for success would have to apply the hard skills and money from their own careers to insure that the doors the womens movement forced open dont close on them The women afraid of divorce would have to see equal rights as the best insurance for themselves and their families against financial disaster Recently a welldressed woman in her 40s facing a crisis in her own 25year marriage told me of her despair at the inability of women leaders to get their act together and truly mobilize to meet the crisis of ERA Theyre not sure even now whether to ask women to go to Virginia or Georgia or Oklahoma They say we might rock the boat she said Dont they realize we have to rock the boat now Who handed them or even President Reagan the right to give up our daughters possibility to live lives of hope and equality for the rest of this century Its not a matter of the specific details of the change ERA will make in the laws of this state or that If we lose the ERA the rights we all take for granted now will be up to the whim of the individual judge again or the boss or husband We wont have real control over our own lives without equal rights in the Constitution That woman had gotten her own suburban friends who had never been near a NOW meeting or consciousnessraising group to pool their money to hire a top professional political consultant to assess the chances of passing ERA in the time left One teenager contributed 800 she had raised babysitting for ERA More valuable than the study itself  which showed that passage of ERA was still politically possible was the urgency of these women If only that could be made visible That energy is out there waiting for leadership And the fact is the most recent national poll conducted by Yankelovich Skelly and White in May 1981 confirming the conservative mood of the nation in support of Reagan on economic issues recorded a substantial 61 percent majority for passage of ERA as compared with 30 percent against Finally I think we have to face the fact that on June 30 1982 we may lose the battle to get equal rights for women into the Constitution  and consider the real consequences Many women whose own power in the executive suite or political arena arose from the womens movement for equality in a sense they have forgotten or never acknowledged in their own careers  will most surely lose that power Women who were persuaded that ERA was against the family and that all they needed was a man to take care of them the rest of their lives will have reason to fear financial disaster in divorce Leaders of specialinterest groups  men or women whose concerns are for the rights of homosexuals blacks Jews children the aged  may realize too late that defeat of the ERA which protects the rights of half the nation may doom the already threatened rights of much smaller interest groups If we had not been diverted by sexual politics we might not now be watching the dismantling of affirmativeaction programs against sex discrimination in education and employment by conservative extremists in the Senate The defeat of the Senators on the Moral Majority hit list Birch Bayh Frank Church John C Culver George S McGovern cannot be attributed solely to disgust with Carter or to Reagans coattails The womens movement has to assume some responsibility We underestimated the threat and did not mobilize ourselves in allout defense of the men who were explicitly targeted for defeat by the National Conservative Political Action Committee supposedly because they supported equal rights for women the right to abortion and homosexual rights Is a distorted sexual politics at work if the womens movement did not rise to the support of these men with the same passion as for instance it supported Bella Abzug or Elizabeth Holtzman in their Senate races Is a distorted sexual politics responsible for the lumping of these three issues together in such an inflammable sexually charged package It is all very well for leaders of the womens movement today to insist correctly that the equal rights amendment has nothing to do with either abortion or homosexuality  in fact it has nothing to do with sexual behavior at all But the sexual politics that distorted the sense of priorities of the womens movement during the 1970s made it easy for the socalled Moral Majority to lump ERA with homosexual rights and abortion into one explosive package of licentious familythreatening sex here is no doubt that the radical right with its almost unlimited money is using abortion and homosexuality as a red herring For surely homosexality and abortion are not the main problems in America today But up through history to Hitler and the Ayatollah and not exempting Stalinist Russia control and manipulation of sexuality and the family and suppression of the rights and personhood of women have been key elements in authoritarian power The emotions and repressions linked to sexuality are so powerful that it is also relatively easy to divert peoples attention from their own basic economic interests and even from asking the tough political questions simply by manipulating sexual hysteria The Founding Fathers of this republic wrote into the Bill of Rights the protection of certain basic areas of privacy Surely it is politically unwise to seem to threaten that area of inviolate sexual privacy now as part of an effort to secure these basic rights for women Tactics that smack of sexual exhibitionism even slogans like sexual preference distort the basic principle they seem to invade that very right of privacy for which we fight Maybe there was something slightly off in the way we handled abortion Such slogans as free abortion on demand had connotations of sexual permissiveness affronting not only the moral values of conservatives but implying a certain lack of reverence for life and the mysteries of conception and birth After all why do feminists seem to be fighting for abortion against women who say they are fighting for the right to life How can we fight the real battle in such terms Who is really for abortion That is like being for mastectomy I myself am for life I am for the choice to have children which those who would ban access to safe legal medical abortion endanger The true potential of womens power can be realized only by transcending the false polarization between feminism and the family It is an abstract polarization that does not exist in real life For instead of the polarization that has plagued the womens movement in the last few years and prevented the very possibility of political solutions new research shows that virtually all women today share a basic core of commitment to the family and to their own equality within and beyond it as long as family and equality are not seen to be in conflict One such study Juggling Contradictions Womens Ideas About Families was conducted by Nancy Bennett Susan Harding et al of the Social Science Research Community at the University of Michigan in 1979 The 33 women in this study were between the ages of 28 and 45 white with children living in small and mediumsize Michigan cities A third of the women had some college education most of the families had an income of between 15000 and 30000 and more than half the women were employed most of them part time at jobs ranging from selling real estate to nursing hairdressing and cleaning houses The researchers admitted that their preconceptions and practically everything they had read had prepared them to put the women they interviewed into two categories  familial or individualistic The familial ideology places a tremendous value on the family and on motherhood both as an activity and as a source of identity It holds that family  husband and children  should be the primary focus of a womans life and that the needs of the family should be placed above all else In contrast the individualistic ideology places the individual on an equal level with the family mothers have needs and goals to meet as persons apart from the family The researchers reported Instead of finding categories of women we found categories of ideas  bits and pieces of two distinct belief systems  familial and individualistic ideologies None of the women we spoke with subscribed completely to one ideology or the other they all expressed some combination of the two in their words and in their lives The ideologies are opposed in the political arena  The women we spoke with however did not present these ideas as contradictory The researchers stressed We were not surprised to find conflicting ideas or ideologies expressed by the women we interviewed but to find them combined in the views and behavior of each woman The tension between the two ideologies  womanasindividual and womanservingherfamily  looked irreconcilable in the abstract but was in fact reconciled in the womens lives They worked usually part time or on different shifts from their husbands shared child care with husbands or grandmothers or others and approved of childcare centers even if they were not yet ready to use them themselves Even those who themselves symbolize or preach one or the other ideology can be seen combining both in their own lives When Rosebeth Moss Kanter the eminent sociologist and author of Men and Women in the Corporation takes her 2yearold son to a board meeting her partnerhusband Barry takes over with the child They describe this arrangement in feminist terms But when Marabel Morgan saves her marriage not by decking her body in ostrich feathers but by enlisting her husband as partnermanager to keep track of and invest the money she earns lecturing on Total Womanhood she describes this as feminine not feminist There are not two kinds of women in America The political polarization between feminism and the family was preached and manipulated by extremists on the right  and colluded in perhaps unconsciously by feminist and liberal or radical leaders  to extend or defend their own political power Now as ideological polarization is being resolved in real life by juggling and rationalizing new necessities in traditional terms and old necessities in feminist terms women will strengthen the family in evolving ways Politically for the womens movement to continue to promote issues like ERA abortion and child care solely in individualistic terms subverts our own moral majority Economic necessity and the very survival of the family now force the increasing majority of women to work and to make painful choices about having more children And women who merely tolerated or even disapproved of these concerns will now face them as matters of concrete personal urgency and the survival of their families The womens movement has appealed to women as individualists the Moral Majority has played to and elicited an explosive defensive reaction on behalf of women as upholders of the family Perhaps the reactionary preachers of the Moral Majority who decry womens moves to equality as threats to the family are merely using the family to limit womens real political power In a similar vein feminists intent on mobilizing womens political power are in fact defeating their own purpose by denying the importance of the family That Michigan study showed something very important All the women believed in equality and all of them believed in the family  from the same or converging needs for security identity and some control over their lives Whether or not they supported a particular issue depended on how they perceived its affecting them No appeal would be acceptable even to the most individualistic if it denied or conflicted with their commitment to the family which they all shared Family is not just a buzz word for reactionaries for women as for men it is the symbol of that last area where one has any hope of control over ones destiny of meeting ones most basic human needs of nourishing that core of personhood threatened now by vast impersonal institutions and uncontrollable corporate and government bureaucracies Against these menaces the family may be as crucial for survival as it used to be against the untamed wilderness and the raging elements and the old simple kinds of despotism For the family all psychological science tells us is the nutrient of our humanness of all our individuality The Michigan women and all the others they exemplify may show great political wisdom as well as personal survival skills in holding on to the family as the base of their identity and human control It is time to start thinking of the movement in new terms It is very important indeed that the daughters  and the sons  hold on to the dream of equality in the years ahead and move consciously to the second stage of the sexrole revolution If we cannot at this moment solve the new problems we can no longer deny we must at least pass on the right questions These secondstage questions reflect the most urgent problems now facing this nation There is a quiet movement of American men that is converging on the womens movement though it is masked at the moment by a resurgence of machismo This movement of men for selffulfillment beyond the rat race for success and for a role in the family beyond breadwinner makes it seem that women are seeking power in terms men are leaving behind Even those women who have made it on such terms are forfeiting the quality of life exchanging their old martyred service of home and children for harassed passive service of corporation In the second stage women have to say No to standards of success on the job set in terms of men who had wives to take care of all the details of life and standards at home set in terms of women whose whole sense of worth and power had to come from that perfectly run house those perfectly controlled children Instead of accepting that double burden women will realize that they can and must give up some of that power in the home and the family when they are carrying part of the breadwinning burden and some beginnings of power on the job Instead of those rigid contracts that seemed the feminist ideal in the first stage there will be in the second stage an easy flow as man and woman share the chores of home and children  sometimes 5050 sometimes 2080 or 6040 according to their abilities and needs In the second stage the woman will find and use her own strength and style at work instead of trying so hard to do it mans way and she will not feel she has to be more independent than any man for fear that she will fall back into that abject dependence that she sometimes secretly yearns for Politically instead of focusing on woman as victim and on sexual battles that dont really change anything like those marches against pornography feminists in the second stage will forge new alliances with men from unions church and corporation that are essential if we are to restructure jobs and home on a human basis In the second stage questions like Should women be drafted will be obsolete for it will be understood that for the nations survival women simply will have to be drafted if a major war threatens With the dangers of nuclear holocaust new questions need to be asked about the defense of the nation that demand a sensitivity to human values and to life on the part of both male and female military leaders Above all the second stage involves not a retreat to the family but embracing the family in new terms of equlity and diversity The choice to have children  and the joys and burdens of raising them  will be so costly and precious that it will have to be shared more equally by mother father and others from or in place of the larger family The tradeoffs will be seen more clearly as both men and women become realistic about the values and the price It will probably not be possible economically for most women to have a real choice to be just a housewife fulltime or lifelong But men as well as women will be demanding parental leave or reduced schedules for those few years  or in early middle or later life for their own rebirth A voucher system such as Milton Friedman and other conservatives have already proposed for different purposes could be used to provide a child allowance payable perhaps as a tax rebate to every man or women who takes primary responsibility for care of a child or dependent parent at home She or he would get equal credit in the wageearning spouses pension and oldage Social Security vestment this credit would not be lost in case of divorce If both parents returned to work and shared childcare responsibilities they could use those vouchers to help pay for child care in the community Many advanced nations have such a child or family allowance And in the second stage unions and companies will begin to give priority to restructuring hours of work  flextime and flexible benefit packages  not just to help women but because men will be demanding them and because improved quality of work will not only cost less but yield greater results in terms of reduced absenteeism increased productivity and profit than the conventional package But in the second stage when we talk about family we will no longer mean just Mom and Dad
and the kids We will be more keenly aware of how the needs of both women and men for love and intimacy and emotional and economic sharing and support change over time and of the new shapes family can take In the second stage we will need new forms of homes and apartments that dont depend on the fulltime service of the housewife and new shared housing for single parents and people living alone  widowed married and divorced  who are the largest new group in the population The only bright spot in the housing market this past year was the great increase in sales of homes and condominiums to single women living alone But since in fact it takes two incomes to buy housing today banks and boards of condominiums and mortgage lending officers will increasingly be faced with requests for mortgages or leases by two three or more persons unrelated by blood or marriage The common interests of all these kinds of families will create the basis for a new political alliance for the second stage that may not be a womens movement Men may be  must be  at the cutting edge of the second stage Women were reborn in effect merely by moving across into mans world In the first stage it almost seemed as if women and men were moving in opposite directions reversing roles or exchanging one halflife for another In the second stage we will go beyond the eitheror of superwoman or total woman and house husband or urban cowboy to a new wholeness an integration in our personal lives of the masculine and feminine in each of us in all our infinite personal variety not unisex but new human sex If we can move beyond the false polarities and singleissue battles and appreciate the limits and true potential of womens power we will be able to join with men  follow or lead  in the new human politics that must emerge beyond reaction It will be a new passionate volunteerism an activism that comes out of living these new problems for which there may be no single answer It must have the same kind of relevance to the vital interests in life of both men and women and meet the same needs for higher purpose and communality as did the womens movement Now those whose roots are in the service of life must have the strength to ask if no one else does what should government be responsible for if not for the needs of people in life And the strength to start from those real needs of life to take back government for the people The second stage may even now be evolving out of or aside from what we have thought of as our battle I know that equality the personhood we fought for is truly necessary for women  and opens new life for men But I hear now what I could not hear before  the fears and feelings of some who have fought against our movement It is not just a conspiracy of reactionary forces though such forces surely play upon and manipulate those fears There is no going back The womens movement was necessary But the liberation that began with the womens movement isnt finished The equality we fought for isnt livable isnt workable isnt comfortable in the terms that structured our battle The first stage the womens movement was fought within and against and defined by that old structure of unequal polarized male and female sex roles But to continue reacting against such structure is still to be defined and limited by its terms Whats needed now is to transcend those terms and transform the structure itself How do we surmount the reaction that threatens to destroy the very gains we thought we had already won in the first stage of the womens movement How do we surmount our own reaction which shadows our feminism and our femininity we blush even to use that word now How do we transcend the polarization between women and women and between women and men to achieve the new human wholeness that is the promise of feminism and get on with solving the concrete practical everyday problems of living working and loving as equal persons This is the personal and political business of the second stage,,
FEMINISM'S NEXT STEP,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/05/magazine/feminism-s-next-step.html,The womens movement is over said my friend a usually confident executive who is also a wife and feminist At least she continued in a grim tone it is in my shop The men are making jokes about bimbos again and the other woman in the executive group and I just look at each other It doesnt matter if we get mad they act as if we arent there When a new job opens up all they look for now is men Its as if the word has gone out that weve lost our case there wont be any equal rights amendment after all so they dont need to worry anymore about lawsuits over sex discrimination even though laws against it are still on the books They figure they can do what they want about women now  or do nothing at all  like the old days The womens movement in some form will never be over But the rights that women have struggled to win in the last decade are in deadly danger with rightwing groups in Congress determined to gut laws against sex discrimination and to abolish legal abortion We now have less than 365 days to pass the equal rights amendment which is both the symbol and the substance of womens rights If ERA does not become part of the Constitution by June 30 1982 it may not come up again in this century And there are other signs that we have reached not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning Listening to my own daughter and others of her generation I sense something off out of focus going wrong From the daughters working so hard at their new careers determined not to be trapped as their mothers were expecting so much and taking for granted the opportunities we fought for Ive begun to hear undertones of pain and puzzlement almost a bitterness that they hardly dare admit As if with all those opportunities that we won for them they are reluctant to speak out loud about certain other needs some of us rebelled against  needs for love security men children family home I sense a frustration in women not so young about those careers theyre lucky to have facing agonizing conflicts over having children Can they have it all How I sense a desperation in divorced women and men and an unspoken fear of divorce in those still married which is being twisted into a backlash against equal rights that are more essential than ever for the divorced I sense a sullen impatience among some of those women who entered the work force in unprecedented millions over the last 10 years who are in fact earning 59 cents for every dollar men earn because the only jobs available to most women are still in the lowpaying clerical and service fields Even among the few who have broken through to the executive suite I sense the exhilaration of trying to be superwomen giving way to disillusionment with the tokens of power What is going wrong Why this uneasy sense of battles won only to be fought again of battles that should have been won and yet are not of battles that suddenly one does not really want to win and the weariness of battle altogether  how many feel it I and other feminists dread to discuss these troubling symptoms because the womens movement has been the source and focus of so much of our energy strength and security for so long We cannot conceive that it will not go on forever the same way it has for nearly 20 years But we cannot go on denying these puzzling symptoms of distress If they mean something is seriously wrong we had better find out and change direction yet again before it is too late I believe it is over the first stage We must now move into the second stage of the sexrole revolution which the womens movement set off In that first stage our aim was full participation power and voice in the mainstream  inside the party the political process the professions the business world But we were diverted from our dream by a sexual politics that cast man as enemy and seemed to repudiate the traditional values of the family In reaction against the feminine mystique which defined women solely in terms of their relation to men as wives mothers and homemakers we insidiously fell into a feminist mystique which denied that core of womens personhood that is fulfilled through love nurture home We seemed to create a polarization between feminists and those women who still looked to the family for their very identity not only among the dwindling numbers who were still fulltime housewives but also among women who do not get as much sense of worth or security from their jobs as they get  or wish they could get  from being someones wife or mother The very terms in which we fought for abortion or against rape or in opposition to pornography seemed to express a hate for men and a lack of reverence for childbearing that threatened those women profoundly That focus on sexual battles also took energy away from the fight for the equal rights amendment and kept us from moving to restructure work and home so that women could have real choices We fought for equality in terms of male power without asking what equality really means between women and men I believe that we have to break through our own feminist mystique now and move into the second stage  no longer against but with men In the second stage we have to transcend that polarization between feminism and the family We have to free ourselves from male power traps understand the limits of womens power as a separate interest group and grasp the possibility of generating a new kind of power which was the real promise of the womens movement For the second stage is not so much a fixed agenda as it is a process a mode that will put a new value on qualities once considered and denigrated as  special to women feminine qualities that will be liberated in men as they share experiences like child care These qualities used mainly in the private world of the family until now were previewed for the first time publicly in the womens movement now they will be used in a larger political sphere by both men and women We discovered the firststage limits  and the potential  of womens power in the last election After the momentous passage of the equal rights amendment by Congress in 1972 and approval by 35 of the 38 states needed to ratify a Constitutional amendment ERA had become deadlocked in the 15 unratified states Despite majority popular support as shown by the polls ERA was taken up as a target of rightwing political groups and became a focus for the reactionary political wave that was beginning to sweep the country Discussion of it bogged down in hysterical claims that the amendment would eliminate privacy in bathrooms encourage homosexual marriage put women in the trenches and deprive housewives of their husbands support What the equal rights amendment says is Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex What it would do is put half the population under the full protection of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights for the first time guaranteeing inalienable equal opportunity for women in employment education and other spheres It would also provide the basis for equality in social security marriage and divorce law pensions and military service The Republicans in fact probably lost the votes of the single largest voting bloc in this election as a result of the extreme stand they took on their platform repudiating the equal rights amendment vowing to amend the Constitution to outlaw abortion and pledging to appoint judges who concurred with these views It is noteworthy that there was a 16 percent difference between the voting of women and men in the 1980 Presidential election According to a New York TimesCBS News Poll Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter by an overwhelming 54 to 37 percent among men but only by 46 to 45 percent among women The majority of women 52 percent voted against Reagan  45 percent for Carter 7 percent for Anderson In the years since exit polls have been taken there has never been such a discrepancy between mens and womens voting In the previous Presidential election the male and female percentages were nearly identical Further women who were for the equal rights amendment voted overwhelmingly against Reagan  65 percent to 32 percent or more than 2 to 1 This womens rights bloc constituted 22 percent of the total vote a larger bloc than blacks 10 percent Hispanics 2 percent and Jews 5 percent combined or even than bluecollar workers 17 percent Women who opposed the ERA constituted only 15 percent of the vote and they supported Reagan even more avidly than men 66 percent compared with 29 percent for Carter For women as for men inflation was an overriding issue in the election Nevertheless for the majority of women to have voted against Reagan equality had to be a primary concern Polltakers could not understand why there was a difference between the voting of women and men They could not pin it to the specific issues of ERA and abortion only to a general impression that Carter would be better for women But in the four years of his Presidency Carter had delivered only one new state  Indiana  beyond the 34 that had ratified ERA before his election And he had also opposed Federal funds for poor womens abortions There are many things in life that are not fair he declared in 1977 Nine months before the election the board of the National Organization for Women resolved Anybody but Carter The womens rights groups united to defy Carters own commandos at the Democratic convention and won a stronger support of ERA and womens right to choose in the Democratic platform But Carter himself did not understand the weapon this gave him Only at the very end some of the fine feminists and shrewd female politicians in the Carter Administration  Eleanor Holmes Norton the chairman of the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Anne Wexler the Presidents assistant  enlisted the help of feminist leaders making a commitment to mobilize the full machinery of the White House for ERA and child care next time Too little too late If the Democrats had spent the same amount of energy courting women on the issues of equal rights as they spent courting blacks and Jews and other minorities  not only during the campaign but during Jimmy Carters four years in the White House  we might have had the equal rights amendment and the womens movement might have mobilized in earnest to reelect Carter As it turned out we mobilized in belated panic to defeat Reagan and contained our disgust with Carter But our help was not seriously sought nor deserved But the question must be asked Is the kind of power generated or implicit in the womens movement truly expressed in singleissue specialinterest politics There is a discrepancy between the power of the womens movement as an instrument for fundamental change in the consciousness of and about women and their role in society and the deadlocks and failures of the organized political movement on these single issues Of course it could be argued that the equal rights amendment is more than a single issue Surely half the population is more than a specialinterest group But no matter As the movement focused its energies on those issues it borrowed at least in part the dominant masculine technique of abstracting one issue from the total context and becoming locked into a winlose zerosum confrontation There was always a conflict between the womensorganization leaders who merely wanted to raise money and hire male lobbyists and those feminists who wanted to mobilize the unprecedented power of the womens movement using the actual energies of all the women out there who had changed their lives n the other hand in fighting for the equal rights amendment over the past 10 years women have grown discovered unsuspected strengths and skills and developed a consensus extending from traditional establishment groups like the Junior League and the YWCA the Girl Scouts the League of Women Voters Roman Catholic nuns Jewish and Protestant churchwomen union business and professional women to the new womens caucuses in every field as well as newly organized black and Chicano groups students and farm women and the proliferating mainstream to radical feminist organizations This consensus is infinitely broader than any specialinterest group of men In fact the movement for womens equal rights has won the support not only of the majority of men as reflected in polls but specific political support finally from labor leaders and civilrights and other specialinterest groups As Eleanor C Smeal the president of the National Organization for Women NOW has said Not a moment of it was wasted even if we never win It will take a miracle of political wisdom and survival skills for women to save the equal rights amendment by June 30 1982 The womens movement has made such miracles happen before The great march on Washington by thousands of women in the hot summer of 1979 made their real passion for equality clear enough to Congress to achieve extension of the traditional sevenyear deadline for ratification of Constitutional amendments For a miracle like that in the current reactionary political climate the leaders of every womans organization from NOW and the League of Women Voters to the most careeroriented professional womans caucuses and nonpolitical college sororities  would have to put aside their separate agendas They would have to give not only lipservice priority to ERA but they would have to summon an emergency mobilization of their members their staffs and their own treasuries even mortgaging their buildings to put all possible woman power into states like Virginia Georgia Oklahoma North Carolina as well as Illinois Missouri and Florida dividing the command of different states among the different organizations or agreeing to follow a combined command Republican politicians from President Reagan down would have to be made to understand that their responsibility for killing the equal rights amendment might be the margin for defeat for Republicans in 1984 And Democratic politicians would have to understand that our voting bloc  now larger than the traditional ethnic and bluecollar base  could be their only hope for power again in this century but only if they mobilize their still considerable political muscle expertise and flagging courage for equal rights for women as masterfully as they did to bring about the 960 defeat for cuts in oldage Social Security in the Senate And the seemingly apathetic me generation of students would have to be aroused as they havent been since the Vietnam War the daughters to pay their dues and insure the opportunities they now take for granted the sons to insure their own new dreams for more fulfilling lives The women who have had assertiveness training and learned to dress for success would have to apply the hard skills and money from their own careers to insure that the doors the womens movement forced open dont close on them The women afraid of divorce would have to see equal rights as the best insurance for themselves and their families against financial disaster Recently a welldressed woman in her 40s facing a crisis in her own 25year marriage told me of her despair at the inability of women leaders to get their act together and truly mobilize to meet the crisis of ERA Theyre not sure even now whether to ask women to go to Virginia or Georgia or Oklahoma They say we might rock the boat she said Dont they realize we have to rock the boat now Who handed them or even President Reagan the right to give up our daughters possibility to live lives of hope and equality for the rest of this century Its not a matter of the specific details of the change ERA will make in the laws of this state or that If we lose the ERA the rights we all take for granted now will be up to the whim of the individual judge again or the boss or husband We wont have real control over our own lives without equal rights in the Constitution That woman had gotten her own suburban friends who had never been near a NOW meeting or consciousnessraising group to pool their money to hire a top professional political consultant to assess the chances of passing ERA in the time left One teenager contributed 800 she had raised babysitting for ERA More valuable than the study itself  which showed that passage of ERA was still politically possible was the urgency of these women If only that could be made visible That energy is out there waiting for leadership And the fact is the most recent national poll conducted by Yankelovich Skelly and White in May 1981 confirming the conservative mood of the nation in support of Reagan on economic issues recorded a substantial 61 percent majority for passage of ERA as compared with 30 percent against Finally I think we have to face the fact that on June 30 1982 we may lose the battle to get equal rights for women into the Constitution  and consider the real consequences Many women whose own power in the executive suite or political arena arose from the womens movement for equality in a sense they have forgotten or never acknowledged in their own careers  will most surely lose that power Women who were persuaded that ERA was against the family and that all they needed was a man to take care of them the rest of their lives will have reason to fear financial disaster in divorce Leaders of specialinterest groups  men or women whose concerns are for the rights of homosexuals blacks Jews children the aged  may realize too late that defeat of the ERA which protects the rights of half the nation may doom the already threatened rights of much smaller interest groups If we had not been diverted by sexual politics we might not now be watching the dismantling of affirmativeaction programs against sex discrimination in education and employment by conservative extremists in the Senate The defeat of the Senators on the Moral Majority hit list Birch Bayh Frank Church John C Culver George S McGovern cannot be attributed solely to disgust with Carter or to Reagans coattails The womens movement has to assume some responsibility We underestimated the threat and did not mobilize ourselves in allout defense of the men who were explicitly targeted for defeat by the National Conservative Political Action Committee supposedly because they supported equal rights for women the right to abortion and homosexual rights Is a distorted sexual politics at work if the womens movement did not rise to the support of these men with the same passion as for instance it supported Bella Abzug or Elizabeth Holtzman in their Senate races Is a distorted sexual politics responsible for the lumping of these three issues together in such an inflammable sexually charged package It is all very well for leaders of the womens movement today to insist correctly that the equal rights amendment has nothing to do with either abortion or homosexuality  in fact it has nothing to do with sexual behavior at all But the sexual politics that distorted the sense of priorities of the womens movement during the 1970s made it easy for the socalled Moral Majority to lump ERA with homosexual rights and abortion into one explosive package of licentious familythreatening sex here is no doubt that the radical right with its almost unlimited money is using abortion and homosexuality as a red herring For surely homosexality and abortion are not the main problems in America today But up through history to Hitler and the Ayatollah and not exempting Stalinist Russia control and manipulation of sexuality and the family and suppression of the rights and personhood of women have been key elements in authoritarian power The emotions and repressions linked to sexuality are so powerful that it is also relatively easy to divert peoples attention from their own basic economic interests and even from asking the tough political questions simply by manipulating sexual hysteria The Founding Fathers of this republic wrote into the Bill of Rights the protection of certain basic areas of privacy Surely it is politically unwise to seem to threaten that area of inviolate sexual privacy now as part of an effort to secure these basic rights for women Tactics that smack of sexual exhibitionism even slogans like sexual preference distort the basic principle they seem to invade that very right of privacy for which we fight Maybe there was something slightly off in the way we handled abortion Such slogans as free abortion on demand had connotations of sexual permissiveness affronting not only the moral values of conservatives but implying a certain lack of reverence for life and the mysteries of conception and birth After all why do feminists seem to be fighting for abortion against women who say they are fighting for the right to life How can we fight the real battle in such terms Who is really for abortion That is like being for mastectomy I myself am for life I am for the choice to have children which those who would ban access to safe legal medical abortion endanger The true potential of womens power can be realized only by transcending the false polarization between feminism and the family It is an abstract polarization that does not exist in real life For instead of the polarization that has plagued the womens movement in the last few years and prevented the very possibility of political solutions new research shows that virtually all women today share a basic core of commitment to the family and to their own equality within and beyond it as long as family and equality are not seen to be in conflict One such study Juggling Contradictions Womens Ideas About Families was conducted by Nancy Bennett Susan Harding et al of the Social Science Research Community at the University of Michigan in 1979 The 33 women in this study were between the ages of 28 and 45 white with children living in small and mediumsize Michigan cities A third of the women had some college education most of the families had an income of between 15000 and 30000 and more than half the women were employed most of them part time at jobs ranging from selling real estate to nursing hairdressing and cleaning houses The researchers admitted that their preconceptions and practically everything they had read had prepared them to put the women they interviewed into two categories  familial or individualistic The familial ideology places a tremendous value on the family and on motherhood both as an activity and as a source of identity It holds that family  husband and children  should be the primary focus of a womans life and that the needs of the family should be placed above all else In contrast the individualistic ideology places the individual on an equal level with the family mothers have needs and goals to meet as persons apart from the family The researchers reported Instead of finding categories of women we found categories of ideas  bits and pieces of two distinct belief systems  familial and individualistic ideologies None of the women we spoke with subscribed completely to one ideology or the other they all expressed some combination of the two in their words and in their lives The ideologies are opposed in the political arena  The women we spoke with however did not present these ideas as contradictory The researchers stressed We were not surprised to find conflicting ideas or ideologies expressed by the women we interviewed but to find them combined in the views and behavior of each woman The tension between the two ideologies  womanasindividual and womanservingherfamily  looked irreconcilable in the abstract but was in fact reconciled in the womens lives They worked usually part time or on different shifts from their husbands shared child care with husbands or grandmothers or others and approved of childcare centers even if they were not yet ready to use them themselves Even those who themselves symbolize or preach one or the other ideology can be seen combining both in their own lives When Rosebeth Moss Kanter the eminent sociologist and author of Men and Women in the Corporation takes her 2yearold son to a board meeting her partnerhusband Barry takes over with the child They describe this arrangement in feminist terms But when Marabel Morgan saves her marriage not by decking her body in ostrich feathers but by enlisting her husband as partnermanager to keep track of and invest the money she earns lecturing on Total Womanhood she describes this as feminine not feminist There are not two kinds of women in America The political polarization between feminism and the family was preached and manipulated by extremists on the right  and colluded in perhaps unconsciously by feminist and liberal or radical leaders  to extend or defend their own political power Now as ideological polarization is being resolved in real life by juggling and rationalizing new necessities in traditional terms and old necessities in feminist terms women will strengthen the family in evolving ways Politically for the womens movement to continue to promote issues like ERA abortion and child care solely in individualistic terms subverts our own moral majority Economic necessity and the very survival of the family now force the increasing majority of women to work and to make painful choices about having more children And women who merely tolerated or even disapproved of these concerns will now face them as matters of concrete personal urgency and the survival of their families The womens movement has appealed to women as individualists the Moral Majority has played to and elicited an explosive defensive reaction on behalf of women as upholders of the family Perhaps the reactionary preachers of the Moral Majority who decry womens moves to equality as threats to the family are merely using the family to limit womens real political power In a similar vein feminists intent on mobilizing womens political power are in fact defeating their own purpose by denying the importance of the family That Michigan study showed something very important All the women believed in equality and all of them believed in the family  from the same or converging needs for security identity and some control over their lives Whether or not they supported a particular issue depended on how they perceived its affecting them No appeal would be acceptable even to the most individualistic if it denied or conflicted with their commitment to the family which they all shared Family is not just a buzz word for reactionaries for women as for men it is the symbol of that last area where one has any hope of control over ones destiny of meeting ones most basic human needs of nourishing that core of personhood threatened now by vast impersonal institutions and uncontrollable corporate and government bureaucracies Against these menaces the family may be as crucial for survival as it used to be against the untamed wilderness and the raging elements and the old simple kinds of despotism For the family all psychological science tells us is the nutrient of our humanness of all our individuality The Michigan women and all the others they exemplify may show great political wisdom as well as personal survival skills in holding on to the family as the base of their identity and human control It is time to start thinking of the movement in new terms It is very important indeed that the daughters  and the sons  hold on to the dream of equality in the years ahead and move consciously to the second stage of the sexrole revolution If we cannot at this moment solve the new problems we can no longer deny we must at least pass on the right questions These secondstage questions reflect the most urgent problems now facing this nation There is a quiet movement of American men that is converging on the womens movement though it is masked at the moment by a resurgence of machismo This movement of men for selffulfillment beyond the rat race for success and for a role in the family beyond breadwinner makes it seem that women are seeking power in terms men are leaving behind Even those women who have made it on such terms are forfeiting the quality of life exchanging their old martyred service of home and children for harassed passive service of corporation In the second stage women have to say No to standards of success on the job set in terms of men who had wives to take care of all the details of life and standards at home set in terms of women whose whole sense of worth and power had to come from that perfectly run house those perfectly controlled children Instead of accepting that double burden women will realize that they can and must give up some of that power in the home and the family when they are carrying part of the breadwinning burden and some beginnings of power on the job Instead of those rigid contracts that seemed the feminist ideal in the first stage there will be in the second stage an easy flow as man and woman share the chores of home and children  sometimes 5050 sometimes 2080 or 6040 according to their abilities and needs In the second stage the woman will find and use her own strength and style at work instead of trying so hard to do it mans way and she will not feel she has to be more independent than any man for fear that she will fall back into that abject dependence that she sometimes secretly yearns for Politically instead of focusing on woman as victim and on sexual battles that dont really change anything like those marches against pornography feminists in the second stage will forge new alliances with men from unions church and corporation that are essential if we are to restructure jobs and home on a human basis In the second stage questions like Should women be drafted will be obsolete for it will be understood that for the nations survival women simply will have to be drafted if a major war threatens With the dangers of nuclear holocaust new questions need to be asked about the defense of the nation that demand a sensitivity to human values and to life on the part of both male and female military leaders Above all the second stage involves not a retreat to the family but embracing the family in new terms of equlity and diversity The choice to have children  and the joys and burdens of raising them  will be so costly and precious that it will have to be shared more equally by mother father and others from or in place of the larger family The tradeoffs will be seen more clearly as both men and women become realistic about the values and the price It will probably not be possible economically for most women to have a real choice to be just a housewife fulltime or lifelong But men as well as women will be demanding parental leave or reduced schedules for those few years  or in early middle or later life for their own rebirth A voucher system such as Milton Friedman and other conservatives have already proposed for different purposes could be used to provide a child allowance payable perhaps as a tax rebate to every man or women who takes primary responsibility for care of a child or dependent parent at home She or he would get equal credit in the wageearning spouses pension and oldage Social Security vestment this credit would not be lost in case of divorce If both parents returned to work and shared childcare responsibilities they could use those vouchers to help pay for child care in the community Many advanced nations have such a child or family allowance And in the second stage unions and companies will begin to give priority to restructuring hours of work  flextime and flexible benefit packages  not just to help women but because men will be demanding them and because improved quality of work will not only cost less but yield greater results in terms of reduced absenteeism increased productivity and profit than the conventional package But in the second stage when we talk about family we will no longer mean just Mom and Dad 
nd the kids We will be more keenly aware of how the needs of both women and men for love and intimacy and emotional and economic sharing and support change over time and of the new shapes family can take In the second stage we will need new forms of homes and apartments that dont depend on the fulltime service of the housewife and new shared housing for single parents and people living alone  widowed married and divorced  who are the largest new group in the population The only bright spot in the housing market this past year was the great increase in sales of homes and condominiums to single women living alone But since in fact it takes two incomes to buy housing today banks and boards of condominiums and mortgage lending officers will increasingly be faced with requests for mortgages or leases by two three or more persons unrelated by blood or marriage The common interests of all these kinds of families will create the basis for a new political alliance for the second stage that may not be a womens movement Men may be  must be  at the cutting edge of the second stage Women were reborn in effect merely by moving across into mans world In the first stage it almost seemed as if women and men were moving in opposite directions reversing roles or exchanging one halflife for another In the second stage we will go beyond the eitheror of superwoman or total woman and house husband or urban cowboy to a new wholeness an integration in our personal lives of the masculine and feminine in each of us in all our infinite personal variety not unisex but new human sex If we can move beyond the false polarities and singleissue battles and appreciate the limits and true potential of womens power we will be able to join with men  follow or lead  in the new human politics that must emerge beyond reaction It will be a new passionate volunteerism an activism that comes out of living these new problems for which there may be no single answer It must have the same kind of relevance to the vital interests in life of both men and women and meet the same needs for higher purpose and communality as did the womens movement Now those whose roots are in the service of life must have the strength to ask if no one else does what should government be responsible for if not for the needs of people in life And the strength to start from those real needs of life to take back government for the people The second stage may even now be evolving out of or aside from what we have thought of as our battle I know that equality the personhood we fought for is truly necessary for women  and opens new life for men But I hear now what I could not hear before  the fears and feelings of some who have fought against our movement It is not just a conspiracy of reactionary forces though such forces surely play upon and manipulate those fears There is no going back The womens movement was necessary But the liberation that began with the womens movement isnt finished The equality we fought for isnt livable isnt workable isnt comfortable in the terms that structured our battle The first stage the womens movement was fought within and against and defined by that old structure of unequal polarized male and female sex roles But to continue reacting against such structure is still to be defined and limited by its terms Whats needed now is to transcend those terms and transform the structure itself How do we surmount the reaction that threatens to destroy the very gains we thought we had already won in the first stage of the womens movement How do we surmount our own reaction which shadows our feminism and our femininity we blush even to use that word now How do we transcend the polarization between women and women and between women and men to achieve the new human wholeness that is the promise of feminism and get on with solving the concrete practical everyday problems of living working and loving as equal persons This is the personal and political business of the second stage Copyright c 1981 by Betty Friedan,,
THE E.R.A. COUNTDOWN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/05/opinion/the-era-countdown.html,It was cheering to read of the nationwide demonstrations last week to save the Equal Rights Amendment Three more states must ratify it before June 30 1982 or the amendment will die Nearly a decades effort now turns on a few dozen legislators in a handful of states  including North Carolina Illinois Florida and Missouri Many of these lawmakers have voted against the ERA before and will be urged to do so again It will be vital this time to vote on the merits of the amendment and not on the campaign of hyperbole and halftruths that swirl about it If the legislators heed what the Amendment says rather than what is said about it they could not in good conscience vote it down Its promise is simple overdue and just Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex That is not the clarion call to wild and reckless social change that its enemies depict The ERA would not usher in an era of coed restrooms and women on the battle field It is not even clear that the amendment would guarantee women the right to an abortion or to a coed draft or even to coed registration for military service Even so victory is important As Betty Friedan points out in The Times Magazine today the ERA is both the symbol and the substance of womens rights With it the achievement of greater equality would depend on the Constitution and not on the whims of politicians With it there would finally be as strong a Constitutional protection for sexual equality as there is for racial equality Defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment would not end the fight for sexual equality but it would make the battle more difficult and much more costly That should be intolerable in a nation committed to justice for all
Ideas & Trends; TALKING TELEVISION'S PULSE--A DEBATE OVER PRESSURE POINTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/05/weekinreview/ideas-trends-talking-television-s-pulse-a-debate-over-pressure-points.html,An old American tradition or censorship The line between democratic selfexpression and antidemocratic repression is often finely drawn as demonstrated recently by the Coalition for Better Broadcasting in its threat to boycott companies sponsoring television programs it considers offensive Last week the boycott was canceled but the questions it raised remain alive Formed in February the coalition claims to represent 300 mostly conservative antiabortion and religious groups with Moral Majority which demonstrated its formidable political clout in last years elections being its largest member and financier Remembering the notorious blacklists of the McCarthy era in the 1950s many television observers began to speak darkly about another pressure groups systematic attempts to become arbiter of taste and dictator of moral philosophy for the nation Times have changed however in one important respect In most cases the television advertiser no longer controls the content of a program The company purchases a schedule of spot ads in much the same manner that space may be bought in newspapers and magazines For the most part there is no direct involvement in program content although many advertisers are concerned about where their ads may appear Still the possibility of losing revenues through a boycott remains and last month the threat by unknown numbers of people in a group of uncertain strength sent executives of targeted companies off to the Memphis area to make peace with the coalition leaders According to the Rev Donald E Wildmon the coalitions founder the meetings demonstrated that advertisers basically shared the groups concerns and the boycott was called off Nevertheless the Rev Jerry Falwell founder of Moral Majority who with Phyllis Schlafly a leading opponent of the equal rights amendment accompanied Mr Wildmon at a news conference last week said his organization was raising funds for a war chest to buy and assist in buying fullpage ads across the nation naming public enemy No 1 or 2 or 3 or whoever they are and listing their products Do such tactics amount to censorship A spokesman for the coalition insists that all were asking for is a little balance in programming But critics even those with similar goals consider this disingenuous According to Everett Parker head of the United Church of Christs office of communications and perhaps the dean of broadcast reformers the thrust of the coalitions campaign is more negative than positive The coalition wants change through punishment he commented Another longtime critic of the networks Peggy Charren head of Action for Childrens Television distinguished her organizations tactics from the coalitions We believe in improving television by expanding the numbers and types of programs not by restricting programming she said Some observers argue that while many of the other pressure groups want to refine and expand certain aspects of television content the coalition wants to eliminate great chunks of the schedule so the TV product conforms with its views and visions Moreover the dominating presence of Moral Majority in its ranks suggests to some observers that the overriding concerns are not just social but political and religious For many the spectre of a new conformity is real and chilling On his side Mr Wildmon has been reminding anyone who will listen that boycotts are as American as apple pie There are certainly precedents  many of them ironically enough liberal  to bear him out The past couple of decades have seen black communities boycotting lunch counters war protestors boycotting chemical companies strike supporters boycotting lettuce Television has had its own history of citizen pressures Many groups have lobbied successfully in recent years for better representation on TV blacks Hispanics women homosexuals environmentalists PolishAmericans upset about Polish jokes New Yorkers upset about putdown New York jokes In the 1970s the National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting a group currently headed by Ralph Nader regularly and prominently identified advertisers whose spots appeared most frequently in violent programming No official boycotts were called but the strategy clearly involves sensitive matters of degree For the most part the television industry has resisted such pressures A CBS documentary The Guns of Autumn was opposed by gun lobbyists and avoided by potential sponsors The network aired it unsponsored ABCs Soap series continues though opposed by various conservative groups NBCs Jesus of Nazareth was broadcast despite opposition from several religious groups and CBS televised Playing for Time the story of a Jewish victim of a Nazi concentration camp starring Vanessa Redgrave an outspoken advocate of the Palestinian Liberation Organization though a number of Jewish groups protested Not only were these programs televised but significantly they all did well in the audience ratings Indeed indications are that if a boycott had come off the targeted sponsors might not have suffered much A poll commissioned by ABC for example showed that a maximum of 13 percent of the American public would consider supporting a boycott of that group only onehalf of 1 percent were Moral Majority members CBS News found that 30 percent of the groups listed by Mr Wildmon as coalition members said they did not belong to it An NBC survey concluded that only two programs  Threes Company and Soap would be turned off the screen by as many as 3 percent of the public because of sex profanity or violence they exhibit 12 would be turned off by 1 percent or less In other words boycott or no a lot of people would keep tuning in to watch Dallas and The Dukes of Hazzard The coalitions actions have produced inevitable reactions Norman Lear the TV producer has announced a media campaign called People for the American Way which will run ads to counter the intolerant messages and antidemocratic actions of moral majoritarians In another area cable television  especially paycable with its unsponsored programs and numerous channels that can cater to specific interest  may eventually make the threat of an advertiser boycott largely meaningless
Paperback Talk,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/05/books/paperback-talk.html,Censorship So far as writers are concerned there is no longer a law of obscenity So wrote Charles Rembar in The End of Obscenity a book widely reviewed when it was published 13 years ago As an attorney Mr Rembar had played a central role in the legal battles that lifted the bans on Lady Chatterleys Lover Tropic of Cancer and Fanny Hill Mr Rembar was unduly optimistic One of the reasons for the grave mood pervading the recent convention of the American Booksellers Association in Atlanta was the passage by the Georgia Assembly of a law that declares it to be a misdemeanor of the highest degree to display publicly in a place frequented by minors any book pocketbook or magazine containing material that may provoke or arouse lust or passion According to Maxwell Lillienstein the ABA counsel this is the first time in his recollection that something less than obscene has been banned in this country Laws of a similar sort but not as far reaching are on the books in Pennsylvania and in several municipalities in Los Angeles County Calif Similar apprehension was in the air this past week as censorship and its implications were discussed at a series of meetings during the American Library Association convention in San Francisco Judith Krug director of the ALAs Office for Intellectual Freedom reports that protests by local groups against the circulation of certain books by school and public libraries have tripled during the past year with 34 states heard from Such favorite targets of the past as JD Salingers The Catcher in the Rye Kurt Vonneguts SlaughterhouseFive and dictionaries that define bed as a verb have been joined by the Boston Womens Health Collectives Our Bodies Our Selves Judy Blumes stories for young people and Don Bredess novel of adolescence Hard Feelings The retreat from the victories celebrated by Mr Rembar began in 1973 when the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of Miller v California that criteria for obscenity must be set by local contemporary community standards It has been accelerated in the past year or two by the nationwide swing to conservatism and the proliferation of groups campaigning for their conception of morality The situation has been complicated by the fact that in many communities books particularly paperbacks are sold in the same stores as sophisticates  as the trade calls such magazines as Playboy and Penthouse In at least one instance a prosecutor anxious to please a local group suggested to dealers that they refrain from selling certain books and magazines until a court had ruled as to whether they were obscene Few retailers have the time or competence to judge each of the hundreds of new titles they offer for sale each month To meet the rising tide of vigilantism businessmen and professional people concerned about the fate of the book maintain a New Yorkbased organization to exchange information and take legal action when that seems advisable Media Coalition Inc is an alliance of the American Booksellers Association the Association of American Publishers the Council for Periodical Distributors Associations the International Periodical Distributors Association and the National Association of College Stores The American Library Association cooperates through its Office for Intellectual Freedom At the moment Media Coalition has suits in the courts contesting the constitutionality of both the Pennsylvania and Georgia laws How does an author whose works are a particular target of protesters feel about it all The question was asked of Judy Blume at a press conference during the ABA convention The parental groups responsible just dont want to deal with reality she replied She called the trend saddest for the kids  it stops real communication between them and their parents Morality One of the bestknown organizations currently working for political conservatism is Moral Majority Inc headed by Jerry Falwell a Lynchburg Va Baptist minister who presides over a syndicated television show called Old Time Gospel Hour Mr Falwell offers his blueprint for the

"REAGAN NOMINATING WOMAN, AN ARIZONA APPEALS JUDGE, TO SERVE ON",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/08/us/reagan-nominating-woman-an-arizona-appeals-judge-to-serve-on.html,SUPREME COURT BY STEVEN R WEISMAN WASHINGTON July 7  President Reagan announced today that he would nominate Sandra Day OConnor a 51yearold judge on the Arizona Court of Appeals to the United States Supreme Court If confirmed she would become the first woman to serve on the Court She is truly a person for all seasons  Mr Reagan said this morning possessing those unique qualities of temperament fairness intellectual Remarks on Court post page A12 capacity and devotion to the public good which have characterized the 101 brethren who have preceded her White House and Justice Department officials expressed confidence that Judge OConnors views were compatible with those espoused over the years by Mr Reagan who has been highly critical of some past Supreme Court decisions on the rights of defendants busing abortion and other matters Some Quick Opposition From the initial reaction in the Senate it appeared her nomination would be approved However her record of favoring the proposed Federal equal rights amendment and having sided once against antiabortion interests while she was a legislator provoked immediate opposition to her confirmation by the National Right to Life Committee Moral Majority and other groups opposed to abortion At a brief news conference in Phoenix Judge OConnor declined to explain her views saying that she intended to leave such matters to her confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee Page A12 Mr Reagan himself an opponent of abortions said in response to a question that he was completely satisfied with her position on that issue No Radical Shift Expected White House officials were hopeful that Judge OConnors appointment could be historic not only because she is a woman but also because her presence on the Court as a replacement for Associate Justice Potter Stewart who was often a swing vote between ideological camps on the Court could shift the Courts balance to the right However an examination of the Courts voting patterns suggests no radical shift is likely even if she does vote with the more conservative Justices News analysis page A13 It is the additional hope of Mr Reagans aides to make the Court even more conservative in the years ahead when more vacancies are possible Judge OConnor was appointed to Arizonas secondhighest court in 1979 by Gov Bruce Babbitt a Democrat after five years as an elected Superior Court judge in Maricopa County Ariz Before becoming a judge she served in the Arizona State Senate for six years With the selection Mr Reagan fulfilled a campaign promise last year to pick a woman for the Court at one of his earliest opportunities Associate Justice Stewart announced his retirement last month after 23 years on the Court In a brief statement before television cameras at the White House Mr Reagan urged the Senates swift bipartisan confirmation so that as soon as possible she may take her seat on the Court and her place in history Reagan Administration officials had said earlier that Mr Reagan placed a high priority on finding a woman with conservative views for the Court It seemed likely however that Judge OConnors past positions on issues linked to feminists would serve as a focus for any confirmation battle While a member of the Arizona Senate Judge OConnor at first advocated passage of the equal rights proposal and then for reasons that are unclear supported a different version that was regarded by some as less sweeping She is also on record as opposing a measure that would have outlawed abortions in some state facilities Personally Opposed to Abortions White House officials asserted that Judge OConnor had assured President Reagan in an Oval Office interview last Wednesday that she was personally opposed to abortions They quoted her as saying that she opposed the antiabortion measure only because it was not germane to the legislation to which it was attached and the Arizona Constitution forbids nongermane amendments But those officials also said that she felt the legality of abortions was a legitimate matter for the legislative branch to decide Abortion foes however also cited votes in which they said Mrs OConnor supported a 1970 bill to legalize abortion and a 1973 bill permitting Arizona state agencies to participate in family planning In response the White House said that there was no record of the 1970 vote and that contrary to what the antiabortion groups say the 1973 bill was not proabortion and made no mention of abortion The White House also noted that Mrs OConnor had sponsored a 1973 bill which passed giving hospitals physicians and other medical personnel the right not to participate in abortion procedures Position on Rights Proposal As for the proposed equal rights amendment a senior White House official maintained that Judge OConnors onetime support had lessened and that she now had more problems with the proposal He pointed out that Mr Reagan himself had once supported the proposal before changing his position Feminist groups characterized Judge OConnor as a supporter of the amendment however Tonight an enthusiastic Mr Reagan said in Chicago that his appointment made it a happy day for me and I hope for my country Speaking before a Republican fundraising dinner he praised Judge OConnors long and brilliant record as a legislator and jurist and said she had impressed him as a thoughtful and capable woman whose judicial temperament is highly appropriate for the Court He added that her principles adhered to those in the Repubican Party platform Impression on Reagan Michael K Deaver the deputy White House chief of staff told reporters in Chicago that Mr Reagan was impressed with her kind of moderate approach in the sense that she had not been an activist on the rights amendment or abortion issue and had taken a moderate position on both The decision on Judge OConnor came quickly because Mr Reagan was impressed with her immediately Mr Deaver said adding I guess that was the first one and its like buying a car The selection of Judge OConnor brought to a conclusion a search that according to Mr Reagans aides was one of the most exhaustive conducted by the Administration An initial list of about 25 candidates was winnowed last week to a short list of only a few potential nominees Among the names on the shorter list a Reagan aide said were Dallin H Oaks a Utah Supreme Court judge J Clifford Wallace a California judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Robert Bork a former Solicitor General and law professor at Yale and Cornelia Kennedy a Michigan judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit Interviews by Key Aides Several potential choices were interviewed by Attorney General William French Smith and his aides Judge OConnor was interviewed June 30 by Mr Smith and four White House officials Fred F Fielding the counsel and Mr Reagans three top advisers Mr Deaver Edwin Meese 3d and James A Baker 3d Mr Reagan himself spoke to Judge OConnor the next day and made the decision to choose her yesterday according to the White House An Administration official said she was the only person who was interviewed by Mr Reagan or White House officials Fears Seen Misplaced White House officials said a lengthy survey had been made of Judge OConnors views and that fears among conservatives about her record would be seen as being misplaced Judge OConnors confirmation prospects in the Senate were seen as significantly enhanced by the backing of the two conservative Senators from Arizona  Barry Goldwater a Republican and Dennis DeConcini a Democrat Not until today did the White House ask the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the American Bar Association to conduct their examinations of Judge OConnor Mr Smith said her name would be forwarded to the Senate formally pending completion of the FBI check Mrs OConnor has been considered with respect to her overall qualifications and background and there has not been any effort to focus in on any one issue and judge her on that basis Mr Smith said Similarity of Philosophies He said her record on the bench was quite satisfactory even though it contained opinions on few if any major constitutional issues He said he was confident that her philosophy was like President Reagans that it is the responsibility of elected representatives of the people to enact laws and not that of the judiciary One insight into the selection process was provided by an Administration official who said that Judge OConnor had been asked several questions in her interviews with top White House aides Among the questions were whom she felt she was closest to on the Court philosophically what were her opinions on the exclusionary rule under which evidence that is obtained unconstitutionally is deemed inadmissible in court and whether she felt that the Court should take into consideration the practical implications of its decisions The official said that Judge OConnors answers had been considered satisfactory but he would not give details
WOMAN IN THE NEWS; 'A REPUTATION FOR EXCELLING',https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/08/us/woman-in-the-news-a-reputation-for-excelling.html,Judge Sandra Day OConnors place in history is already secure based on todays announcement that she will be President Reagans nominee as the first woman on the United States Supreme Court But if her past is prologue after her Senate confirmation Judge OConnor might well go on to leave even larger footprints on the sands of time as Mr Reagan quoting Longfellow described the mark of United States Justices Thus far in her 51 years Judge OConnor has compiled an impressive list of academic civic political and legal achievements Shes finished at the top in a lot of things said Mary Ellen Simonson of Phoenix who was a legislative aide when Mrs OConnor was majority leader of the Arizona State Senate the first woman in the nation to hold such a leadership position She has a reputation for excelling Mrs Simonson continued As a result shes been one of the states leading role models for women Now shes a national role model Judge OConnor who currently sits on the Arizona Court of Appeals the states second highest court refused this afternoon to discuss substantative issues when she met with reporters in Phoenix And because of her short 18month tenure on the appeals court and its somewhat limited docket she has faced few of the nettlesome issues routinely taken up by the United States Supreme Court Nevertheless her past and her acquaintances provide some insights into her mind and personality She is said by friend and foe alike to be notably bright extremely hardworking meticulous deliberate cautious and above all a Republican conservative But she has an open mind when it comes to her conservatism said a longtime friend Sharon Rockefeller wife of Gov John D Rockefeller IV of West Virginia I cant conceive of her closing off her mind to anything A leading Democratic politician in Arizona agreed that Judge OConnor was not your farout Republican If you have to have a Republican on the court he said privately well shes about the best we could hope for to be perfectly honest She just might fool some people he continued Shes comfortable establishment Republican Junior League blood bank all the right things and respectable groups She just might surprise some people because I dont think shes out of the kneejerk mold Justice Jack DH Hays of the Arizona Supreme Court offered a somewhat similar observation about Judge OConnor Shes an excellent legal scholar he said She tends to the conservative area But she is sound legally and could surprise a lot of people Astonishment as a Senator As a state Senator Judge OConnor caused some astonishment when she came out in support of the proposed Federal equal rights amendment and then cast several votes that were taken as proabortion by organizations that oppose abortion Several of the groups have vowed to fight her nomination Her legislative successes included work on efforts to provide regular reviews for people committed to mental institutions probate code reform the establishment of nofault divorce in Arizona and merit selection for Superior Court judges In addition she was a prime mover for legislation requiring public bodies to conduct their affairs in open meetings and she helped promote the idea of limiting state spending increases to corresponding increases in personal income Judge OConnor also attempted unsuccessfully to push through a Medicaid program for Arizona while serving as a legislator Her efforts for passage of the rights amendment also failed but Judge OConnor established herself as one of Arizonas outspoken advocates for women and did succeed in repealing an old Arizona law that limited women to working eight hours a day An Appeal for Involvement Women have lacked a certain amount of job opportunity and have failed to receive equal pay for equal work Judge OConnor asserted at one point in a debate on the rights amendment I feel strongly that qualified women should involve themselves more than they do now They should be particularly anxious to seek appointments in government or seek out qualified women for political offices Certainly Judge OConnor has attempted to live by those words She was born March 26 1930 the daughter of Mr and Mrs Harry Day of Duncan Ariz where she grew up on a ranch She graduated from Stanford University with a bachelor of arts degree in 1950 and with a law degree two years later in both cases with high honors While in law school she also served as an editor on the Stanford Law Review and was made a member of the Order of the Coif an honorary legal organization One of Judge OConnors classmates at Stanford was John Jay OConnor 3d whom she married He now practices law in one of Phoenixs largest firms They have three sons Another classmate was William H Rehnquist He is now a Supreme Court Justice and like Judge OConnor a Republican conservative Justice Rehnquist graduated first in his law class Judge OConnor was third Judge OConnor spent six years in private practice in Arizona then served as Assistant Attorney General for the state from 1965 through 1968 When an opening occurred in the Arizona Senate in 1969 she was temporarily appointed to fill the slot Subsequently she won election to two full terms and in 1973 was elected majority leader A Super Floor Leader She was a super floor leader said William Jacquin a former state Senator who now heads the Arizona Chamber of Commerce She was devoted to the law by the nature of her own professionalism he added and was extraordinarily thorough in drafting legislation In 1972 she served as a state cochairman of the committee to reelect Richard M Nixon as President Judge OConnor left the Legislature in 1974 to run for Superior Court judge in Phoenix She served on that court until she was appointed to the Arizona Court of Appeals in 1979 by Gov Bruce Babbitt a Democrat At the time Judge OConnor was being mentioned as a possible political challenger to Mr Babbitt Rating Judge OConnors performance on the appellate bench 90 percent of the Arizona bar recommended last year that she be retained Similarly 85 percent of the bar had recommended that she be retained on the Superior Court bench While Judge OConnor is most often described as a diligent nononsense woman always ready to move up the next notch of success close friends say that in private she talks frankly of working hard to be both a successful public figure and a successful wife and mother She relaxes over a game of tennis now and then and every so often lets slip some wry wit But even while relaxing it seems she cannot avoid the limelight Over the weekend while vacationing in the Arizona mountains she was approached by fellow vacationers from nearby cabins on the morning of July 4 and asked to read them the Declaration of Independence She readily agreed
BAKER VOWS SUPPORT FOR NOMINEE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/08/us/baker-vows-support-for-nominee.html,Antiabortion groups today denounced President Reagans decision to nominate Judge Sandra Day OConnor to the Supreme Court but initial reaction in the Senate which will vote on confirmation was favorable I commend the President for the courage of his decision said Howard H Baker Jr the Senate Republican majority leader I am delighted with his choice and I pledge my full support for her confirmation by the full Senate The National Right to Life Committee an amalgam of antiabortion lobbying groups in the 50 states said that it would mobilize its members to prevail upon senators to oppose this nomination The committee said that Judge OConnor was proabortion as a member of the Arizona State Legislature Dr Carolyn Gerster a vice president of the National Right to Life Committee said that the nominee as a legislator voted in 1974 not to allow an antiabortion resolution out of caucus thus killing it The resolution asked Congress to pass a Constitutional amendment protecting the fetus except when the mothers life was in danger and allowed abortions in the case of rape Dr Gerster based her statement of Judge OConnors record on that and other votes which were characterized as proabortion on newspaper accounts and the recollections of other legislators she said Before 1975 the State Legislature kept no records of committee subcommittee or caucus votes We feel betrayed by the President said Paul Brown chairman of the Life Amendment Political Action Committee who contended that Mr Reagan had violated a campaign pledge to support antiabortion positions and appointees Weve been sold out In contrast the National Organization for Women called the nomination a victory for womens rights Eleanor C Smeal president of the organization contended that increasing political pressure from womens groups and a drop in ratings among women in public opinion polls had forced Mr Reagan to the choice of Judge OConnor She rated the judge sensitive to womens rights a moderate on womens rights Any Senate opposition was thought likely to be led by Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina a leader of conservative causes The Senator was reported to have spent much of the day today at the White House seeking reassurances as one antiabortion lobbyist put it but he offered no immediate comment The antiabortion groups insisted that they would marshal Republicans and Democrats to fight the nomination in the Senate But in some of their statements were acknowledgments that the nomination might be approved Im not sure well defeat her said Peter Gemma executive director of the National ProLife Political Action Committee But we want to send the President a clear signal at how much of an insult this is and how his next court appointment had better be prolife Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada a key Republican on the Judiciary Committee who is a confidant of the President discussed the appointment with him this morning at the White House and later endorsed Judge OConnor as an excellent addition to the court emphasizing Mr Reagans assurances that he is fully satisfied with Mrs OConnor philosophically This same emphasis on assurances from Mr Reagan that Mrs OConnor finds abortion personally abhorrent was cited by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah in his endorsement of an excellent choice Im relying on the President of the United States Senator Hatch said in describing the opposition of antiabortion groups as premature and perhaps misinformed If it turns out serious opposition develops thats another matter Kennedy Commends Choice Democrats on the Judiciary Committee offered lengthier and warmer endorsements of Judge OConnor Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts said Every American can take pride in the Presidents commitment to select such a woman for this critical office The ranking Democrat on the committee Joseph R Biden of Delaware said From all outward appearances Sandra D OConnor seems to be eminently well qualified for this position and Im personally very glad that the President has named a woman to fill the vacancy As antiabortion groups cited her legislative record to prove their contention that Judge OConnor was proabortion Alfredo Gutierrez a rival Democrat who succeeded her as majority leader of the State Senate in Arizona denied this Thats absolutely not in the record he said It just isnt there Im surprised at the choice shes conservative in a conventional way but no ideologue Shes a terrific lady and they ought to put her on the court quick The issue of naming the first woman to the Supreme Court while a major feminist goal in recent years has stirred little general public interest according to the latest New York Times CBS News News Poll The poll conducted last month showed that 72 percent of the public believed that it made no difference whether a man or a woman was appointed The National Womens Political Caucus celebrated the nomination as proof that women are breaking the barriers of nearly 200 years of exclusion from decision making in our nation Potter Stewart whose retirement from the Supreme Court created the vacancy said that he was delighted by the choice
RATHER AN UNKNOWN; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/08/us/rather-an-unknown-news-analysis.html,Sandra Day OConnors opinions in her 18 months as an Arizona appeals court judge display careful reasoning and use of precedent But they shed little light on her attitude toward most of the controversial constitutional issues she will face if she is confirmed as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Judge OConnor a former Republican majority leader of the Arizona State Senate is widely regarded as conservative in her political outlook Her legislative record has been attacked by antiabortion groups that say she cast proabortion votes before she became a judge but those assertions have been disputed by people who sat with her in the Arizona Legislature A review of Judge OConnors 29 published opinions for the Arizona Court of Appeals disclosed none dealing with abortion Nor did any of the opinions disclose her views on most of the other controversial issues that the Supreme Court has ruled on such as busing as a means of desegregating schools prayer in schools the death penalty affirmative action and the constitutional rights of criminal defendants The White House indicated tonight that Judge OConnor was a supporter of the death penalty Michael K Deaver the Presidents deputy chief of staff said that Judge OConnor had been the author of an Arizona law providing for the death penalty and had sentenced at least one person under the law However no one has been executed in Arizona since she first became a Superior Court judge there in 1975 Most of the decisions made by the judge before she joined the Court of Appeals have not been published Thus it appears to be far too early to determine whether the ideologically divided Court will become more conservative or more liberal if Judge OConnor fills the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart who has been viewed as a moderate leaning to the conservative side of the Courts delicate philosophical balance Sharing Reagans Philosophy Attorney General William French Smith said today after President Reagan had announced Judge OConnor as his choice to be the first woman to sit on the Supreme Court that she shared the Presidents overall judicial philosophy of restraint and deference to the legislative branch in making law A recently published law review article by Judge OConnor lends some support to the Attorney Generals view The article in the William and Mary Law Review dealt with the relationship between state and Federal courts Judge OConnor cited with approval recent Supreme Court decisions requiring Federal judges to defer to some initial determinations by state court judges She singled out a recent decision by Associate Justice William H Rehnquist her former law school classmate that held that when considering a constitutional challenge to a state criminal conviction a Federal court should ordinarily presume that the state courts factual findings were correct View on Civil Rights Act There is no reason to assume Judge OConnor wrote that state court judges cannot and will not provide a hospitable forum in litigating Federal constitutional questions In the article Judge OConnor also suggested that in view of the increasing caseload of the Federal courts and the expressed desire of the Reagan Administration to hold down the Federal budget Congress should consider limiting the scope of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 That frequently used law also known as Section 1983 allows individuals to sue state and local officials for violations of constitutional rights Congressional limits she said could be accomplished either directly or indirectly by limiting or disallowing recovery of attorneys fees Federal law now permits successful civil rights plaintiffs to be reimbursed for their attorneys fees in many cases As a member of the Arizona State Senate from 1969 to 1974 Judge OConnor compiled a record of mainstream pragmatic Republicanism while rising to become the first woman to serve as majority leader Termed Conservative But Fair Shes certainly a conservative in the conventional sense but beyond that shes extremely fair said Alfredo Gutierrez a Democratic state senator who succeeded Judge OConnor as majority leader She is not an ideologue She is a perfectionist rooted in the law Judge OConnor left the state Senate when she was elected to be a state Superior Court judge in Phoenix in 1975 She was elevated to the Arizona Court of Appeals the states second highest court 18 months ago by Gov Bruce Babbitt a Democrat While several of Judge OConnors 29 published opinions as an appeals court judge affirmed criminal convictions one of them reversed two armed robbery convictions because the defendants right to trial by a 12person jury under state law had been violated None of the opinions expressed strong views on the issues of criminal and constitutional law that have divided the Supreme Court Striking Down Law on Rent Another opinion struck down a state law that Judge OConnor considered arbitrary and irrational discrimination against people appealing decisions by justices of the peace in landlordtenant disputes over nonpayment of rent Judge OConnor said that the state law which required tenants appealing a justice of the peaces decision evicting them for nonpayment of rent to post a bond of double the annual rent is not reasonably tailored to achieve a legitimate state end and is not uniformly and nondiscriminatorily applied As a state court judge Judge OConnor has considered mostly cases raising such state law issues as the liability of municipalities for negligence and the standards to be applied in awarding disability payments rather than the issues of Federal constitutional and statutory law that occupy the Supreme Court This fact together with the difficulty of predicting how a new Supreme Court Justice will react to the new and unique responsibilities make it impossible to say what changes in judicial doctrine might come about if Judge OConnor is confirmed But analysis of the Supreme Courts voting patterns in several controversial areas including abortion suggests that no radical shift in the Courts approch is likely even if Judge OConnor votes with the Courts most conservative members more often than Justice Stewart has done

TRANSCRIPT OF REMARKS BY REAGAN AND NOMINEE TO HIGH COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/08/us/transcript-of-remarks-by-reagan-and-nominee-to-high-court.html,Following are transcripts of President Reagans remarks and answers to questions yesterday in announcing his selection of Judge Sandra Day OConnor to serve on the Supreme Court as recorded by The New York Times and of a news conference in Phoenix by Judge OConnor as recorded by The Associated Press Reagan Remarks As President of the United States I have the honor and privilege to make thousands of appointments to positions in the Federal Government Each is important and deserves a great deal of care for each individual is called upon to make his or her contribution often at personal sacrifice to shaping the policy of this Administration Thus each has an obligation to you and in varying degrees has an impact on your life In addition as President I have the privilege to make a certain number of nominations which have a more lasting influence on our lives for they are the lifetime appointments of those men and women called upon to serve on the judiciary in our Federal district courts and courts of appeals These individuals dispense justice and provide for us those most cherished guarantees of protections of our criminal and civil laws But without doubt the most awesome appointment a President can make is to the United States Supreme Court Those who sit on the Supreme Court interpret the laws of our land and truly do leave their footprints on the sands of time long after the policies of Presidents Senators and Congressmen of a given era may have passed from the public memory After very careful review and consideration I have made a decision as to my nominee to fill the vacancy on the United States Supreme Court created by the resignation of Justice Stewart Since I am aware of the great amount of speculation about this appointment I want to share this very important decision with you as soon as possible Hints About a Woman Needless to say most of the speculation has centered on the question of whether I would consider a woman to fill this first vacancy As the press has accurately pointed out during my campaign for the Presidency I made a commitment that one of my first appointments to a Supreme Court vacancy would be the most qualified woman I could possibly find That is not to say I would appoint a woman merely to do so That would not be fair to women nor to future generations of all Americans whose lives are so deeply affected by the decisions of the court Rather I pledged to appoint a woman who meets the very high standards I demand of all court appointees I have identified such a person So today I am pleased to announce that upon completion of all necessary checks by the Federal Bureau of Investigation I will send to the Senate the nomination of Judge Sandra Day OConnor of the Arizona Court of Appeals for confirmation as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court She is truly a person for all seasons possessing those unique qualities of temperament fairness intellectual capacity and devotion to the public good which have characterized the 101 brethren who have preceded her I commend her to you and urge the Senates swift bipartisan confirmation so that as soon as possible she may take her seat on the Court and her place in history Her Position on Abortion Q Do you agree with her position on abortion Mr President A I said Im going to turn over all questions to the Attorney General here and let him answer the questions Q The righttolife people may oppose it sir and we just wonder if A All of those questions the Attorney General is prepared to answer Q Mr President yours is a pro position on that can you give us your feelings about that pro position A I am completely satisfied Q On her righttolife position A Yes Q And did you interview her first personally A Yes Judge OConnor Remarks Good morning This is a momentous day in my life and the life of my family and Im extremely happy and honored to have been nominated by President Reagan for a position on the United States Supreme Court If I am confirmed in the United States Senate I will do my best to serve the Court and this nation in a manner that will bring credit to the President to my family and to all the people of this great nation Q Unintelligible A We havent even thought about questions like that pending the confirmation hearing Q When did you find out President Reagan would nominate you A He called me yesterday afternoon about 4 oclock our time and spoke with me at that time Q Had you considered you were a serious contender for the post A I assumed that I was because I was interviewed late last week in Washington Q By the President A Yes Q What kind of questions did the President ask A Im not at liberty to disclose the contents of the conversation and you can check with the White House on that Q How long did the conversation last A Not very long Id say no longer than 15 minutes Q Did you speak with Senator Goldwater Senator DeConcini Congressman Rhodes Have they had the opportunity to speak to you this morning A Not yet Senator DeConcinis office got through but my line has been very busy this morning I think its been hard for people to get through Position of Congressmen Q Has our states Congressional delegation been unanimous in endorsing your nomination A As far as I know they have Ive had of course calls from Senator Goldwater and from Representative John Rhodes previously indicating support Q Judge OConnor Mr Reagan said this morning that you would have your chance so to speak to leave your tracks in the sands of time When you assume your post assuming that you do what kind of changes do you think you might bring about to the Supreme Court Do you have any thoughts on that at this point A I dont think thats anything unintelligible Q How do you view yourself as a legal as far as the laws concerned Your legal approach A I simply try to do as good a job as I can with each question as it arises A Philosophical Label Q Would you put a label on yourself  moderate or constructionist A No I cant do that Q Youve been attacked by the righttolife people for your stand on abortion How would you characterize your position on that issue A Im sorry I cant address myself to substantive questions pending the confirmation hearing Q What were your thoughts when you first realized that you were being considered you might be the first woman on the Supreme Court A Well I was greatly honored by the suggestion but never thought it would be a reality Q Do you consider lack of Federal court experience on the appeals or on the district court level a negative factor in your appointment Is that going to be a difficulty youre going to have to overcome A I cant see that Certainly Ive not had Federal experience and time will tell whether that means I have a lot more to learn than I otherwise would Rejection of Questions Q Why can you not address substantive questions A Pending the confirmation hearing Im not able to do that Q You have been asked not to I dont understand Is it something youre just not allowed to do By whom A Well I simply am not going to address myself to substantive issues pending the confirmation hearing Q unintelligible because youre the first woman A Well I hope not Q Would you reflect on that aspect of it  being the first woman What that means to you What you think it means to the judicial system A I dont know that I can In approaching the work on the bench I can only say that I will approach it with care and effort and do the best job that I possibly can do and Ive always tried to do that with any position that Ive held Q Does your experience in the state legislature have any impact on your thinking as a judge A Undoubtedly it does All of our experiences reflect in some way in what we are and I have an appreciation for the legislative process because I have been part of that process Q Your husband has a very active law practice here in Phoenix Have you thought about how you will unintelligible A We havent thought about all those questions pending a confirmation hearing Thank you

HIGH COURT TERM; MAJOR FEDERAL POWERS AFFIRMED,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/09/us/high-court-term-major-federal-powers-affirmed.html,Facing its first change in membership in nearly six years the Supreme Court has just ended a term that affirmed the authority of the Federal Government to act in several important areas to safeguard the health of workers to regulate foreign travel in the name of national security and to override private legal claims in order to settle a major foreign policy crisis It was a term that removed doubts about the constitutionality of televised trials and the allmale military draft with the Court ruling that the Constitution does not require either but permits both For the first time in four years the term produced no major rulings on the subject of racial equality But the theme of equality between the sexes dominated the term and found the Court less hospitable than it has been for years to allegations of unconstitutional discrimination on the basis of sex Generally Narrow Rulings Following its longstanding practice the Court for the most part ruled narrowly on the questions that reached it preferring to rest its decisions on statutory interpretation rather than constitutional doctrine Statutory rulings leave legislators free to change their minds Several cases that had promised important constitutional decisions when the term began last Oct 6 disappeared from the docket by the time the session ended on July 2 Cases posing questions about affirmative action the rights of parents and the limits of socalled reverse discrimination were found by the Justices to be moot or procedurally defective in some way On the other hand the Court did not hesitate to take up the legal challenge to the financial arrangements by which Presidents Carter and Reagan ended the hostage crisis with Iran On the final day of the term eight days after hearing arguments in the case the Court unanmously upheld the settlement in a ruling it based on the implied consent of Congress rather than on any sweeping assertion of Presidential authority Regulatory Agency Rulings The Court pointedly declined the Reagan Administrations suggestion that it not decide the major regulatory case of the term a challenge to the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations standards for exposure to cotton dust The Court ruled that Federal law required the agency to protect workers from exposure to toxic substances to the maximum extent feasible without regard to the relationship between costs and benefits That was the position argued to the Court by the Carter Administration but the Reagan Administration which wants to subject all major regulations to an analysis of the cost as against the benefits sought to avert the decision The Court issued full written opinions in 123 cases in the term It reversed lower court decisions about twice as often as it upheld them By design each of the nine Justices wrote roughly the same number of opinions for the Court But they differed widely on other measures of judicial selfexpression dissents and separate concurring opinions Associate Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the most dissenting opinions 24 while Chief Justice Warren E Burger wrote the fewest five Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall while writing only eight dissenting opinions joined other Justices in dissent 31 times for the highest overall total of 39 Justice Stevenss total was 31 The lowest overall number of dissents belonged to Associate Justice Byron R White with 13 The highest number of separate concurring opinions 15 was achieved by Justices Stevens Lewis F Powell Jr and Harry A Blackmun Justice Marshall wrote one separate concurring opinion Justice White with the second fewest wrote six 44 Unanimous Decisions More than onethird of the terms cases 44 were decided unanimously and 15 other decisions drew only one dissenting vote Seventeen cases were decided by 5to4 votes Associate Justice Potter Stewarts role in the closest decisions belies the commonly held view that he occupied a crucial swing position on the Court He retired from the Court on July 3 after 23 years and President Reagan announced yesterday that he planned to nominate Judge Sandra Day OConnor of Arizona to succeed him Justice Stewart was part of the majority in nine of the 5to4 cases that is nine cases out of 123 in which an opposite vote by Justice Stewart would have changed the outcome Among these were decisions that upheld the California statutory rape law as not violating the constitutional rights of men and that held that parents do not have a constitutional right to a lawyer to contest an effort by the state authorities to remove their children permanently from their home Patent and Criminal Law There were also patent law and criminal law decisions Justice Stewart voted with Associate Justice William H Rehnquist the Courts most conservative member in eight of the nine cases Too little is known about Judge OConnors views to say how she would have voted in these close cases The Chief Justice and Justice Rehnquist voted together with a high degree of consistency surpassed only by the degree to which Justices William J Brennan Jr and Marshall voted together at the liberal end of the Courts spectrum Justices Burger and Rehnquist voted alike 109 times and parted company in 12 cases Justices Brennan and Marshall voted together 111 times and were on opposite sides in 12 cases The Chief Justice has the prerogative of making the assignments to write decisions in cases in which he is in the majority This term the Chief Justice assigned most of the critical cases to himelf or to Justice Rehnquist These included for Justice Rehnquist the cases involving the Iranian assets the allmale draft the constitutionality of statutory rape laws and the Federal rights of residents of state institutions for the retarded The Chief Justice wrote the opinions on televised trials the revocation of passports on national security grounds parental notification for abortion and the rights of defendants faced with psychiatric interviews When the Chief Justice is in dissent the most senior Justice in the majority gets to assign the opinion Justice Brennan the Courts most senior member exercised that right to assign himself the opinions in the cotton dust case and a second important case that expanded the right of women to challenge low pay on the basis of sex discrimination Following are summaries of the important decisions of the 198081 Supreme Court term Federal Authority In addition to the Iranian assets and the cotton dust cases the Court upheld the authority of the State Department to revoke a passport on the ground that the overseas activities of the passport bearer are causing or are likely to cause serious damage to the national security or the foreign policy of the United States The decision upheld the department in revoking the passport of Philip Agee a former Central Intelligence Agency official who has embarked on a worldwide campaign to expose the agencys personnel and operations The Court turned back a challenge to the Federal stripmining law and ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency can enforce its water pollution standards without regard to the financial ability of an individual factory to comply The Justices aided the Federal Governments effort to deport former Nazis by ruling in the case of Feodor Fedorenko a guard at the Treblinka death camp in Poland that failure to disclose such service at a concentration camp made a subsequent naturalization invalid Sex Discrimination The Court ruled that maleonly draft registration and by implication a military draft that included only men does not violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws The 6to3 majority ruled that because women were barred by various laws and policies from serving in combat they were not similarly situated with men and so may properly be excluded from compulsory military service The Justices upheld state laws that punish men for having sexual relations with underage women but do not punish women for the same conduct with underage men The Court opened the door to a new theory of employment discrimination ruling that women can sue over low pay even in the absence of male colleagues who are doing equal work at higher pay The case was based on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Institutionalized Persons The Court ruled that placing two prison inmates in a cell designed for one is not of itself unconstitutional but left open the prospect that prison conditions as a whole might be unconstitutional if they violated the contemporary standard of decency The Court ruled that a bill of rights for the mentally retarded enacted by Congress in 1975 did not impose any specific obligation on stateoperated institutions The Justices have accepted a case for the next term that raises the broader issues of the constitutional rights of the institutionalized retarded The Court overturned a lower court decision that mandated special judicial scrutiny for cases involving the mentally ill Family Issues The Court ruled that military pension benefits are the personal entitlement of the service member and thus may not become part of a property settlement in a divorce The adverse impact of the decision falls almost entirely on the former wives of servicemen The Court avoided extending the decision to private nonmilitary pensions On the last day of the term it let stand a lower court decision that treated a private pension as community property The Court ruled that a state can require that before performing an abortion on a teenaged girl a doctor must notify the parents or face criminal liability The Justices ruled that a parent is not constitutionally entitled to legal representation at a court proceeding that could result in permanently severing the parentchild relationship Press and Speech The Court ruled that states may permit the televising of criminal trials even over the defendants objection The Justices ruled that decisions to change the entertainment programming of a radio station are not subject to Federal regulation The Court held that television stations are required to sell reasonable amounts of air time to candidates for Federal office and left wide discretion to the Federal Communications Commission to decide when in a particular campaign the obligation to provide access begins A local community that permits some form of commercial activity may not impose a complete ban on nude dancing the Court ruled But the Justices also ruled in a New York case that a state has the authority under its power to regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages to ban topless dancing in bars The Court ruled that localities may ban billboards that carry commercial advertising messages That opinion left unclear the extent to which billboards bearing political or other noncommercial messages may be regulated The Justices upheld a Federal law that makes it a crime to deposit mailable matter in mailboxes without first putting a stamp on it and mailing it Criminal Law The Court ruled that the constitutional protection against double jeopardy does not bar the prosecution from appealing a sentence it regards as too lenient The decision upheld a Federal law that authorizes the Government to appeal sentences under specific circumstances Two decisions expanded the constitutional protection against selfincrimination The Court ruled that a murder defendant must be given the right to remain silent when questioned by a psychiatrist who might later testify that the defendant is dangerous and should be put to death The second ruling interpreting the 1966 Miranda decision held that once a suspect has invoked his right to the presence of a lawyer in questioning he cannot be regarded as having waived that right unless he initiates further conversations with the police Four decisions dealt with search warrants and the results were mixed Two placed new limits on the police a ruling that even when the police have a valid arrest warrant they also need a search warrant to enter the home of a third party in search of the one they want to arrest and a ruling that the police generally need a warrant to open a closed container taken from the trunk of an automobile In the other decisions the Court ruled that a warrant to search a home for contraband automatically gives the police the power to detain temporarily anyone found on the premises and that the police do not need a warrant to search the passenger area of an automobile while arresting the occupants Finally the Court upheld the Justice Departments interpretation of the Federal antiracketeering law ruling that the statute is not limited to the prosecution of criminal organizations that take over or infiltrate legitimate businesses Religion The Court struck down a Kentucky state law that required the posting of a copy of the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom The Justices ruled that a worker who quits a job that conflicts with his religious beliefs may not be denied state unemployment compensation The Court ruled that officials of a state fair may require members of the Hare Krishna sect to conduct their solicitation activities from booths
WHITE HOUSE REBUTS CHARGES THAT NOMINEE HAS VOTED FOR ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/09/us/white-house-rebuts-charges-that-nominee-has-voted-for-abortions.html,President Reagan was reported today to be urging some of his conservative allies to keep an open mind on the qualifications of Judge Sandra Day OConnor his newly announced choice for the United States Supreme Court until her confirmation hearings are completed Faced with the possibility of a vigorous campaign by antiabortion groups against Judge OConnor meanwhile the White House attempted a counterattack by directly rebutting the charge that she had voted on several occasions in favor of abortions White House spokesmen asserted further that Judge OConnor had never been an activist on any issues related to feminism David R Gergen the senior White House spokesman quoted the Arizona judge on the subject of the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution as being neither as enthusiastic as some proponents nor as alarmed by it as some opponents Judge OConnor who has been described by the White House as personally opposed to abortions has said that she will not discuss her views until her confirmation hearings White House officials acknowledge that the judge regards abortion as a legitimate matter for regulation by the legislative branch Officials Optimistic By the end of the day Administration officials said that they were encouraged by the prospects for confirmation of Judge OConnor in the Senate Yesterday Mr Reagan had Senator Jesse Helms the conservative Republican from North Carolina visit him at the White House to assuage his concerns about Judge OConnor The President also telephoned the Rev Jerry Falwell leader of Moral Majority which has already come out against her nomination saying that Judge OConnor has advocated legal abortions and the equal rights amendment At the White House Mr Gergen quoted Mr Reagan as saying that the reaction to the selection of Judge OConnor had generally been very positive But this evening the White House press office released information showing that telephone calls and mail had been running heavily negative ever since the judges possible nomination was reported in the press last week Telegrams and mail had been 2573 against and 290 in favor while telephone calls were 1554 against and 263 in favor Mr Gergen said he had no way of knowing whether there had been an organized telegram or telephone campaign by the antiabortion movement Annoyance at White House White House officials reacted with some annoyance that someone whom they regarded as a conservative was being attacked by conservative groups on the abortion issue But they professed not to be surprised and were ready today with a pointbypoint rebuttal At issue appear to be positions taken by Mrs OConnor on five separate occasions when she was a State Senator in Arizona The Administration view was detailed in an internal memorandum prepared by Kenneth W Starr counselor to Attorney General William French Smith based on two telephone conversations between Mr Starr and Judge OConnor on Monday These are the five cases  In 1970 according to the National Right to Life Committee Judge OConnor voted proabortion on a Senate Judiciary Committee measure But the Starr memorandum said there is no record of how Senator OConnor voted and she indicated that she has no recollection of how she voted on this measure which was aimed at repealing Arizonas criminal prohibitions against abortion The measure was under consideration before the Supreme Court upheld the right to abortion under some circumstances  In 1973 the National Right to Life Committee said Judge OConnor was prime sponsor of a bill providing family planning information to minors with the definition of family planning described as broad enough to encompass abortion The Starr memorandum maintained that the bill made no express mention of abortion and was not viewed by then Senator OConnor as an abortion measure  In 1974 Judge OConnor was said to have voted against a State Senate resolution calling on Congress to pass an antiabortion amendment to the Constitution according to the Right to Life group Mr Gergen said today that there was no public record of this vote and that it appears to have been a caucus vote He said she could not remember opposing the measure  In 1974 the Right to Life group said Judge OConnor opposed a bill forbidding abortions at the University of Arizona at Tucson The Starr memorandum said that the abortion provision was a rider attached to a bill expanding certain sports facilities and that Judge OConnor was simply following a provision in the Arizona Constitution forbidding nongermane amendments to legislation  In 1977 the Right to Life group said Judge OConnor was a keynote speaker at the proabortion International Womens Year state meeting in Arizona The Starr memorandum said she had never attended or spoken at a womens rights conference on abortion White House officials also said that Judge OConnor who is an Episcopalian had long found abortions to be personally repugnant and that in 1973 she sponsored a bill granting to hospitals physicians and medical personnel the right not to participate in abortions They said that at no time in her interviews however was she ever asked her opinion of the Supreme Court decision Roe v Wade upholding the constitutional right to abortions To ask her such a specific question Mr Gergen said would have been inappropriate and injudicious
SEPTEMBER VOTE ON NOMINEE FORECAST,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/09/us/september-vote-on-nominee-forecast.html,The Senates vote on the nomination of Judge Sandra Day OConnor to the Supreme Court is not likely until September Senate Republican leaders said today They also reported no significant opposition developing as yet despite threats from conservative antiabortion lobbyists If theyre going to start a fight theyre going to find Old Goldie fighting them like hell said Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona Judge OConnors chief sponsor warning Moral Majority and other socialissue groups against sticking their noses into the everyday operations of government That remark from the Republican once admired by some as Mr Conservative underlined the tactical difficulty opponents were likely to have in trying to make a broadly based conservative issue of the appointment Some antiabortion lobbyists conceded as much but said that the two months before a full Senate vote necessitated by inquiries in the Senate and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the legislative recess next month gave them a chance to build constituent pressure against Judge OConnor Key Elements Are Missing It takes certain elements to create a battle and so far theyre not there said Paul M Weyrich director of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress one of a number of conservative groups opposed to the appointment Antiabortion groups met this afternoon to plan a common strategy The Senator they look to as their leader Jesse Helms of North Carolina has thus far remained a step back from the battle saying he was still investigating discrepancies between his and President Reagans views of Judge OConnors legislative record on the abortion issue Im not going to prejudge the lady said Senator Helms who led a successful fight at the Republican National Convention last July for an antiabortion plank that some critics contend Mr Reagan betrayed with his nomination yesterday of Judge OConnor of the Arizona Court of Appeals If confirmed the 51yearold judge would become the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court As a state legislator in Arizona Mrs OConnor at different times endorsed the proposed Federal equal rights amendment and voted against antiabortion interests But some Arizonans in both parties contend that in the larger context of her legislative career she was not proabortion as she is now characterized by some lobbying groups here Reagan Misled by Staff Those groups have avoided blaming Mr Reagan for their disappointment taking the view expressed this morning on National Public Radio by Richard Viguerie the conservative fundraiser Hes a busy man who relies heavily on his staff who have misled him and he needlessly gave the back of his hand to an important part of his coalition David R Gergen the senior White House spokesman said that the President was trying to diffuse potential opposition to the appointment by meeting yesterday with Senator Helms and telephoning the Rev Jerry Falwell president of Moral Majority a religious and political lobbying organization in the hope that they would keep an open mind about the appointment A spokesman for Mr Falwell said that he did not commit himself Senator Strom Thurmond the South Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee said he believed that the FBI background check on Judge OConnor might require two weeks for completion to be followed by a weeks notice for the committee hearing His current impression he said was that Judge OConnor would eventually be confirmed A spokesman for Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the Senate majority leader estimated that at the earliest the appointment might be dealt with by the Judiciary Committee just before the August recess with a floor vote in early September The timing is important because the fall term of the Supreme Court begins in October and Senator Baker has promised to expedite the nomination to meet that date If the opposition is to make headway it must convince such key Judiciary Committee members as Senator Orrin G Hatch a Utah Republican who is usually quite sympathetic to the antiabortion bloc I intend to support the President the Senator said today But she has to answer certain questions

REAGAN'S COURT CHOICE: A DEFT MANEUVER; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/09/us/reagan-s-court-choice-a-deft-maneuver-news-analysis.html,With his nomination of Sandra Day OConnor for the Supreme Court vacancy President Reagan has won admiring applause from rival politicians for a masterly political stroke as well as a strong judicial choice This city still recalls that a little over a decade ago President Richard M Nixon had to face political humiliation when the Senate rejected two of his Court nominees Clement F Haynsworth Jr and G Harrold Carswell Now Mr Reagan is being credited with an astute Court selection that immediately won the endorsement of a broad spectrum from conservatives like Senator Barry Goldwater Republican of Arizona to liberals like Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts The President has risked a new breach with the radical right wing of the Republican Party which has provided his most zealous political support through the years and is now openly dismayed over Mr Reagans Court choice Blunts Democrats Charge But in the process several members of Congress commented the President has blunted the rightwing stereotype that Democrats were beginning to use against him in the increasingly partisan battle over economic issues House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr Democrat of Massachusetts who has been in a toetotoe battle with Mr Reagan on the budget and taxes called a truce long enough to hail Judge OConnors nomination as the best thing hes done since he was inaugurated Meanwhile rightwing leaders were accusing the President of betraying the Republican platforms conditions on Court appointments To others the pragmatic symbolism of Judge OConnors selection followed the pattern of some of Mr Reagans early Cabinet appointments which plased mainstream Republicans irritated hardline conservatives and enabled the President to broaden his political appeal as his tenure began Now they said Mr Reagan is once again courting the political center at the expense of the radical right This is incredibly smart politics said Representative Morris K Udall a liberal Arizona Democrat Its a real strike You take all the groups in America and there has been none more distrustful of Reagan than the womens movement This just cuts the ground out from under them It will be doubly delicious to the leaders of the womens movement because people like Phyllis Schlafly will be trying to take Reagans head off Udall Praises Selection Mrs Schlafly a prominent Republican activist from Illinois has spearheaded the effort to block ratification of the proposed equal rights amendment to the Federal Constitution Judge OConnor is known for having supported the amendment though White House officials said that more recently she had expressed some reservations about it With Ronald Reagan as President the fact that you can get a woman appointed to the Court is remarkable Mr Udall asserted The fact that you can get someone as moderate and as close to the center of the Republican Party as she is is really stunning It erases the stereotype opposition to Reagan Some Senate conservatives such as Paul Laxalt Republican of Nevada took comfort though gingerly in the fact that President Reagan had pronounced himself fully satisfied with Mrs OConnor philosophically Other members of Congress cited Mrs OConnors conservative reputation suggesting that initially perhaps both liberals and conservatives were overinterpreting her flexibility on such issues as abortion As a member of the Arizona Senate in 1974 Mrs OConnor voted against a ban on abortions at Arizona University Hospital Sound and Fury Predicted But in the face of a volley of reproof from the National Right to Life Committee and other antiabortion and farright political action groups the White House took a detached view evidently convinced that the President had effectively isolated the far right on this selection Theres going to be a lot of sound and fury said one Reagan aide but it will wind up signifying little or nothing when its all over Senator Goldwater who had urged the choice on the President by telling him that Judge OConnor had chastised him in 1976 for backing President Ford said he was ready to battle the hard right I dont like to get kicked around by people who call themselves conservatives on a nonconservative matter he said If its going to take a fight theyre going to find old Goldy fighting like hell Over the last six months Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina has led the right wings battle against some Reagan appointments by delay and outright opposition in committee or on the Senate floor But the White House has stood firm and eventually prevailed No Comment From Senator Helms So far the North Carolina conservative has refrained from any comment on Judge OConnors nomination suggesting that he may be tactically reluctant to oppose her publicly But if past experience is any guide the Reagan White House may now compensate the vocal Republican right with some less visible appointments policy proposals or ideological rhetoric on social issues So far the Reagan team has pursued a careful political balance in its appointments often appealing first to mainstream Republicans then appeasing the vocal right Similarly the White House has remained aloof from the busing controversy in the Senate between liberals such as Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut and conservatives led by Mr Helms But once the Presidents economic package is out of the way the conservatives hope the President will once again assert his sharply conservative views on social issues
LAWMAKERS REPORT CONCERNS AT HOME ON REAGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/09/us/lawmakers-report-concerns-at-home-on-reagan.html,While Representative James L Oberstar was riding in a Fourth of July parade through his Minnesota district the Democratic lawmaker heard an earful from his constituents lining the parade route People were shouting Give Ronnie hell stop the Social Security cuts  Mr Oberstar recalled That was the principal focus As they returned to Washington today from their 10day holiday many mambers of Congress reported hearing similar sentiments about the President from voters back home They like the image of the man they like him as a king said Representative Mike Lowry Democrat of Washington But theyre really starting to wonder about the impact of his programs These growing doubts the Democrats concede are too little and too late to block the Presidents budget cuts Both houses have adopted budgets that conform closely to White House requests and the HouseSenate conference to resolve the remaining differences will begin next week But the Democrats hope to capitalize on these doubts in the coming fight over the tax bill which should reach the House floor the last week of July 50000 Question Cited In his campaign to promote the Democrats tax package the House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr of Massachusetts said today that the debate would turn on a 50000 question Voters who make less than that he said would be better off with the Democratic bill while wealthier taxpayers would gain more advantages under the Reagan plan The Democrats mood on Capitol Hill received a lift yesterday in Mississippi where Wayne Dowdy the 37yearold Democratic Mayor of McComb Miss won an upset victory over Liles B Williams in a special election to fill a vacant Congressional seat Mr Williams a Republican who is a staunch backer of President Reagans programs had been heavily favored to win the election In a statement to reporters this morning Mr ONeill tried to link the Mississippi election to the tax issue They voted their pocketbooks the Speaker said They voted to protect Social Security against Republican cuts They voted for a candidate who would look out for the average taxpayer who would stand up to big business and reject Reagans rich mans tax cut Criticism Called Exaggerated Republicans generally conceded that there were grumblings of discontent against the President but they discounted its political importance Representative Jim Courter Republican of New Jersey said that Democrats had grossly exaggerated the potential impact of the Reagan budget cuts and added I have a feeling that six months or a year from now people will say Hey things are not so bad  Representative Barber B Conable Jr Republican of upstate New York said that most criticism of the budget cuts was coming from those who had a vested interest in maintaining government programs People who depend on government programs either as beneficiaries or as employees are concerned about program cuts Mr Conable said What do you expect Moreover a sizeable group of lawmakers discerned continuing support for Mr Reagans economic austerity program The people of my district and I share their feeling have concluded that what were doing now is not working reported Representative Dan Daniel of Virginia one of 29 Democrats who provided Mr Reagans margin of victory in a key budget test 10 days ago They dont know whether the Presidents program will work but they want to give it a chance Changes in Social Security But even some Republicans believe that Mr Reagan hurt himself by proposing drastic changes in the Social Security System that would reduce benefits for workers who want to retire early To be honest with you I think it was a mistake Mr Courter said of the Presidents proposal He did a very bad job of articulating the problem Jimmy Carter never got people thinking about Ronald Reagans real program said Mr Lowry the Washington Democrat But the Social Security proposals more than anything else have made people start thinking about it A number of lawmakers also said that the Republicans were damaged by the hasty and confusing way they pushed their budget cuts through the House People were very upset with the way we passed the budget resolution said Representative Robert T Matsui Democrat of California I couldnt even tell them what was in it RightWing Criticism Growing From another direction some supporters of the President are concerned about the growing criticism directed against him by rightwing activists who believe he has not been sufficiently aggressive in promoting such social issues as a ban on abortions and a revival of school prayer Representative Gary A Lee Republican of upstate New York said that such issues were a sleeping giant that could disturb the harmonious environment the President had fostered in pressing for his economic program Democrats concede that Mr Reagan has virtually won the budget battle and that whatever tax bill emerges will clearly bear his imprint But they see some small reason for hope The President won this thing this year Mr Lowry said but theres always next year
BAKER SEEKS TO END DEBATE ON ANTIBUSING EFFORTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/09/us/baker-seeks-to-end-debate-on-antibusing-efforts.html,The Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr moved today to cut off debate on two antibusing proposals that have tied up the Senate floor since before the Fourth of July recess Attempting to clear the way for action on President Reagans economic program Mr Baker introduced a petition for cloture that if adopted by 60 senators in a vote scheduled for Friday would eventually end what was at first a lonely filibuster against the antibusing proposals by Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut Mr Baker said he would like to see consideration of controversial social and emotional issues including abortion as well as busing postponed until later this year or next year in order to get on with the business of the Senate But it was uncertain whether the cloture petition would succeed and whether it would clear the way for adoption of either of the antibusing measures which have been proposed as amendments to a bill authorizing spending by the Department of Justice It appeared that debate would continue into next week even if the cloture move succeeds 15 Senators Sign a Letter Mr Weicker was recently joined by other liberal and moderate senators and by the American Bar Association as well as civil rights and civil liberties groups in denouncing a proposal by Senator J Bennett Johnston Democrat of Louisiana that would severely restrict the power of Federal courts to order busing as a desegregation remedy According to a letter that has now been signed by 15 senators including Mr Weicker and Daniel Patrick Moynihan Democrat of New York the Johnston proposal would radically alter our basic constitutional framework by usurping the traditional power of the Federal courts to interpret and enforce constitutional rights Mr Baker said his cloture proposal would have the effect of postponing consideration of the Johnston amendment until later in the session Under Senate rules the amendment which deals with the Federal courts would be ruled out of order since it is not germane to the legislation it would amend the Department of Justice authorization bill Mr Baker expressed sympathy with the goals of the antibusing legislation but said it should be considered in freestanding debate later rather than as amendments to every bill that comes along However a cloture vote might not prevent further timeconsuming parliamentary maneuvering over another antibusing proposal sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina His proposal would be germane to the bill in that it would prevent the Justice Department from using appropriated funds to seek courtordered desegregation through busing Other Tactics in Mind A vote for cloture would theoretically clear the way for an expedited vote on the Helms amendment to the Department of Justice authorization bill which is similar to legislation that was passed by Congress last December but vetoed by President Carter But Senator Weicker has indicated that he has additional parliamentary tactics in mind including dozens of amendments that could prolong consideration of the Helms proposal long after the cloture vote even if he lost it And his determination to persist was apparently reinforced by the support he has received from other senators including Christopher J Dodd Democrat of Connecticut who today praised his colleagues courageous stand on constitutional principle Such a postcloture filibuster could eventually force Mr Baker to seek to defer consideration of the Helms antibusing proposal as well as the Johnston proposal in order to speed action on the Presidents economic program While Mr Johnston continued today to describe courtordered busing as an abuse as ineffective in achieving school desegregation as it is unpopular Mr Weicker and other opponents of the antibusing proposals sought to cast them as a radical effort to upset the delicate constitutional balance of powers between the Congress the Federal courts and the executive branch At a news conference sponsored by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People William Taylor of the Leadership Conference denounced the antibusing proposals as dangerous destructive and unconstitutional attempts to strip the courts of power to combat unconstitutional school segregation He said the Johnston proposal could open the floodgates to further courtstripping bills that have been introduced in Congress including proposals to remove all Federal court jurisdiction to decide cases involving abortion and prayer in the schools
SENATE UNIT VOTES BAN ON ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/10/us/senate-unit-votes-ban-on-abortions.html,A Senate subcommittee today approved legislation that could allow the states to prosecute abortion as murder a first Congressional step toward overturning the 1973 Supreme Court decision that a woman has the right to terminate her pregnancy By a vote of 3 to 2 the Senate Judiciarys Subcommittee on the Separation of Powers approved a measure that said the life of each human being starts at conception thus giving fetuses rights under the Constitution Senator John P East Republican of North Carolina who is the subcommittee chairman said after the vote in a packed chamber that he was extremely delighted at the outcome Joining Senator East in voting for the measure were two other Republican Senators Orrin G Hatch of Utah who expressed reservations about the bills constitutionality and Jeremiah Denton of Alabama Opposing the measure were the committees two Democrats Max Baucus of Montana and Howell Heflin of Alabama Mr Heflin said that the measure was an exercise in futility because the Supreme Court would inevitably refuse to overrule its landmark Roe v Wade decision legalizing abortions Curbing Contraceptive Measures Mr Baucus said that the bill would have the practical effect of barring such contraceptive measures as the intrauterine device which is believed to act after conception He also contended that the bill whose cosponsors include Senator Alfonse DAmato Republican of New York undermines the role of the judiciary as it has existed in this nation and will lead to an undercutting of the role of the states in our Federal system Although the vote was a triumph for the opponents of legalized abortion the victory was tempered somewhat by Senator Hatchs obvious unhappiness with the bill and his prediction that the abortion issue would probably not reach the Senate floor until next year Mr Hatch an influential Senate conservative who is also chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution said that his own panel would hold hearings in the fall on a constitutional amendment to ban abortions thereby delaying a full Judiciary Committee vote on the issue Mr Hatch an abortion foe said that he had serious constitutional reservations about the present bill and preferred instead a constitutional amendment to deny a woman the right to terminate her pregnancy He supported the bill he said because on an issue of this magnitude I would prefer that the collective wisdom of the entire Judiciary Committee rather than only this subcommittee be called into play Finding by Congress on Life The bill as voted today was amended somewhat by Mr East and says The Congress finds that the life of each human being begins at conception Previously the measure said present scientific evidence indicates a significant likelihood that life starts at conception Essentially the bill which was shaped by Stephen H Galebach a lawyer with the Washington firm of Covington  Burling seeks to extend to the unborn the rights of due process guaranteed under the 14th Amendment The bill would also prohibit lower Federal courts from considering challenges to the antiabortion legislation a maneuver that Mr Baucus said could be turned against conservatives on such issues as gun control Suellen Lowery legislative director of the National Abortion Rights Action League said this afternoon that despite the vote the organization remained somewhat optimistic about thwarting Congressional efforts to ban abortion We have managed to push this bill onto the back burner and it shows we have some real political strength Miss Lowery said She added that Senator East expected to push this bill through but he hasnt Faye Wattleton president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said While we regret the Senate subcommittee vote of 3 to 2 to report the human life statute to the full Senate Judiciary Committee we are encouraged that todays action effectively blocks immediate consideration by the full committee

GOLDWATER TELLS OPPONENTS OF O'CONNOR NOMINATION TO 'BACK OFF',https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/10/us/goldwater-tells-opponents-of-o-connor-nomination-to-back-off.html,Conservative groups today intensified their attack on Judge Sandra Day OConnor President Reagans nominee for the Supreme Court but Senate Republicans predicted victory and Senator Barry Goldwater warned that her critics should back off The Senate Republican leader Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee said at a news conference that Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina chairman of the Judiciary Committee had assured him that he was ready to move as soon as the White House formally submitted the nomination Mr Baker predicted that Judge OConnor would be confirmed easily either before the recess more likely shortly after we return on Sept 9 Judge OConnor 51 years old a former Republican leader in the Arizona Legislature serves on the Arizona Court of Appeals If confirmed she will replace Associate Justice Potter Stewart when the Court reconvenes on the first Monday of October Denounced Two Votes Antiabortion forces have denounced two votes that she cast in 1970 and 1974 while a member of the Arizona Senate and to some extent her past support for the proposed equal rights amendment to the Federal Constitution Senator Goldwater one of Judge OConnors leading supporters declared in a Senate speech that a lot of foolish claptrap had been circulated about her position Instead of jumping to conclusions about her views on the basis of years old positions that were taken in a different context and setting why cant these people wait until the nomination hearings Mr Goldwater asked The righttolife groups are totally off base and should back off But a coalition of 21 conservative and antiabortion groups charged that Mr Reagan did not fully understand Judge OConnors voting record The charge involved a Justice Department memorandum given to Mr Reagan that said Judge OConnor did not remember how she voted on the 1970 measure which concerned Arizonas criminal prohibitions against abortion Without All the Cards I think when he has all the facts  if they are true  he may change his mind said Paul Weyrich head of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress I think the decision was made without all the cards in the deck The White House said Judge OConnor would come to Washington next week to meet with members of the Judiciary Committee But a survey of the panel revealed no outright opposition with about half the members leaning in favor of the nomination and others withholding judgment pending confirmation hearings Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina a leading conservative who is a member of the Judiciary Committee said he would not comment before talking to Judge OConnor Another committee member Alan K Simpson Republican of Wyoming said I dont think there are enough horses to deny this nomination in any way
ABOUT WASHINGTON; AN OCCUPATION OF CIVIL LIFE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/11/us/about-washington-an-occupation-of-civil-life.html,There was great change in the nation in 1873 when the men of the Supreme Court sat together and ruled on Bradwell v Illinois It was an era when the slaves had been freed the frontier was retreating and women were fighting for the constitutional right to practice law finally reaching the highest court with their case God designed the sexes to occupy different spheres of action the majority ruled It belongs to men to make apply and execute the law Thus did Myra Bradwell suffer defeat and the State of Illinois enjoy victory in its law banning women lawyers If Myra Bradwell sought comfort in a separate opinion she found none in the concurrence of Mr Justice Bradley who felt the majoritys language too weak Man is or should be womans protector he said finding that the delicacy which belongs to the fair sex evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of civil life This is the law of the Creator declared the man Haunting Recollection Time has passed by Mr Justice Bradley But he is not forgotten by the successors of Myra Bradwell particularly as they prepare for the coming Senate inquiry into the nomination of Judge Sandra Day OConnor as the first woman member of the Supreme Court In the hours after Judge OConnors nomination this citys phenomenal predilection for reducing events to quickfix whitehot issues threatened to make her a mere adjunct to the endless abortion dispute as more than a dozen antiabortion lobbying groups found fault with her and promised to fight her confirmation Researchers and reporters went scrambling through obscure riders on forgotten construction bills passed by the Arizona Legislature and Judge OConnors longago remarks to a womens gathering in Texas While all this mad dash goes backward in the attempt to find litmus statements on a single issue of the present Phyllis N Segal would remind us not to lose a sense of history or humor for that matter  Man is or should be womans protector  she quoted Mr Justice Bradley with mock grandeur Its reminiscent of Justice Rehnquists ruling this year on women and the draft 100 Years in Arriving Mrs Segal is director of the National Organization for Womens Legal Defense and Education Fund and while others talk of Judge OConnor in terms of the abortion fight she talks of 100 years of slow progress for women lawyers She talks of Myra Bradwells failure to crack the Illinois bar of Belle Mansfields success in 1869 in the more tolerant state of Iowa in becoming the nations first woman admitted to the bar And by dint of statistics alone she talks of Judge OConnor as a pioneer woman regardless of her views of the outcome of the confirmation vote Judge OConnor was graduated from law school in 1952 when fewer than three in 100 law school students were female It was only 10 years before that the first women had been named to the Federal bench Judge OConnor herself has told of receiving a job offer upon graduation from a famous law firm  for the position of legal secretary All this makes her a pioneer even if she does come from the grudging present and the recent Victorian past of the law profession because of the slow progress described by Mrs Segal She notes that women were less than 1 percent of the Federal judiciary 10 years ago and are 7 percent now The situation is still so constricted in her view that the pool of higherranking Federal and state judges who are women must consist of superlawyer achievers a level of quality that Mrs Segal contends all but dictated someone of Judge OConnors caliber for the Supreme Court nomination even if the search committee had been looking for a woman who was more pleasing to rightwing interests Just Another Justice I dont expect to see the Supreme Courts votes changed by this appointment Mrs Segal said after four days of a crash study on the life and rulings of Judge OConnor But it breaks down important barriers and my only concern is that the hearing process not be made into a mockery by the far right Thus far the antiabortion groups opposed to Judge OConnor after beginning on the offensive appear to be risking isolation with no Senate sympathizer coming forward to carry their banner This situation reached the point yesterday where Senator Gordon J Humphrey the New Hampshire Republican who lent the groups a room to hold a news conference anxiously had an aide call up reporters later to disassociate himself from their opposition to Judge O Connor Only weeks ago Senators were scrambling aboard an antiabortion amendment sought by the same groups and they are likely to do so again in the future But in the case of Judge OConnor virtually all of the statements issued thus far by Senators have been positive and phrased not in terms of the abortion issue but in terms of developing history That point seemed well summarized by a tour guide yeterday afternoon in leading visitors up to a sculpture of three pioneer suffragists in the Capitol Susan B Anthony Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott all stared forward together only partially emerged from an otherwise unfinished granite block The sculptor Adelaide Johnson left it that way in 1925 the guide said because she said the womens work was never done
SENATE BARS CURB ON BUSING FILIBUSTER BY LIBERALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/11/us/senate-bars-curb-on-busing-filibuster-by-liberals.html,The Senate today rejected a move to invoke cloture to stop a filibuster by liberal Senators The liberals are opposed to a proposal that would severely limit the power of Federal courts to issue school busing orders in desegregation cases The vote of 38 in favor and 48 opposed was 22 short of the 60 required to halt a filibuster and left the busing dispute still dominating floor business However the majority leader Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee who had sought to close debate fearing that the busing issue would encroach on the tight schedule of President Reagans tax and budget program announced a bipartisan agreement The busing fight would be suspended next week in time for the scheduled consideration of the Administrations tax cut plan This is exactly the sort of thing I had hoped to avoid Senator Baker said early in the day as the tax package schedule seemed threatened He has attempted to put off such controversial social issues as busing and abortion in favor of the economic programs but senators keep bringing them up as amendments to routine bills The vote today was only the first of several expected attempts to deal with a tactical reversal of history in which Northern liberals have resorted to filibuster techniques polished in the past by Southerners fighting civil rights legislation A second cloture vote scheduled for Monday has a better chance of passage and would advance the maneuvering of the antibusing bloc Further Filibustering Vowed But even then the filibuster group led by Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut has hundreds of dilatory amendments in the hopper and has vowed to push the filibuster into the fall when Senators opposed to busing would like to have fresh law on the books for the school year The vote Monday will be on the cloture petition of Senator JBennett Johnson Democrat of Florida to cut off delaying tactics and get to a vote on his antibusing plan That proposal denounced by liberal senators and civil rights organizations as an unconstitutional usurping of powers would bar Federal courts from ordering buing of a child any more than five miles or a 15minute ride from the neighborhood school in desegregation cases It also provides for retroactivity and while critics contend that it could undo a decade of racial progress Senator Johnson contends busing has only achieved white flight Cloture Vote on Monday I think weve got a good shot at cloture Monday Senator Johnson said after the vote today noting that there has been majority sentiment to curtail busing That sentiment however has been for a second proposal which Senator Weicker also promises to filibuster against that would bar the Justice Department from schoolbusing cases That proposal sponsored by Senator Jesse A Helms Republican of North Carolina is acceptable to President Reagan and has been approved by the House Senator Weicker said after the vote today that he welcomed any and all delays of the Presidents economic program I can never win in the sense of winning on the issue itself he said But I can see that one day at a time we never get to that final vote The outlook is that the Senate will still be on the busing issue well into September after the summer recess
Politics; ABORTION DIVIDING 2 PARTIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/12/nyregion/politics-abortion-dividing-2-parties.html,WHILE the Conservative and Right to Life Parties maintain a tenuous relationship throughout most of the state the two parties have broken in Nassau County with the Conservative Party in effect trying to put the Right to Life Party out of business in the county where the Right to Life Party is strongest and where much of its leadership lives John OLeary the Conservative Party chairman in Nassau and Joseph M Margiotta the Republican county leader have joined forces to persuade Republican and Conservative candidates not to seek or accept Right to Life Party endorsement in an effort to reduce the partys bargaining leverage Mr Margiotta has often criticized all the minor parties and would presumably like to shut out the Conservative Party too But that might jeopardize Republican candidates who need Conservative votes to win It was Mr OLeary who prompted the break with his argument that Right to Life was splintering the antiabortion forces He argued that the Conservative Party also opposes abortion but that significantly he and his party do not go as far as the Right to Life Party in flatly opposing abortion under all circumstances Mr OLeary said that he would support abortion if a mothers life were threatened or in cases of rape or incest He also questioned the effort in Washington to define by law at what stage of pregnancy life begins Despite these differences Mr OLeary contended that there was room in one party  the Conservative Party  for both groups They should fold their tent and rejoin us said Mr OLeary who conceded that the Right to Life Party had siphoned off Conservative Party members as well as members of other parties He has been county chairman for nine years and is one of the senior Conservative leaders in the state In Suffolk where the Right to Life Party is also relatively strong relations between that party and the Conservatives have been strained but not to the breaking point Neil Greene the new Conservative chairman in Suffolk said recently that the Right to Life Party has to be more in tune with us on issues other than abortion The Nassau County Conservative break with the Right to Life Party was precipitated according to other Conservative leaders when Guy Mazza a Republican narrowly won a special Assembly election earlier this year to replace Thomas S Gulotta Mr Gulotta had been named Hempstead Town Presiding Supervisor succeeding Alfonse M DAmato What made the special election significant was the narrowness of Mr Mazzas victory and the fact that the Right to Life Party provided his winning margin after the Conservative Party had declined to endorse him To compound the embarrassment for the Conservatives the Right to Life vote was higher than the Conservative Party vote  a clear threat to the Conservative bargaining leverage at least in that Assembly District and possibly an omen of future problems Serphim R Maltese the Conservative Partys state executive director said that the state party had recommended to Conservative county organizations that an attempt be made to coexist with the Right to Life Party although the final decision would be made at the county level I dont know of another county in the state where there is a problem said Mr Maltese who was also Queens Conservative chairman He noted that in New York City the Conservative Party had decided to endorse William Powderly the Brooklyn Right to Life leader as the ConservativeRight to Life joint candidate for City Comptroller At the same time in an undoubted quid pro quo the Right to Life Party is supporting Michael Long the Conservative chairman in Brooklyn for a City CouncilmanatLarge seat Mr Long is also a vice chairman of the states Conservative Party and a member of its inner circle Mary Jane Tobin of Merrick the state chairman of the Right to Life Party said that the party had been willing to consider endorsing Nassau Republicans including County Executive Francis T Purcell who is seeking reelection for a second term in November But Mrs Tobin said Mr Purcell and other Republican candidates refuse to meet with the Right to Life Party leaders She said that as a result the party would field its own candidates with one notable exception District Attorney Denis E Dillon a Democrat who has been endorsed by all parties Mrs Tobin said that last year Mr Margiotta had personally appealed to her to support Mr DAmato for the Senate and this year Mr Mazza for the Assembly But that of course was prior to Margiottas arrangement with OLeary she said Theres no doubt we can make a difference Mrs Tobin said The name of the game is votes
NOMINEE FOR HIGH COURT: A RECORD DEFYING LABELS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/12/us/nominee-for-high-court-a-record-defying-labels.html,Like supporters and detractors of her Supreme Court nomination Sandra Day OConnor devoted the better part of this week to a review of the state legislation and judicial decisions that constitute the record of much of her public life With her office at the Arizona Court of Appeals here overflowing with congratulatory bouquets her desk cluttered with papers and files and her law clerk husband and friends helping with the review Judge OConnor looked up at a brief break yesterday morning to sigh Its a nightmare Fifty years is a long time she said and its hard to remember everything you did Differences of Temperament The review is far from complete but the woman public and private who has so far emerged from an examination of of those records and from conversations with friends colleagues and adversaries is by political instinct judicial philosophy economic standing and personal temperament both similar to and different from the constituency that elected Ronald Reagan President Judge OConnor emerges as a sometime conservative with a moderate even progressive streak a determined woman but not a dogmatic one President Reagan described her as a person for all seasons but she appears to be something less than the advocate that other supporters including many in the feminist movement have made her out to be At the same time she is clearly more complex than her detractors including Moral Majority and the antiabortion lobby have suggested Her record as an Arizona state senator and state judge provides few clues to Judge OConnors positions on some of the most important questions likely to come before the Supreme Court But her votes and decisions on other matters are also being examined closely They include support of measures to limit state spending to restore the death penalty and to ban compulsory school busing to achieve racial balance In her six years on the bench Judge OConnor has never had occasion to rule on the subject of abortion But the record she compiled on that issue and on the proposed Federal equal rights amendment in the previous six years which she spent in the Arizona Senate has generated dismay and even outrage among political conservatives and antiabortion groups The Reagan Administration seemingly surprised by the swiftness and severity of the criticism has attempted to minimize the extent of Judge OConnors support for legislation allowing abortion in Arizona But legislative records disclose several occasions on which she voted in favor of making abortions more widely available Vote in Committee In 1970 the year after Mrs OConnor was appointed to fill a vacancy in the State Senate she was a member of the Senates Judiciary Committee which considered a bill that would have repealed state statutes prohibiting abortions Committee votes were not recorded in the Senate in 1970 but The Phoenix Gazette reported on Feb 26 that year that Mrs OConnor was among six of the nine committee members who voted to approve the bill which later died in the Rules Committee On Wednesday the Administration made public a memorandum prepared by Kenneth W Starr a counsellor to Attorney General William French Smith asserting that Judge OConnor had no recollection of how she voted on the bill Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who this week began a standard background examination of Judge OConnor were said to have interviewed Dr Carolyn Gerster a Phoenix internist and past president of the National Right to Life organization who has said she is dismayed by Judge OConnors nomination Direction From White House Judge OConnor according to a close friend believes that the White House has oversimplified her position on abortion In a brief conversation Judge OConnor said that while she badly wanted to clear up the confusion surrounding her voting record she had been asked by the White House not to discuss abortion or other matters of substance until her appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee In 1974 Mrs OConnor then the Senate majority leader voted against a measure to prohibit the use of public funds for abortion The same year she opposed a bill prohibiting abortions at the University of Arizona hospital The Starr memorandum asserted that Mrs OConnor opposed the latter bill because it was attached as a rider to another measure permitting the university to issue bonds to expand sports facilities and therefore a nongermane amendment that she believed violated the State Constitution The memorandum says that her reasons for so voting are nowhere stated on the record According to newspaper accounts in 1974 Mrs OConnor also voted against a resolution asking Congress to amend the United States Constitution to legally recognize the right to life of the fetus The year before she was one of 10 senators who cosponsored a bill requiring that all medically acceptable birth control methods be made available to anyone regardless of age She also voted that year for a bill permitting doctors and other hospital employees to refuse to perform abortions Cant Explain Protests Some of those who served with her in the legislature dismiss the suggestion that Judge OConnor supports abortion I dont know what theyre upset about said Donna C West a Republican Senator here who calls herself a prolife legislator I have known her for 15 years and Ive never seen anything that would lead me to believe shes proabortion Mrs West said I have never considered her an antilife person Those votes that Sandra cast were a number of years ago I know from personal conversations that she is personally opposed to abortion When the proposed equal rights amendment came before the Arizona Senate for ratification in the early 1970s Mrs OConnor voted for it twice once in the Judiciary Committee and again on the Senate floor where the measure failed by a single vote In 1974 Mrs OConnor was coauthor of a resolution which failed to clear the Judiciary Committee urging that the question of ratification be put to a popular vote Mrs OConnor also took the lead in revising several Arizona statutes that discriminated against women in such areas as the number of hours they were permitted to work parental consent and child custody matters Less Than Ardent Feminist It is those votes that have prompted conservative and fundamentalist religious groups to label Judge OConnor a feminist even a radical one an idea that makes those who know her scoffShe certainly believes that a woman ought to be educated and have equal opportunities that a woman can make a fine lawyer or a doctor said a Phoenix lawyer who is close friend But the lawyer who asked that his name not be used recalled that the Paradise Valley Country Club to which she and her husband belong had a mens grill where women were not permitted at lunch Judge OConnor he said has often kidded about how foolish it is that some women get so provoked about how they cant sit down with the boys and have a beer and a hamburger Susan Freeman another lawyer who knows Judge OConnor described her as concerned about women and she is concerned about people generally but shes certainly not a radical feminist Several of those who served with Mrs OConnor in the Senate praised her dedication to legislative process suggesting at the same time that she might be better suited by temperament to the law and the bench Because she is so intense she really does not suffer fools gladly said one longtime observer of the legislature and in the Legislature you have to suffer fools constantly Case of Talent Winning Out Colleagues and friends characterize Judge OConnor with the same words and phrases smart but not brilliant hard working intense meticulous nononsense demanding dedicated and ambitious The first woman to serve as majority leader of any state senate in the nation Mrs OConnor won that job in 1972 because of what several former colleagues said was a general admiration for her intelligence and insistence on precision rather than her personal popularity  a case as one put it of talent winning out Bill Jacquin who was president of the Arizona Senate at the time said he had backed Mrs OConnor against fairly stiff competition because Sandra possessed all the attributes  she does her homework she knows how to get the proper things out of her staff She has a very precise and concise mind and was able to do that very well She does not have the charisma in the sense of stirring speeches that kind of thing said Mr Jacquin who now heads the Arizona Chamber of Commerce She does have the ability to make an articulate speech that is founded on fact and thats what I was looking for Judge OConnor was first elected to the Senate in 1970 four years after a group of young Republicans took control of the Legislature after decades of domination by rural Democrats The Republicans Mrs OConnor among them passed a Medicaid bill a nofault divorce statute a strong antipollution law and legislation requiring public bodies to conduct open meetings Conservative to Moderate Despite her stance on such issues however Mr Jacquin asserted that Mrs OConnor was no more liberal than the man in the moon Shes conservative to moderate Mr Jacquin said Another colleague called her not liberal or conservative  shes just what she is Though active in Republican Party politics  Mrs OConnor was an alternate delegate to the 1972 Republican National Convention and cochairman of the Arizona Committee to ReElect the President  one friend a liberal Democrat described her as very decent in her dealings with people of different points of view Her record seems to show more attention to issues than to ideology She voiced strong objections to an antipornography bill she considered too vague and too broad for example but also supported measures to limit state spending to restore the death penalty and to ban compulsory school busing to achieve racial balance Not Many Clues in Record Her record as a legislator does not provide many clues however to Mrs OConnors positions on some of the most important questions likely to come before the Supreme Court She has never been required to render judicial interpretations of the Federal civil rights laws In Mrs OConnors tenure on the state senate she opposed gun control and public aid to parochial and private schools but the Legislature did not consider such other important topics as sentencing of criminals and school prayer Nor have her six years as a judge first in State Superior Court and for the last 18 months on the Arizona Court of Appeals where her opinions concerned such matters as workers compensation landlordtenant disputes and criminal matters given her much opportunity to confront decide questions that surround such larger social issues They have however earned her a reputation among Phoenix lawyers as a thorough and wellprepared judge She frequently knew more about a case from having reviewed the file than the lawyers did said Barry Silverman a Maricopa County Commissioner and lawyer who has appeared often before Judge OConnor Every other year the Arizona Bar Association asks its members to rate the judges before whom they practice and despite the praise now being offered in her behalf Judge OConnor has not scored high marks in those polls Relatively Low Ratings As a Superior Court judge in 1976 she received the same rating as two other judges while the other three got higher ones In 1978 Judge OConnor received the lowest score of the eight judges rated In 1980 her first year on the appellate bench she placed eighth among the 10 judges rated One Phoenix lawyer called Judge OConnor a good lawyer not a perfect lawyer a good trial judge and a better appellate judge Among other things he said she was one of the few Arizona judges who insisted that all hearings in her courtroom be opened to the public rather than conducted in chambers Shes pretty independent said Paul Eckstein an acquaintance who is also a lawyer Those people who are supporting her may be surprised by her and those people who are opposing her may come to like her Another lawyer who knows Judge OConnor predicted that she will not be a quick study but she will be a thorough study Andy Hurwitz an aide to Gov Bruce Babbitt of Arizona and a former clerk to Potter Stewart the Justice whose place on the High Court Judge OConnor has been nominated to fill noted that at the age of 51 she is younger than any of the eight sitting justices and would have time to grow into the job A Real Learning Curve Theres a real learning curve up there for anybody Mr Hurwitz said He added that her lack of Federal judicial experience would not be a serious detriment because civil and criminal procedure in the Arizona were nearly identical with those in the Federal courts Judge OConnor was born Sandra Day on March 26 1930 in El Paso Tex but she spent her earliest years on her familys 162000acre ranch the Lazy B which her grandfather founded a century ago near Duncan in southeastern Arizona Because there were no schools in Duncan that suited her parents Harry and Ada Mae Day as a young girl Mrs OConnor was sent to live with her maternal grandmother in El Paso and to attend school there She did well graduating from high school at the age of 16 She then entered Stanford University with which she has maintained a lifelong affiliation most recently as a trustee At a time when most women at Stanford were majoring in education she won a bachelors degree in economics awarded with great distinction and a law degree obtaining both in six years Younger and Shyer Her sophomore roommate Marilyn Brown remembered her as a very shy young woman who spoke with the soft accents of west Texas but who seemed more than equal to university life Even though she was younger than us she always seemed to handle it Mrs Brown said She never got upset She never went into a panic about anything She was easy to get along with and she was fun After her graduation in 1952 from law school where she ranked in the top 10 percent of her class Sandra Day married a classmate John Jay OConnor 3d now a successful corporate attorney here and like his wife heavily involved in civic affairs One close friend described the couple as partygoers especially Mrs OConnor who also has a reputation as an excellent cook and a lover of fine wines Sandra likes to socialize likes to see people the friend said Though Mrs OConnors biography lists her as an Episcopalian the friend said that neither she nor her husband were active churchgoers Despite her many charitable and civic activities including the past presidency of the Phoenix Junior League another friend a lawyer described Judge OConnor as a very stiff formal person Other acquaintances said her lack of convivality and campaigning skills had probably cost her the Republican gubernatorial nomination three years ago Limited Social Contacts Income status and background  Mr OConnor is the son of a prominent San Francisco doctor  have limited the OConnors exposure to people much like themselves the sort of upwardly mobile Arizonans who belong to the Paradise Valley Country Club one of the most exclusive in town where memberships sell for 15000 The club has an open membership policy but no black members Joe Brem the general manager said none had been proposed for membership in the club in the 11 years that he has been there Mr OConnor also belongs to the even more exclusive Valley Field Riding and Polo Club a group of 100 people who meet for monthly dinner parties Mr OConnors law firm Fennemore Craig von Ammon  Udall counts among its clients the Kennecott Copper Company the Santa Fe Railroad and Mountain Bell Lawyers who know Mr OConnor estimated that he earned at least 300000 a year but an individual familiar with the familys finances said the sum was substantially less although still in six figures Relatively High Assets If Judge OConnor is confirmed by the Senate she will be one of the wealthier Supreme Court justices According to a source familiar with the familys finances she and her husband have a net worth of at least 500000 As a legislator and judge in Arizona Mrs OConnor has filed annual financial disclosure statements that provide a limited but still illuminating view of the familys holdings and investments A review of these statements along with other public documents and interviews with those knowledgeable about the OConnors finances suggests that they manage their money cautiously Their portfolio of investments is relatively small and conservative with modest holdings in real estate ranching chemical and transportation companies and oil exploration ventures that apparently serve as tax shelters The OConnors largest asset is their home in Paradise Valley an exclusive suburb of Phoenix Set on an acreandahalf lot off a culdesac in the shadow of Camelback Mountain the adobe house has an assessed value of 201000 and an unpaid mortgage of 40000 Realtors here said it might sell today for close to half a million dollars Share in Law Firm The OConnors next largest asset the source said is Mr OConnors partnership share of his law firm one of the largest and most successful in the Southwest Friends said that if he left the firm as he may decide to do should his wife be confirmed the sale of his partnership might bring him 150000 Another major financial and sentimental holding is Judge OConnors share of her familys business the Lazy B Cattle Company which grazes perhaps 2000 head of cattle on more than 160000 acres near the ArizonaNew Mexico border most of it leased from the state or Federal Government Harry Day Mrs OConnors 83yearold father is president of the company Judge OConnor is a director and H Alan Day her younger brother manages the ranch Although its earnings are not made public in recent years the Lazy B has been involved less in ranching and more in other activities A decade ago cattle accounted for nearly oneseventh of the companys reported assets of 555573 Last year however less than 5 percent of the companys 746016 in assets was cattle according to reports filed with the Arizona Corporation Commission The OConnors stock holdings are limited according to the judges most recent financial statement which lists stock in five publicly traded companies Gorman Rupp a manufacturer of water pumps Eastman Kodak Nalco Chemicals Apple Computer and Southwest Forest Industries Sources said that the OConnors sold their holdings in Southwest Forest earlier this year The sources said that the OConnors stake in each of these companies ranged from 5000 to 25000 Limited Real Estate Ventures Over the last two decades the OConnors have joined in limited partnership real estate development ventures records show including investments in 80 acres in west Phoenix and in an apartment complex both of which were later sold Other OConnor investments include interests in shopping centers here two energyexploration concerns that serve as tax shelters and a leasing company that operates jet helicopters to ferry technicians to and from offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico Mr OConnor told friends this week that given the suddeness of his wifes nomination he had not had time to consider what steps he might take to place his holdings in trust if Mrs OConnor is confirmed As a State Senator Mrs OConnor did not always recuse herself when legislation that might bear on her or her familys investments was presented for a vote Though she did excuse herself from voting on one major banking bill in 1973 when she was a director of the First National Bank of Arizona she voted in favor of at least four bills that could have affected her familys cattle business While her husband was serving as a director of two Phoenix automobile dealerships Mrs OConnor voted in favor of legislation containing provisions that gave existing dealers the power to keep potential competitors out of their market areas Judge OConnor who is spending the weekend away from Phoenix could not be reached for comment on those votes

WHAT TO ASK JUDGE O'CONNOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/12/opinion/what-to-ask-judge-o-connor.html,Some of the objections to Sandra OConnor are about as relevant to her fitness for the Supreme Court as abortions are relevant to stadiums The righttolife movement seems to think that abortion is germane to everything so it cant understand why Judge OConnor when she was the majority leader of the Arizona State Senate opposed an antiabortion rider to a football stadium bill because it seemed nongermane Wed be troubled if she had seen a connection But zealotry is not the only basis for raising questions about nominees for the Supreme Court Their longrun philosophical positions are generally wholly unpredictable Yet a Presidents most lasting legacy may reside in the mind and manner of the Justices he appoints The Senate has a duty to explore both responsibly At first glance her record is appealing But much more needs to be known about her and about the depth and nature of her conservatism How Judge OConnor handles herself under questioning also will tell much about the quality of the Presidents choice The art of getting confirmed is openness where possible  and circumspection when the questions get too close to prejudging issues that may come before the Court Some questions arise from the uniqueness of the nomination Judge OConnor follows 101 male justices Others arise from the simple fact that so little is known of her outside Arizona where she gained prominence as an assistant state attorney general legislator judge and civic leader What does she think will be the effect of a woman on the Court Are there times when there is validly a womans point of view in the law Would she speak up for womens interests if her male colleagues seemed oblivious to them How has her personal experience with job bias influenced her view of laws against discrimination After graduation with high honors from Stanford Law School at least one law firm thought she was applying for a secretarial job She had to overcome such obstacles before the womens movement and civil rights laws began to be effective Is she indignant Does she think others must climb the ladder the way she did without much help from the law Does she see a special role for the Federal courts including the Supreme Court as a guardian of constitutional rights Some people are inclined to fault her nomination because she lacks experience in the Federal courts She has written that Federal judges should put more trust in state courts Yet when there is a choice many Americans prefer Federal courts where judges are more independent less tied to local politics When is Federal judicial action necessary What in her public life demonstrates a commitment to helping people whom society has not always been eager to protect Her own career testifies to her views about equal opportunity for women It would be encouraging to learn that she is in life as well as law committed to equal justice for all
ONLY ULTRAS FIGHT MRS. O'CONNOR FOR THE HIGH COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/12/weekinreview/only-ultras-fight-mrs-o-connor-for-the-high-court.html,Honored and happy Sandra Day OConnor was also silent and circumspect on questions of her judicial philosophy last week after President Reagan nominated her as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court The 51yearold Arizona state judge would be the first woman on the Court Her interpretation of the Constitution Judge OConnor said must await the Senate confirmation hearings now likely in September This discreet silence coupled with ambiguity in some aspects of her legislative and judicial biography allowed for enough different interpretations to prompt qualified support from feminist groups while touching off conflict within the Presidents own conservative camp Despite the dustup however early predictions had her taking former Justice Potter Stewarts seat on the Court by the October term A conservative Justice was what President Reagan wanted particularly one who would exercise restraint and deference to the legislative branch in making law and shaping social policy Justice Rehnquist the Courts resident conservative page 22 Shes establishment Republican said a leading Democratic politician adding however that she was not of the kneejerk mold An Arizona Assistant Attorney General from 1965 through 1968 Judge OConnor joined the state Senate in 1969 and became the first woman to serve as majority leader She compiled a record of mainstream conservative Republicanism that helped her win election as a Superior Court judge in 1975 and she developed a reputation for openmindedness that led a Democrat Governor Bruce Babbitt to elevate her to Arizonas Court of Appeals 18 months ago On the bench Judge OConnor has been praised as a skilled technician whose reasoned opinions are grounded in precedent Like her classmate at Stanford Law School Justice William H Rehnquist she seems to favor judicial restraint The National Organization for Women called the OConnor nomination a victory for womens rights and the National Womens Political Caucus said it showed that women are breaking the barriers of nearly 200 years of exclusion from decision making in our nation The most heated opposition came surprisingly from conservatives of the Moral Majority stripe To their charge that she favored the equal rights amendment the White House responded that she was neither as enthusiastic as some proponents nor as alarmed by it as some opponents Rebutting assertions that as a legislator she had voted for abortion rights the White House quoted her as saying she had no recollection of having voted in such a manner that she finds abortion personally repugnant and that in 1973 she sponsored legislation granting medical personnel in Arizona the right not to participate in abortions All this says little as to how Judge OConnor would vote as a member of the Court However observers say that the addition of even a highly conservative member would bring no radical shift in the Courts decisions
VOTES BY WOMEN IN G.O.P. ATTACKED,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/12/us/votes-by-women-in-gop-attacked.html,Leading officials of the Democratic Party today challenged the National Womens Political Caucus one of the countrys two largest feminist political groups to stop supporting Republican women in Congress who vote for the Reagan Administrations budget cuts Polly Baca Barragan a Colorado State Senator who is vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee told Democrats in the caucus that they should push for a reevaluation of the organizations willingness to back such Republicans Even the Congresswomen who were elected with feminist support she said had to toe the party line and vote against the economic survival of the women of this country In an interview Kathy Wilson a Republican from Alexandria Va who is slated to be elected the national chairman of the caucus tomorrow said that Senator Baca Barragans approach would weaken both the caucus and the ability of Republican feminists to alter their partys policy I want my party back she declared Senator Baca Barragans demand brought into the open a critical tension within this influential group Among feminist political organizations the caucuss 55000 members place it second only to the National Organization for Women which has 125000 members and its active Washington office and roster of experienced politicians in its membership have made it important in the capital Strains Within Caucus For years the caucus has had a distinctive bipartisanship but that characteristic has brought internal strains This is especially true during Republican Administrations when it becomes obvious to members that Republican women do not exercise an influence on policy comparable to that wielded by Democrats when their party controls the White House That friction is particularly severe at the groups 10th anniversary convention here Speaker after speaker praised President Reagan for his selection of Judge Sandra Day OConnor for the Supreme Court But then they quickly turned to criticizing the Administration over its opposition to the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution its policy on abortion and its budget reductions in a wide range of programs Republican caucus members had a chance this morning to join in by complaining to the highest ranking representative of their party at the convention They told Gary van Buskirk assistant deputy director of the coalition division of the Republican National Committee that they felt the partys leadership showed no support for feminist Republicans their candidacies or their issues The absence of an Administration representative was matched by that of Republican women in Congress who were criticized by Senator Baca Barragan and Ann F Lewis political director of the Democratic National Committee A caucus official said that all Republican women in Congress except United States Senator Paula Hawkins of Florida had been invited to be present Jill Ruckelshaus the most prominent Republican on the convention program mixed harsh criticism of the Administration on the same economic issues cited by Senator Baca Barragan with praise for the caucus itself Praise for Caucus Activities She said that the constant pressure of demonstrators in last falls campaign and findings of polls had caused Mr Reagan to promise to appoint a woman to the Supreme Court And the caucuss role in organizing those demonstrations clearly showed she said how important it is for the National Womens Political Caucus to be strongly and visibly bipartisan Democrats here were far from unanimous about the theme of the State Senators speech In a meeting this morning Deborah Chankin a Los Angeles delegate warned that the proposal to end support to Republicans because of their votes brings us to the brink of saying that the National Womens Political Caucus as now conceived will not work Iris Mitgang the outgoing caucus chairman said in an interview that the organization should avoid adopting a policy that could cost our unique ability to talk to both sides of the aisle But the California Democrat acknowledged that the call for a new approach reflected the fact that the policies of the Reagan Administration would make it harder for the group to maintain its bipartisanship In a news conference yesterday the conventions keynote speaker Eleanor Holmes Norton former chairman of the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission urged sympathy for the Republican lawmakers Although she attacked brutal cuts in programs that affect women and called it a tragedy that Republican women in Congress had supported those reductions she said We need to be more tolerant of our Republican sisters They are in a party which has at least one wing that daily reads itself out of the 20th century Republicans Stands Assailed Mrs Lewis responded that she saw no point in sympathy when the Republican lawmakers could not provide a single vote against any of the budget reductions As Government activities in which reductions would hurt women particularly hard Senator Baca Barragan today cited Federal programs to combat sex discrimination in schools and colleges the Comprehensive Education and Training Act programs family planning centers the 122 monthly minimum Social Security benefit Medicaid and the protein supplements program for pregnant women
THE POLLING OF AMERICA,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/12/books/the-polling-of-america.html,NEW RULES Searching for SelfFulfillment in a World Turned Upside Down By Daniel Yankelovich 278 pp New York Random House 1595 IN Americas version of democracy polls play a vital role Questions asked of citizens seem to know no bounds We are asked to rate a new nail polish and a Presidents performance or to list what we think we want in a marriage partner We are pressed for opinions on issues of the day even if no one is entirely sure what an MX missile does The Census our largest poll by far prints 300000 pages of figures based on answers to such questions as 16H If you get your water from a well is it drilled or dug A democracy is supposed to be responsive so we pay serious attention to whatever people say The result is a thriving opinion industry armed with clipboards and computers which limns the public mind in columns of percentages Daniel Yankelovich the president and founder of a successful polling firm has even grander aspirations for the techniques of his trade He believes that the figures he has collected if analyzed with care reveal a cultural revolution occurring in our midst Indeed his interviews have uncovered nothing less than the rise of a new American philosophy of life in unexpected quarters New Rules posits three stages in the nations cultural history roughly representing the past present and a probable future Until the late 1950s Americans generally adhered to a givinggetting compact Following the Puritanbased canon that pleasure must be earned and that work and family duties were principal pursuits you only took out of the system as much as you put in The 60s and 70s saw the rise of the notion of ones innate right to selffulfillment accompanied by the arrival of introspection as a mass phenomenon And Mr Yankelovich has the data to prove it In the late seventies he states our surveys showed 72 percent of Americans spending a great deal of time thinking about themselves He does not say what occupied the minds of the other 28 percent perhaps their fellowcitizens in the first 72 percent But this era may be ending A new restlessness is spreading among younger Americans  who lack clearly defined goals and feel utterly aimless Self is not enough Recent polls show a poignant and inchoate yearning to elevate what might be called the sacredexpressive aspects of their lives But to understand why this new stage is coming we must see what has gone wrong with the way we are now That is what New Rules is largely about To support his thesis about the recent rise and subsequent disenchantment with selfabsorption Mr Yankelovich focuses on the 17 percent of adult Americans he calls the strongform group These are the younger affluent professionals dear to upscale advertisers culled from his computer by a program called the Singleton segmentation procedure We learn a lot about them For example 60 percent of the members of this group say they have powerful creativity needs as opposed to only 29 percent of everyone else No less than 86 percent volunteered that they enjoy an occasional elegant meal with wine and candlelight While the menus are not mentioned a clue emerges when we learn that 50 percent are fond of wheat germ and natural foods high in fiber No less than 57 percent engage in analyzing their dreams including some from the 44 percent who like sleeping in water beds New Rules is not all numbers Mr Yankelovich took to the road to talk with real Americans the better to evoke the complexity and individual ity of peoples lives In his book he recounts 13 out of several hundred interviews In them we see that while strong formers are clearly actual people most of them seem to come from sociologys equivalent of Hollywoods Central Casting There is Robert Agnoli all names are fictional a political science professor whose life has gone awry since his wife left to live with another woman Or Sara Lou Wellford an Alabama belle who divorced her doctorhusband went to law school and is doing well in San Francisco Well not too well She is often anxious and depressed she overeats and has more than once sought psychotherapy And then Mark and Abby Williams a very vocal couple He gets 24000 as a public service lawyer she makes 36000 editing an industrial magazine Mark says he doesnt mind that his wife makes more money than he does perhaps because if Abbys instincts are right hes having an affair with one of his clients For her part Abby talks a lot about her unfilled potentials and need to keep growing Mark holds up his end of the conversation with terms like dimension and proclivity Mr Yankelovich doubts that the marriage will last which often seems to be the case when you search for selffulfillment Lyndon Hendries has gotten rich in Houston doing public relations so he knows what to say when being interviewed Ive adequately achieved the external goals  but the personal price is way too high for ego gratification  I have an incredible number of people demanding things from me personally and professionally and I am pleased when I can say no I have grown more selfish in recent years valuing myself more than family members powerful peers bosses or clients Someone should warn Mrs Hendries Some strong formers have found happiness usually by scaling down Like Margaret Greenson resettled in Santa Fe and employed at a local museum Or Samuel Moscowitz who sold his hardware store and works as a parttime guide in the Florida Everglades And Miguel Feliciano a Manhattan mail clerk who seems to live for his bicycle and for racing Few of these people come across as interesting  Studs Terkel plumbs much farther than Mr Yankelovich  but perhaps that is the point Selfabsorption came easily in an affluent economy As opportunities expanded and much of the population prospered individuals concluded that the distance they had come was due to talents of their own Professional occupations opened up and the number of people who felt they knew a lot concurrently grew Education  especially the spread of social science which made psychology a game anyone could play  obviously helped Yet insofar as selfabsorption is Mr Yankelovichs thesis it remains rather sketchy To begin with Americans have always had a selfcentered streak One has only to open Alexis de Tocqueville to see mirror images of ourselves a century and a half ago One effect of the democratic spirit he wrote is to concentrate every mans attention upon himself It could of course be argued that individualism took a different form in the past when it was entrepreneurial in thrust and people wanted money so they could surround themselves with tangible possessions But have things changed that much To be sure tastes have turned more sophisticated We are no longer as materialistic or so we like to think Instead of amassing large or expensive objects we now collect experiences in the form of food and travel and an array of entertainments We are as acquisitive as ever we just have a different shopping list Mr Yankelovich predicts more significant changes as scarcity becomes the rule He says that surveys already show that Americans are growing less selfabsorbed According to his statistics while only 32 percent of us were searching for community in 1973 by 1980 the proportion with that craving had grown to 47 percent Not only that 70 percent of Americans confess they have few friends and wish they could have more Similarly a Playboy poll found 53 percent of the nations men searching for someone to be totally open and honest with These responses suggest to Mr Yankelovich that we will be seeing a renewed emphasis on the social virtues of sharing giving committing sacrificing participating and even denying ones own pleasures of the moment All that plus the advent of a sacred expressive ethic The problem with predictions based on polling is that all you have to go on are the things that people say Americans are a verbal people attuned to the latest phrases All that talk of 70s selffulfillment Mr Yankelovich eventually admits was really so much talk Why then take seriously the new vocabulary of sharing and commitment considering that it comes from the very same segment of the population One suspects that they have seized on openness and honesty as new experiences rather like discovering a new restaurant or resort If we are to live by New Rules the shape of peoples character will have to undergo some basic changes In particular we will need to relinquish our insistence on personal importance In fact there are already Americans who adhere to such an ethic Mr Yankelovich hardly mentions them except as a statistic According to his computer 20 percent of the population still adheres to traditional norms In fact the figure may be higher if not quite a moral majority these citizens who are strongly patriotic and dutiful in their relationship to their religion and who take their responsibility to their families very seriously have certainly shown strength at polls where votes are actually cast Many of them express their commitment to a moral community through their opposition to abortion They believe that sex has responsibilities and people who treat it lightly should be made to pay a price In ways Mr Yankelovichs strong formers cannot comprehend these Americans know the meaning of friendship For them closeness comes through religious worship or perhaps through associational activities like gun clubs and hunting groups More than 25 million people buy hunting licenses every year To many of them gun control strikes at attachments that mean much in their lives For all their modern methods polls cannot capture these feelings in their printout of percentages Mr Yankelovich says that an absolute traditional morality which represents the past the way we were is fading from the scene and is being replaced by a more flexible morality that allows for some selfabsorption and selfexamination History seldom moves in a singleminded curve however and the older ethic pervades much of the middle class including younger people in prospering regions of the country Their churches may be airconditioned and boast the latest sound equipment but they preach an account of human origins based squarely on the Bible Still Mr Yankelovich may be correct in suggesting that many Americans would like to escape the harsh competitive edges of social mobility On this point his most convincing piece of evidence comes not from surveys but from an automobile plant that announced 50 openings in custodial positions To managements surprise over 2000 employees applied most of them younger workers who held higherpaying higherstatus jobs and who would have had to take a cut in pay But it bears noting that the plant was in rural Tennessee not exactly the heart of selffulfillment country New Rules offers no evidence that people who have tried wheat germ and waterbeds are ready to revise their conceptions of themselves in any thoroughgoing way They may talk of adopting a new life style just as they are into parenting or caring relationships but it is hard to visualize any community to which they could commit themselves Much of the difficulty lies with the polls So long as interviewers encourage us to verbalize we will believe that the manner of people we are can be deduced from what we say De Tocqueville knew much better He wrote Democracy in America with barely a quotation or statistic He simply watched what people did and reported what he saw That is why his analysis remains a classic with a message for today
The Nation in Summary; LEGISLATING ON LIFE AND DEATH,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/12/weekinreview/the-nation-in-summary-legislating-on-life-and-death.html,The hearings leading to last weeks vote were among the most emotional in Senate history and the outcome is not likely to cool the controversy By a 3to2 vote a Senate subcommittee approved a measure that states the life of each human being starts at conception and that could if it becomes law allow states to prosecute abortion as murder Senator John P East Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the subcommittee said he was extremely delighted with the legislation the first Congressional step toward overturning the 1973 Supreme Court decision giving women the right to abortion Senator Orrin G Hatch of Utah a prominent abortion foe voted for the bill but underlined his serious constitutional reservations reservations shared by many legal scholars The initial wording of the bill which said present scientific evidence indicates a significant likelihood that life begins at conception was changed after scientists testified that there is no such evidence There was more solid consensus last week on the definition of lifes end A Presidential commission recommended that all 50 states adopt a uniform law defining death as the irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain including the brain stem The panel agreed that medical advances have rendered the old legal definition of death based on breathing and heartbeat largely meaningless
REAGAN'S SHIFT TO THE CENTER RAISES CLAMOR ON THE RIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/12/weekinreview/reagan-s-shift-to-the-center-raises-clamor-on-the-right.html,WASHINGTON FOR seasoned watchers of President Reagan his midweek speech in Chicago was a familiar scene gone slightly and tellingly awry His trusty index cards had given way to a teleprompter The crisp cadences of his offthecuff orations were replaced by long and harshly partisan sentences that visibly wearied both Mr Reagan and his audience Despite the lastminute effort by aides to correct a mistake in the speech text Mr Reagan admitted that his appointment of Judge Sandra Day OConnor to the United States Supreme Court culminated a search for a highly qualified woman Thus with a phrase Mr Reagan contradicted the official White House position that selection of the nations first female justice had nothing to do with her sex Mr Reagans slip was an uncustomary admission of political reality and in regard to such realities this was a jolting week for the White House team They face a short hot July full of threats to Mr Reagans popularity to his effort to tone down his reputation as an ideologue while holding on to his conservative base and to the remarkable legislative gains made so far in his term The OConnor appointment brought unaccustomed praise from liberals and womens groups but it sparked an open revolt among some New Right and conservative Christian leaders The White House gambled Mr Reagans prestige in a Mississippi Congressional race and lost Meanwhile despite Administration efforts to downplay the social issues on which Mr Reagan capitalized as a candidate opponents of busing abortion the equal rights amendment and the ban on school prayer are insisting that he turn back the clock on the liberalizing trends of two decades Not Whether but How Much But by far the greatest threat to Mr Reagans political health is the Congressional resistance to his plan to cut income taxes by 25 percent in 33 months Until now Mr Reagan has towered like a giant over opponents in the legislative battle But with the approach of the August Congressional recess and Mr Reagans own California vacation those early victories are threatened by the prospect of a reversal on the tax plan The sum of these factors is to focus attention on Mr Reagans performance in the Presidents political role A year ago people were saying he couldnt get elected and if elected he couldnt govern said David R Gergen the senior White House spokesman By every standard I think he deserves high marks from a political standpoint While we face an uphill battle in taxes he has changed the focus of the debate on both cutting taxes and cutting spending The question is not whether but how much The question of how much of course is central to the tax issue as a test of Mr Reagans political judgment and prestige Last month in passing his spending cuts Mr Reagan humbled Democratic leaders In spirit at least the Democrats have rebounded House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr asserted last week that a speedy vote in the House would bring passage of the more modest tax cut 15 percent in two years  favored by the Democrats Even though Mr Reagan chided Representative Dan Rostenkowski by name on the Congressmans home turf in Chicago the House Ways and Means chairman did not appear pressured by the Presidents Aug 1 deadline Convening the committee on Thursday Mr Rostenkowski said that tax legislation might be ready for floor action by oh July 29 Finally in their most devilish move the Democrats are trying to outReagan Mr Reagan by offering businessmen and oil well owners tax breaks more generous than those in the Reagan bill already approved by the Senate Finance Committee With such enticements Mr ONeill and Mr Rostenkowski hope to lure back the renegade boll weevil Democrats who tipped the earlier House budget votes to Mr Reagan These factors could force the White House to a goforbroke decision on tactics By having his allies introduce the Senate bill as a substitute measure on the House floor Mr Reagan could bypass the Democratic leaders and score the greatest legislative victory of his term But to lose this showdown on the floor would send Mr Reagan off to his California ranch with a first defeat that could reinvigorate the staggering Democrats and seriously undermine the Reagan economic program Searching for an Ideological Balance What does Mr Reagan think about this Indeed whether he ponders such choices at all or simply as his critics allege follows the decisions of his staff is a great mystery Mr Reagans advisers have drawn a veil across Presidential decision making But White House officials admitted that their first political firestorm came when Mr Reagan obeyed his economic advisers demand that he approve Social Security cuts within a few hours of seeing their proposal Last weeks storm hit when Mr Reagan made the OConnor choice after talking to her  and no other candidates  for less than an hour and reading a Justice Department memo that conservative activists say misrepresents Mrs OConnors record on abortion In any case an appointment that sets off a public spat between Senator Barry Goldwater and the Reverend Jerry Falwell has to be taken seriously by a White House trying to find its ideological balance Mr Goldwater the godfather of the old right called on every good Christian to kick the back end of Mr Falwell for questioning the choice But the White House cannot so easily brush off conservative activists and Christian fundamentalists who believe Mrs OConnor is insufficiently opposed to abortion and womens rights The Administration was stung by their quick negative response since Mr Reagan faces a bundle of litmustest social issues on which the politicoreligious right expects him to deliver Such followers fear Mr Reagan is following the historic pattern that finds chief executives softening their campaign ideology to govern as centrists They also fear the growing influence of moderates such as Chief of Staff James A Baker 3d who wants Mr Reagan to ignore divisive social issues until the tax cut is passed Even so White House aides do not believe the activists will break with Mr Reagan and they casually suggest that the New Right is complaining so theyll have a better chance next time The White House has not noticed the chastening lesson pointed up by the reemergence of former President Carter last week Once elected Mr Carter quit worrying about his core constituency of Southerners and bornagain Christians and they turned on him Even so Reagan advisers are more concerned about softening Mr Reagans hardline image than pleasing the conservative purists The imagesofteners received a boost from the Mississippi results in which Liles Williams the Republican backed by the New Right lost to Wayne Dowdy Mr Reagans threats to revise the 1965 Voting Rights Act apparently drove enough blacks into the Dowdy column to beat Mr Williams Now some White House aides are warning Mr Reagan not to tamper with the voting law Such complicated crosspressures clearly overburdened the public relations men around Mr Reagan last week For example Larry Speakes number two man in the press office announced a White House policy of not commenting on Mrs OConnors qualifications The policy was scrapped within hours as was a subsequent policy of suppressing the fact that negative OConnor telegrams outnumbered the positive by 2573 to 290 And on the flight to Chicago Michael K Deaver the deputy chief of staff tried to talk newsmen out of reporting a joking explanation of the speed with which Mrs OConnor was selected that as the week went along seemed quite plausible It was Mr Deaver said like shopping for a car and the President simply liked the first one he saw
NATURE'S REVENGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/12/books/nature-s-revenge.html,PORNOGRAPHY AND SILENCE Cultures Revenge Against Nature By Susan Griffin 277 pp New York Harper  Row 1295 PORNOGRAPHY Men Possessing Women By Andrea Dworkin 300 pp New York A Perigee BookPutnam Publishing Group Cloth 1295 Paper 595 WHO would have predicted that just now when the far right has launched an allout attack on womens basic civil rights the issue eliciting the most passionate public outrage from feminists should be not abortion not profamily fundamentalism but pornography The fervor with which some feminist activists have rallied against smut is more than a little ironic for opposition to pornography is also a conspicuous feature of the new rights program Furthermore in certain respects the arguments of the two groups are uncomfortably similar If antiporn feminists see pornography as a brutal exercise of predatory male sexuality a form of violence against women and an incitement to such violence the right also associates pornography with violence and with rampant male lust broken loose from the saving constraints of God and Family Nor have conservatives hesitated to borrow feminist rhetoric about the exploitation of womens bodies This peculiar confluence raises the question of whether the current feminist preoccupation with pornography is really an attempt to extend the movements critique of sexism  or whether on the contrary it is evidence that feminists have been affected by the conservative climate and are unconsciously moving with the cultural tide These two very different books suggest that it is both In Pornography and Silence Susan Griffin argues that pornography is rooted in the fear of nature in the futile desire to deny our vulnerable mortal bodies In a patriarchal society men identify themselves with culture and women with nature and the body accordingly men seek to control women and suppress the female in themselves Women identifying themselves with the despised body become selfhating and selfpunishing The result for both sexes is an erotic fantasy life that is essentially sadomasochistic The pornographic image which objectifies and degrades the usually female body represents a ritual in which the usually male pornographer or user playing both killer and victim reenacts the murder of his bodily self since the murder can never be truly accomplished it must be compulsively repeated Pornography the author concludes expresses not a yearning for sexual liberation but its opposite a desire to silence eros Real sexual liberation requires a reconciliation with nature a healing of the illusory split between body and spirit In affirming the fundamental goodness and wholeness of the erotic impulse and connecting sexual repression with the subjection of women Susan Griffin boldly allies her feminism with the cultural revolutionary tradition of William Blake Emma Goldman Wilhelm Reich Her book tackles questions of critical importance for sadomasochism is indeed deeply embedded in our sexuality Yet a fatal oversimplification derails her argument In this society men and women too identify femaleness not only with nature but paradoxically with conventional morality while maleness represents not only culture but the aggressive natural drives that for good or ill defy convention Thus pornography is in part a revolt of male libido against female morals If it is cultures revenge against nature it is equally natures revenge against culture  the return of the repressed in distorted solipsistic sometimes frightening form By separating sexual acts and organs from their larger human context pornography degrades them and at the same time exalts them as the only reality It denies the body yet denies with equal insistence and futility the shame guilt and inhibition that denial of the body produces To flatly equate pornography with sadism as Susan Griffin does is to miss the contradiction at the core of the pornographic experience Indeed the passages she devotes to condemning pornography rather than analyzing it are reductive and heavyhanded in a way the rest of the book is not Pornography the author says endangers our lives She defends this melodramatic assertion by arguing that all cultural images influence behavior True but only because they articulate and legitimize feelings that already exist Pornography that offers concrete images of how to act out hatred of women may invite imitation and reenforce an atmosphere of complacency toward sexual violence but the hatred and complacency that produce violence are built into the culture In short pornography is a symptom not a root cause And in fact Pornography and Silence is most convincing when it speculates on root causes In tracing the sadomasochistic mentality to the intolerable choices  between masculinity and femininity bodily pleasure and power in the world  that parents force on their children the author implicitly makes the radical claim that it is a sexist sexually repressive family structure that endangers our lives Yet she chooses to focus her anger on the symptom Like most feminist opponents of pornography Susan Griffin presumes an objective distinction between pornographic images which are sadistic by definition and simple explicit depictions of sexuality The fallacy here is that the range of potentially pornographic images  that is images primarily used for the purpose of sexual arousal  is limited only by the users imagination Even if one wants to argue that the use of an image for sexual gratification requires a sadistic fantasy the image itself may be objectively innocuous And what about cryptopornography like Gothic novels The appeal of Gothics is also rooted in sadomasochism and just as Hustler magazine shows men how to act like rapists Gothics show women how to act like victims The crucial difference is that Gothics purvey a repressed romanticized sexuality while hardcore pornography is explicitly lustful and genital In singling out the latter for condemnation Susan Griffin betrays an unwitting conservative bias Despite its flawed logic Pornography and Silence is a serious effort to apply feminist insights to sexual psychology Pornography in contrast is less a theoretical work than a booklength sermon preached with a rhetorical flourish and a singleminded intensity that meet somewhere between poetry and rant In Andrea Dworkins moral universe the battle of the sexes is a Manichaean clash between absolute power and absolute powerlessness absolute villains and absolute victims The foundation of male power the prime component of male identity is violence physical and psychic Men are predators women their chief prey To men sex means rape the penis is an instrument of power and terror Pornography expresses enforces is male power The womans sex is appropriated her body is possessed she is used and she is despised the pornography does it and the pornography proves it The power of men in pornography is imperial power the power of the sovereigns who are cruel and arrogant who keep taking and conquering for the pleasure of power and the power of pleasure If Susan Griffin misses contradictions Andrea Dworkin scorns the very idea of contradiction Ambiguity is for the fainthearted dialectics are the selfserving invention of male philosophers Male culture she proclaims thrives on argument and prides itself on distinctions She scoffs at the distinction women are commanded to make between pornographic fantasy and real life In a chapter on the Marquis de Sade she conflates his life with his work reduces his antinomian nihilism to a straightforward celebration of male power and dismisses Angela Carters The Sadeian Woman  an illuminating study of how de Sades writing and by extension all pornography unites reactionary and radical impulses as a pseudofeminist literary essay The misogyny Andrea Dworkin decries is real enough  it is just not all of reality Between women and men often the same women and men there is love as well as war This may be an impossible contradiction but it happens to be the contradiction on which our social order rests A world view that defines male sexuality as pornography as rape leaves no room for mutual heterosexual desire let alone love yet a feminism that does not take heterosexuality seriously can neither comprehend the average womans life nor spark a movement that might change it If relations with men offer nothing but violence and exploitation most womens apparent desire for such relations must mean that either men are so diabolically powerful as to have crushed even passive resistance or women have been so brutalized that we have lost the will to resist Where in this scenario is the possibility of struggle Without contradiction there can be no change only impotent moralizing And in the end moralizing always works against women The Andrea Dworkins rail against male vice the George Gilders come forward to offer God and Family as the remedy Which is why I find Pornographys relentless outrage less inspiring than numbing less a call to arms than a counsel of despair

A REPUBLICAN FEMINIST OUT TO CHANGE THE PARTY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/14/style/a-republican-feminist-out-to-change-the-party.html,Kathy Wilson the new chairman of the National Womens Political Caucus became a Republican at the dinner table naturally and gradually She became a feminist on the job suddenly and furiously Now she has to combine those two chosen identities at a time when Democrats especially Democratic women are trying to use the Reagan Administrations budget and its views on abortion and the proposed equal rights amendment to argue that it is no longer possible to be a good Republican and a good feminist simultaneously Kathleen Ann Higdon Wilson the daughter of a Navy pilot was born on Aug 10 1951 at the Quonset Point Naval Station in Rhode Island She has lived in 11 states nine of them before she graduated from high school But if the scenery changed as she grew up the politics did not My family was Republican and we discussed a lot of politics around the dinner table she said in a recent interview Her feminism came far less smoothly less cheerfully After graduating from the University of Missouri in 1973 she went to work in sales for a Kansas City hotel After 10 months on the job I was the best salesperson on the staff she said She was asked to train two employees both men After three months of teaching them she discovered their salaries Those men were each making 100 a month more than I was She says that she asked her supervisor why and he replied simply enough because theyre men She says His ears got red and I quit I walked out and joined the womens movement She became a paid field worker for a coalition of womens groups that was trying to get the equal rights amendment through the Missouri Legislature About a year later she went back to the University of Missouri for a masters degree and joined the National Womens Political Caucus After coming to Washington with her husband Paul in 1977 she organized the caucuss northern Virginia branch At the time in 1978 she was working in a Civil Service job as an occupational counselor in the Labor Department She left last fall when her daughter Cathryn Rose was born Key Convention Figure Two years ago Mrs Wilsons efforts in Virginia led to her election as first vice chairman of the caucus nationally a post that made her the chief spokesman for the organization at the Republican National Convention in Detroit last year There the caucus was campaigning unsuccessfully to keep the partys traditional commitment to the equal rights amendment in its platform Mrs Wilson was sharp in her criticism there and she is no less ready today to criticize the Administration the convention helped create In her one campaign speech here she had no opponents in the election yesterday she declared American feminists have been put on the defensive  but we will not be defeated The conservatives have been given positions prestige and power by this Administration and they are determined to use them to stop us But they wont The passage of a budget which hurts women of all classes but especially women heads of households hurts us The introduction of a family protection act intended to keep women tied to the kitchen by their apron strings hurts us The attack on Title IX programs hurts us The appointment of male assistant Attorneys General in the Justice Department men who made their careers fighting affirmative action hurts us A President who encourages a Congress to nationalize a womans body hurts us A President who honors his wife and daughters by denying them equality hurts us Title IX declares that no educational institution receiving Federal money can discriminate on the basis of sex The proposed family protection act was introduced by conservative Congressmen who contend it would reduce the Governments role at home and in the schools But after compiling that indictment she explains why she is still a Republican and an active one It goes beyond her support for the Administrations general approach of making sharp budget and tax reductions Mrs Wilson said her kind of Republicanism is the right brand and the field should not be abandoned to Mr Reagan and the conservatives I want my party back she said Mrs Wilson maintains that despite several fundamental disagreements there is room for some cooperation with this Administration on matters such as holding the President to his promise to seek the repeal of all state laws that discriminate against women And she argues when cooperation fails feminist complants from Republicans like herself can have more impact ensuring that the criticism of the Reagan Administration is not dismissed as partisan potshotting The caucus has 55000 members less than half as many as the National Organization for Women But its singular aggressive bipartisanship has always brought with it an unusual degree of attention and influence
EDUCATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/14/science/education.html,LONGVIEW Tex MEL and Norma Gabler seem simple folk at first She dwells on the grandchildren He mows the lawn They have lived for years in the same modest ranch house here in this dusty East Texas industrial town But in their own quiet way the Gablers have become an important voice in American education Their goal to cleanse the nations schools of all materials that they consider antifamily antiAmerican and antiGod Their target textbooks Were losing our children in the classroom said Mrs Gabler whose wide smile and slow manner of speech have become familiar at state textbook adoption hearings here in Texas one of 27 states where school textbooks are selected by a single statewide authority Of the numerous textbook critics across the country the Gablers neither of whom completed college have become the best known and are considered among the most thorough and persistent In large part because of their efforts social studies textbooks have been recalled health manuals replaced and English anthologies removed from textbook lists around the country While textbook publishers publicly minimize the importance of the Gablers privately they acknowledge that this softspoken couple has become an important symbol of parents across the nation and that their message needs at the very least to be heard if not heeded by the 940millionayear American textbook industry Were all certainly very much aware of them said Robert D FitzGerald vice president of Allyn  Bacon a major textbook publisher in Boston I have no quarrel with the Gablers I do feel strongly that we should listen to them and everyone else They have a right to be heard The Gablers are at the center of a growing network of parent groups emboldened by what they see as the new conservative mood in the nation who are demanding the alteration or removal of teaching methods curriculums and individual books that they contend are in large part to blame for the high teenage pregnancy rate venereal disease declining test scores and other problems of todays youth With a mailing list of over 12000 and a staff of seven the Gablers embrace goals similar to those of such national organizations as Moral Majority the Eagle Forum and the Christian Broadcasting Network All try to provide grassroots parents groups with the lobbying techniques and literature to wage attacks on individual books or school practices Until textbooks are changed there is no possibility that crime violence venereal disease and abortion rates will decrease reads a fundraising pamphlet from the Gabler organization If all the problems of our world were suddenly resolved but textbooks remained unchanged most of these same problems would soon return because of what is being taught our children in classrooms In the Gablers eightroom home overflowing with file cabinets and book shelves the couple works from dawn to midnight scouring textbooks for questionable material In the guest bedroom the bed has become a table Mr Gabler uses to answer his correspondence which averages 200 letters each week What was once a sun porch is now lined with file cabinets and papers Throughout the house on shelves wedged behind curtains and in front of windows are books and more books that the Gablers and their associates have subjected to their scrutiny While Mr and Mrs Gabler say they have no standard list of objectionable ideas their criticism revolves around certain themes that textbooks today undermine patriotism the free enterprise system religion and parental authority that the books are negative in their discussions of death divorce and suicide that the books erode absolute values by asking questions to which they offer no firm answers In one recent review of a ninthgrade literature book published by Houghton Mifflin the Gablers objected to The Cask of Amontillado a short story by Edgar Allan Poe Gruesome murderous bizarre content the Gablers review says of the story Not suitable for a literature class The Gabler organization took issue with The American Adventure published by Allyn  Bacon because among other things they said it overemphasizes Watergate and the Vietnam War In response Mr Fitzgerald said They were certainly significant events in our history To some people to mention them is too much In other cases the Gabler organization has objected to a history textbooks mention of George Washingtons violent temper a social studies texts discussion of Marilyn Monroe and essay questions that require a student to give his opinion about the Vietnam War We are spending too much time trying to relate and make it relevant said Mrs Gabler who is 56 There is too much negativism said Mr Gabler who is 66 and was a clerk at the Exxon Corporation for 39 years before he became involved in reviewing textbooks The Gablers say their interest in textbooks began some 20 years ago when their son Jim who was then 16 complained to his father that his high school history text endorsed a Washington dictatorship  the expression is Mr Gablers  and made no mention of the rights retained by individual states for their own governance Where can a young person go to find the truth Mr Gabler said his son asked him From that point on Mr Gabler said he wanted to examine what other fallacies were being taught in school They are against having the story of Robin Hood taught in school because they claim it sanctions stealing They take issue with a textbook that reads The law that allowed slavery in America was wrong so people could break the law because they say it encourages insubordination They seek to remove a book that encourages youngsters to imagine themselves as sitin protesters of the 1960s on the grounds that doing so teaches rebellion In addition to reviewing individual books the Gablers serve as a clearinghouse for other issues and put interested parents in touch with other groups concerned for example with seeing sex education eliminated and the biblical story of creation taught alongside evolution The Gablers maintain a hectic speaking schedule and have been to virtually every state as well as Australia and New Zealand The trips they say are paid for by the parent groups who invite them to speak They plan to speak to parents this summer in England The trouble with most of the textbooks the Gablers contend is that they are written from the perspective of people who do not believe in God or an absolute value system This perspective they say is a religion called secular humanism which permeates every aspect of contemporary society and teaches youngsters to lie cheat and steal Humanism is the religion of the public schools said Mr Gabler who refers to them as government seminaries Behind the lace curtains in the guest bedroom is a wall of yellowing books many out of print that Mr Gabler says he would like to have brought back into the nations schools We feel safe with older books said Mr Gabler

BEGIN GETS FORMAL REQUEST TO FORM NEW CABINET,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/15/world/begin-gets-formal-request-to-form-new-cabinet.html,President Yitzhak Navon announced today that he had decided to call upon Prime Minister Menachem Begin to form the next government of Israel The announcement came after two days of consultations between President Navon and the leaders of the 10 parties that won seats in Parliament in the June 30 voting Mr Begin said last week that he believed he could form a coalition with a oneseat majority consisting of his Likud blod and three religious parties After these consultations President Navon said I arrived at the conclusion that Mr Menachem Begin has more chances than any other candidate at present to form the government I called the Prime Minister I told him that and I asked him to see me tomorrow so I will be able to ask him to form this new government Outlook for Compromise Good Intensive negotiations by the politicans have been in progress since the elections Although the religious parties have made stringent demands for tightening of certain social and work laws the chances for compromise seem good enough for Mr Begin to be optimistic about forming his government swiftly By law Mr Begin will have 21 days after the President asks him formally tomorrow to form a government If he fails in that time the President may extend the period up to a second 21 days If no government can be put together by the expiration of the two 21day periods the President then has the choice of either asking somebody else to try or of notifying Parliament that he sees no chance of forming a government in which case Parliament may vote to dissolve itself and call new elections The process has no time limit under law Begin Warns on Time Limit However Prime Minister Begin warned yesterday that he would call for new elections if he failed to form a government by the end of the first 21day period The comment was seen as a bargaining tactic to get some recalcitrant coalition partners into line and to minimize squabbling over Cabinet positions Mr Begins Likud bloc won 48 of the 120 seats edging out the opposition Labor Party headed by Shimon Peres which won 47 The President who is elected by Parliament to a fiveyear term has discretion in whom to ask to form a government but the one selected has by custom been in the winning party Labor Party Allies Did Poorly Mr Peres had gone through the motions yesterday of requesting that he be given a chance But the small left of center parties with which Labor would be able to join in a coalition did poorly in the election and the rightist and religious parties more natural allies of the Likud did somewhat better enough to make ta slim majority The National Religious Party which has participated in every government since the first Parliament in 1949 won six seats  down from 12 in the 1977 elections  and has preferred the Likud to Labor because its patronage power has been increased and its influence over social and foreign policy enhanced The Agudath Israel movement a strict Orthodox party with four seats has demanded increased Government funds for religious institutions a strict ban on Sabbath work except for security and medical personnel a change in the legal definition of a Jew to exclude those converted by nonOrthodox rabbis or born of mothers so converted a ban on the sale of pork throughout the country a modest dress code for women in Government offices and similar legislation Abortion and Autoposy Curbs The party managed to get a liberal provision of the abortion law repealed and fought successsfully for legislation severely limiting autopsies and organ transplants The proposed change in the definition of who is a Jew which has a bearing on who is granted automatic Israeli citizenship has already met objections in the Liberal Party which is part of Mr Begins Likud Mr Begin said yesterday that he could not make a commitment to force such a change on unwilling legislators although he agreed with it personally Agudath Israel has shown sign of accepting some compromise Mr Begins third small coalition partner would be the Tami faction led by the Religious Affairs Minister Aharon Abuhazira who was recently tried and found not guilty of accepting bribes He faces a further trial on larceny and corruption charges Wants Religious Affairs Post He left the National Religious Party setting up his own list of candidates with Jews from North Africa in an ethnic appeal that won him three seats He had demanded the Religious Affairs portfolio but also has seemed inclined to go along with the coalition even if he does not get it These partners plus the Likud would make 61 seats Negotiations with the rightwing Tehiya Party which has three seats and opposes the peace treaty with Egypt broke down after its leaders demanded that the final withdrawal from Sinai mandated by the treaty be reconsidered But the party may support a Beginled government passively by voting with it on motions of confidence Prime Minister Begin has also talked with Moshe Dayan the former Foreign Minister who heads a twomember slate called Telem But Mr Dayan reportedly asked as a condition of joining Mr Begin in a government to be put in charge of the negotiations with Egypt and the United States on granting selfadministration to the Palestinian Arabs living under Israeli occupation in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank Mr Begin who had given the post to the head of the National Religious Party Interior Minister Yosef Burg turned down Mr Dayan and there now seems little chance that his Telem slate will join the government

QUAINT COUNSEL FOR TEEN-AGERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/17/opinion/quaint-counsel-for-teen-agers.html,The Adolescent Family Life or chastity bill is moving through Congress with dismaying ease The measure has cleared the Senate Labor and Resources Committee unanimously winning the vote even of Edward Kennedy It is a sad and puzzling spectacle given the Administrations railing against welfare dependency The two issues are clearly connected The bill would finance programs that discourage teenagers from sexual activity balancing this effort against federally funded programs that offer more traditional sex education Social agencies like the Florence Crittenden Homes which offer teenagers a complete range of counseling including birth control and opportunities for abortion would not be eligible for support Teenagers who have babies will be encouraged by the new program to place them for adoption The bills backers seem quaintly unaware of the pervasive interest in sex among modern teenagers When some senators tried to tone down the prudish ideology of the bill by eliminating the words chastity and promiscuous they had to agree in exchange to make it absurdly narrow As now written the measure would subsidize only programs that require parental consent for any counseling that touches upon family planning sexuality venereal disease and abortion Still more quaint is the refusal to recognize any connection between the phenomenon of teenage pregnancy and the welfare problem A recent study by the National Institute of Education found that about one million students become pregnant each year 80 percent of them drop out of school which is about eight times the average dropout rate About half the teenage mothers keep their babies but they rarely marry a large proportion of them soon look to public welfare and other programs for support with little hope of ever becoming selfsupporting Nor is that the end of the problem A study by Blanche Bernstein showed that 505000 of the 528000 children on welfare in New York City last January lived in families headed by women These children she reports account for about half the citys highschool dropouts whose lack of education then bars them from from good jobs and keeps them trapped in the welfare cycle Some Americans apparently find emotional satisfaction in encouraging teenagers to deny or postpone their sexuality It is a costly satisfaction and fantasy diverting attention and resources from the real world
UNDOING THE HIGH COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/17/opinion/undoing-the-high-court.html,Columbus Ohio  The exceedingly dangerous character of attempts led by rightwing zealots to eliminate United States Supreme Court jurisdiction in cases dealing with abortion legislative reapportionment school busing and school prayers is not fully perceived Indeed their bills if passed and upheld by the courts would undo the Federalist victory led by Chief Justice John Marshall in the early 1800s under which the Republic has flourished The bills would undermine the security of property rights as well as those personal rights that Americans long have taken for granted The Federalist victory in such cases as Marbury v Madison 1803 and Martin v Hunters Lessee 1816 established the principles that the Supreme Court can declare acts of Congress and state legislatures unconstitutional and can reverse decisions of state courts that misconstrue the Constitution and laws of the United States This principle of judicial review provides for a single interpretation of the Constitution that is binding upon the lower Federal courts as well as the state courts Further the Constitution granting life tenure and freedom from reduction in salary protects Supreme Court Justices from political reprisal This institution of finality and uniformity is the essence of what the late Justice Hugo L Black called our Federalism While we usually think of the Constitution as primarily protecting personal freedoms such as free speech and the right to vote what is equally important is that it also protects property rights Businesses and individuals are protected from having their property appropriated by the state without just compensation from having states impair contracts already entered into from states imposing confiscatory zoning and pollutioncontrol laws and from states setting arbitrary limitations on the interstate movement of goods and on the rates that railroads and utilities might charge The system established by the Federalists encouraged investments from the Eastern states in our developing West and from foreign countries in the United States Investors knew that their property was safeguarded by the Federal courts from arbitary conduct of distant states that might fall into the hands of antiproperty political forces and was safeguarded also in those times when even the Congress might adopt a populist course It is not surprising that many late 19th century and early 20th century attacks on the Supreme Court came from the left The most notable example was Franklin Delano Roosevelts unsuccessful Courtpacking plan in 1937 He sought to achieve desired results by offering legislation to increase the size of the Court In the past these attacks from the left and from the right have always failed though often by the closest of margins Rightwing zealots and racists many of whom had screamed Impeach Earl Warren today are attempting a more sophisticated strategy  to utilize an obscure clause in Article III of the Constitution that after enumerating the powers that the Congress can and has granted to the Supreme Court states With such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress shall make Only once in our history and that in a postCivil War Federal statute that restricted but did not remove all avenues of review to the Supreme Court in habeas corpus cases has this exceptions clause been used to impair Supreme Court jurisdiction Indeed many legal scholars believe that despite that earlier example Congress cannot validly use this exceptions clause to impair Supreme Court jurisdiction especially in areas dealing with fundamental rights Why would property rights be affected even if Congress took away the power of the Supreme Court to review statecourt decisions dealing with say abortions If the principle is established and accepted that Congress ultimately controls the subjects with which the Court can deal then constitutional rights whether personal or property rights will depend upon which coalitions James Madison called them factions  control Congress or a particular state government Just as todays rightwing faction would reverse the decisions that increase personal freedom and protect blacks tomorrows extremists could go after business interests by taking away Supreme Court jurisdiction in eminent domain zoning pollution control bank regulation and utilityratesetting cases The last word in such cases would be left to the state courts themselves subject to political control by the local electorate Investments are premised on the assumption of longrange stability and certainty Eliminate this sense of security and investors become reluctant to commit their capital There are two facets to the Reagan movement  the conservative businessoriented side and the radical causeoriented side The risk facing the nation is that the radicals might prevail

OBSERVER; THE AGES OF PERSON,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/18/opinion/observer-the-ages-of-person.html,Difficult questions about age fill the mail this week Mr CS of Chester Pa for example writes that since the 1930s the Supreme Court has often been referred to as nine old men and asks If Sandra OConnors appointment is confirmed will it be correct thereafter to refer to the Court as eight old men and an old woman No Mr CS eight old men and an old woman will not do In the first place since Mrs OConnor is only 51 years old the phrase would strike most people over the age of 29 as viciously overloaded with youth bias To people in their 20s a female Justice of 51 may be an old woman but people old enough to remember Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes might just as reasonably think of a woman of 51 as a spring chicken Do we want to refer to the Supreme Court as eight old men and a spring chicken Of course not Even in America vulgarity must have its limits How about eight old men and a lady Out of the question  feminists have declared lady a taboo word They prefer the word person which would give us eight old men and a person Unfortunately this construction calls attention to Mrs OConnors femininity and may therefore be objectionable as a sexist phrase Are the eight old men after all not persons too just as Mrs OConnor is a person If Mrs OConnor were older we could solve the problem simply with nine old persons Under the circumstances however the only possible phrase is eight old persons and a person Thus dies another lively phrase Age questions also trouble several correspondents who have read about a bill in the Senate which will require life to begin at the moment of conception Mrs SL of Panama City Fla writes Every year I have to put up with 24 hours of sulking from my husband because Ive forgotten his silly birthday Does the lifebeginsatconception bill make this birthday nonsense obsolete and if so why doesnt the Senate hurry up and pass it Alas Mrs SL there is no relief in sight The greeting card candy and flower industries have no intention of being voted into bankruptcy by a Senate eliminating birthdays You can expect an amendment to the bill stating that the day of birth continues to be as important to the American economy as the day of conception is to the beginning of life It is far more likely that your husband will henceforth insist that you remember not only his birthday but also his conception day Greeting card manufacturers in fact are already preparing an extensive new line of cards for this boon to business Here are two samples Humorous On the TV poor reception Ergo Buster your conception Poetic Salesmen were happy Your parents aggrieved On that blissful day When you were conceived Mr ML of Washington DC is also concerned about how the lifebeginsatconception bill will affect age and whether a huge expensive bureaucracy will have to be established to deal with the problem Next month he writes I will reach my 65th birthday and be eligible for retirement I assume that enactment of the Senate bill will automatically make me nine months older since by Act of Congress my life will then have begun nine months earlier than previous calculations permitted In brief Mr ML wants to know if he will be entitled to retroactive retirement for the months worked at the time he thought he was only 64 but was subsequently found by law to have been 65 The answer seems obvious enough If Congress is going to add nine months to a mans life in an instant it has an obligation under the principles of equity to reimburse him for whatever losses he suffers Mr ML anticipates correctly that the Congress will want to do this particularly if it is an election year He rightly notes a problem however How are old codgers like me going to produce a satisfactory conception certificate to prove that we were conceived nine months before delivery rather than eight or seven or six months before The answer is clear To avoid having taxpayers swindled by finaglers who lie about their conception days the Government will have to establish a bureau to investigate all conception claims Conceivably this work might be handled by the FBI but since it will involve interrogation of surviving parents most of whom will be in their 80s 90s or 100s the Government will doubtless prefer to erect a new department more skilled at wheedling the truth out of the elderly Naturally such testimony would have to be checked against old hospital records and midwives testimony and conflicting data tested before review boards at which all parties would require lawyers The bright side is that the process might be the greatest boon to the legal and bureaucratic professions since the income tax code was last amended Eventually of course the whole mess would wind up having to be decided by eight old persons and a person
U.S. ADVISES TOTAL ABSTINENCE FROM DRINKING FOR PREGNANT WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/18/us/us-advises-total-abstinence-from-drinking-for-pregnant-women.html,Pregnant women should drink absolutely no alcohol because they may be endangering the health of their unborn children the Surgeon Generals office has officially advised doctors in the United States Previous Government warnings stopped short of advocating complete abstinence from alcoholic beverages for pregnant women But public health officials now say they know too little about the effects of small amounts of alcohol to condone the use of even one ounce of alcohol in pregnancy The advisory was published in the July issue of the Food and Drug Administrations Drug Bulletin It came in response to an extensive review of research into the effects of alcohol consumption on pregnancy over the last decade according to John DeLuca director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Birth Weights Affected The review conducted by the institute was forwarded to the President and Congress last November According to Mr DeLuca several studies published in the last five years indicate that pregnant women who drink as little as one ounce of alcohol a day tend to have children with low birth weights and that women who drink just one ounce of alcohol twice a week show an increased incidence of spontaneous abortion While scientists have been relatively certain for years that excessive drinking at least three to four ounces of pure alcohol a day can contribute to birth defects in newborn children they have been unsure about the effects of light drinking Dont Know a Safe Level And although the latest findings suggest that any alcohol consumption can affect unborn babies researchers say they are still uncertain about the extent of the effects Its really quite simple  we dont know a safe level said Mr DeLuca I cant say that one drink is safe and one and a half is not The science does not allow us to do that The warning by the Surgeon Generals office was criticized as overkill by Dr Morris Chafetz founding director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism from 1970 to 1975 Dr Chafetz said that the studies reviewed for the institutes report leave a great deal to be desired Many of the studies surveyed mothers and babies after pregnancy but not before and during he said Therefore it was not possible to tell whether small doses of alcohol rather than tobacco stress poor nutrition or other factors were primarily responsible for the low birth weights and spontaneous abortions In the last two years Government health officials repeatedly issued warnings about drinking in pregnancy However complete abstinence was not officially advocated Other Women Are Warned The current Surgeon Generals advisory urges total avoidance not only by women who are pregnant but also by those who are planning to become pregnant The FDA Drug Bulletin is distributed to more than one million physicians and health professionals throughout the country Last Novembers report was compiled by the institute with the Food and Drug Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Our recommendation was based primarily on the link between excessive consumption and birth defects Mr DeLuca said Excessive drinking has been reported to trigger a wide but definable range of birth problems known as fetal alcohol syndrome Defects associated with the syndrome can include singly or in combination mental retardation central nervous system disorders growth deficiencies facial abnormalities and other malformations and cardiac problems Role in Infant Syndrome Several studies have also identified maternal alcoholism as a possible contributor to sudden infant death syndrome in which for no clear reason an infant mysteriously dies while sleeping The reported effects of alcohol occur independently of those caused by smoking and poor diet according to the advisory which also warns that alcohol can be transmitted to a nursing infant in breast milk The bulletin advises physicians to inform each patient about the risk of alcohol consumption in pregnancy and to advise patients not to drink alcoholic beverages and to be aware of the alcoholic contents of foods and drugs

ADOPTION: NEW VIEWS ON BLACKS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/19/nyregion/adoption-new-views-on-blacks.html,INTERRACIAL adoptions which reached their peak in the late 1960s are waning particularly in nonintegrated areas of the Island Adoption agencies are attempting to find black homes for black children who far outnumber the white children available Little Flower Childrens Services of New York the second largest residential childrens agency in the state with 1600 children at facilities in Wading River and Brooklyn has announced a campaign for black children from infancy to 17 According to Angela Hazel a case worker 14 blacks are available through the agency and 48 more are in the legal process of being freed for adoption Unless a child is so hard to place that we have no choice Mrs Hazel said we will not place black children in white homes The ideal home for children is a home of their own ethnic setting Officials at Little Flower said that when they tried crossing racial lines they got children back who were supposed to have been placed permanently Well cross racial lines in placing interracial children said Adrienne Carr manager of the development office But we attempt to place black children in black homes Officials of social services departments and agencies said that black children placed in white homes that were in nonintegrated neighborhoods frequently suffered ostracism and identity problems They said that children already confused about their identities because of adoption became even less sure of themselves when adopted by a family of different race Transracial adoption is not just a social issue said Dr Jeffrey Hammerman director of Little Flowers clinical services It is an intrapsychic issue Everybody needs a sense of personal identity We get that identification from parental objects If the parental objects are very different from the child then there is usually a great deal of difficulty in the childs gaining a sense of who he is Besides each ethnic culture wants to preserve its ethnic heritage Black people are not white people in dark skin said Mrs Hazel who felt rejection at times in growing up black in a white neighborhood The State Social Welfare Law says that parents who seek to adopt children categorized as hard to place because of their age or race or physical or emotional handicaps cannot be discriminated against because of race Officials at the agencies agree that if there were a choice between leaving a hardtoplace child in foster care or a residential home or placing him in a white home that met adoption criteria the white home would be chosen However Robert Burke assistant director of family services at the Nassau County Department of Social Services said Black social workers regard whites adopting black children as a form of racial genocide We rarely place black or interracial children in white homes Black children have special needs met by black families In the 1970s when the number of healthy infants available dwindled because of such factors as revised abortion laws and social acceptance of single mothers raising outofwedlock children the Department of Social Services started to recruit black adoptive parents for black children Mr Burke said the number of black or interracial children available at the agency was usually 80 percent of the total The agency has 30 hardtoplace children available for adoption Adoption is a white middleclass idea he said Blacks have been taking care of their own for years through extended families Its true that agencies didnt reach out to blacks to adopt in the late 60s but we are recognizing black families as a resource now Although the total of black or interracial children available for adoption in Nassau County is usually about 80 percent of all eligible children 1980 Census statistics indicate that 69 percent of the countys population is black In Suffolk primarily black or interracial children are available for adoption through the County Department of Social Services blacks make up 56 percent of the population Officials in both counties said there was a list of prospective parents to adopt healthy white infants Sometimes the wait is longer than a year said Janet Silva an assistant director at the Suffolk department As a result some couples will express interest in adopting more readily available hardtoplace children such as a handicapped interracial or older child The Suffolk department also has 30 hardtoplace children available nine of them black Although we have placed black children in white homes a few times very few white families here are interested in adopting black children said Phyllis Elsky supervisor of adoption services We recently placed two black boys with a white family in Oregon Transracial adoption is more accepted on the West Coast Since 1977 finding black families to adopt black and interracial children has become easier adoption officials said when the state started to pay a subsidy based on income to families who adopted hardtoplace children Regardless of income medical coverage is available for adopted youngsters who have physical or emotional handicaps Economically blacks are still not as well off as whites here Mr Burke said With a subsidy many black foster families who could not afford to adopt foster children can now do so By law a foster family that has been caring for a child for 18 months or more has the first chance of adopting the child Kay Donley executive director of the New York Spaulding Home for Children a Manhattan agency that has found some homes for hardtoplace children on the Island said We try to place kids where we feel they will have the fewest problems We seldom do transracial adoptions unless a child has a complex of physical and mental handicaps that makes him difficult to place or unless he is a decultured child For instance we recently had two Hispanic teenagers who were completely integrated into the white culture and in fact rejected their heritage They didnt want to be placed with a Hispanic family We respect the kids wishes when they have a preference A community plays a large role in determining the success of interracial adoption according to professionals in childrens services and white families who have adopted children of a different race Karen and Bob Devlin of Freeport adopted Rachel an interracial child through the Binghamton Department of Social Services in 1967 when she was an infant When the family moved to Yaphank an allwhite community the Devlins found she was not accepted by her peers at school Not everyone in Yaphank was prejudiced Mrs Devlin said We have met good friends there and wherever you go sometimes even in integrated neighborhoods there will be some prejudice When the Devlins lived in Long Beach an integrated community on the first day of first grade Rachels teacher called Mrs Devlin to tell her Rachel was slow When the school personnel actually saw us face to face  when they discovered that we were white college graduates who seem to assemble sentences correctly said Dr Devlin a history professor at Adelphi University then they changed their attitude But because of repeated rejections of Rachel by her peers the Devlins moved three years ago to Freeport another integrated community Since weve moved there has been a dramatic change in Rachel Dr Devlin said She is more secure now Her identity is not a pressing concern She used to have a stereotype Aunt Jemima image of her natural mother Mrs Devlin said Now she has forgotten that She has lots of black middleclass role models here Adoptive parents and professionals said that when a family that has adopted a child of a different race ignores differences in heritage or in appearance there are bound to be problems Judy and David Gluck of Amityville adopted two interracial children Christine 9 and Joshua 6 When the family moved into nonintegrated Levittown Christine became the target of verbal attack from peers The Glucks moved to Amityville an integrated community and they have cultivated black friends Christines selfimage has improved and although she is lightskinned she identifies most closely with black people However AbdulRahmann Muhammad director of the Adoption Resource Center at Columbia University a federally financed program that disseminates information on children available for adoption statewide said that a black or interracial child adopted by a white family could sometimes lead to resentment for the child from the black community as well as prejudice from whites In a white family the black child may be regarded as a cute baby and accepted at first but later on he becomes less attractive and there are usually problems Mr Muhammad said According to statistics from the Adoption Resource Center there are 6000 children available in the state and 60 percent are of a minority group None of these children should be deprived of a home Mr Muhammad said But we have to diligently recruit AfroAmerican families for black kids Well have to focus on more innovative nontraditional resources For instance the black religious community has not yet been completely tapped Elnora Smith director of the New York chapter of the National Association of Black Social Workers said her organization in 1972 took a strong stand concerning the placement of black children stating they should be placed in black homes to preserve their racial identities Its changing now she said but before the early 70s blacks were not found suitable to be adoptive parents by most agencies Peter Vercillo of Brentwood a white single adoptive father of two black boys 9 and 10 years old said that a black family did not necessarily instill pride in the black culture I adopted my sons a year ago from an agency in Indiana Mr Vercillo said They had been raised in a black foster home and they didnt even know where Africa was Mr Vercillo a sixthgrade teacher in the Brentwood district said he tried to adopt children in New York but had been unsuccessful The push from black social workers was on he said Whites adopting blacks were considered liberal dogooders Its not fair My ability to parent should not be judged by my skin color or marital status Racial problems have not surfaced with his sons he said and despite the struggle he went through to adopt Mr Vercillo feels glad he did so Even during the rough days  and some have been very rough  I know I made the right decision in adopting the boys he said When youre alone you think only about yourself he added Now Ive got the boys to think about I know that where they were in Indiana is far inferior to their being with me For a lot of people this kind of adoption can be OK Im sure we get stared at a lot but I just dont notice I like being with my kids Whatever Ive given the boys theyve given me a million times more Pastor Lee Wesley executive director of Lutheran Community Services Inc a Brooklyn agency with a branch in Hauppauge said interracial adoptions could be successful depending on the emotional security of the family and the child and their community In a sensitive caring community this type of adoption can work out well he said In an allwhite community there is usually rejection After all nonintegrated neighborhoods have been kept that way on purpose Despite the caution among professionals white families who have adopted black or interracial children said that problems of identity adjustment or prejudice could be overcome If the child one adoptive mother said gets the feeling from his parents that he is good if he is accepted by them he will have a sureness about himself With that sureness he can surmount any problem
MEMOIRS OF A NEW CHINA HAND,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/19/magazine/memoirs-of-a-new-china-hand.html,For years I had avoided going to China It is possible even likely that the Chinese Government and masses were not aware of this deprivation After all they had not lacked for foreign company journalistic or touristic Platoons of American editors and publishers had been to China permanent offices were established and bureau chiefs were already pleading with the Chinese for visas for more reporters and for bigger apartments Shelves of books revealing the essential truths about China and the Chinese had marched quickly from typewriters to remainder bins and in scores of newspaper series television specials and magazine articles poor China had been richly and repeatedly dissected analyzed praised scolded condemned and beatified As for tourists China had been booked solid for years and one unfortunate planeload of travelers had been whipped from airport to Great Wall to Forbidden City to Summer Palace without rest until it was revealed to them that there were no hotel rooms in Peking that night so back to the tarmac the plane and overnight in another town There had been ordinary tourists political tourists professional groups and hobby groups Even the gardenclub tours were well under way before I got there and it was becoming a little chic not to go to China like not wearing designer labels My reluctance to go to China puzzled me a bit I had spent six years as a foreign correspondent in India and Japan and the East had been my particular interest and fascination for decades In my reportorial youth I had daydreamed of a China assignment but when it did open to American journalists in the early 1970s and the opportunity came I avoided even a visit Of course the reason was there in my mind all along and when I did decide to go it popped to the surface I had avoided China because I had become bored to death by MarxistLeninistliberationist jargon Nine early years at the United Nations two years in Poland dinner encounters in New York with the Maoist chic the years of reading solemn Western explanations of the glories of the Great Leap Forward and how those intellectuals were really benefiting from shoveling manure during the Cultural Revolution and then reading the quick unembarrassed reversals  all this made my brain glaze over And the very thought of listening to more tiresome propaganda the prospect of long days with frozen smiles on my weary face made my muscles twitch I reveal here for the first time that the great intellectual weapon of the Communists is their superb ability honed by decades of practice to induce boredom They say the same trite things over and over with such total conviction with such sublime deafness to countervailing argument that the opposing mind debilitated by years of logic retreats or succumbs So it must be said at the beginning that when curiosity finally triumphed over slogan sickness I traveled to China with one suitcase a duffel bag and an awful lot of other baggage in my mind Everybody travels with some kind of baggage in the brain and I lay out for inspection what I took with me Totalitarianism and authoritarianism are repugnant to my soul dictatorships left or right are blood kin Communism is organized mismanagement apologists for thirdworld tyrannies are racist and contemptuous of the people they profess to support freedom of expression is not simply the property of the wellfed but can be understood by the poor and even the hungry I once believed parliamentary democracy had a chance at triumphing in the poor nations but Indira Gandhis scornful assumption of power riding over the cravenness of the Indian press and judiciary and civil service in 1975 gave me strong doubts Eventually she was thrown out through the democratic process and returned through the democratic process but her coup detat had torn the fabric of faith and that is her legacy I do not believe increased production necessarily means increased liberalization  see Soviet Union But I do believe that the fate future and duty of people who live in the grace of liberty lie in fighting for and supporting those who loosen the bonds instead of tightening them Even to suggest that cherished freedoms are not really necessary for others seems to me spiritually unbecoming I did not go politically bland about China I felt that Mao had been revealed to be not only tyrannical but possessed of a lunatic destructiveness still being measured in lost decades and lost lives and dreams for China I believed also that his successors were trying to rescue China from the Maoist debacle But they seemed to be pulling back on their tentative experiments with freedoms and were themselves haunted by the specter of the return of Maoists And I knew I would not be dealing with a bunch of Chinese libertarians but with dedicated Communists searching for something more workable less oppressive than Maoism I wanted to see how they were doing what they were doing I went as a man blessed by full freedom but understanding that some liberty is better than none and wondering whether the Chinese at last were getting a taste of lifes sweet fruit Suddenly I was eager for China wish I were a poet because poets are the best reporters They tell you what counts and they do it with few words They tell the truth so plainly that every reader is struck immediately by the reality of truth and doesnt need facts and figures to back it up Someday a poet will write the best about China as the poets write best eventually about everything damn them If I were a poet I would write about the looks I saw on some Chinese faces because they remain with me even before I consult all those notes and tapes I have on my desk There was that fine sly triumphant look on the face of the commune official in a county seat in Inner Mongolia when he caught my little political thrust and returned it In the previous week I had been hearing a lot about the Gang of Four Maos widow and her hapless cohorts and how they were responsible for ruining China for fire flood and general allround misery The official was giving me a little lecture on the economy of sheepherding in Inner Mongolia and was talking about the wolf problem Lots of wolves around and the herdsmen were organizing wolf hunts Tell me I said were there more wolves in Mongolia during the rule of the Gang of Four He thought a brief moment after the translation held up a finger grinned and said Yes there were That was because wolf hunts were poorly organized during the rule of the Gang of Four There was the quick tough look on the face of the Mayor of Shanghai replacing official aloofness when he made it clear that he didnt give freedom of expression very high priority but that the old days of repression were not going to come back either I remember the flash of anguish and then the mask that dropped over the face of the girl in the reformatory when she told me why she was there  for having affairs with boys There was the look of amazement utter amazement on the face of the old fellow near the market in Xian as he stared at me in my Red Flag a fancy Communist limousine and we took each others picture I with a camera I would write more about faces that suddenly looked up from work and smiled with total warmth at a total stranger and I would write a lot about hands and feet and backs There are machines in China but what counts is the hand and the arm the load on the back walking down the road pulling or carrying or pushing Digging chopping hewing  a country powered by muscle and fueled by sweat If I were a poet I would write about love in China and Chinese brides I think I will anyway later I was in China something less than four weeks and much of it was quite official  officially greeted official guides everywhere official policy expounded virtually always officials met and officials interviewed And yet I did not feel harried hounded or particularly constrained I was in a controlled society whose officials were behaving as openly as they safely could which was not very I was in a country that wanted friends  everywhere there was a rather touching boast on a poster We have friends all over the world But I was in a country where officials were uncertain about the future and worried that the past might be lying in wait for the overly candid Nobody was taking chances But I picked my own itinerary Peking to find out what the Chinese thought they should tell me the mining town of Datong an overnight train ride from the capital to see the Buddhist caves Inner Mongolia because it sounded romantic Xian to get into the interior and see some archeological digs Chongqing because it was in the huge province of Sichuan a world of 100 million the Yangtze River to see the gorges Yichang to visit the nearby dam Wuhan to find out about flood and drought Chinas twin demons and Shanghai and Canton No ground broken but no place refused I traveled on a private visit but I was part of a Chinese unit Everybody in China is part of a unit  commune shop office factory or street unit The unit governs life  rations apartments jobs housing pay marriage travel And the unit exercises political control or purposes of my visit I was attached as a guest to a Foreign Affairs Ministry unit That meant an official of the Foreign Affairs Ministry who traveled with me as pleasant shepherd and translator arranged for my tickets and hotels and rendered punctilious tothepenny accounts at every stop You dont just hop on a plane or a train in China permission to travel from city to city has to be granted first then transportation and hotels have to be arranged Its all done through the unit Some units have more clout than others In Peking I was told it was better to be a guest of a municipal unit of some kind than of the foreign office because the local government controls the best hotel and is likely to pay more attention to requests from the equivalent of Ed Kochs office than to the equivalent of Al HaigsIt took a little doing but I got in In each city there was a conference about what I would do If I wanted to see a politician I saw a politician Communes were produced and so were model workers and museums and a factory one all I wished and a dreadful visit to a university Nothing much volunteered by the Government little declined All quite correct and pleasant But anybody who visits China journalistically or diplomatically or touristically and dreams of breaking away is not entirely realistic The political system does not permit it And the Chinese simply do not have the plane room train room hotel room or any other kind of room to let lots of foreigners wander around at will Scarcity itself becomes an instrument of control  for Chinese as well as for foreigners But if I wanted to stop and talk to somebody or if James Sterba the Peking correspondent of The Times with whom I traveled wanted to talk to a sodapop salesman about pushcart capitalism nobody objected If I wanted to walk by myself I did A foreigner is never really alone in China  he is too interesting to the Chinese It is impossible for instance just to drop in to any restaurant for a meal It was a small but annoying restriction Like all restrictions it tells something When I insisted on dining away from the hotel there was a great deal of back and forth on the phone and when I arrived at the restaurant I found we were almost always curtained off from the Chinese diners In part this was to protect us from the unwavering stares of the crowds our arrival brought In part it was because the Chinese thought their countrymen might not be couth enough for our sensitive natures It was not pleasant being surrounded by white curtains whatever the motive and the Chinese listened courteously when I said so  but the white curtains stayed up It would have been foolish of me to expect Chinese officialdom to unburden itself to me It would have been foolish of the Chinese not to realize that any experienced journalist accepts this discards that weighs what he sees and hears against a lifetime of traveling and comparing and comes up with his own reactions and judgments It was a structured visit but within the structure quite possible to see hear and think Just as the Chinese do in their units I imagine In Peking a fairly drab city coated with the dust of the Mongolian plains I began the search that was to occupy me until I left Canton by train for Hong Kong and in a sense occupies me still the search for a frame of reference for and population If it were not for birth control people would be fighting for a place to stand in China Then you comprehend that free contraception and the availability of free abortion are not matters of ideology here but of keeping China a place where a person can breathe and walk o China uses delayed marriages public pledges and peer pressures on bride and groom to keep them to one child It is official policy to give a bonus to couples pledging to have only one child the bonus must be returned if they have more And there are other penalties for having more Rations and housing are provided on the basis of a twochild family That means that if a third child comes along everybody in the family has to get along with less of whatever foods or goods are being rationed Chinese children are loved hugged pampered kissed and kissed They always have been I am told There is a special poignancy in seeing a young mother kiss a child because you know that in all likelihood it will be her only child Someday there will be hundreds of millions of families with only one child This must have a profound impact on the nation because it will affect the deepest of relations between parent and child Will good old sibling rivalry be put out of business And how will the nations psyche be affected as it must In time there will be hundreds of millions of children growing up as the sole belonging to the Government of course but they dont really count China moves by foot lives by the roadside If you have vegetables to sell for yourself or your commune you sit down by the road and sell them If you are in the army and the unit commissar wants to give you a lecture chances are hell line you up in formation just off the road and talk at you which is pretty good entertainment for the kids hanging around You bike along the roads or you just walk you pull a cart or push it you beat the donkeys hoping to excite them to a state of lethargy you gossip and argue and get your hair cut you fix things  pots shoes bikes  by the road and you eat your rice steamed bread or noodles If you have a pig to sell or to take to the slaughterhouse you tie it to the back of your bike and off you go And if you are a foreigner then you become part of it at least voyeuristically and more if you stop and look or stop and talk You become quite an attraction and a bit of entertainment yourself not just a drop of water When it comes to tourism the Chinese Government fully understands the profit motive Food and hotels are fairly reasonable but for everything else the Chinese are going on the sockittothem theory of price setting Souvenirs arts and crafts antiques 50 or 70 years old are comically overpriced and prices vary from city to city by as much as 100 percent But there are always some tourists who are willing to pay any ticket price so maybe the Chinese know something Thousands of tourists from all over do travel through China as economically as possible  earnest interested noncaricature tourists full of good will but terribly terribly tired Here said an American at a museum near Xian to his wife Stand here for a picture Honey she said almost weeping I just cant smile anymore While Im at it another travel note for reporters The foreign correspondents kit which until now has consisted of a shortwave radio a portable typewriter and a pocket tape recorder now includes a Sony Walkman If you are a correspondent you spend a lot of time in airports waiting for planes that have a habit of being four hours late Jumping into an envelope of music can be comforting I didnt understand that until I waited the requisite four hours in Xian for the plane to Chongqing Here I am stretched out on a sofa where this note is being scribbled listening privately and happily on a Walkman borrowed from Sterba to a pirated Taiwan tape of Bluegrass music I am tired and feel grungy but my feet are jiggling merrily Theres nothing quite like Bluegrass in Xian The Concise Revised Consensus History of PostRevolutionary China in One Volume Peking 1981 Looseleaf I was in China in May It turned out to be quite an interesting month politically The Chinese Government was just coming to the end of one of its most dangerous and difficult tasks  dealing with the Mao problem This was the situation Maos picture had come down almost everywhere in China except for holidays and even then the pictures were a lot smaller and scarcer than they used to be But officially Mao was still a hero Sooner or later the party would have to decide what to do about him Dead he was still a problem The party had to decide how responsible he had been for Chinas tragedies how to judge his place in history how large a niche to provide for his bust he man now in charge in China Deng Xiaoping  who kept the amusingly modest title of Deputy Prime Minister when he climbed to power had himself been disgraced and thrown out by Mao not just once but twice and couldnt return finally until after Mao died in 1976 China had gone hugely spectacularly wrong for two decades beginning in the late 1950s Obviously some of this must have had to do with what Mao and the party did after they took power in 1949 But nobody talked about that at all because it would involve the very foundation of the Chinese Communist society But certainly sooner of later responsibility had to be fixed for the Great Leap Forward of 195860 that crash economic program so dear to the hearts of foreign admirers of Mao  all those of foreign admirers of Mao  all those enchanting backyard furnaces all those eager Chinese workers laboring day and night all those inspiring goals set all those giant communes made up of peasant cooperatives Not all the Chinese were enchanted The Great Leap Forward became a huge leap backward The goals were not met the furnaces died the great communes stumbled in mismanagement the land sickened the people were exhausted and China bled Then there was the Cultural Revolution of 196676 that totally mad revolution within a revolution when Mao and his entourage decided that what China needed most was perpetual turmoil that the enemies were within that there had to be purification through fire that danger lurked in the minds of scholars that beauty and learning were evils to be rooted out the universities were closed millions exiled to the countryside China isolated from the world civic and family life destroyed and how many people killed nobody knows or probably will ever know Paranoia was elevated to policy Red Guard thug gangs roamed the land and the prison camps were choked Ever since Maos death and the return of Deng all these disasters had been officially acknowledged but blamed on the Mao entourage  the Gang of Four But it couldnt last For one thing everybody knew better and for another Deng wanted to eliminate from influence a few of his old foes still clinging to top posts like Chairman Hua Guofeng Mostly Deng had to put Chinese history in his own perspective explaining the past was essential to mapping the future Explaining the past meant cutting Mao down substantially But to strike too hard at him might raise unthinkable questions about the early years and the Communist system itself That obviously could not be permitted or left to chance So for more than a year the party leadership had been wrangling and debating and bargaining in secret All the officials in Peking and all the diplomats knew the debate was taking place and had spent their time speculating on the outcome History was involved but so were lives and careers and power and the future Hardly anything was more important One day in Peking I was told that I was to see an important official  no name  and would I care to submit a list of topics I wanted to discuss My list included some questions on foreign affairs but pointedly raised the matter of evaluating Mao  what was the party going to say and when There was a warmup visit with a Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs clearly arranged to look me over and the next day I was asked to visit the important official who turned out to be Huang Hua the Foreign Minister He had recently been given the extra title of Deputy Prime Minister Mr Huang had been around  he had been around a lot He was one of the few Chinese diplomats who had been allowed by the Maoists to stay abroad during the bad years and here he was now a man of significance in the new era stronger than ever I had met him in New York at a dinner party in his honor  it turned out our encounter was not engraved on his memory  where his toast was a lengthy prepared speech He was obviously not a man given to sudden ungovernable urges to take political risks but he was also obviously a man who could if he wished tell a visitor what reality was as seen from the offices of the Chinese Politburo Mr Huang sat back in his stuffed chair and I asked a question He looked at me nodded and began to talk He talked about Chinese modern history from the early days of the Communist victory He talked and he talked and he talked He talked for about one hour and 15 minutes including interpretation time No more questions At first I did not understand what was taking place I was astonished and irritated It was plain he had not been interested in my question that I would have gotten the same lecture if I had asked first about the weather Some of the Chinese journalists who had been invited dropped off to sleep which made me even more irritated If I could stay awake they could at least pinch themselves alive Finally Mr Huang paused for a few seconds That was meant to indicate the end of the preliminaries Then without a piece of paper in front of him he proceeded to tick off every topic I had presented on my list He had memorized every subject I was interested in decided what he was going to say and said it after giving a historical preamble for the record keepers For another hour Mr Huang spoke First he marched from one foreignaffairs topic to another Then another pause a brief stare and he got to the heart of what he knew really interested both of us most  how the party was going to deal with the dilemma of evaluating the Maoist past without tarnishing the revolution and the system itself Mr Huang announced carefully and slowly that the party had reached a consensus Mao had made some serious mistakes but he had been a great leader and thinker so great in fact that his thought still had to be studied analyzed and pondered The present party leadership was strong never stronger and intended to remain that way I rather admired all that Mr Huang did not have to spell it out much further It meant that the leadership had carved out an intricate decision  to blame Mao squarely for some of the important errors but to keep his place in history as a thinker and leader and revolutionary hero Thus there would be no Mao cult but no unpleasant questions raised as to whether the very system Mao had helped create might have been at fault And as for the future the party would decide what the great thoughts of Mao really meant as it went along history was to be a looseleaf book The hardliners of the left would have to swallow a partial demystification of Mao There was to be no widespread purge of the kind Mao loved so dearly They could keep their jobs for the most part but demoting Hua Guofeng would put them on notice that their days of power were to be over if Mr Deng had his way and that he intended to have it As for the intellectuals and freeexpression dreamers of the right they were to understand that open brutal repression was no longer in style But Mao who had thrown their kind into prison camps by the millions and had coined the catchy official phrase stinking intellectuals was to be retained in history as a great philosopher a founder a man of brilliance That should be enough to keep them walking delicately and not getting too many fancy ideas On June 30 the official consensus declaration on Mao was published Every word will be studied minutely in China It took 35000 words for the party to say what Mr Huang had said in a few minutes in his own good time And when he did the Chinese journalists in that room had come wide awake I wonder why Americans and Chinese get along so well We do Only rarely have we been on the same side of history I know about the sailing ships and the missionaries but not many Chinese or Americans are moved by historical memories of either these days There is so much that should divide us and has For centuries China was the worlds favorite victim She was the victim of her own arrogant dynasties with their xenophobic delusions of superiority then the victim of the European powers who removed delusions with gunboats and carved up China nicely pausing to put up signs in Shanghai that the Chinese would not allow themselves or foreigners to forget No dogs no Chinese Then came the Japanese to torture China and along the way there were warlords and bandits and Sun Yatsens hopes destroyed in the chaos of the Nationalist regime dreadful civil war and Maoist rule The United States was not a leading victimizer although we took a little here and there nothing too big and we did stand together during World War II But essentially the United States was on the other side  the rich side of the fence  for most of history And during the Korean War the Chinese army gave us absolute living hell The Chinese were a main supplier of our enemy during Vietnam  how they regret that now 20 billion of aid to those lackeys of the Russians all for nothing  and during the decades of the long freeze China and the United States painted each other ugly But it is not sentimental to say that you simply cannot be an American in China for more than a few days without feeling you are in friendly territory Every American in China has anecdotes of warmth to tell One of mine now is about the young man and the old man outside the movie theater in Shanghai We were all hanging around looking at the billboards of the next weeks American Film Festival Some pretty good ones were chosen by the Chinese  Snow White Shane Black Stallion Singin in the Rain Guess Whos Coming to Dinner  nothing that would start riots in the streets or show the United States of 1981 but pretty good oldies The young man one of Chinas determined Englishpracticers told me he had learned English on the side while working as a mechanic and would see every film because he wanted to know more about my country which he said he thought was a good friend of Chinas The old man who joined in spoke much better English There was a still picture of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy A fine actress Hepburn the old man said  he had first seen her at the Shanghai Roxy in Little Women Perhaps not quite as good as Garbo but very good anyway and he was sorry to hear Tracy was dead when did it happen There was a little talk about life in the United States and cars and wasnt it good that the President escaped and how are things generally Not very significant but terribly warm and friendly a scene repeated often around China one way or another  the use of a little bond some English to make human contact Part of the feeling of friendliness must come from the fact that Chinese and Americans have the same sense of humor I can prove it I was in a fine mood in China I was running around asking questions and learning things and feeling 10 years younger It is a scientific fact that running around and learning things makes the body cells from the head bone to the ankle bone younger I made a lot of jokes and the Chinese thought almost every one of them funny and a couple were real thigh slappers Now can you tell me that people who laugh at your jokes are not intelligent warmhearted and all told pretty terrific Theres a poignant irony about China and foreigners China and the rest of the world Throughout its millenniums China acted as though the rest of the world either did not exist or was trivia or could be swallowed up Yet it has been Chinas fate to be overwhelmed by the world it tried to ignore The Great Wall stretching from the sea and built of stone and the bodies of hundreds of thousands of slaves is an awesome and a bitter sight China was overwhelmed by invaders of Genghis Khan by the West by the Japanese Then when it did reach out after the Chinese Communist victory in 1949 it discovered that the Russian hand it grasped was to hear the Chinese tell it full of nettles Now after Maos attempt to make China an isolation cell brought chaos to the country cost it that most precious and irreplaceable resource time the Government of Deng Xiaoping is reaching out again to the rest of the world  reaching out drawing back reaching out Its a fascinating thing to watch the Deng Government Its on a high wire like those wonderful Chinese acrobats but the safety wire isnt quite visible The Deng people know that the great crime of previous dynasties including the Mao was to fail to bring China into the world of contemporary knowledge Ancient Chinese invented movable type but they kept knowledge the property of the very few Compared to countries less ancient but more adventuresome brilliant arrogant China was really a fortress of ignorance for centuries Mao destroyed the intellectuals wiped out the universities and set China back who knows perhaps 20 years perhaps half a century perhaps more because the world went forward while China took the great leap backward Deng has opened the door it is plain but he and his people are fearful of what might enterThey stand there and say yes technology come right in and this investment but not that this idea is all right but this one is too capitalist too selfindulgent a little foreign culture yes but nothing gaudy or dangerous some careful book exhibitions and movies but remember art and literature must serve the people and how are we going to keep the artists and writers in line if too many wild ideas get in and how are capitalists going to wander around and get things done and make profits without impinging on the socialist theology and we know private initiative is necessary because weve seen it work the past few years  privately operated plots outproducing Government acreage and little stalls recently permitted to open to sell vegetables or cook fast dishes doing just fine  but shouldnt we pull them back a little and it gets all mixed up foreign influence good and bad affecting domestic policy and how are we going to let new ideas in and control one billion people and how are we going to shut them out and still feed one billion people and protect them and all the while the millions of bureaucrats who did profit from Maoism and had their lives invested in it are waiting for just one slip and they will cut our heads right off So I become Mr Deng What do I do I have taken my risks challenged Maos hardline successors thrown them into jail turned villains into heroes and the other way around cautiously dealt with Maos history so as to appease the knives on the left a little and not let the intellectuals on the right get too many fancy ideas Ive let foreign capital in Ive taken a lot of chances Ive got enemies at home and enemies abroad and I cant let the country go back or it and I will go down and I cant rush forward too fast because it might destroy socialism and I am a believing MarxistLeninist not a cryptocapitalist so what do I do I play it careful cautious easy smart a step fo
ward and a step back and a step sideways to confuse things a bit  a step a step a step It is a difficult dangerous act and Deng has had some delicate moments when his footwork seemed to slip For a while the Deng group overextended itself heady with the realization that Maos death grip which had prevented modernization had loosened and eager to capitalize on the destruction of the Gang of Four That is supposed to mean Maos widow and aides but really could be the gang of four million or 14 million or 20 million who knows all those who supported the isolationcell philosophy of government Too many industrial projects too many debts looming too much sudden nonplanning  rich for the stomach of a controlled society like feeding steak to a starving man Peking began to worry Expansion and a little loosening up were all right but nobody in Peking had any desire to lose control because to lose control is very very dangerous So readjustment began The Communists like a lot of other rulers like words that sound bland but mean a lot Readjustment means pull in cut back spend on target goals only make sure the targets are politically right Heavy industry was assigned lower priority behind agriculture and increased production of consumer goods  plain simple goods for the most part but things that Mao would have denounced as germs injected into society by capitalist running dogs  more bikes radios cloth food even private television sets Factories were cut back A management type in a Peking steel plant acted as if the cutback orders were just wonderful And unemployment had to be acknowledged for the first time in China That gave Deng the chance to allow some private initiative to take up the slack Nothing as wild as capital formation mind you or even private property But it became permissible for people who couldnt get jobs  particularly youngsters out of school  to scrounge up a little work on their own A few of them could get together in a collective or partnership Nobody could hire anybody and make a profit on labor But a few partners could open a little restaurant or a bikerepair stall or a young fellow could get some shirts from a factory haul them over to a free market and sell them at a profit These selfemployed are all over China adding the salt of choice the pepper of variety to the Communist consumer stew Indeed factories are now supposed to make a profit That was something of a revolutionary idea Before what counted was production A factory manager was judged on how much he produced over quota and it didnt matter if those shoes or spare parts or whatever piled up in the factory How many were produced was what counted Now he is expected actually to produce things that sell and are wanted And then the farmers were to get something too  a tiny plot of land where they could grow theoretically what they wanted after the unit met its quota and sell it at free markets Some commune commissars dont like that term and call them country fairs Some of this worked some didnt some worked all too well Some factory managers really began to believe that they were free of central planning and to hear Peking tell it started to spend money like water The private plots worked they worked all right and so did the free markets in which their produce was sold They worked so well that Governmentrun food stalls in some cities were obliged to move to the free markets because thats where the people were  the old capitalist marketing technique of following the crowds And Deng found out what every leader who doesnt want to rely totally on the threat of terror found out It is one thing to give an order and another to make a bureaucrat a thousand miles away jump to it Many of the communes are run by bureaucrats who have their doubts about privateplot nonsense When I asked a couple how the expansion of the private plots was going they looked a bit blank Yes they agreed Peking had said something to the effect that upwards of 7 percent of the land should be in private plots but in time in time So Deng and his people are going forward and backward adjusting readjusting What the Chinese people really feel about all this is a question Pragmatically  a new favorite word in China they would seem to like it because it means more food on the shelves a chance for the unemployed son or daughter to pick up a few yuan and judging by the crowds in the free markets the peasants are making pretty good money selling their products They charge a little over state prices but they have the goods the consumers want Variety and availability Foreign businessmen sit around the indoor cafe of the Peking Hotel and the Peace Hotel in Shanghai and grumble wearily about the difficulty of cutting a deal in China Given the fact that the Chinese Communist officials have only been cutting deals for a few years and that every one of them knows that if the Maoists return to power someday having traded with foreign businessmen at all may mean death disgrace oblivion it must indeed be pretty difficult Still the businessmen stick around because even a little penetration of that billionmouth twobillionfeet market would be just lovely Probably the kindest thing ever said to me about private initiative in China was said quite innocently by a Chinese official in Canton There are a lot of restaurants and food stalls in Canton and he said you could always tell the private ones  they were open earlier and the dishes were ladled out faster The Iron Rice Bowl he explained Thats shorthand for if you have a lifetime job with the Government and there is no reward for extra work and no penalty for goofing off  who cares the Iron Rice Bowl cant be broken If he survives Deng at least will go down in Chinese history as the man who knew that the stew would taste better with a little spice of profit That is pragmatic We stayed in a yurt in Inner Mongolia Sterba my traveling companion was grumpy because he thought it was a touristy yurt since other travelers had been brought to the same sheepherder brigade but I was more charitable How many brigades and how many yurts can the Mongolians provide out there on the grasslands The yurt is a round tent covered with felt against the wind The deputy brigade leader a sheepherder who obviously had executive abilities gave me a rundown on the advantages and drawbacks of yurts Advantages quick to put up and quick to take down when the time comes to follow that movable feast  the sheep to new grasslands Round so the winds dont blow them down easily and a hole in the top so that the smoke can escape Also they are earthquakeproof although there hasnt been an earthquake recently Drawbacks not very warm because the hole that lets the smoke out lets the wind in Also they are built right on the ground and are not very good for sheepherders or sheepherders wives inclined to rheumatism As a matter of fact sheepherders suffer a lot from rheumatism and maybe the yurt is the cause of it all A depressing Saturday afternoon visit in Shanghai My Chinese guides felt I was wrong to be so downcast Maybe they were right We were taken to a work and study school a reformatory for youngsters in their teens who had been accused of light crimes  stealing chronic misbehavior or sexual offenses It was in an outlying district of Shanghai 200 boys in one school 50 girls in another a mile away They slept in neat dormitories in neat doubletiered decks and their toothbrushes were neatly slanted in their cups all in the same direction The principal an earnest and obviously devoted man of 38 said that when the youngsters got in trouble their teachers recommended that they be sent to the school for a year or so for education and training If the parents approved off to the school with no further hearing If the parents did not approve the youngsters would have to face police justice The idea the principal said was to teach these young people their errors through criticism and discussion to teach them good work habits to save them before they got into further trouble At any time the school can shorten the sentence  or prolong it or in unruly cases call in the police It didnt look like heaven and it wasnt meant to be But as a citizen of a country where reform schools are training depots for criminals and where youngsters are beaten and raped by other inmates I could hardly sneer at the concept Every day three hours of labor In one classroom into which I wandered when I was pointed in another direction boys in their teens were separating knotted balls of thread in silence Pointless numbing work designed to teach them humility and to make them eager to be rewarded with less mindcrushing work In other workshops boys were patching up old boxes collected from factories so they could be used again dull but useful in a country where Government shops will buy up old bottles and rags and cans because nothing should be wasted There was a shop where boys were assembling bikes and that was meticulous useful work for which they were paid The road from pulling threads out of balls to assembling bikes was laid out clearly before the boys There didnt seem to be any cruelty so who was I to carp Then we drove to the girls school It was getting on toward evening and in a couple of hours the children who had behaved during the week would be allowed to go home for Saturday night and Sunday evening We walked up a flight of stairs and entered a room where a dozen girls were fixing boxes We were applauded on cue and a little embarrassed I turned to one of the girls and asked her through an interpreter why she was there She stood up immediately looked straight at me with pain and said loudly and firmly My name is Ma Xiulan I am 18 years old I am here because I had affairs with boys Then the mask slid over her face and she had done her job correctly  to confess to blame herself without showing improper emotion To show grief might imply that the Governments decision to put her in the reform school was wrong In another room girls at sewing machines Again applause embarrassment the mindless question to the nearest girl She stood up looked at me and said My name is Li Shanxing I am 19 years old I am here because I had an affair with a boy What happened to the boy I dont know she said looking down and trying hard but not as successfully as Ma Xiulan not to show grief I told the principal I had no more questions and wanted to leave at once He was a bit surprised but downstairs I told him I did not feel it was right to ask questions of children who could not tell me they didnt want to answer Later I was told that most of the girls were there for having affairs with boys  not prostitution but the crime of sex without sanction In the car driving back I was sad and silent for a long while Finally I turned to one of the Chinese and said that if having sex were a crime in my country half the youngsters would be in jail and the other half would be trying to get in That was one joke nobody laughed at and I guess it wasnt all that funny To a foreigner modern China is prudish and almost nonsensual The only place the Chinese express sensuality is in their food Desensualization  I know no better word for it  for decades had been part of life  or antilife  in China Men and women dressed almost identically in the same colors blue green gray Cosmetics or a touch of color here and there were discouraged severely during Maos rule Mao who had four wives himself did his best to eliminate outward differences between men and women to make the country almost asexual in appearance and in conduct What made Mao insist on this desensualization It was not population control Abortion was available on demand and free birthcontrol devices were everywhere Economic penalties and social pressures against large families had been built into Chinese society and there was no real need to decree physical dreariness to try to wipe out any expression of sexual differentiation any connection between sex and beauty sex and pleasure This went deeper It struck me as having more to do with people control  part of the general leveling out and neuterization that Maoism seemed to need There is a distaste among Chinese particularly in the countryside for open displays of sexuality but Mao carried it deeper and further  he made it part of the approved vision of life This reflects strange tastes or distastes among the Maoists It seems to me that leaders who try to desensualize their people who try to make them as drab as possible who find display of sexuality of any kind offensive have problems of their own There is still an air of desexualization but a bit of warmth is creeping in  girls can curl their hair if they wish wear other colors if they can be found and white hats blossom in the springtime Occasionally open affection breaks through and you feel like cheering Shanghai is for lovers because boys and girls actually walk hand in hand in public I once saw a boy with his arm around a girls waist in Shanghai In a few cities hotel waitresses grinned flirtatiously at Sterba And Chinese brides now seem to want to be treated like brides It is permissible to have decent wedding feasts The brides get all dressed up in rented wedding gowns to have their pictures taken and they see to it that their grooms rent tuxedos for the occasion Ive seen brides cling to their boys arms in parks for snapshots One girl even pinned on a piece of costume jewelry The boys looked a little uncomfortable but the girls were determined so who knows maybe romance will make a comeback But I think about Ma Xiulan and Li Shanxing still Its a small topic though I suppose it doesnt help much in trying to figure things out Always in my mind from the day I arrived in Peking as I traveled first north then west and south as I looked and talked and made notes when I rode the train from shabby bouncy Canton to shining bouncy Hong Kong four hours and a world away ever since and even now and probably always will be the question of the frame of reference How do you come to conclusions for yourself on China Against what background what frame of reference what set of values How do you pull your thoughts together logically Is what counts to compare what is taking place to the hideousness of Chinese history  and isnt this better Do you say to yourself that the truth is that Mao for whatever compulsions of his own almost succeeded in destroying China That Deng is far better than Mao and that really is what counts Is historical comparison reality or condescension Is what counts that the Chinese have rather more to eat a little more hope of a little more comfort Or is what really counts the degree to which men and women can talk and write and think a little more freely And in which direction is that going Can you separate the judgments from the system Is it correct to say that there was a good Mao period and a bad Mao period as the Deng Government does Or was bad Mao rooted in good Mao and were both the result of the system Communism Why does a country where land is so valuable waste millions of acres of farmland What does China need from us and we from China How does a new China hand make any attempt to separate the empathy he feels for China after just a few weeks from the decades of distaste he has felt for authoritarianism or totalitarianism take your pick Or should he China doesnt care but the new China hand does,,
SUNDAY OBSERVER; REAGAN'S FRIENDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/19/magazine/sunday-observer-reagan-s-friends.html,Having whipped the Democrats without breaking a sweat President Reagan must now look forward to coping with his hottest friends This could be a heavy struggle Coping with friends often is Lyndon Johnson had this problem back in the era when he ran the Senate for the Democrats He could usually glue together enough Republican swing votes and enough Democratic regulars to have his way but his bleakest moments were invariably provided by the liberals of his own party The redhots Johnson called them They were redhot for ideas that made Republicans and dampcool Democrats climb the wall bellow and snort Liberal ideas Ideas that they refused to compromise They filled Johnson with sorrow and despair His friends whose roots like his went back to the early New Deal  how could they make life so miserable for him Didnt they understand They didnt understand They enjoyed making life miserable for him They pleasured themselves by tormenting him as a betrayer of New Deal dogma as a friend who had sold out It is hard and sad to wield power in Washington when your friends want you to stand by ancient friendships President Reagan also has some redhots in the wings In the political gibberish of the day they are often called the extreme right though the term is not very useful There is an extreme right in domestic economics and they are very coldblooded cats indeed This is the group that has carried the Stockman budget for the President Politically they are as cool as clabber in the icehouse They came to power on a national surge of desire for lower taxes cheaper government and deviltakethehindmost a desire so powerful that it pulled several million critical middleofthehighway voters over into Reagan conservatism Barring an economic disaster the President can probably prosper by holding this part of his coalition The danger is that the redhots will drive it out of camp by demanding that Reagan carry through with a remaking of American society which brings the Government thundering into private lives The symbol of the redhots has become the Rev Jerry Falwells Moral Majority but they go beyond that They are the people who want government to end the hedonism built into American life over the past generation Their prime aim is to shut down the sexual carnival and make government use its muscle to establish the oldtime religion There is a certain appeal in this aim even to the hardened sinner but after the romance has been acknowledged and the nostalgic yen for returning to the supposedly good old days has been enjoyed there remains the reality of millions of voters who are likely to howl if government starts reorganizing their private lives The early attacks against abortions for lowincome women and free exercise of homosexual rights have given only a hint of the political mischief to be stirred up Lowincome people and homosexuals are politically dispensable minorities Mr Reagan can flourish without them so long as he can hold the big middleclass middleoftheroad vote with tax cuts shrunken government and a stable dollar Start poking the government paw into their private lives however and you have trouble Middleclass and middleincome if the 1980 census is anywhere near accurate no longer means a husband and wife living with twoandahalf children in a split level with the parlor over a twocar garage It is just as apt to mean two or three single people banded together to pay otherwise insupportable housing costs Or a man and woman both previously divorced now married to each other both of them possibly working There are his children her children and their children and sometimes the children live with him and her and sometimes some of them live with his former wife and some with her former husband These people are probably just as avid about tax cuts and chivying the pauper classes as the oldfashioned twoandahalfchild family with mom and dad married 20 years and there is no reason why Reagan cannot hold them in his coalition if the Laffer Curve proves out On the other hand if he is forced to bring in the Government and cut off abortions for them and sanitize their television and improve their moral tone rage could be quick to howl and his coalition could come undone quickly The White House apparently recognizes the danger Astutely it persuaded the redhots not to press their demands until the President had enacted his economic program The redhots waited like good sports Now their turn is about to come If they demand it all they have the power to blow the Reagan coalition apart before it can be consolidated It would be wishful thinking for Democrats to anticipate this outcome By now everyone must know it is suicidal to underrate the political skill of the Reagan group Doubtless the White House will find a way to cool down its hottest friends when due bills are presented It may cost the President a bit in friendship as it cost Lyndon Johnson in his day but the great question is how to maintain power And as Johnson used to say Where else are they going to go

will affect the future of Americas 617 million children under the age of 18 who live in a society where statistics show a dramatic change in the structure of families and a shift in population that is transforming a nation of the young into a nation of the old Poll Supports Rights According to a recent New York TimesCBS News Poll there is support for childrens rights in a number of areas but a belief that parents rights are supreme in many circumstances In the sample of 1467 votingage Americans a 3to1 majority favored the designation of a lawyer to represent childrens interests in divorce cases and 68 percent said that juveniles should have the right to be tried by a jury A 2to1 majority said that the Federal laws against kidnapping should apply when one parent steals a child from the other in a divorce case The age of 18 was most frequently mentioned by those polled as the time when parents should loosen the reins in a variety of matters including the right to make decisions on medical treatment and the right to decide where and with whom to live Although 65 percent of those polled believe in a womans right to choose abortion 63 percent said that girls under age 18 should not be allowed to have an abortion without parental consent The poll suggests that Americans believe overwhelmingly that the most important thing that children should get from their parents is love and from government education or training Some of the trends that are shaping childrens lives and the discussion of childrens rights are evident in a variety of national statistics  There are 617 million people in America under age 18 in a population of 2265 million according to the Census Bureau This is 74 million fewer than in 1970 when there were 691 million children in a population of 2032 million representing the changing age structure of the population  Some 766 percent of the children live with two parents 18 percent live with their mothers and 17 percent with their fathers Parents are getting divorced at twice the rate they did 20 years earlier according to the National Center for Health Statistics More children are involved in marital breakups than ever before 118 million in 1979 compared with 562000 in 1963 As many as 100000 children were kidnapped by their parents last year in custody disputes  More than 500000 children are in foster care 100000 are in mentalhealth specialeducation and other facilities and 87000 under 18 are in prison census and other estimates suggest  There were 711142 reported cases of child abuse in 1979 the most recent year for which statistics are available according to the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect In 1979 164400 runaway children were taken into custody by the police according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation The Family Is Changing The American family is changing and there has been a great deal more intervention into family affairs in the last 15 years than in the last 500 years said Henry Foster professor emeritus at New York University Law School who taught the first childrens rights course in this country in the 1960s But then the family school and religion have less authority than ever before The question of whether children have any independently assertible rights has long provoked divergent answers  Representative of one school of thinking is the Rev Jerry Falwell founder of the Moral Majority I believe that children should be subservient to their parents he said Children have the right to expect their parents to love them and to give them the correct discipline to develop their character They have the right to be punished properly when they do wrong but never to be abused To my mind the first childrens right is the right to a committed caretaker said Dr Urie Bronfenbrenner professor of psychology and human development at Cornell University What kids need is someone who cares for them this is the lesson of the hard facts of half a century of childdevelopment research Joseph Goldstein Sterling Professor of Law at Yale University points out that the rights of a child can certainly merge with a familys rights and they may not be in conflict at all Liberationists and ChildSavers There have been two principal impulses in the childrens rights movement according Robert Mnookin professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley To simplify it greatly he said there have been the childrens liberationists who believed that the way to salvation for children was to march down the same road that women and minorities have marched giving children the same rights as adults Then there have been the childsavers The rights that they wanted to expand were the rules that permitted the state to assume a broader role in intervening in the family in cases of need But I think its impossible to consider childrens rights without talking about how the law balances the power relationship between the child and the family the child and the state It is no easy matter simply to define what a child is Last year when the Veterans Administration found it necessary to define the word child so that benefits could be paid it took 1100 words across two and a half columns in the Federal Register to do it Legally children are defined as persons under the age of majority which in most states is 18 States set the ages at which adulthood is achieved in activities like serving on a jury or buying liquor The concept of when a child begins to have rights is also currently at issue A Senate subcommittee recently approved a socalled human life measure that states that life shall be deemed to exist from conception The bills supporters argue that the 14th Amendment which prohibits states from depriving persons of their rights without due process of law should be applied to unborn children The bill was reported to the Senate Judiciary Committee for action The National Academy of Sciences addressed the issue of the rights of the fetus by adopting a resolution saying that the bill deals with a question to which science can provide no answer when the fetus becomes a person the resolution said must remain a matter of moral or religious values Much attention has also been given to a number of legal cases that have pitted children against parents The most sensational was that in which Tom Hansen a 24yearold from Boulder Colo filed for 350000 in damages in 1978 against his parents in what his lawyer called a malpractice of parenting suit It alleged neglect of his needs for clothing food shelter and support at critical periods in his life A district court judge dismissed the case as without merit A 13YearOld Seeks Asylum Childversusparent disputes have raised fundamental constitutional issues One such recent case was that of Walter Polovchak a 13yearold Ukrainian boy in Chicago who sought political asylum rather than return with his emigrant parents to the Soviet Union The case is being appealed after a juvenile court made Walter a ward of the state Representing the interests of children is not always a simple matter For example some children want to be returned to the very home where they have been physically or sexually abused said Prof John J Sampson of the University of Texas Law School It isnt always easy to know precisely whats in the best interest of the child Childrens rights are being defined in a new way in another legal arena the Supreme Court of the United States Since the 1960s the Supreme Court has taken an extraordinary number of cases involved with children families and the state said Prof Robert A Burt of the Yale University Law School I taught family law before 1968 and there were hardly any cases Now its virtually a subcategory of constitutional law Childrens advocates point to the Courts ruling in a 1967 case In re Gault as the beginning of the socalled revolution in childrens rights The 81 decision held that children have rights to due process in court proceedings including the right to a lawyer to privilege against selfincrimination and the right to be tried before witnesses who could be crossexamined Other rulings reflecting the Supreme Courts new activity in this area have involved the commitment of children to mental institutions the rights of foster children to due process minors rights to abortion medical services and freedom of expression and other issues One case on standards of proof in the termination of parental rights is now before the Court However said Professor Foster some comments in Wisconsin v Yoder and some of the language in Gault are just about the only things we have to make a claim for the constitutional rights of minors In the view of Professor Mnookin of Berkeley considering the Supreme Court rulings is almost like listening to a fugue He explained You can discern three distinct themes First that parents have primary responsibility to raise children Second that the state has special responsiblities for children to intervene and protect them And third that children as people have rights of their own and have rights as individuals in relation to the family and in relation to the state These themes are constantly in conflict Although the Gault ruling was important in establishing childrens procedural rights in a juveniledelinquency context the more important development in the area of childrens rights came in the area of legislative protections and services and their subsequent judicial enforcement said Daniel Yohalem legal director for the Childrens Defense Fund in Washington Federal programs have controlled the spending of billions of dollars for things like the education of the handicapped medical care and nutrition A Rallying Point Thus the Reagan Administrations budget proposals in Congress have become a rallying point for those who hold that children have rights to services from the Government Of some 164 billion budgeted in six key Federal programs affecting children the Administrations proposed cuts would prune more than 38 billion Beyond the question of budget cutting loom the Administrations attempts to place the categorical grants for some 500 Government programs into block grants that would be paid to the states which could disburse Federal funds as they wish President Reagan has urged block granting as a way to cut through complex Government regulations and to give the states more autonomy in employing Federal funds Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois said The states and localities are closer to the people and its a good idea to give them more responsibility Advocates of childrens rights counter that Federal statutes are necessary to curb abuses I hope the statutes will be preserved said Peter W Forsythe director of programs for children at the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation in New York It took 50 years to build them up and if theyre wiped out theres nothing to replace them The best thing that can happen for poor kids and for all kids is to have an economy that is clicking on all cylinders said Edwin L Dale Jr spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget Opponents of the cuts believe they will have a devastating effect on children and families The first and most significant asset of any nation is its children  said Professor Louis Levitt of the Wurzweiler School of Social Work at Yeshiva University The Reagan cuts are shortsighted and cruel and all of us will pay the price Well have to live with these children for the next 60 years Children have been seen and heard in the debate about their rights The whole problem is that kids cant vote for politicians  so why should politicians do things for kids said 13yearold Jennifer Avellino a reporter for Childrens Express a New York group that produces a triweekly syndicated newspaper column written by 8 to 13yearolds What is the future of the childrens rights movement Some advocates believe that America will be increasingly intolerant toward children as the ratio of young to old tips dramatically toward a proponderance of the aged by the end of the century But other childrens advocates see themselves as part of an evervital continuum of social reform I know the childrensrights movement has a future Mr Yohalem said What were doing here is simply the continuation of American efforts like the settlementhouse movement and the compulsoryeducation movement It will not go away because it serves a need that is fundamental to each generation  Next Foster care  childrens rights in relation to the state
SOME RAMIFICATIONS OF A HUMAN LIFE LAW,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/22/opinion/l-some-ramifications-of-a-human-life-law-203481.html,To the Editor As the designers of the Human Life bill are well aware its significance lies not in its overt assertion but in its implication namely that abortion and several methods of birth control will fall into the category of homicide and thus be punishable as felonies The bill however has other implications which its supporters may not equally be willing to support First the attempt to fix the beginning of life in objectified biological terms cannot be separated practically from a determination of the nature of the life in question To be operational the designation of conception as lifes starting point necessarily entails a determination of what precisely is being conceived It was not entirely a joke when a previous letter to the editor pointed out that his cat met one of the suggested sets of criteria which would make her and her potential offspring subject to the law The example may be crude but it anticipates a more serious ambiguity in the application of this amendment to a genetically variant or functionally impaired fetus I am certain that ensuing attempts at a definition of human will not be resolved satisfactorily by simple recourse to biological criteria but instead will create enough problems and diversions to make the proposed law unfeasible Secondly legislation that grants its rights based on a biologically demarcated period of life necessarily precludes consideration of both the quality of that life and the social conditions under which it is lived With the inviolability of life secured exclusively as a function of the minimal biological requirements of its existence and the subsequent prohibition against any interference with the natural biological process it would follow that the state be culpable for the murder of every soldier killed in war and every criminal sentenced to death In the event that the Human Life legislation is passed I present these observations for those who will be burdened with its interpretation KENNETH SANDBANK New York July 14 1981
DEMOCRAT'S LOSS LAID TO TIES WITH PHILADELPHIA'S MAYOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/23/us/democrat-s-loss-laid-to-ties-with-philadelphia-s-mayor.html,Mayor William J Green at an unusually candid news conference today assumed part of the blame for the defeat yesterday of his partys candidate for Congress a Democrat running in a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans by 4 to 1 Theres nothing like a good licking to make somebody begin to take a good look at themselves Mayor Green said And after saying that perhaps he had not been visible enough and perhaps had not communicated effectively to this citys neighborhoods all the things he was trying to do to save money increase government efficiency and reform patronage politics he added Sometimes I think I seem terribly aloof Independent Wins Decisively The Mayors candidate David B Glancey a young city Democratic chairman was defeated decisively by a dissident Democrat state Senator Joseph Smith who was running as an independent Mr Smith had also been designated the nominee of the Third Congressional Districts Republicans and thus had two lines on the ballot Other stunned Democratic leaders trying to assess the reasons for the defeat also laid part of the blame on the Mayor but other factors also emerged including the issues of abortion taxes and city services Some also said today that the outcome of the vote to succeed Raymond F Lederer the Democratic representative who resigned last spring after his conviction on bribery charges as a result of the Federal Governments Abscam investigation was a reflection of the nature of Philadelphia politics You have to remember that Philadelphia politics are caught in a time warp said a PHiladelphian familiar with the citys politics In voting on Congressional races people here dont vote for national issues they vote for constituent services They vote on who can get their potholes fixed Green Compliments Smith At his news conference the Mayor seemed well aware of that aspect when he made a laudatory comment about the candidate whose defeat he had worked for Referring to Mr Smith and his constituents Mr Green said He had represented them in the past served them well and had done a good job He was sort of their guy In his wellfinanced campaign Mr Glancey 36 years old stressed his opposition to President Reagans budget cuts and promised to work hard in Congress for more jobs for Philadelphians an issue that seemed important to the bluecollar northcentral Philadelphia district Mr Smith 61 years old stressed his prolabor voting record over his 11 years in the state Senate but he also tried to foster the idea that the race was a referendum on the Mayor asserting that he had lost contact with the neighborhoods Philadelphia is a city of neighborhoods and in the Third District they are especially closeknit Unions Play Key Role The prolabor record proved important to Mr Green for it brought the support of leading unions to help finance and run his campaign and get out the vote One Glancey partisan State Senator Frank Lynch was among those who said they believed the issue of the Green administrations performance was decisive The foot soldiers would come back to me and say the people just werent going for Glancey that he was just too close to Greenie Mr Lynch said He continued People out in the district have seen their assessments go up their water and sewer costs go up and their trash  well itll get collected eventually I dont think my own street has been cleaned in a year But he said other issues such as abortion might have been equally important In the campaign Mr Smith supported an constitutional amendment against abortion while Mr Glancey had said that although he was personally opposed to abortion he could not back such an amendment Every Catholic church in the district was backing Joe Smith on that abortion issue Mr Lynch said adding however The biggest break he got was those two lines on the ballot He couldnt have been elected as a Republican and he couldnt have won as an independent With both of those lines he had it made Patronage Stance a Factor Another state political official who asked not to be identified said he thought Mr Greens attempts at reforming the patronage system had worked against Mr Glancey The patronage jobs win the loyalty of ward leaders he said and they are the ones who get out the votes In this district they dont go for the political dogooder he said They think the machine politician gets things done for the neighborhood Race also entered the picture in a district where many of the voters are bluecollar whites because some whites saw the Mayor as doing too much for blacks one said But he added that didnt help him in the black wards because blacks thought Green had not done enough Several leaders said today that some analysts overemphasized the idea that a vote for Mr Smith was a vote for the return of Frank Rizzo whom whom Mr Green succeeded as Mayor in 1979
CUSTODY AND THE LEGAL CLASHES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/23/nyregion/custody-and-the-legal-clashes.html,When the Rev Francis Pizzarelli opened the rectory door at Infant Jesus Catholic Church in Port Jefferson LI in March 1980 he found a wiry 15yearold seeking sanctuary His name was Jamie Schaeffer and he had bolted from a custody hearing after a Family Court judge ruled that he must leave his fathers home in Long Island and return to his mothers home in Florida The police are looking for me he told the priest It was not the first time that Jamie had defied court orders to live with his mother who was granted custody when the Schaeffers were divorced in 1975 nor as it turned out was it the last time At issue in custody disputes such as the one involving Jamie is the right of parents to rear a child as they see fit as against vaguely defined rights of children in the evolving American family As Father Pizzarelli looked back on the night he agreed to shelter Jamie it seemed to him that the boys story was in some ways bizarre and in other ways typical of Long Islands runaways children 16 and older who are leaving home at a rate of 4000 a year and sometimes trying as Jamie later tried to emancipate themselves The custody issue is driving kids out of the house the priest said Theyre being told in no uncertain terms You have no rights to say who you want to live with Kids whove been dragged through the courts tell me Father I dont want to live with either one of them  A Debate Over Rights The child in a custody battle the minor seeking emancipation the pregnant teenager  a variety of children caught in a variety of predicaments are claiming the right to make major decisions affecting their lives even though the decisions conflict with their parents wishes Such conflicts once confined to the privacy of the home are spilling out into courtrooms and into the halls of the state and Federal legislatures where they have become a subject of intense debate Lawrence Stotter past chairman of the American Bar Associations family law section predicts that the press for childrens rights in the 1980s will parallel that of womens rights in the 1970s Of divorce cases he said Were moving away from the concept of children as chattels just as we have moved away from the concept of wives as chattels Its a natural progression Nevertheless Mr Stotter echoed the view of many in the familylaw field when he conceded I have yet to see the answer to the question what should be the rights of children and of parents Marcia Robinson Lowry chairman of the childrens rights project of the American Civil Liberties Union calls the clash of childrens rights and parents rights one of the most difficult and complex issues we deal with To illustrate she cited the widely publicized case of Walter Polovchak a 13yearold Ukrainian boy who was granted political asylum after refusing to return to the Soviet Union with his parents The Chicago chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is representing Walters parents in the case which is on appeal The division among civil libertarians reflects the complexity of the issue Mrs Lowry said adding There are people on the national staff who think we should be on the other side of the Polovchak case Conflicts between parents and children are very difficult Public Favors Rights As the professionals ponder this question a New York TimesCBS News poll suggests that the American public favors greater rights for children in some areas and more parental control in others For example most of the 1467 respondents 68 percent in a telephone poll conducted recently believe a child has a right to a lawyer when his parents get divorced while an almost equal number 63 percent believe minors should not be allowed abortions without their parents consent The United States Supreme Court came to grips with the question of parental control as it relates to the medical care of minors in 1979 in two important opinions In the first the Court held that parents have the authority to consent to the commitment of an unwilling child to a mental hospital as long as two psychiatrists agree Two weeks later the Court declared unconstitutional a Massachusetts law requiring minors to get the approval of their parents or a judge before they could undergo abortions This ruling along with an earlier one on contraception advanced the socalled mature minor doctrine which holds that some children may be of sufficient maturity to consent to certain medical treatment Meanwhile in March the Court upheld a Utah law requiring that parents be notified when a minor requests an abortion While most state laws and clinic policies do not require parental notice this issue and related ones are being debated in state legislatures At the same time the Reagan Administration has stressed its commitment to supporting family involvement in all aspects of teenage sexuality Some here may not like it but its a fact of life and its best that we recognize it  Marjory Mecklenburg director of the Department of Health and Human Services adolescent pregnancies program recently told a conference of professionals in the field We will ask hard fiscal questions as well as hard human questions about what happens to these young women A Move to Florida No trend in modern society affects more children in a more profound way than divorce In 1979 the last year for which statistics are available the lives of 118 million children were altered by marital breakups and the custody arrangements that followed Jamie Schaeffers case illustrates what can happen when custody arrangements collapse Jamie was 10 when James and Elaine Schaeffer were divorced A few days after the decree was signed Jamie and his mother moved to Florida Since the move to Florida deprived him of his right to visit Jamie the father says he stopped paying child support He also says he had to hire a detective to find Jamie In any event two years passed All I heard was how bad my father was  Jamie recalled over a meal in a diner on Long Islands North Shore Then one day I got off the school bus in Florida and there he was I walked over to him and we started talking He said Would you like to go back to New York with me and I said Let me think about it I thought about it and I said Yeah Five days later the police came to his fathers house on Long Island and took Jamie into custody My mother told the police I was kidnapped but I wasnt the boy said In my mind I wasnt The common term is child snatching It is estimated that 25000 to 100000 children are snatched each year by parents Until recently once one parent took a child across state lines there often was nothing the other parent could do about it except hire a detective to find the child and snatch him back Late last year in response to pressure from aggrieved parents and studies documenting the risk of psychological harm to children Congress passed the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act It requires judges to enforce and not modify custody orders from other states and it authorizes the use of the Federal Parent Locator Service to search for parents who flee with children just as it now searches for parents who flee from support payments The New York TimesCBS News poll found that 61 percent of respondents believe kidnapping laws should apply to parents The new parental kidnapping law has its critics however both inside and outside Congress mostly because it fails to make the crime a Federal one only when a felony warrant has been issued for the abducting parent does the law authorize the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into the case Thirtytwo states New York among them treat child snatching as a misdemeanor As John Gill president of Childrens Rights of New York put it If one spouse steals mail from another spouses mailbox thats a crime tampering with the Postal Service But if one spouse steals their children and hides thats not a Federal crime A Brief Interlude The childsnatching incident was a brief interlude in Jamies life for he was quickly returned to his mother in Florida but he was not content to stay there I kept running away trying to get to my dad he said My mom blamed him She said I was brainwashed In one year I did enough running away for 10 kids I never got out of the state of Florida though The police always caught me In his mothers view the boy was confused He didnt know his own mind she said in an interview He wasnt mature enough to know what was best for him Jamie disagreed saying I knew I wanted to live with my dad Im a lot like him We both like to fish we both like cars and working with machinery My mom treated me like a baby When I was 15 she thought I was still 8 In 1979 Jamies mother agreed to allow him to spend the summer with his father At the end of summer Jamie telephoned his mother to say he wasnt coming back He enrolled in a local high school His father filed a petition for a change of custody The judge said I had to go back to Florida Jamie recalled He said the Florida court had jurisdiction I said Dont you care about my feelings But the judge said the court wasnt interested in feelings only jurisdictions Thats when I ran out of the courtroom Finally I ended up at the church where Father Frank was I stayed in the rectory for two months waiting until I turned 16 As Jamie sees it the court did not want to hear his wishes Although many judges now interview older children involved in custody cases only 20 states including Connecticut have laws providing that depending on the age and maturity of the child his or her wishes be weighed in the courts determination A study of cases in Michigan where the childs preference must be considered in custody disputes found that although this is an enlightened policy the extent to which trial judges are willing or able to implement it is questionable Some judges ignore the wishes of young children while others lack the expertise to interview them according to the researchers Richard Benedek an Ann Arbor lawyer and Dr Elissa Benedek clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan Among other things they recommend the use of child psychologists to determine and evaluate the childs preference Another Approach Another approach to the problem of protecting the childs interests in custody disputes is the appointment of a guardian ad litem or lawyer for the child Several states have held that the court has the inherent power to make such appointments but only 20 states provide the statutory authority In Wisconsin and New Hampshire the appointment of a guardian ad litem is mandatory in all contested custody cases A much debated question in legal circles today is whether every child is entitled to a lawyer in a custody dispute Opponents argue that the childs interests are adequately protected by the judge that a third lawyer would muddy the waters and that the fees of the childs lawyer to be paid by one or both parents would pose an undue hardship Already they say the cost of protracted litigation to win custody approaches the cost of sending a child to college Proponents maintain that a child should have a lawyer because his or her interests may conflict with those of the parents They also argue that the childs lawyer would help defuse the hostility in the proceedings and help develop a more complete picture for the court by interviewing teachers counselors friends and neighbors Joint Custody In another contested area Dr Doris Jonas Freed of New York a national custody expert and others assert that a child of divorce has a presumptive right to frequent and continuing and meaningful contact with both parents or joint custody In recent years 15 states have enacted laws requiring courts to award joint custody when in the childs best interests In California Hawaii Nevada and Michigan judges are bound to consider joint custody even if only one parent requests it In New York a bill along those lines was vetoed last month by Governor Carey who said the presumption that joint custody was in the childs best interests should never be made based on an agreement between divorcing parents If parents care about their children they should try joint custody Jamie said adding that his father and stepmother now separated have agreed to share custody of their 3 12yearold daughter I think thats great if parents can work it out he said Jamies parents could not work it out So a few days after his 16th birthday he went from the church rectory to the courtroom accompanied by Father Pizzarelli and Charles Russo a child advocacy lawyer who agreed to take the case without fee The case was a tough one Jamie was asking to be emanicipated from his parents in a state where there are no clear guidelines on the emancipation of minors Most states provide that a child becomes emancipated when he reaches the age of majority or when he marries or joins the armed forces Traditionally only parents not children could petition a court for a decree of emanicipation releasing them from their legal duties to support maintain and educate a child In many states today parents must still consent to a court decree of emancipation of a minor unless they are found guilty of child abuse or neglect in which case their rights can be terminated Emancipation Laws More than a dozen states have laws allowing the courts to emancipate minors but in many cases emancipation is for specific purposes only In Mississippi for example a minor can sell a piece of real estate in New York a minor can sue his parents Under a new Connecticut law an emancipation decree entitles children of 16 or older to the status of adults They can sign contracts join the military and establish residency among other things In evaluating a minors request for emancipation courts look for selfsufficiency and freedom from parental control and authority Does he have a job A place to live Does he manage his own affairs Pay his debts Critics of the Connecticut law judges among them maintain that the law allows parents to abandon their children legally Although such children are often considered runaways the critics say they are actually pushouts There are pushouts too in New York and New Jersey but no laws to emancipate them Some of them go to the runaway shelters and some stay out on the streets says Linda Bailey executive director of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Advocacy Project in New York Theyre in a legal limbo They cant sign contracts cant enroll themselves in school cant get medical records a whole litany of cants As for Jamie Schaeffers right to emancipate himself his lawyer Mr Russo sought to argue the case but was in the wrong forum Family Court is a statutory court he said I knew that of course Our next logical step was Supreme Court But Jamie at this point said Look I dont want any more to do with courts Im sick of being bounced back and forth between parents Ive got my own life  In the end Judge Arthur Abrams ordered Jamie to return to Florida with his mother The judge also ordered an armed court officer to accompany the boy and his mother to her car which was parked outside the courthouse When they got to the car however Jamie said Im not going Mom And he walked away As Father Pizzarelli who witnessed the scene in the parking lot put it When a 16yearold walks away no parent can force him back no police officer will bring him back Whether thats the law or not thats what happens  Next children and the courts

GENETIC DISEASE THAT ATTACKS JEWS CALLED POTENTIALLY CURABLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/24/nyregion/genetic-disease-that-attacks-jews-called-potentially-curable.html,Gauchers disease one of the most common genetic disorders among Ashkenazi Jews is potentially curable in adults according to leading researchers who attended a workshop on the disease at Mount Sinai School of Medicine yesterday The disease which is always fatal in infants but not in those who first develop it as adults is due to an enzyme deficiency A dozen patients undergoing enzyme replacement therapy at the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda Md are showing signs that the disease has at least been partly arrested The adult form can produce severe pain in the back or limbs anemia bone deterioration gross enlargement of the spleen or liver internal bleeding or white blood cell deficiency that results in a fatal infection Yet some adult patients remain almost symptomfree Dr Peter Beighton of the University of Cape Town told of one who plays vigorous tennis at age 80 The adult form occurs primarily in Ashkenazi Jews  those of Central and East European ancestry The infant form attacks the nervous system and is fatal within a year or two The infant form moreover seems to affect all ethnic groups uniformly An intermediate or juvenile form has been found particularly common in northern Sweden Caused by Enzyme Deficiency One hope of the researchers is to learn what chemical or other factors distinguish these three forms from one another The disease is named for Phillippe C E Gaucher a French physician who described it in 1882 Occurrence of the adult form in Jewish populations is at least as common as TaySachs disease an invariably fatal infantile disorder Both are caused by enzyme deficiencies arising from the inheritance from both parents of a recessive gene When both parents carry the gene the chances are one in four that their child will have the disease At a news briefing during yesterdays meeting Dr Robert J Desnick director of the Center for Jewish Genetic Diseases at Mount Sinai and an organizer of the workshop estimated that as many as 160000 residents of the New York area carry the gene in a chromosome inherited from one parent From 1000 to 1500 have it in matching chromosomes from both parents and therefore manifest the disease he added Missing Enzyme Identified Researchers Dr Desnick said are closing in on the precise location of the gene in its chromosome If the location is found it could be possible to clone the gene inserting it into bacteria that could massproduce the enzyme for treatment A more distant prospect would be to insert the correct gene directly into those lacking it A number of years ago Dr Roscoe D Brady of the neurology institute in Bethesda where clinical tests are being conducted identified the missing enzyme as glucocerebrosidase Its role within the large scavenging cells that break down waste or foreign material within the body is to split certain fatty molecules When the enzyme is lacking such molecules accumulate in the scavenger cells which may then be deposited in the spleen and liver grossly enlarging those organs Dr Brady began his clinical tests seven years ago using enzymes derived from human placentas The purification method was improved in 1977 he said yesterday but unfortunately the enzymes are still attached to sugar molecules that guide most of them to the wrong cells limiting effectiveness of the treatment Test for Parents Sought Obtaining the enzymes is very costly and since its effectiveness is limited only a few patients are being treated One hope of the workshop participants is to find an effective way to test prospective parents for the gene Although the gene is recessive if they carry it small amounts of the defective enzyme are produced in their white blood cells or skin cells Such a test for the TaySachs gene is said to be virtually 100 percent effective whereas the rates reported yesterday for Gauchers disease ranged from 90 percent to 96 percent Dr Desnick pointed out that the tests cost several hundred dollars and are not recommended unless there is reason to suspect presence of the gene If parents have already produced one victim of the disease a prenatal test can be performed to determine if a prospective child has it too leaving open the option of an abortion
"LIKE IT OR NOT, DUBLIN IS CAUGHT BY CROSSFIRE",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/26/weekinreview/like-it-or-not-dublin-is-caught-by-crossfire.html,Even television viewers accustomed to nightly horror reports from Northern Ireland were shaken last week by film showing 13yearold Denis Thompson weeping beside his mothers grave She was killed five years ago by an Irish Republican Army bomb in a boutique in Ballymena Yvonne would have been 31 years old today said the boys anguished grandfather Nathaniel It is ridiculous that so much has been said about the hunger strike when the people who are the innocent victims are forgotten Hungerstriker Thomas McIlwee whose mother has gone to the United States on a fundraising tour was one of those involved in the bombing that killed Mrs Thompson Irish Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald whose fragile coalition is less than a month old abhors the kind of violence that has enveloped the Thompson and McIlwee families During his campaign he insisted that most Irish were far more concerned about the economy and 20 percent inflation than with Northern Ireland But Mr Fitzgerald like his predecessors has been unable to avoid the Northern Ireland issue The hunger strike in Belfasts Maze prison is stirring increasingly powerful undercurrents of support for the Irish Republican Army Six hungerstrikers have died and two more Kieran Doherty and Kevin Lynch reportedly are in their final hours Mr FitzGerald in seeking to settle the hunger strike knows that the death of Mr Doherty who was elected to the Irish Parliament shortly after he began his fast could weaken his own Fine Gail PartyLabor coalition possibly bringing on new elections He is attempting to walk a line between compromise and firmness reflecting ambivalence many Dublin Governments have felt toward the Northern Ireland issue Last week was a case in point On Monday Mr FitzGerald made clear his anger at what he saw as Britains stubbornness in balking at proposals for a settlement But on Tuesday after two British officials visited Maze and the hungerstrikers raised the ante with hardline demands he let it be known that the British had been essentially right to withdraw from the talks By the weekend  after angry statements by IRA supporters  Mr FitzGeralds aides insisted that he was not enthusiastic about the Britons belated visit Mr FitzGerald firmly opposes terrorism but he is also aware of what one Belfastborn Dublineducated writer calls the Irish ambiguity over the legitimacy of violence There are few countries he suggested where a man who had been charged with possessing 200 pounds of explosives in an attempt to place a bomb in crowded downtown Belfast  as Mr Doherty was  would have been elected to Parliament Mr FitzGeralds difficulties are rooted in his countrymens ambivalence about the guerrillas and also about the British and the Irish nation going back to the history of British colonization The 1920 formula partitioning off six counties in the north with Protestant majorities which remained part of the United Kingdom has never been fully accepted as permanent by southern or Catholic Irishmen Northern Ireland was not created to satisfy any local demand for selfgovernment J C Beckett professor of Irish history at Belfasts Queens University has written Its creation was an expedient imposed on the country by a hardpressed British Cabinet which sought only to hold two groups of Irishmen from each others throats and to give them an opportunity of living peaceably apart since they could not live peaceably together The expedient finally failed The Protestant majority in the North held political and economic sway over the Catholic minority until Britain finally took over the province in 1972 in a fruitless effort to create a government of power shared between Catholics and Protestants The Irish Republic meanwhile struggled to remain aloof from tribal warfare in Ulster Over the years Dublin governments have voiced pleas for peace but have according to their critics failed to take steps that would reassure Ulster Protestants fearful of being swallowed up in an overwhelmingly Catholic country The Catholic Church retains a special position in the Irish Replublic Divorce is difficult Contraceptives although relatively simple to purchase may be bought legally only with a doctors prescription Abortion is banned Loyalists in Ulster are fond of noting that the Republics Protestant population has dropped from 20 percent in 1922 to less than 5 percent evidence they say of religious prejudice Protestant moderates in Belfast add that even if the Catholic hierarchy relaxed its dominance in Dublin which they believe unlikely most Protestants would seek to remain separate from the Republic The Protestants nightmare is that they will be left by departing British to fend for themselves against their Catholic neighbors in the North and those waiting over the border Catholics meanwhile have a burning sense of grievance over jobs and housing and they look to unity as their salvation accepting and often condoning Irish Republican Army violence No doubt the presence of our troops prevents the outbreak of civil war but it also breeds extremism and terrorism on both sides Richard Crossman a Labor Party Cabinet Minister said more than a decade ago The one thing which might knock some sanity into their heads would be to be told that there is a time limit to our patience and that unless a solution is reached within that time limit we shall leave them to settle their own problems Such a step increasingly discussed now in London would probably be popular in Britain It would leave to the Irish Government a role it has strenuously avoided for decades dominant player in the Northern Ireland

THE U.S. FAMILY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/27/opinion/the-us-family.html,Public debate over abortions the Equal Rights Amendment divorce outofwedlock births and welfare has raised deepseated concerns about the future of the American family Almost all the ruminations on the current status and future of the family have tended to be extreme Alarmists issue dire warnings that the family is disintegrating while others respond with shouts of joy welcoming the crumbling of the institution Both sides ought to hold the obituaries Families though having undergone very wrenching changes are far more resilient than is often thought Margaret Meads observation some 30 years ago that the family is the toughest institution we have is still valid Indeed social and economic forces may actually buttress the family in the years ahead though it will continue to evolve Despite the turbulence of the last two decades repeated survey research shows that Americans now place top priority on family life and marriage as critical aspects of personal development and happiness The proportion of adults who are married at some time in their lives remains at a historically high level Americans have not soured on marriage even if fewer are willing to remain with one spouse until death do them part About 38 percent of first marriages by women in their mid to late 20s will end in divorce yet three of every four of them will remarry The divorce rates may not fall to the low pre1940 levels but neither do they seem to be progressing geometrically as is often assumed Married couples have not rejected parenthood While they want fewer children few wish to remain childless Small increases in fertility rates have already occurred as many women realize that motherhood is a nowornever proposition Medical technology has made it possible for proportionately more women to have children even though today more women postpone motherhood Population declines are far from a reality in this country A major concern has centered on children of broken homes because the number of youngsters affected by divorce has more than tripled since 1956 Yet almost 70 percent of all children still live with their natural parents and nearly all children live with at least one parent Children today have a much higher chance of living with either a mother or father than those in previous generations The average number of children per divorce has decreased as the proportion of divorces involving no young children has increased Roughly half of the households headed by divorced and separated women contain no children Recent data do not support the notion therefore that the number of children involved in divorce will continue to increase Household shifts show a far more complex pattern than simple rejection of the family For many younger adults the first marriage without children appears to be a quasitryout legitimized by church or state serving as a preparatory period for the second marriage which most often includes having children In the 1970s the number of unmarried couples increased by 150 percent to more than one million But in most cases cohabitation is only a period for experimentation or a transitional waystation before an adult moves on to the more conventional family patterns However living in sin is not a recent invention The writer Richard Lingeman found that during the 20 years before the Revolution onethird of all births in Concord Mass were conceived prior to marriage which roughly equals current rates So much for good old puritanical New England Womens increased participation in the workforce hardly indicates their rejection of family life Given the impact of inflation and slower productivity growth an increasing number of families have required a second paycheck to maintain living standards or to realize rising aspirations While change has been slow there are indications that working wives show a greater propensity to demand and receive a more equal role in family decisions All this indicates some basic shifts in stereotyped sex roles Most working women have tried to combine careers with an active family life paid employment has not led to a rejection of marriage and motherhood since bedroom technology has made it possible to plan parenthood around a career For the time being and in the foreseeable future the marriedcouple household is likely to remain the predominant family arrangement though households are demonstrating a high degree of variation It will require a greater degree of flexibility in public policy to cope with the diverse needs of different types of households But there is no reason to place the family on the endangeredspecies list  Sar A Levitan research professor of economics and director at The George Washington Universitys Center for Social Policy Studies is coauthor with Richard S Belous of the forthcoming Whats Happening to the American Family

CONFEREES DECIDE ON $37 BILLION TAX CUT IN FEDERAL BUDGET,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/29/us/conferees-decide-on-37-billion-tax-cut-in-federal-budget.html,A huge HouseSenate conference moved tonight toward completion of more than 37 billion in budget cuts after ratifying changes in hundreds of programs in an effort to curtail Federal spending The conference said to be the largest in the history of Congress involved 72 senators and 183 representatives But although attention focused on hundreds of differences between the House and Senate versions the two bills shared a common philosophy of fiscal restraint and were in agreement on the vast majority of issues Last night President Reagan described the package as the most sweeping cutbacks in the history of the Federal budget and estimated that the reductions would result in 140 billion in savings in the next three years measured against the current spending levels Focus Is on Method Not Goal The last remaining issue this evening was a disagreement on a ceiling on Federal financing of Medicaid for the elderly and poor But as in nearly all other disputes the disagreement focused on method rather than objective The Senate conferees sought a ceiling based on a 9 percent increase over the 1981 amount as against the 5 percent requested by the Administration The House conferees would achieve identical savings through a 3 percent decrease in Federal contributions to the states The conferees work next goes to the floor of the House and Senate where votes are expected on Friday The bill then goes to President Reagan for signing Under the package of budget cuts some programs were eliminated This included a 122amonth minimum benefit for Social Security recipients due to die in February but Congress is likely to restore it later Public service jobs under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act were also eliminated Most programs were modified In cash benefit programs ranging from food stamps to costofliving adjustments for Federal retirees future growth was curtailed by reducing benefits and tightening eligibility requirements Consolidation of Programs The legislation also provided for block grants to the states that would consolidate dozens of specific programs for health education social services home energy assistance and community and economic development The objective is to allow the states to decide how to spend funds that were previously designated for specific purposes by the Federal Government The Administration was unable to eliminate some programs that it had marked for extinction These included the Legal Services Corporation the Economic Development Administration and the Appalachian Regional Commission The package of budget cuts was mandated in the first budget resolution adopted in May That resolution instructed Congressional committees to make cuts in certain Federal programs such as agriculture health and education to keep spending in the next fiscal year to 6955 billion In June the Republicancontrolled Senate adopted the recommendations of its Budget Committee and voted to have its committees recommend legislative changes that would total 373 billion in cuts In the Democraticcontrolled House however a coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats rejected the recommendations of the House Budget Committee and instead adopted an Administrationsupported proposal that would result in 381 billion in cuts Health care issues were exempted from the Republican package however and those issues have proved the thorniest for the conference House and Senate conferees agreed on heath block grants that excluded family planning programs which would be continued as a separate entity Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee had refused to accept the compromise until he received a letter from President Reagan absolving him of responsibility for exclusion of the family planning programs The letter arrived this afternoon I didnt ask for any absolution Senator Hatch said I said I think its time for you guys to stand up and share the burden  The President said that all things considered he would prefer Mr Hatch to go along with the heath block grant compromise The conferees also accepted a proposal by Mr Hatch and Senator Jeremiah Denton Republican of Alabama to extend the work of adolescent pregnancy programs Those programs provide 133 million for nutrition and health care for pregnant adolescents Under the HatchDenton proposal 10 million would be added for research and up to 66 million for storefront centers to counsel against promiscuity Those centers would offer no abortion information but would refer a child to an abortioncounseling facility Representative Toby Moffett Democrat of Connecticut referred to the centers as storefront chastity centers and predicted that well be laughed out of every junior high school in America The conferees agreed on three block grants but would exclude veneral disease childhood immunization and tuberculosis programs and migrant and community health programs in addition to family planning programs A block grant for preventive health financed at 92 million would combine existing programs in home health rodent control fluoridation health education hypertension emergency medical services rape crisis and health incentives A 491 million health services block grant would combine mental health alcohol and drug prevention and abuse programs A 280 million primary care and community health center block grant also was approved The conferees also agreed to eliminate by stages Public Health Service hospitals such as the one on Staten Island Both the House and Senate bills would repeal the 200yearold entitlement or legal right that seamen have to free medical care
HEALTH NOMINEE DEBATE EASES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/30/us/health-nominee-debate-eases.html,The ideological and procedural standoff that has for months blocked Senate confirmation of President Reagans choice for Surgeon General of the United States Dr C Everett Koop a prominent foe of abortion has been ended As part of a complex compromise on health legislation reached yesterday by House and Senate conferees the lawmakers agreed to lift the age limit of 64 years for members of the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps The age restriction had stood in the way of Dr Koops confirmation because he is nearly 65 and the Surgeon General by law must be a member of the corps However the compromise also imposed tighter qualifications for the job requiring specialized training or significant experience in the administration of public health programs Dr Koop is a respected pediatric surgeon with only limited public health experience It remains to be seen how the Republicancontrolled Senate will interpret the rule Opposition From Liberals The nomination of Dr Koop has provoked stiff opposition from liberals who take exception to his views against abortion population control and homosexual rights His nomination has also been opposed by major elements of the medical profession including the American Public Health Association The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment headed by Representative Henry A Waxman Democrat of California had managed to delay the nomination by refusing to alter the age restrictions that made Dr Koop ineligible The job of Surgeon General is largely symbolic with limited statutory authority
POLITICAL-ECONOMIC TURN; THE PRESIDENT ATTAINS MASTERY AT THE CAPITOL,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/30/us/political-economic-turn-the-president-attains-mastery-at-the-capitol.html,In 190 days President Reagan has not only wrought a dramatic conservative shift in the nations economic policies and the role of the Federal Government in American life but has also swept to a political mastery of Congress not seen since Lyndon B Johnson With stunning victories today the President has won Congressional approval for the largest budget and tax cuts in modern American history changes that his partisans have termed the Reagan revolution inviting comparisons to the early New Deal period of Franklin D Roosevelt Republicans Are Euphoric The ease with which the Reagan forces scored their 238to195 vote of victory on the tax battle in the House of Representatives on the heels of an 89to11 tax victory in the Senate demoralized Democrats and sent Republicans into euphoria This means the President has effective control of the House said Representative Charles Wilson a Texas Democrat who had fought the Reagan tax bill I would advise the Democratic leadership not to stage any more Armageddons Other Democrats conceding that the President had made his point that he now has a solid working majority for his economic program in both House and Senate contended that this would not necessarily carry over to social issues such as abortion busing school prayer or the environment Speaking of the 48 Democrats in the House who backed the Presidents tax package Morris K Udall the liberal Arizona Democrat commented These guys didnt sign a contract to become Republicans  they responded to an allout fullcourt press by the President But the Republican leadership contended that the tax victory following the earlier budget victories had been a shattering blow to the House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr who predicted a Democratic victory only two days ago and that it should now make the Democratic leadership more willing to compromise I hope they realize we have a President who is committed to his program and willing to fight for it said Representative Trent Lott from Mississippi the Republican whip The President made an appeal and followed up on it This victory does not mean the Democrats have lost absolute control but it indicates that the policies that the Speaker advocates have been repudiated I hope it means the leadership will really be willing to compromise in the future Awed by His Influence Both Democrats and Republicans spoke with awe of the Presidents having generated public support for his tax package with his Monday night television appeal though Mr ONeill and other Democratic leaders contended that it was mainly organized corporate and conservative telephone callers who devastated Democratic support for the opposition program Sarcastically Mr ONeill told the House that corporations like Exxon Philip Morris McDonnell Douglas Paine Webber and Monsanto had turned over their switchboards to generate calls to Congress in the Presidents behalf But other Democrats complained that Mr ONeill himself may have speeded Democratic defeat by virtually conceding this morning because of what he called a telephone blitz like this nation has never seen Twice now Mr Reagan has surprised the Democratic leadership with political muscle when Mr ONeill had counted on victories He did it on June 25 on the substitute budget package that he sent to Congress to make it toe the line on longterm cutbacks in social programs and again today on the tax bill Camp David Invitation a Factor Both allies and adversaries credited the Presidents lobbying with tipping the balance Among the 15 Democrats whom Mr Reagan courted at Camp David last Sunday for example 12 voted with him today caught in the snowballing of the last 48 hours Even though Republican leaders acknowledge they will have difficulty holding their own ranks solid in the future most members were so struck by the Presidents lobbying that they said he would have considerable power to influence votes on other issues if he becomes fully committed More broadly however Mr Reagan has already accomplished far more than most Washington politicans believed possible six months ago in changing the direction of government by cutting back sharply on the growth of social programs while raising military spending Vote Was Expected Philosophically the President had largely carried the day even before today It had been a foregone conclusion that HouseSenate conferees would approve a 37 billion package of budget cuts in programs like Medicaid food stamps public service jobs aid to education child nutrition and even minimum Social Security benefits long regarded as political untouchables On the tax issue the President so effectively seized the initiative that the Democrats incorporated much of his thinking in their own package Both Democrats and Republicans say it will take the country time to digest what Congress has done with his sweeping budget and tax cuts These are two whopping pieces of legislation in terms of what they mean for the country Robert H Michel the House Republican leader said Part of the Great Society program has been repealed and because we have indexed the tax cuts to inflation and thus made them permanent these social programs cant be reinstated except deliverately We cant back our way into them any more on the back of taxbracket creep Mr ONeill and other Democrats tempted to fight one last rearguard fight over minimum Social Security benefits take solace in the belief that Mr Reagan has won too much and that both economically and socially the country will protest Just before the tax vote Mr ONeill warned the House that the Presidents tax cut was so generous that in time it would bring such tight budgeting that politicians would be fighting soon over whether to cut Social Security or defense

IN THE NATION; A Man Of Respect,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/31/opinion/in-the-nation-a-man-of-respect.html,After describing how he ran the California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown of San Francisco was asked at a panel discussion at the National Conference of State Legislatures what he thought was Speaker Tip ONeills biggest problem in managing the House of Representatives Ronald Reagan Mr Brown replied and went on to tell how he had learned during the Reagan Governorship of California what ought now to be crystal clear to the nation  that this President is an able and resourceful political leader whose amiable underplaying reinforces even while it obscures his effectiveness Mr Reagan demonstrated that again here today with a lowkeyed speech to the state legislators As a former Governor he quipped I feel as if I should ask for legislation or veto something in which he expertly replayed his familiar theme of a new federalism to restore the constitutional symmetry between the Federal Government and the states That he said would be the most exciting and noteworthy revolution of our times The legislators meeting here are mostly all for more power and flexibility in state government But they are concerned too about the impact of Federal budget cuts on state services and about administering the new block grants that Mr Reagan called a Federal tool for transferring power back to the state and local level And they know the new federalism also will transfer back to them the political heat for reduced services and possibly the necessity to raise state taxes But if that limited the enthusiasm shown for Mr Reagans message by a body reputed anyway to be more Democratic than Republican the Presidents reception among these practicing politicians was respectful indeed On the morrow of his taxcutting triumph no one here  even the Democrats who lambasted his budget cuts  was underestimating him Now that the first phase of the Reagan Administration  putting his economic recovery program in place has been so spectacularly achieved the President nevertheless has new problems to confront The first of these is whether the recovery program can produce recovery or at least what can plausibly be described as recovery The problem is that Mr Reagan has claimed much for his budget and tax package  not just generally that it would achieve all the essential aims of recovery but specifically that it would drive up the economic growth rate to 45 percent annually after 1982 while reducing inflation to 83 percent in 1982 and 55 in 1984 Meanwhile a balanced budget also is promised for 1984 despite the massive increases in military spending projected for the same period Having persuaded Congress to approve his recovery program Mr Reagan can hardly shift the responsibility if it fails to reach these goals  if for example inflation does not decline as promised But much of the working of his program is now out of his hands Will Americans put their taxreduction gains mostly into savings and investment as Mr Reagan expects Will lowered tax rates inspire such economic growth as to produce the additional revenues  something like 100 billion  that will be needed to pay for the military increases and still balance the budget in 1984 Or will even more severe budget restraints have to be imposed at unpredictable social cost With his own first priority now achieved moreover Mr Reagan can no longer cite it as a reason for the radical right wing of his party to defer its cherished legislative goals  various proposals to ban abortion strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction in such matters as school busing and prayer in the schools and repeal major provisions of the Voting Rights Act A Family Protection Act that would attempt to roll back the last two decades tide of sexual and cultural change also is on the agenda No more emotional issues than these stretching Mr Reagans mandate to its limits if not going beyond them could confront any President The prospect of such battles  and radical Republicans like Jesse Helms of North Carolina are likely to force them  can hardly be a happy one for Mr Reagan On the one hand he could offend his most ardent supporters by not backing them on such issues on the other he could damage the position he has adeptly taken  and virtually all Presidents have sought  as a relatively moderate leader to the right of center but not out of the broad middle course of American politics Either way Mr Reagan would lose some of the clout he will need for his own further priorities like the new federalism But steering a middle course on the rightwing agenda will challenge all his political skills What is now abundantly clear is that those skills are formidable In the wake of his budget and tax victories and with Congress more or less at his feet Mr Reagan is in perhaps the most powerful position of any President since Lyndon Johnson in 1965 But from Mr Johnsons experience Mr Reagan may know that thats not always good for a President it can encourage such overreaching as for another example Franklin Roosevelts courtpacking plan following his reelection landslide in 1936

BROOKLYN PASTOR ASSAILS MORAL MAJORITY'S LEADER,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/01/nyregion/brooklyn-pastor-assails-moral-majority-s-leader.html,A Brooklyn minister who is president of the National Black Pastors Conference has charged the leader of the Moral Majority with perverting the Christian faith The minister the Rev William Augustus Jones of Bethany Baptist Church contended that the Rev Jerry Falwell the Moral Majority leader equated piety with patriotism and failed to distinguish between the flag and the cross Mr Jones made the charges in a letter to Mr Falwell that he made public yesterday Mr Jones said his comments were motivated by Mr Falwells public statements of support for Israels recent attack on Iraqs nuclear reactor and its bombing of Beirut Lebanon Moral Majority based in Virginia is a conservative Christian politicalaction group Mr Falwell is also a Baptist minister Nelson Keener Mr Falwells administrative assistant said yesterday that the television evangelist had no comment on Mr Joness statements because he had not yet received the letter from the Brooklyn pastor 3000 Clergymen in Group The 47yearold Mr Jones heads an organization of 3000 Protestant and Roman Catholic clergymen and the group distributes its literature to about 10000 black ministers across the country Mr Jones is immediate past president of the 500000member Progressive National Baptist Convention The letter from Mr Jones was one of the strongest criticisms of the Moral Majority leader to come from black religious leaders many of whom consider themselves to be as conservative and evangelical as Mr Falwell The Brooklyn pastor whose church is one of the largest in the BedfordStuyvesant area said he had been disturbed by the positions taken by Mr Falwell for some time but indicated that it was his comments about the Israeli attacks on Iraq and Lebanon that prompted the letter This aspect of the letter may also reopen the controversy which emerged a few years ago when American Jewish leaders charged that the attitudes of some black Christians toward Israel were being influenced by the Palestine Liberation Organization which had convinced some black church leaders that Palestinian Arabs were the oppressed minority in the Middle East I Believe in Democracy I sense no tension within you between the demands of God and the demands of government wrote Mr Jones In language which bore the rhetorical flourish of traditional Baptist preaching he said that Mr Falwell proclaimed a theology of tribalism and conveyed an image of God as the mere watchman over Western civilization Predicting that the Virginia clergyman would brand him as unAmerican Mr Jones wrote I believe in democracy because of its roots in Christian realism But Mr Jones said he was antiAmerican at any point of conflict between Christian ethics and social policy Mr Jones argued that by championing the American system of government Mr Falwell had done violence to the faith you claim to espouse Whenever churchmen tailor their theology to fit their sociology the resulting deity is unworthy of worship he concluded A Practice of Microethics We do not recall your presence when we had to contend so mightily for racial justice in America the Brooklyn clergyman wrote but its not too late to enter the struggle We did not hear your voice when vile and vicious racists challenged our right of access to the basics of life Mr Jones said the Moral Majority leader practiced microethics when he opposed abortion but sanctioned military action How saddening it was to read and hear your salutary response to Menachem Begins bombing of the Iraqi nuclear reactor plant the minister wrote The sensitivities and sensibilities of all decent souls shuddered when you expressed profuse delight that those F16s were produced in America

"A NEW SET OF PRINCIPLES, PURSUED IN TOUGH TERMS",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/02/weekinreview/a-new-set-of-principles-pursued-in-tough-terms.html,IT has been a little more than six months since Ronald Reagans celebratory inauguration with its proclamations of heroic dreams and new beginnings The Week in Review asked two political analysts to talk about the images and the realities of those first six months and what they may mean for the future Harry C McPherson Jr a Washington attorney and former special counsel to President Johnson and Ben J Wattenberg a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and chairman of the Coalition for a Democratic Majority formed in 1972 by Democrats opposed to the McGovern movement in their party Excerpts of their discussion with Leslie H Gelb national security correspondent for The New York Times Caroline Rand Herron an editor of The Review and Hedrick Smith Washington correspondent for The Times follow Question Six months ago there was talk of a radical departure in American politics not only because of Ronald Reagans election victory but because of the Republican sweep of the Senate and the Republican gains in the House Have we in fact seen a political sea change or something less or is it too soon to tell Mr McPherson There has been a dramatic change Im not entirely sure how to characterize it The best I could do is say the Reagan conservative view of economics and to some extent of foreign policy has become the ground on which the debate such as the debate is is proceeding Mr Wattenberg I wouldnt disagree But on the question of sea change you never know whats going to happen next month let alone by 1984 It seems to me though that the pieces came into place with that election last year I dont think people at this time in 1933 could have said Oh boy its already happened But maybe they could have said Its in place and if we get lucky and if events move in the right way In that sense there have been some very major economic and cultural changes At the same time the shift has not been so radical as has been portrayed If you can move the nose of the ocean liner one or two degrees in a year and then one or degrees the next year then after four years or eight years youve changed course The Great Society  the mixed economy welfare state whatever you want to call it  is going to survive Its probably gone too far its going to be rationalized its going to be shaved But theyre not  rhetoric not withstanding  going to destroy the good part And they couldnt get away with it if they tried From a Johnsonian Perspective Q Mr McPherson does the change look radical from the perspective of somebody who sat in the Johnson White House Mr McPherson A year ago  two years ago Carter was talking about cutting the budget Carter was cutting off trade with the Soviet Union in response to Afghanistan and doing a number of things that are subsumable under more conservative lines It wasnt perceived as such In that sense the change is not radical But what the Reagan people have done is to state in very tough terms a set of principles by which they believe the country ought to be run which call for dramatic cuts in Federal spending and indeed in Government involvement in a number of areas These are tough guidelines It is a religion with many of them  with David A Stockman director of the Office of Management and Budget and others  a powerful conviction that is being worked out and asserted in almost every way Obviously there are some compromises to win but not tremendous ones Reagan as a Democratic Senator was quoting the other day can say no Mr Wattenberg I would think optimistically that it will be a major shift keeping the best of what has gone before Q So the ocean liners course would take the waste fraud and abuse out of the Great Society and leave the best Mr Wattenberg Things like that that crept into the system yes And then as Mr McPherson said look more toward the private sector I dont think that were going to be sitting here eight years from now and saying Hey the level of government involvement is back down to what it was in 1928 Q Was there a mandate on social issues Mr Wattenberg There was a generalized mandate  lets use the old word although Im not sure its the right word any more against a kind of permissiveness On the other hand on specific issues  abortion comes most readily to mind  I dont think theres any mandate at all to reillegalize abortion If they go down that path theyre going to get into a lot of trouble Q President Reagan has been compared to President Johnson on his handling of the legislative branch Is that fair Mr McPherson One of the things that weve got to bear in mind here is that Reagans opposition is as fragmented and as generally unsure of itself as I have ever seen When Lyndon Johnson was trying to push through the Great Society program the Republicans were a small band outnumbered 2 to 1 And yet that small badly outnumbered group did have notions of what it thought our policy should be  essentially that there ought not to be these large spending programs and interventions into the economy and the society The Democrats at the moment in my judgment dont really know what to stand by Mr Wattenberg says appropriately that many parts of the Great Society will survive But Democrats as a whole and even in particular dont have a sharp sense of what has got to be fought for and preserved at all costs  of what has worked in these big spending programs of how much have education programs done to improve elementary and secondary education Q Are you saying that at least one major effect of the last election was the shattering of the Democratic Party Mr Wattenberg No no The Democratic Party at least since Ive been in Washington since the mid1960s has been fragmented The wings are closer together than they were partly because the left wing has been decimated But those differences still exist Q Are we seeing a realignment of party the emergence of a new center After all Mr Reagan has been enormously successful in warding off the fringes the Democrats simply have not been able to stand up to this beautifully oiled machinery Mr Wattenberg The question is if things start not working well how much good is a welloiled machine Richard Scammon the election analyst likes to say theres nothing wrong with the Democratic Party that 20 percent inflation cant cure He was saying the same thing about the Republicans four years ago and by God 20 percent inflation cured it If nothing much goes wrong you could have such a realignment But if a lot of things go wrong all bets are off Mr McPherson The Democratic Party like a silhouette painting will begin to take its shape by what the Republicans do This is not unlike 1960 John Kennedys campaign was made up mostly of programs that Eisenhower had either vetoed or threatened to  area regional redevelopment manpower training Reagan is not your laidback Republican conservative a nice old fellow who likes to play golf  or a young Democrats image of Eisenhower back in the 50s His Administration has more in mind than merely sitting in neutral On a number of programs it wants to put the car into reverse With that strong activism a shape will come about as Democrats begin to rally around Mr Wattenberg Thats right The only great blunder Reagan has committed so far is on Social Security The other thing is you can make the case that the best thing that could happen to the Democratic Party is that they lose that tax vote Mr McPherson Let it be Reagans program Q You talked Mr Wattenberg about the President setting a new course of one or two degrees that over time will add up Mr Wattenberg Rather the effects The ideology is much more than one or two degrees Q Thats how you start Large ideological doses but small changes in actual direction Mr Wattenberg Thats right Q Mr McPherson you talked about Reagans throwing the car in reverse Thats quite different If Mr Wattenberg is right and a fit and trim Great Society emerges what kind of silhouette can the Democratic Party take Mr McPherson The Administration is seeking and is about to get a tremendous cut in Government spending in each of the next two years and a substantial tax cut Neither one of those things would have been done I believe if Carter had been reelected  not because Carter liked high taxes and not because he wanted to continue high spending but because he I believe despite his differences with Congress and his difficulties in working with Congress was perceived by them and by the country as part of the team that had brought you Great Society He is a mainstream Democrat in that sense Another thing that makes the change more dramatic is that one will see almost no encouragement for further Government intervention into the economy or the society Q But few of the socalled social issues  abortion and school prayer and so on  have surfaced for fullblown debate Mr Wattenberg Some of those I think can get Reagan in a lot of trouble One of the things he has done wrong is the same thing that Carter did wrong  appoint to many of the second third fourth levels of the Administration people from the leftward wing of his leftofcenter party I dont know whether he did it by caprice or design His theory was Well I have kind of moderates in the Cabinet and here are these activist types and we can control them What he learned  or what I learned from watching him  is that you can filter out about 90 percent of it and the other 10 percent is what gets you into trouble and creates that silhouette against which the other party goes Mr Reagan has gone to the polar extreme of his party for some subCabinet appointments If it plays out as an interventionist social policy  people are traditionalminded in this country they want to maintain cultural values but they do not want the Government banging into everything Mr McPherson The social issues will help to break up this unanimity that the President has enjoyed Thats very much why he and Senator Baker majority leader Howard H Baker Jr and others are trying to keep them off the floor You asked about Reagan and Congress and whether he was as good as Lyndon Johnson Reagan never served in Washington until he became President neither had Jimmy Carter But the difference between the two men was enormous right from the start No doubt Reagan learned a good deal from some of Carters boners Ive heard it said that Speaker ONeill House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr thought Carters problems began when he asked everyone to come down to Plains to see him after the election and they did and rode in buses and stayed in old motels Reagan came to Washington immediately and had a series of parties He is a warmer person a more naturally outgoing person in his relations I believe than President Carter was  at least in dealing with politicians Hes got a very good Congressional relations director Hes managed to keep his own party in good humor and to bring a lot of Democrats along with him on many programs simply by these personal touches and by a warm and attractive personality that is well regarded out in the country A Change in the Peoples Temper Q Was it all exaggeration that preelection talk that nothing can stop the lobbies and the special interests Are you saying Mr Reagan pulled together the ungovernable society through the sheer force of an adroit and pleasant personality Mr Wattenberg And a change in the temper of the people The thing that disturbs me most when you say that its irreversible is that youre saying that in a democracy people cannot control their own destiny They can These are flexible systems You can see it as a brokerage synthesis but when the people want a change its more than just having people down for cocktails or going up to the Hill Now what people in the country are saying is that Government has gone far enough That is very different from saying the Government has gone too far Reagan and Stockman want to say Government has gone way too far I find personally the most unattractive thing about Ronald Reagan is this theological antiGovernment belief Its his Government now I think theyre learning that But its going to get him into trouble if he stays on that theology Mr McPherson In three years five years 10 years when private enterprise proves itself unable to deal with the problems of public transportation housing all the infrastructure of public needs schooling  when simply buying the entire conservative agenda has not produced an adequate response to these public needs  we shall have a new agenda of social and economic action calling for government intervention Maybe by that time well know more about it how to do it well than we do right now Mr Wattenberg Whether these people are smart enough to trim their rhetorical sails in the face of reality on these domestic issues remains to be seen I must give you one sensation I have about this whole tax debate In some sense its more Reaganomics than Reagan wanted They were afraid to put in that capital gains thing originally isnt that right because it came in on the Democratic side Mr McPherson The key thing thats got to be borne in mind is that the Republican tax bill is based and the Republican economic program is based on the theory that if you reduce taxes very substantially you will so generate productive energy that we will produce more revenues that it will not be inflationary The Democratic program might as well be based on the same theory We shall see whether it works I think everybody wants to pay fewer taxes If we can have ice cream and not have to shell out for it terrific Mr Wattenberg The Republican program as it evolved got away in large measure from its original theology The original KempRoth did not involve spending cuts It said this dividend would come automatically Mr McPherson A balanced budget for growth Mr Wattenbergand thats not what they ended up with Thats what was called voodoo economics It probably was So there has been just what I was talking about  this moderating procedure of ideology bumping into reality Exactly the same thing has happened in foreign policy They came in and they said all those guys are crazy we got to do this this this and the other thing You sit down with the actual issues and its not a Carter interest or a Reagan interest  there is an American interest Mr McPherson Theres a wonderful Churchill phrase about this  I forget the verb  that once you get into office once you become responsible you are softened by royal jelly  something like that Its a wonderful phrase Mr Wattenberg Now that doesnt say though that if you change the rhetoric you cant start moving things in a different direction In some ways the change has happened even more in foreign policy mostly because of defense spending We were in a very real sense a stronger nation on the morning of Nov 5 1980 than we were in the afternoon of Nov 4  not because we had one more bullet but because it was very clear all around the world that the perception  and I would underscore perception  that America may become the second most powerful nation in the world was wrong And that perception yields a whole new reality to people looking out for the interests of their countries into the 1980s A Shift from the Humane Mr McPherson This is on my perception meter too because I dont have any way of knowing I have the sense of a change from an Administration that talked continually of the ambiguities and the difficulties in any foreign policy decision and that also used the language of internationalism the language of peaceful cooperation That change has gone toward an Administration that puts things much more into a firm we versus they context that in my judgment has made too much of some foreign policy dangers as it perceives them and that does not end its speeches with exhortations to the world to beat swords into plowshares Maybe this is my old Democratic wish for humane rhetoric coming out in the same way that I feel it on the domestic side But if there is a shortcoming in this Administration on the domestic side it is in its belief as Mr Wattenberg said that less government in every case is better and in a certain coldheartedness towards the needs of people who cant do for themselves On the foreign policy side the shortcoming is in precisely the absence of a sense that the world is a terribly dangerous place too dangerous even for magnified force to deal with that there has to be a constant effort to talk with the Soviet Union and any other adversaries to file down the sharp edges of conflict and a constant and reiterated concern for finding means of controlling arms While it may be rhetoric ultimately rhetoric becomes policy and policy becomes reality Unless there are those expressions of concern I fear that we will have only a foreign policy motivated by augmented defense capability and by a determination to find in any kind of antiAmerican or proCuban movement a real threat to our national security Mr Wattenberg Im not sure I agree although I think its true to some degree for the moment What I think is going to happen and what in fact is happening is that they are saying and the fact of it is that a stronger national defense does not solve our problems It only prevents certain kinds of them from getting worse Again it is this fascinating brokerage of ideology against reality They cant change the ideology nearly as much as they want to because of international reality You will see over the years because of increased American strength that they will I hope feel more confident to go into some of that more  I dont know what word  humane maybe rhetoric It may be a little harsh but I for one kind of like the idea of an American President standing up and saying Communism as an idea is over the hill and we are the wave of the future There is still a great war of ideas of values going on in the world In that sense the stance buys Reagan a lot of trouble On the other hand people around the world and in the United States says By God were standing up for what we believe in again and were not just cookie pushers And thats healthy in a foreign policy Q Lets pursue the question of perception A major Reagan criticism of Carter was that there was no coherence in foreign policy Did Reagan reestablish coherence Mr McPherson One of the problems President Carter had with the voters was that he and his Administration conveyed the view that there were almost no circumstances under we would defend any interests with our own troops And while the country is not warmongering it does not want to have quite that message delivered Reagan and this Administration have certainly changed that On the other hand it seems to me that theres a great deal of confusion and theres quite an admixture of voices Coherence probably exists in overall tone but in practice and in individual instances it seems to be lacking Mr Wattenberg There is a rhetorical and ideological coherence What these people believe in first  not that the Carter people didnt believe it but they believe it with much greater intensity  is that freedom is under threat around the world They believe that I think more strongly than anything they believe about supplyside or government or anything else Secondly they believe America is too weak militarily Thirdly they believe that words and rhetoric count for a great deal and we ought to be on the ideological offensive Beneath that you have the normal babble youre going to have in any Administration

WOMEN AND THE SPOILS OF SUCCESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/02/magazine/women-and-the-spoils-of-success.html,Anne Taylor Fleming is a writer based in Los Angeles By Anne Taylor Fleming Whenever I enter a room of people these days I am conscious that it is the women not the men who give me the onceover a quick slightly veiled not entirely ungenerous instant appraisal I look back at these women across the room as if it were empty of men Who are you our eyes say to one another what joys and sorrows have you known what do you do where do you work where do you buy your clothes but mostly mostly we ask each other are you successful do you have what you want do you have what I want Then we meet and talk and our talk is a kind of amiable grilling a sizing up a comparing of jobs hair husbands children childrens schools number of miles run that day the underlying question always is she farther ahead than I I noticed that when the story of Mary E Cunninghams rise and fall at the Bendix Corporation broke last October it was women other successful women who were often quicker than men to ascribe that rise to her blond beauty and to her inferred romance with Bendix chairman William M Agee I heard these women at parties in restaurants wellaccoutered in their gabardine suits and gold chains hint in wellbred innuendoes that Miss Cunningham had used her sexuality to get ahead She was too young they said wistfully too lovely they said enviously not to have Her resignation from Bendix they took as confirmation of their suspicions Swipes at Miss Cunningham might have been expected but not I had hoped from women Yet there is evidence in many other places that on their way to the top some women are not being as gentle with one another as they once hoped they would be I am not talking about the way career women regard women who stay at home Though Phyllis Schlafly would have housewives believe that career women look down on them that is not what I hear Among the professional women I know there is a respect for a kind of dismissive awe of those who stay at home The real tension is not between housewives and professional women but among professional women themselves It was not always so I remember well the excitement my friends and I felt when in the spring of 1972 in our early 20s we read for the first time in a new magazine called Ms about the work of Matina Horner a psychologist and president of Radcliffe College Mrs Horner had done a long study about why bright women fail Her conclusion was We fail we pull back from success  primarily at college age because we fear competition primarily competition with men who might find us unlovely We carried that issue around with us argued about it until it became a manifesto of sorts We would not pull back we would not fail we would succeed whatever the loss in love And in the beginning exhilaration of our shared promise we were sisterly custodial of one anothers dreams It was a special moment shared by many women all over the country It was also brief After moving out into the marketplace and into the decade women became competitive first with men then  and it is this that lingers  with one another a kind of jousting among the tokens So that now a little less than a decade since that article thrilled us so many of the women I know are driven people more afraid of failure than of success more afraid of complacency than of competition more afraid of one anothers successes than of the successes of the men in their lives Even among noshrinkingfromthelabel feminists there is a kind of professional competition A friend of mine who recently attended a conference of women academics told me about the constant jockeying that went on how the homosexual women impugned the feminism of the straight women how some of the straight women in their efforts to be ideologically pure attacked one another I myself am not immune to this intragender elbowing Recently I met a woman whose work I have long admired but before I could compliment her we became engaged in a pesky namedropping badinage about writers and editors we knew and money and this and that all the good feelings lost in that stale male competitiveness we ought to have been able to avoid This competition among us women carries over into our love lives where if the expression can be excused our men pimp for us in a way by boasting of our accomplishments Often a proud husband  genuinely proud I think will boast to me of his wifes work and as lovely as I find the sentiment I always feel faintly sad and soiled as if I somehow had become caught up in a proxy fight Is she happy this wife of yours I want to ask Is she tired a lot Instead of which I sigh and say How nice They also the men with our tacit approval very subtly extol or advertise our sexual accomplishments Look what a wife I have they sort of wink not leeringly but lovingly so that the other men and women get the message White wine in hand we are complicitous in the winks We mean to be good at everything When the womens movement was beginning in earnest I did anticipate some of this competition I did not expect women to be any better any less afflicted with a divisive drive once unleashed than men Or did I Deep down didnt I at least hope that we would remember from where we had come and be tender toward each other as we climbed up I have never believed the differences between men and women to be substantial that is I think we tend to be more alike than not tend to have the same kinds of drives tend to need the same kind of holding But I suppose I imagined that along with the calendar pain our wombs somehow bequeathed us an extra empathy a kind of biologic tenderness If it exists that tenderness is apparently very hard to hold onto in a highpowered professional world where fairly fierce competition seems inevitable a world where a young woman like PulitzerPrizewinnermanquee Janet Cooke of The Washington Post feels the need to invent not only a story for her newspaper but an entire past for herself  a resume of degrees never earned languages never learned jobs never held  when her talent many attest would have been enough Along with the competition a kind of adjunct to it there is something even more worrisome surfacing a repressive reflex in some women I am not speaking of the antiERA antiabortion women but about selfstyled liberal liberated women whose hearts have taken a churlish turn women who in the name of feminism are making reactionary noises For example the women against pornography who recently picketed the Broadway production of Lolita claiming that the portrayal of Nabokovs nymphet would pander to the wayward desires of grown men Pornography is a tough issue for women As a woman it is hard to look at the photographic vivisection of females which is the stock in trade of certain bestselling magazines Not that Lolita is any way comparable to a layout in Hustler for example a magazine I loathe but like the play would not wish to see stopped Is not restraint in the form of censorship to a gender so long restrained a more abhorrent idea finally than the public display of our private parts Granted the debate becomes murkier when one is talking about child pornography If I had children perhaps my shivers at seeing small bodies in sexual postures would be more rageful I cannot be sure But I am sure that calls for censorship by women especially in regard to a hardly hardcore work of fiction like Lolita are by and large disturbing Disturbing too and also indicative of the repressive or reactionary instinct is the spate of autobiographies by women celebrities  Elizabeth Ashley Evelyn Keyes Shelley Winters and most recently Britt Ekland to name a few books more swaggering more macho in a sense than those by their male counterparts On the one hand these women seem bold liberated their bumptious exorcisms of their past lives and lovers a defiance of outward rules and censorship But on the other hand these books are a throwback because they again emphasise sex and sexual performance The men in these books are more often than not treated as sex objects In a recent cover story in Esquire magazine called What Do Women Really Think About Mens Bodies a woman writer somewhat explicitly itemizes male body parts the ideal shape size and feel of each As with the autobiographies I just dont find anything liberated or even witty in this tableturning Kissing and telling and talking about body parts  as women should know better than anyone  is an unpleasant business as demeaning to the teller as the toldupon Do women forget so soon the years of sexual McCarthyism when they were blacklisted if they put out In recent years there has been an increasing honesty about sex  a demystification of the act of sex  which has been wondrous for women But kissing and telling has much more to do with spite than with honesty Would it not in our new freedom be a lovely time for us to keep quiet about certain things On the eve of the last Presidential campaign a woman wrote in The Washington Monthly about the alleged womanizing of Ted Kennedy  behavior she said which indicated that he was immature and therefore of questionable Presidential caliber She was not talking about Chappaquiddick She was talking about casual couplings just barely personal and ultimately discardable encounters which she said give me the creeps I had many arguments with women about the article my position being as in the case of Mary Cunningham that what a man or woman does in private is private that how one takes ones pleasure apparently has little bearing on how one does ones job or how one votes and that if there were ever a group of people who should be deeply opposed to having peoples character judged by what they do or do not do in bed it is women so long so judged My complaint with the piece about Kennedy is the same as my complaint with the womens autobiographies putting sex back at the center of things when the point of liberation was to shift sex out of the limelight The Washington Monthly piece goes on to say that Kennedys success in the sexual area must depend a lot of the time upon a sense of inadequacy in the women involved  a desire to upgrade themselves by association with a powerful male Must that be true and if true so what Havent women earned the right to make fools of themselves if thats what it is earned the right to their supine moments of adequacy or joy if thats what they are without being criticized or pitied by one another The authors assumption that longterm relationships are preferable and more mature than brief encounters is undoubtedly true But can they not also be more venomous more hurtful less transitorily lovely I am not going to make a case for making love without love I cannot imagine a more lonesome habit I am simply troubled by the judgment of character based on sexual behavior just as Im bothered by the call for censorship of pornography by women and the kissandtell books by women examples all I think of a kind of postliberation sanctimony one expects to find among the members of the Moral Majority and the opponents of liberation The most extreme the most curious example of this sanctimony is a recent article in New West magazine the California version of New York magazine in which a selflabeled liberal woman attempts to explain why she a straight woman hates homosexual men to the point she says that she nearly flinches when one walks by She cant quite explain In fact she concludes the article by saying that she doesnt understand why she can look at a homosexual with a depth of hatred so intense I cannot believe it exists in me But in the meantime in an effort to understand she trots out every standard antihomosexual sentiment and theory trying them on as if they were designer jeans I do not mean to suggest that this viewpoint is widely shared by liberal women Among the women I know I hear almost fond if sometimes a tinge catty murmurs about how homosexual men have appropriated our sashay if that makes sense I hear amused if sometimes a tinge mad offthecuff remarks about how there arent any straight men left Underneath that amusement I hear in some womens remarks a kind of inarticulated female guilt about having somehow with our sexual eagerness driven some men away either into the new celibacy or the old impotence or into the arms of other men and a concomitant sadness at not being able to hold certain men this side of the heterosexual line But this is quiet stuff and has nothing to do with the vitriol expressed in New West toward homosexual men vitriol one might expect from a good ol boy or from Jerry Falwell but not from a liberal woman I do not understand the lack  again  of tenderness or of gendermemory just as conversely I do not understand the outpouring of sympathy by many liberated women for the convicted murderer Jean Harris understandable I grant when sympathizing with her love for a man distracted by a younger woman but sympathetic only until she pulled the trigger The tenderness bestowed on Mrs Harris a kind of kneejerk feminist reaction and the tendernesses they withhold from one another indicate that the sympathies of some liberated women are a bit skewed at the moment Sometimes I think that like one of those sleepy Middle Eastern places where so much oil is found one day so that by the next men are driving Mercedes down unpaved paths and women are wearing Western high heels with their native wraps sometimes I think we women lose a lot that is lovely and original in the rush to catch up Is it just naivete or weakkneed nostalgia is nostalgia ever anything else to think we might have been able to hold on to those things There are those who will say my timing is lousy what with the opponents of liberation poised to turn back the clocks I have absolutely no sympathy for the Phyllis Schlaflys and the Ronald Reagans who want to negate the rights women have won in the past decade I have only strained sympathy for what I call the feminist recidivists those who now say to us You cant have it all go home raise children  that is the most important work you can do Retreat is not the point The point is for women to try to be more gentle more generous particularly with one another as we go on I hate the idea that we are simply falling into line beside men aping their pride and their prejudices Damn do we really have to be so obvious

1980 ELECTION GIFTS: $55 MILLION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/04/us/1980-election-gifts-55-million.html,Political action committees representing special interests spent 55 million on House and Senate election campaigns last year the Federal Election Commission reported today Although big business outspent labor giving most of its money to Republicans Democratic candidates received more money than Republicans While big business gave its money to Republicans by a ratio of 2 to 1 labor gave its money to Democrats by more than 12 to 1 Democrats received more than 29 million from political action groups while Republicans received 26 million the report said Altogether 1095 corporate groups donated 19 million to Congressional candidates 490 trade and health groups gave 17 million and 240 labor organizations gave 13 million Contributions by Other Groups In addition 241 nonconnected groups including groups opposing abortion and gun control and such political groups as the National Conservative Political Action Committee donated 5 million to candidates An earlier report showed that in the 1980 elections for the first time House and Senate candidates received more from political action committees than from individual contributors The new report said that in addition to the 55 million given directly to candidates the committees made 14 million in independent expenditures to elect or defeat specific candidates Much of this came from the 40 million raised by the nonconnected groups In addition 2 million was given to Presidential candidates and 32 million more was designated for other purposes such as retiring debts from previous campaigns Altogether political action committees spent 60 million
REAGAN AND CONGRESS: CLOUDS FORECAST; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/05/us/reagan-and-congress-clouds-forecast-news-analysis.html,As Congress passed the final version of the tax bill today and its members left town for a fiveweek recess the lawmakers could look back on an extraordinary session Under the whip hand of a popular and persuasive President Congress took a long step toward reversing the steady expansion of Government services and responsibilities that started with the New Deal almost 50 years ago But while President Reagan has towered over Capitol Hill for the last six months his domination when Congress returns in September is by no means guaranteed The full story of the 97th Congress remains to be written and many important questions political and substantive remain unanswered For example can the President continue his almost magical use of television to generate public support for his policies Or will his powers fade as he falls victim to the conventional Washington wisdom that a leader can go to the well only so often Many political analysts underestimated Mr Reagan earlier this year and thought he had used up his power in the budget fight But the issues coming along now are less dramatic and more detailed than the titantic battles over budgets and taxes and less subject to the crusadelike appeals that the President has used so successfully so far Will Republican moderates particularly those from the Northeast and the Middle West continue their support for the President In response to this question House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr said today I doubt it Even Republican leaders wonder how long their party discipline can last To some lawmakers the interests of the Frost Belt states are already diverging from the thrust of the Reagan economic policy which seems to be encouraging the economic boom in the Sun Belt states that provide the Republican Party with its major source of growth One small sign of uneasiness showed up yesterday when five Republican senators voted against the provisions in the tax bill favoring the oil industry Will Southern Democrats continue to provide the Republicans with their margin of victory in the House Many of these lawmakers represent conservative districts and feel more comfortable with the Republican philosophy But Democratic leaders are still hoping that the tug of party loyalty and the threat of an impending election will redeem some of the rebels as Representative Jim Wright of Texas put it These political questions provide the backdrop for the substantive battles expected this fall And as one Democratic staff member noted today Mr Reagans success could well depend on his choice of issues Potential Problems Listed If as his aides indicated yesterday the President makes major proposals in such areas as crime and narcotics control he could find a receptive audience on Capitol Hill But a number of other issues could force their way to the front of the legislstive agenda causing the Reagan Administration some serious problems Among the potential problems are these  Appropriations While the budget has been basically set for the fiscal year 1982 which begins Oct 1 Congress must still appropriate the money to run the Government and that will give lawmakers a chance to make marginal changes in spending priorities  Block grants Mr Reagan failed to enact a wholesale transfer of Federal power to the state and local level and he has vowed to try again But Congress seems determined to preserve an important role for itself in determining the allocation of Federal funds particularly those earmarked for the poor  Social Security The Presidents proposals to cut benefits have clearly hurt him politically especially among older voters  Clean Air Act Last year voters responded to Mr Reagans call for less Federal regulation but public opinion polls show overwhelming support for preservation of the antipollution law This is one area where solid Republican support is not guaranteed and Senator Robert T Stafford Republican of Vermont has already promised to lead the fight to extend the law  Social issues The President has tried to keep such issues as abortion school busing and school prayer on the back burner so they would not detract from his economic program Rightwing groups are now determined to push these issues forward and they could present Mr Reagan with some embarrassing choices All these questions will be influenced by the answer to the biggest question of all Will the Presidents economic program work Many lawmakers in both parties would agree with Representative Wyche Fowler Jr Democrat of Georgia who sat just off the House floor the other day and said You dont believe it will work I dont believe it and nobody in there believes it When he was asked today to sum up the last six months of Congressional action Mr ONeill said Its all the Presidents now Interest rates are his the deficit is his unemployment is his Its his ball game now
In the Nation; HE WHO LIVES BY THE SWORD,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/07/opinion/in-the-nation-he-who-lives-by-the-sword.html,As chairman of the Agriculture Committee Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina has been a relentless foe of the food stamp program  not because he likes to hear old folks stomachs growl with hunger you understand but to eliminate fraud waste and graft Also as chairman of the Agriculture Committee Mr Helms has no higher priority than Congressional passage once again of the tobacco price support program The height of this priority can be measured by these statistics in Jesse Helmss home state tobacco accounts for 148000 jobs and 16 billion in annual wages But the tobacco program  an economic mainstay in numerous states is in serious political trouble this year The reasons include continuing concern about the health effects of smoking the distaste of many Reagan conservatives for Government intervention in free markets and the budgetcutting atmosphere of Washington Last week The News and Observer of Raleigh NC reported at length on a more tangible problem Jesse Helms Helms has been so vicious and unbending toward social programs and he has so antagonized members of Congress that they want to get back at Helms through the tobacco program Representative Frederick Richmond of New York told Rob Christensen the newspapers Washington correspondent That aint beanbag Mr Richmond is chairman of the House Nutrition Subcommittee as such he was characterized by The News and Observer as having been over the years a key architect of an urbanrural political coalition  that has protected farm interests in the South and food stamp recipients in Northern cities Mr Richmond is not playing a lone hand either Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon the chairman of the Appropriations Committee is sponsoring a farm bill amendment to kill the tobacco program and one of his aides told Mr Christensen pointedly If youre going to be nitpicky on food stamps there is no reason you cant get nitpicky on farm commodities Representative Charles Rose also of North Carolina and chairman of the House Tobacco and Peanut Subcommittee elaborated on that theme In this place anytime you pick up a sword and go after somebodys program you had better be prepared to have that sword come back at you in a way that the wielder of that sword thinks you are the most vulnerable Representative George Miller of California another food stamp supporter put the same idea less elegantly You cant kick the hell out of people and then argue they should be with you The News and Observers report pointed out that Mr Helms also had alienated colleagues by his uncompromising tactics on the Senate floor and by financing some of their opponents from the ample funds of his Congressional Club in North Carolina It might have added that Mr Helms harassed and held up a number of President Reagans State Department appointees after having coerced Mr Reagan into giving him a national television platform at the 1980 Republican Convention The combative North Carolinian now is a leader of the radical right and a prime mover behind such social issues as banning abortion and school busing restoring prayer to the public schools and limiting the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court He also opposes extension of the Voting Rights Act a matter sure to get careful attention from Judiciary Committee Chairman J Strom Thurmond of South Carolina  another state heavily dependent on tobacco Why should not the importance of tobacco price supports to Senators Helms Thurmond and others be a factor in such battles Even President Reagan who in a farewell interview with The Washington Star has finally come out for a 10year renewal of the Voting Rights Act might want to think about that Standing alone and despite the strictures of some nonsmokers the tobacco program is amply justified Its true that a contradiction seems to exist between the Governments health warnings and its aid to tobacco farmers But that aid has little if anything to do with whether people smoke since cutting it off would not cause farmers to stop growing tobacco nor manufacturers to stop making cigarettes Nor are those farmers literally subsidized theirs is a croploan program that costs the taxpayers little or nothing and sometimes actually turns a profit for the Government The price support program does not however stand alone Its part of the interplay of economic interests that dominates politics and as such its fair game for those with other interests Such a narrowly based program in any case is always dependent on tradeoffs compromises and coalition with other interests So those whose votes will be needed for renewal of tobacco price supports have every right and plenty of reason to drive hard bargains on other legislation If the positions were reversed no one would do so more ruthlessly than Jesse Helms who should know that swords cut more ways than one
TAKING CHARGE OF CONGRESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/09/magazine/taking-charge-of-congress.html,Hedrick Smith is The Timess chief Washington correspondent By Hedrick Smith ASPEN LODGE CAMP DAVID MD  It had been raining most of the morning two Sundays ago when President Reagan came out of his personal lodge at the Presidential hideaway in the Catoctin Mountains to greet 15 Democratic Congressmen He had invited them up for lunch and a bit of lobbying As luck would have it the sun came out gleaming over the wet foliage a few minutes before the cars arrived The President in cowboy boots brown slacks and a beige Westernstyle shirt stood on his doorstep to shake hands with each Congressman personally For half an hour they all swapped small talk over coffee orange juice and Bloody Marys on the flagstone patio overlooking a rustic countryclub setting of terraced gardens a swimming pool and nearby woods Then the President walked them to Laurel Lodge where his chefs had set out a buffet of hot dogs hamburgers potato salad chili beans and fresh corn After lunch President Reagan stood up Now for the commercial he smiled launching into a brief pitch for his threeyear taxcut package which was due for a showdown vote in the House of Representatives three days hence He asked for the support of the group most of them still publicly uncommitted If you have any questions the President offered Id be happy to answer them Dave McCurdy a freshman Democrat from Oklahoma wanted to know how the President answered the charge that his was a rich mans tax cut that did less than the Democrats for middleincome America With our third year those people in the 15000to30000 income bracket would actually do better under our bill than under the twoyear Democratic bill Mr Reagan replied There was room for debate on this point but no one contested his answer Bill Hefner a fourthterm Democratic conservative from North Carolina was worried about the thirdyear tax cut adding to the 1984 budget deficit If your economic assumptions are off on interest rates and unemployment and inflation by a couple of points and were locked into the tax cut and youre faced with a 70 to 80 billion deficit he challenged the President what are you going to do Cut defense or Social Security I dont know why everybodys so concerned about the third year when theyll give business tax cuts for seven years and when spending programs go on for years and years and years the President answered Eighty percent of our business is small business and these people need to be able to plan ahead The third year gives predictability If you accept the Democratic plan well never have a third year Ike Skelton of Missouri was concerned that indexing incometax rates to inflation after 1984 would crimp the Pentagon budget Nobodys more concerned about defense than I am the President countered and if there were some kind of international crisis we would correct that with new legislation We could go back in there and fix it Richard Shelby of Alabama liked the indexing idea You can count on me he told the President Im going to do everything I can I believe your package is superior Most of the others remained noncommittal and the President did not press them for a decision It was the classic Reagan charm treatment no hard sell no demand for commitments but a willingness to listen and talk and a flattering sense of access and importance Later on aides would follow up offering the Oklahomans a Presidential pledge to fight any windfallprofits tax on natural gas telling the Georgians the President would oppose large peanut imports in the future President Reagans job was softening them up As they drove away he said to one aide Gee I wonder if we did any good with those fellows today The answer is that after his rousing partisan television speech the next night touching off what House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr called a telephone blitz like this nation has never seen on behalf of the Reagan tax package the President got 12 of the 15 Democratic votes he courted at Camp David that afternoon Ronald Reagan the convinced conservative crusader Reagan the strategist Reagan the battler Reagan the cheerleader Reagan the political charmer has staked his Presidency on his singleminded campaign to enact a sharp turn in the nations economic policy And by his capacity to move Congress to enact the biggest tax and budget cuts in American history he has established his national leadership in a little more than six months and set this nation on a new political course He has achieved far more than political Washington had dreamed possible last January Already his partisans talk gleefully of the Reagan revolution and speak of him as the Republican Franklin Delano Roosevelt President Reagans accomplishment is striking not only because it came in spite of a Democratic majority in the House but also because such political mastery eluded the last three occupants of the White House  Jimmy Carter Gerald R Ford and Richard M Nixon Only four times in this century has a President had such effective sway with Congress according to James L Sundquist a Presidential scholar at Brookings Institution He cites Woodrow Wilson after his first election Franklin D Roosevelt at the start of the New Deal period Lyndon B Johnson in his Great Society heyday and now Mr Reagan The system works well at only one time  right after a landslide election Mr Sundquist observed This is one of those brief periods in our history when a President comes riding a great tide of personal popularity From the present vantage point it is hard to step back into the dark mood of pessimism last year and recall the flow of worried essays about the breakdown of government and the weakness of the American Presidency Former President Ford epitomized the concern in an essay in Time magazine We have not an imperial Presidency he said but an imperiled Presidency The belief shared by many was that American Presidents had become institutionally crippled not only because of the impossiblity of managing the sprawling Federal establishment but more important because of the unwieldy inertia of Congress Presidential programs got lost defeated or mired down because it was said Congressional leaders had lost their clout power had become dispersed and disorganized among a labyrinth of committees party discipline had broken down legislation was snarled in the incessant crossfire of specialinterest lobbying and singleissue politics All these prevented the formaton of an effective governing alliance between the White House and Capitol Hill Mr Reagan has achieved a dramatic turnaround As a chief executive he has been bold and purposeful firm about his major objectives but flexible at the margins As a newly elected public figure he has enjoyed warm popularity and a successful honeymoon Sheer luck has helped him His Presidency was born in the special uspurge of national emotion that greeted the release of the American hostages from Iran It got another boost from the successful Columbia space shuttle Public sympathy and support rose further in response to his gallant geniality after the attempt on his life an event that he turned to political advantage with a dramatic appearance before Congress Further Mr Reagan has been spared any major foreign crisis so far and has benefited from a global oversupply of oil that has helped some to ease the fires of inflation This climate has helped him forge an effective coalition of Southern conservative Democrats added to solid partyline Republican support In dealing with Congress hes closer to Lyndon Johnson than anyone else observed Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr Johnson had a feel for the way the legislature works He was a product of the legislature Reagan understands it instinctively He understands legislative politics but he doesnt try to bull his way through the way Johnson did Carter never understood the legislative process Ford understood but he couldnt do anything about it Nixon never paid enough attention to it to be successful For giveandtake with Congress Reagan is the best Ive ever served with Grudgingly experienced Democrats tip their hats too though they contend that Mr Reagans success is temporary Overall on his dealing with Congress Id give him a Bplus conceded Representative Morris K Udall the liberal Arizona Democrat Hes been good He still doesnt know Congress all that well Hes got some good people who do But I dont see this as a permanent coalition for Reagan I think disillusionment is going to set in this fall To the electorate he has come across as Mr Nice Guy with the Eisenhower grin and the infectious optimism of the boy next door But on Capitol Hill they have discovered his political grit and competitive streak He may have a reputation for 830to530 office hours but when the chips are down he has been willing to pull up his sleeves As a political chairman of the board he delegates wide latitude to his lieutenants and leaves the details to others but the Administrations programs indisputably bear his philosophical hallmarks Comments about his age have evaporated Nor do other politicians disparage him as a former actor Many express amazed respect for his deft salesmanship and his toughness on behalf of his most cherished political goals THE WHITE HOUSE OVAL OFFICE  That private Reagan toughness disguised by his disarming geniality came out on the warm humid morning of June 18 when the President confronted a pivotal and revealing moment of decision Among a handful of close aides he was being pressed hard by David A Stockman his tireless and combative budget director to throw down the gauntlet yet again to the Democratic leaders of the House  to reject the budget cuts developed by Democraticcontrolled committees and to send up a second package of his own The committees have broken faith with the first budget resolution Stockman argued What they have done is sadly deficient It could jeopardize your entire economic program We have to make a major fight to restore the provisions in your first budget Others cautioned the President about the perils of treading on Congressional prerogatives We just have to understand were running a very great risk here warned James A Baker 3d the White House Chief of Staff If we throw down the challenge and lose it will sap our momentum It will have very damaging effects David R Gergen the lanky communications director pointed out that this time unlike the first budget fight the White House would have precious little time to generate public support But Stockman was insistent He sensed that the President felt sandbagged by the Democratic leaders going through the motions of bowing to his earlier budget victory and he played to Mr Reagans instinct to show them now that they could not get away with partial measures Some of the Democratic cuts Stockman asserted were phony because they left the eligibility and entitlement rules of many big Federal programs largely unchanged meaning that these programs would grow automatically in future years If you cant get those entitlement cuts Stockman declared bluntly it will add to the deficits in 1983 and 1984 If you want to balance the budget in 84 you cant live with the cuts theyve made That hooked the President who asked to look at Stockmans figures Well if thats the case he declared working his jaw with irritation we cant accept it This was the call to battle The White House swung into action By noon the President was going over his options at a hastily assembled luncheon of his staff Republican leaders and four of the dissident conservative Southern Democrats who had broken party ranks and given him vital support for his first budget victory These boll weevil Democrats now formed a crucial component of his working coalition though some of them were a little goosey about a new budget fight as one White House official later recalled But the Presidents legislative advisers were telling him that while Stockmans complete budget substitute would not make it a more modest partial package could pass the House To prepare the way the President put in a call the next morning to Speaker ONeill the New Deal Democrat with whom Mr Reagan has both kidded and clashed Only the other day they had had a public spat over Mr ONeills implication that the President was insensitive to the poor Since then they had made up but as it now turned out their new telephone talk would fire the Presidents mood for combat I want a chance to send some substitute language up there on the budget the President told the Speaker The House has worked hard and done a good job but it hasnt gone far enough and I  Aides saw irritation and frustration flash across the Presidents face as the Speaker interrupted to remind the President that the Congressional committees had completed their work Did you ever hear of the separation of powers Mr ONeill asked The Congress of the United States will be responsible for spending Youre not supposed to be writing legislation I know the Constitution Mr Reagan broke in testily Can you be specific about what youre going to send up the Speaker pressed on You always talk to me in vague generalities I dont want to see the Republicans trying to shove something through without full consideration Oh cmon you mean the Democrats tweaked the President I was a Democrat myself longer than Ive been a Republican and the Democrats have been known to make a few power plays The Speaker backed off OK well have a look Ill get back to you he said adding Have your people talk to Jones and Bolling  the Democratic chairmen of the Budget and Rules Committees The Presidents dander was up He became further irritated aides later said when ONeill did not get back to him though that may have been a misunderstanding At any rate the die was cast and any thought of compromise on either budget or tax cuts had now been dashed Mr Reagan was eager for confrontation and ready to work hard to beat the Democrats PENTHOUSE SUITE CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL Six days later on the eve of the crucial budget vote the President arrived in his Los Angeles hotel suite and quickly doffed coat and tie after an allday crosscountry trip stumping for his economic program at the National Jaycee convention By now the budget battle turned on an intricate parliamentary fight on the rules and Speaker ONeill sensing favorable terrain was anticipating a Democratic victory The President was relaxing over vodka and orange juice with his chief personal aide Michael K Deaver when the White House phoned to report a new insurrection among conservative Democrats Stockman and Max L Friedersdorf the smoothly efficient chief of Congressional liaison at the White House urged that the President telephone some undecided Congressmen Mr Reagans voice was already hoarse and after the long trip from Washington Deaver was unsure whether the President was up for more politicking that night Its pretty close back there Deaver reported and if you made a few calls that could swing it Get them on the phone the President offered quickly It may be as many as 20 calls Deaver said testing him What time is it back East About 9 oclock Deaver said Well wed better get going The President sat down in slacks and an opennecked shirt at a little desk with a lamp and notepad while the White House switchboard tracked down 16 members of the House at dinner parties in restaurants or at home For two and a half hours he stalked votes Gee I know its late back there and Im sorry to bother you Mr Reagan would begin I hear youre still on the fence If I could answer any questions Id be happy to I know youve been under a lot of pressure But I hope you can find your way clear to supporting us tomorrow If someone had a specific problem hed make a note and say Ill get the fellows back to you on that one He caught John Breaux an influential sixthterm Louisiana Democrat at a dinner party The President comes across on the phone as smooth as he does on TV Breaux recalled Hes a generalist doesnt talk details But he knows enough of the big picture Its a soft sell and its very effective The next day the President sweated out each vote pestering Deaver for results or querying why there were so many procedural ballots before the House actually got to his budget package But when he won what turned out to be the toughest fight so far he told reporters Ive never felt better in these last five months than I feel in this particular moment Whether Reagans economic policy will cure the nations ills or will backfire economically and polarize Americans politically is a critical question But for the time being he has substantially altered the political chemistry in Washington He has projected genial optimism to the public and has somehow injected the Government with a sense of motion How has he done it It has taken much more than artful appeals to the public over the head of Congress and clever Presidential stroking of the members The Presidents political success has ridden the crest of a new national mood on what for him is an ideal issue It has turned on his own clear sense of priorities and the intellectual and political initiative that the Republicans quickly seized from the Democrats It has profited from the wellorchestrated hardball politics that Reagan partisans have played out in the country and it has depended on the superb political team now assembled in the Reagan Administration In the amalgam of causes the most fundamental is that President Reagan picked as his No 1 priority the issue on which there is currently a strong consensus  the backlash against big Government and the pocketbook squeeze that everyone complains about Last Novembers election represented a frustrated rejection of the ins and their old economic policies The Reaganites contend that their man won a clear mandate for his package of budget and tax cuts In fact the message may have been less precise less a mandate than an urge for change and a willingness to give a new President tolerance to experiment Shrewdly President Reagan and his lieutenants have fed that sentiment with constant preachments against politicsasusual President Reagan immediately conveyed a sense of selfconfidence and direction that the country had been missing His own clarity of purpose gave unity and thrust to his Administration Politically he profited by the contrast with his predecessor The Reagan team deliberately avoided Jimmy Carters tactic of inundating Congress at the start of his term wanting not to confuse the public with a profusion of complicated proposals The priority was clear Mr Reagan concentrated his fire on the economic package and pushed foreign policy and controversial social issues to the background Moreover the Presidents political brain trust counselor Edwin Meese 3d Baker Deaver Stockman Gergen and Richard B Wirthlin the pollster understood that Mr Reagans opportunity to achieve real change was perilously short and that it was important to move fast Normally said Gergen a new President has an open window for just so long and it shuts very quickly in terms of public interest and support With the Administrations first 50 billion budgetcut package the Reagan team captured political momentum before Congressional Democrats fully appreciated what was happening The Democratic leaders belatedly responding to the publics conservative fiscal mood scrambled in disarray to catch up By then Mr Reagan got a second lease from the public with his graceful handling of the attempt on his life Rather than daring to oppose him outright the Democrats resisted at the margins Their budget and tax proposals ultimately became variations on basic Reagan themes Knowing that success depended on Congressional support the President and his entourage had began courting good will among the Washington establishment well before taking office On Inauguration Day it was from Capitol Hill that the President took his first official actions and soon after he did he invited senior House Democrats to the Oval Office for a chat Both were symbolic gestures warmly appreciated in Congress He has since spent roughly 20 percent of his time on Congressional relations Before each major vote he has met with pivotal members of both parties either alone or in such small groups that each felt the flattery of his attention Many left with a gift of Presidential cuff links or seats in the Presidential box at the Kennedy Center When the going got tougher the fencesitters got juicier sweeteners  White House backing for a sugarprice support more funds for Medicaid Conrail energy subsidies for the poor or a slowdown on mandatory conversion to coal for industrial boilers in oilproducing states John Breaux of Louisiana voted with the President on the budget after getting a pledge on sugarprice supports I went with the best deal he said insisting that his vote could not be bought I was rented he quipped and later voted against the President on the tax cut The Reagan strategists fastened on the unique vehicle of budget reconciliation to force the legislature to dance to a disciplined drumbeat The process was set up in 1974 to provide a central mechanism to force Congressional committees to abide by some overall spending ceilings and central guidance It had been used only once before modestly in 1980 but Stockman saw it as a vital lever for the Reagan program Reconciliation was the actionfiring mechanism that overcame the natural inertia of Congress Stockman said Several times the President has used the leverage of his office and his early popularity to go over the heads of Congress to sell his program with simple evocative language The acme was his dramatic reappearance before Congress on April 28 after the shooting incident Dan Rostenkowski the veteran Democratic leader in the tax battle conceded the point My problem is that the President can gear up his army with just one television appearance Rostenkowski moaned before the final showdown Thats fighting the Army Navy Marines and Air Force Among Southern Democrats the Presidents public following had a noticeable effect Reagan won 72 percent of the vote in my district and hes a lot more popular there now than he was on Election Day remarked Kent Hance a WestTexas Democrat who cosponsored the Reagan tax program Its mighty tough to go against a popular President in a district like mine In contrast to the Carter White House Mr Reagans political team is widely praised as wellorganized purposeful attentive and usually ahead of the Democrats on tactics As a former Congressman Dave Stockman brought to the budget maneuvering an intimate understanding of both the budget and the Congressional process As point man on the budget he not only overwhelmed opponents with expertise but absorbed criticism himself sparing the President Friedersdorf who previously served as President Fords Congressional liaison is known as one of Washingtons most experienced best organized and quietly effective experts on Congress Max knows the Hill said one legislative aide He feels its rhythym People on the Hill trust him When a member of Congress calls Max knows whether its something the President needs to know the urgency of it the validity of it He listens and he communicates His style is lowkey and unflappable The esteem with which he is held both in the White House and on the Hill makes him the vital link Jim Baker an experienced political strategist has shepherded the whole operation and teamed up well with Treasury Secretary Donald T Regan on tax legislation On the Hill Senator Baker and Representative Robert H Michel the minority whip are given high marks for keeping Republicans in line and stepping in with advice to save the Administration from legislative pitfalls One of the least visible weapons in the Reagan arsenal is the political operation masterminded by Lyn Nofziger the puckish rumpled California conservative As White House political director he carried the budget and tax battles into the home districts of wavering members of Congress softening them up for Presidential persuasion From 15 years of crisscrossing America in the cause of conservatism Ronald Reagan has developed the most potent network of political activists in the nation Thats why Reagan is not a man to trifle with asserts Lee Atwater the South Carolina political organizer who is Nofzigers deputy Hes got more people committed to him than anyone else Theyre ready able and willing to go into action at a moments notice and technically theyre well organized To generate maximum pressure during the first budget fight last April Nofziger ran a political blitz in 51 swing Congressional districts 45 of them in the South His operation tapped wealthy organized groups like the Republican National Committee the National Conservative Political Action Committee the Moral Majority business politicalaction committees linked with the national Chamber of Commerce National Association of Manufacturers the American Medical Association local civic clubs and scores of other groups interested in cutting Federal spending and taxes They were spearheaded by Administration and Congressional speakers and by a team of workers using direct mail and manning phone banks The premise of the operation is that political reforms and the impact of media have made it so that a Congressmans behavior on legislation can be affected more by pressure from within his own district than by lobbying here in Washington Atwater explainsThe way we operate within 48 hours any Congressman will know he has had a major strike in his district All of a sudden Vice President Bush is in your district Congressman Jack Kemp is in your district 10 of your top contributors are calling you the head of the local AMA the head of the local realtors group local officials Twenty letters come in Within 48 hours youre hit by paid media free media mail phone calls all asking you to support the President More potent perhaps is the implication that the big politicalaction money will oppose incumbents who line up against the Reagan program A House Republican task force under Representative Stan Parris of Virginia crosschecked people who had contributed more than 100 both to the Reagan Presidential campaign and to local Democratic Congressmans campaigns Computerized letters went out to get these proReagan contributors to pressure their Representatives to go along with the President The key to these Congressional victories is muscle says Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada a close friend of the President People here feel that most of the public is with the President One of the greatest things that was done was to go through the lists of big contributors and get them to lean on swing people If a key contributor calls and says Go along with this it has an effect The reach of the White House political operation has astonished some fencesitters Representative Ronnie G Flippo of Alabama was reportedly turned around by a call from Governor Forrest H James Jr a proReagan Democrat Representative Daniel A Mica a Democrat representing the Palm Beach area was leaned on by his former campaign manager I had a call too from a local mayor a Democrat very active in the party and associated with liberal causes and he asked me to vote with the President Mica said It surprised me that they would get to him Sometimes ardent Reaganites have become overly zealous Mica and Bill Nelson another swing Florida Democrat complained after a lobbyist for the National Taxpayers Union told them that unless they committed themselves to the second Reagan budget package his group would run radio ads against them in their home districts Mica was infuriated when the lobbyist played for him a tape asserting that Speaker ONeill was enlisting Mica to destroy the Presidents program not yet unveiled Nelson protested directly to the President at a White House meeting and Mr Reagan shook his head in disbelief Thats about the lousiest tactic I ever heard of he said We dont condone it We dont have anything to do with it White House aides advised the National Taxpayers Union that the maneuver was backfiring and it was dropped Reagan aides believe that one reason the President has fared well thus far is his effort to understand the predicament of the boll weevil Democrats At a breakfast on June 4 Lousianas John Breaux voiced a common fear that the boll weevils were getting cut off from their own party and then might have to face President Reagan campaigning against them in 1982 I dont want to end up like a turkey with an eagle the nickname of big Republican contributors chasing me Breaux said Instantly the President gave a widely quoted response I could not oppose someone who supported my principles he said I could not look myself in the mirror if I campaigned against you Even though the President left himself the loophole of fundraising in their states and stopped short of offering them immunity from Republican opposition one aide said You could sense a real sigh of relief around that table The Reagan camp does keep score among friends and foes meting out rewards and punishment Because of a campaign pledge and good Republican backing in Michigan last November Mr Reagan went along with import relief for the automobile industry and United Automobile Workers Union through seeking reduction of Japanese car exports But in June he lifted import quotas on shoes from Taiwan and South Korea a move that hit the American shoe industry in Massachusetts home territory of Speaker ONeill and Senator Edward M Kennedy Even more impressive has been the near perfect partyline support among 53 Republican Senators and 191 House members The Democrats have 243 in the House 46 in the Senate and there is one Senate independent Neither Eisenhower Nixon nor Ford achieved close to that kind of party loyalty and discipline Indeed some scholars say that the Republican partyline votes this spring have not been equaled since the hardheaded rule of Joseph G Cannon the Republican Speaker back in 1910 The Congressional leaders Howard Baker in the Senate and Bob Michel in the House have been effective in persuading Republicans of their own stake in President Reagans success when it comes time for their reelection One impetus is that many newly elected Republican conservatives feel special allegiance to Mr Reagan because they rode his coattails to office Occasionally Michel has gone to House Republicans to call for a partyline vote with the admonition that there will be retribution against dissidents Among the first and secondterm House Republicans partisan spirit is especially strong The freshman and sophomore classes make up almost half of our 191 members observes Max Friedersdorf They are extremely aggressive to make their mark They want to win and they are fully aware that they have power in unity They have an influence on the more senior Republicans who have developed a minority complex over the years and have been inclined to go off on their own They sense that theyre getting close to having a majority in the House This makes for an esprit that Ive never seen before On the budget votes holding two dozen Northeastern and Midddle Western moderate and liberal Republicans led by Carl D Pursell of Michigan and Bill Green of New York was a delicate task Like other Republicans they chafed over the attention the White House lavished on renegade Southern Democrats Nofzigers office has tried to meet their desires for political appointments Stockman and Michel met repeatedly with this group to adjust the budget cuts to appease them Ultimately the Frost Belt Republicans won increases in
funds for Amtrak Conrail energy subsidies to the poor the national endowments for arts and the humanities nurses training and a less stringent cap on the growth of Medicaid spending When youre dealing with the entire budget there are things along the margin that give way to making the overall goal Stockman later explained We were willing to make adjustments at the margin President Reagan leaves the horse trading to others and stays out of the details of legislative maneuvering His generalized approach has caused Speaker ONeill to quip that Mr Reagan does not know very much about the specifics of his own legislation Emerging from one meeting with the Presdent in early June ONeill told reporters that when the Democratic leadership would try out variations on the Presidents tax program Mr Reagan would look at Ed Meese his counselor for a lead on how to reply a charge denied at the White House The Presidents really not as well posted on the specifics and on the machinery as Johnson Nixon or Ford who used to be more intimately involved in how it all worked observed Michel the House Republican leader Sometimes I think My gosh he ought to be better posted Where are his briefing papers But Reagans not going to be hassled over details Hes chairman of the board Anyway you get the feeling that hes just so intent that hes going to get along with Congress and get as much out of Congress as he can Max Friedersdorf credits the Presidents success so far to his amiable manner his willingness to listen and his investment of time Congressional relations is not just a haphazard occasional thing with the President he says Its constant Hes very willing to take advice not only from the White House staff but the Congressional leaders Plus hes sold on his program and he transmits that enthusiasm in his contacts Two terms as Governor of California gave Mr Reagan solid awareness of the need for legislative compromise for during most of his tenure in Sacramento Democrats controlled both houses of the State Legislature He emerged with a more moderate record than his campaign rhetoric had foreshadowed His method Ed Meese said was to stand firm on principle but be flexible enough to negotiate within the framework of principle Although he does compromise Mr Reagan quickly communicates the limits of his flexibility both to his own staff and to other politicians Governor Hugh Carey of New York ran into the hard side of President Reagan during one session that the President held with state Governors back on Feb 23 Carey criticized the Reagan tax plan of 10 percent personal taxrate reductions for each of the next three years on grounds that it would fuel inflation He urged Mr Reagan to reconsider the plan You could hear a pin drop in that room said Richard S Williamson the White House aide for intergovernmental affairs It was a very forceful challenge They all wanted to see if Reagan was for real While Carey was talking Reagan got red in the face He glared at Carey and then burst out What youve been talking about businessasusual has given us an economic mess doubledigit inflation doubledigit interest rates high unemployment Lets try something new Then he cited past examples of regenerative tax cuts and ended Id say with vehemence that I support 101010  Four months later at a session with Senate Democrats Reagan argued that tax cuts under President Kennedy had not only stimulated the economy but also generated more tax revenues I have come to learn over the years that government doesnt tax to get the money it needs the President said government spends all the taxes it gets In public the President enjoys the cutandthrust of partisan debate He seems to relish political hyperbole Visiting Capitol Hill in midJuly he taunted the Democrats for what he called a makebelieve tax cut  a wolf in sheeps clothing because it was not as big as his On national television he mocked the claim of the Democrats that they were giving a better break to middleincome taxpayers with their twoyear bill By comparison with his threeyear plan the President gibed the Democratic bill was better if you intend to live for only two more years Jousting with Speaker ONeill has occasionally gotten under the Presidents skin but he is quick to patch things up As ONeill has said they put aside their disagreements at 6 PM and mix cordially They can disagree and still be friends said one White House official I think that sets an atmosphere for cooperation and communication It shows junior members of Congress that some of this is political posturing and theres no real animosity As a decision maker the President prefers to have his inner circle thrash out the alternatives and come to him with a consensus recommendation if possible Ive seen members of Congress and his staff go at it hard with the President there Senator Baker reported He listens Theres almost a sense of pleasure and amusement as he watches different people argue the point He lets it go on to a certain point and he makes a decision The implication I draw is that this man is not afraid of controversy He doesnt feel the need to placate anybody Occasionally President Reagan has been ill served by merely ratifying the consensus brought to him by advisers and hurt by his own lack of independent Washington experience For example the White House failed badly in anticipating the Senates reaction to the Administrations proposed cuts in Social Security Stockman and Richard S Schweiker Secretary of Health and Human Services were anxious to send a proposal to Congress on this issue before a House subcommittee began hearings The Presidents political aides were not paying close attention to the controversial dynamite in this package They acquiesced and the President gave the goahead Immediately the Senate voted down the idea 96 to 0 Senate Republicans were outraged at not having been consulted in advance and the Administration had to retreat It is still in trouble on this issue That episode and a few others illustrate that in spite of the Reagan victories and in spite of the Presidents solicitude toward Congress institutional differences remain strong and many problems lie ahead for the White House Budget and tax cutting have been the most favorable issues for the President With the economic battle essentially concluded the legislative agenda will never again be so tidy so focused or so favorable The singlemindedness of the Administration and Congress will dissipate Legislative momentum will be harder to maintain Centrifugal political forces will begin to wear away at the winning coalition the Reagan forces have constructed on the economic issues in Congress Liberal and conservative Republicans have already split on such emotional and controversial issues as busing Similar rifts are likely over abortion school prayer voting rights and other social issues Out in the country the supporting political network will also feel the strains Many business conservatives are likely to part company with the Moral Majority on social issues Boll weevil Democrats who have sided with Mr Reagan on economics already acknowledge that on social issues they differ Other divisions lie ahead on foreign policy Majorities in both houses have already signed a letter opposing the Administrations planned sale of advanced electronic reconnaissance planes to Saudi Arabia Foreign relations committees in both houses have made further military aid to El Salvador conditional on significant progress on human rights in that country They have also resisted the Presidents appeal for a 350 million contingency fund for responding to foreign crises If there was any mandate it was pretty well confined to economics commented Thomas E Cronin a Presidential scholar at Colorado College But once they get into the social issues like abortion or even policy issues like the MX missile hes going to have trouble keeping his own party together This is the only period this six months that hes going to be able to have his own way The Reagan team has kept the other issues off the agenda and thats how theyve been so impressive The top White House expert on Congress Max Friedersdorf essentially agrees I think its too early to say we have a working coalition for the President he says Its potentially there But weve only dealt with two issues the budget and tax cuts On dozens of other issues foreign policy the environment social issues  we just havent tested the water yet,,

THREE HIGH COURT JUSTICES SPEAK TO LAWYERS BUT SHUN CONTROVERSY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/10/us/three-high-court-justices-speak-to-lawyers-but-shun-controversy.html,Speeches by three Supreme Court Justices today and last night have been perhaps the biggest attractions of the potpourri of programs for the more than 8000 American Bar Association lawyers convening at the Hilton Hotel here They have ranked above even the gustatory and musical delights of nearby Bourbon Street But the pronouncements of Justices John Paul Stevens and Lewis F Powell Jr touching on hotly contested constitutional and political issues have been so Delphic that they have left some of those in their audiences asking what they were really getting at Justice Byron R White who also spoke today was assigned a topic that attracted little interest even in a convention of lawyers It was how to reduce court costs and delays But even he felt constrained to avoid direct statements Direct Statements Avoided This it seems is what judicial dignity and decorum demand When they write opinions for the Supreme Court the Justices lay down the law of the land But when they venture outside the walls of their marble palace to give speeches as the three Justices did this weekend they seem to speak in riddles Justice Stevenss remarks at a wellattended prayer breakfast today seemed to many to bear on an issue he never mentioned That is the push in Congress by members of the religious right and others to strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over cases involving school prayer  If there is any fixed star in our Constitutional constellation it is that no official high or petty can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics nationalism religion or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein  Justice Stevens said at one point He was quoting the majority opinion of Justice Robert H Jackson in the 1943 decision that struck down a West Virginia law requiring teachers and pupils to take part in flag salute ceremonies Voluntary Salutes Laudable Justice Stevens said that symbolic gestures of patriotism and religious faith such as saluting the flag and voluntary prayer and reflection are good things on appropriate occasions such as a prayer breakfast But he stressed the distinction between a compelled ritual and voluntary participation in a common exercise  The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts  Justice Stevens declared Later he was asked whether he was sending a message to the Moral Majority and other forces that are attacking Court rulings on school prayer and lining up formidable support behind legislation to remove from the Court its power to enforce those rulings It speaks for itself he said Another Cautious Justice Justice Powell was if anything more cautious He touched last night on President Reagans choice of Judge Sandra Day OConnor of Arizona to replace Potter Stewart who retired from the court last month As the confirmation process has not been completed it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the new nominee other than to repeat the obvious Judge OConnor enjoys a fine reputation Justice Powell began She would be welcomed warmly by the court He went on to review 190 years of Supreme Court history on his way to the conclusion that the first duty of a Justice is to remove from his or her judicial work his or her own moral philosophical political and religious beliefs Was Justice Powell gently rebuffing antiabortion groups that have attacked the Administration for failing to choose a nominee who would swear to overrule that decision He did not say Justice Powell did poke gentle fun at the speculation that others on the court five of whom are between 72 and 75 years old might retire soon Im happy to report that everything is fine at the United States Supreme Court Justice Powell said He said that questions are often put to the Justices chiefly by people in the Reagan Administration who wistfully ask tell me about the health of the Justices As a matter of fact the nine old men  theres only eight of us now  several of us have bought new suits and there is even a rumor that some changes may be made in the Courts plumbing he said

FETAL TREATMENT VS. ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/14/style/fetal-treatment-vs-abortion.html,The abortion debate may take a poignant twist as medical advances increasingly enable doctors to treat defective human fetuses still in the womb a medical journal says In deciding whether to abort a defective but treatable fetus doctors will have to struggle with the fact that the fetus could also be a patient This dilemma is one of the ethical problems anticipated by Dr John C Fletcher in an editorial in the Aug 14 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association Dr Fletcher said that ethical dilemmas aside new treatments for fetuses present the possibility of eliminating or reducing a lifetime of physical suffering and economic burdens The editorial accompanies an article detailing the ways including delicate surgery in which physicians can now treat fetuses Dr Fletcher writes that difficult moral questions may arise in regard to borderline fetuses those for whom doctors and parents must choose between life and death Dr Fletcher assistant for bioethics in the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health writes that in practice highrisk fetuses old enough to survive birth are now usually given the benefit of the doubt when problems arise Maternal and family concerns however get priority over the fetuss life if doctors determine it is not yet viable But in these borderline situations improvements in fetal therapy could establish stronger grounds for protecting the fetus thus conflicting with parents rights to decide on an abortion Dr Fletcher writes He suggests that when such conflicts arise a second physician may someday act as advocate for the fetus A really interesting problem in the long run Dr Fletcher said in a telephone interview is if a disease was perfectly treatable and yet the mother didnt want to undergo therapy whether society would be interested in coercing her to go to term Based on the values that have developed in society so far that would not be the case Dr Fletcher says doctors can escape the dilemma for the time being by not considering the fetus a patient until it is born and separate from the mother However he said that advances in socalled testtube births may force physicians to reevaluate the notion that separateness from the mother is the most important morally relevant difference between the fetus and the newborn The criteria of separateness is weaker as a morally relevant category than it used to be Dr Fletcher said noting that infants born prematurely and weighing less than a pound can be saved through medical treatment
PART 2 OF REAGAN AGENDA SOMEHOW LOOKS FAMILIAR,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/16/weekinreview/part-2-of-reagan-agenda-somehow-looks-familiar.html,For months now Ronald Reagans White House has had its mind fastened on the Presidents economic program In fact Mr Reagans ceremonial signing of his package of budget cuts and tax cuts was billed as the occasion for a longawaited shift of focus Such may have been the plan But his signature had scarcely dried before Mr Reagans aides were conceding that their economic challenges have just begun They described themselves as more skeptical than Mr Reagan about economic recovery in 82 and doubtful that meeting the promise of balancing the budget by 84 can be met without great difficulty Its very clear that our No 1 imperative is going to continue to be economic recovery a senior official said Rather than drop these issues we now have to work hard translating the legislative gains we made into real gains in the pocketbooks of Americans Shortly after the President returns to Washington in early September several pressing budgetary matters will have to be decided The first is Social Security costs Although the Administration had to abandon its original proposals including a cutback in benefits for those who retire early the notions are expected reemerge in different form Were going to have to be realistic this time said a White House official though he noted that there is little Congressional sentiment for such trims Meanwhile Mr Reagan promised during last months horsetrading on his tax cuts to come up with a way to protect perhaps 300000 Social Security recipients whose minimum benfits are due to expire in March Then there is defense Defense Secretary Caspar W Weinbergers proposals to achieve strategic superiority carry a 15 billion price tag White House planners say cuts will have to be made in other defense items such as procurement and the use of military bases According to his aides Mr Reagan plans to use the economic troubles to underscore two messages The first is to encourage greater use of private sector contributions for job training and the arts where Federal support has been cut back The second pressed by Administration economists as the only way to achieve the productivity gains necessary to spur noninflationary growth is to encourage the public to use the tax cuts to save and invest rather than purchase consumer goods Since both the Social Security and the military steps are likely to be politically difficult Administration aides are already advising Mr Reagan to husband his political strength Inevitably that means the President will pressed to continue to refrain from a visible role in volatile social issues such as busing abortion and school prayer  the very issues that his increasingly impatient conservative constituency has been hoping he will turn to Were still discussing just how the President is going to deal with these issues said a key adviser Certainly hes going to be firm and supportive in stating his position But youre unlikely to see any crusade emanating from the White House There will be additional pressure this fall to produce initiatives in other areas in which Mr Reagan campaigned One such came last week with Vice President Bushs announcement of a review that could lead to abolition of longstanding regulations in civil rights and the environment Soon Mr Reagan will have to decide how sweeping his proposals will be He must also decide whether to offer major revisions of two landmark statutes whose provisions expire next year the Clean Air Act and the Voting Rights Act Labor regulations as the longdisputed DavisBacon Act which requires certain minimum wages on all Federal contracts are under review too last week in a first step to change the Labor Department published 80 pages of proposed revisions Rather than repeal the act a White House official said the ultimate approach would more likely involve changing the way the minimum wage is calculated The goal is to reduce contracts cost without angering labor particularly Republicanleaning construction workers who are likely to turn out in 1982s Congressional elections White House officials also fear fallout from a potentially painful end of the long foreign policy honeymoon Mr Reagan has enjoyed The increasingly public disputes between Secretary of State Alexander M Haig Jr and Secretary Weinberger and the expected choice of a costly expansion of the nations bomber and missile system could revive among some voters the concern expressed during the Presidential campaign that Reagan Republicans will drive the nation closer to war The third world and the Middle East are expected to command Mr Reagans attention this year as well In October at the NorthSouth summit in Cancun Mexico Mr Reagan will have a chance to make his case for emphasizing private sector loans and investment to help underdeveloped nations achieve economic growth Third world representatives have signalled already their desire for the United States to do more in direct aid and to engage in global negotiations aimed at bringing about a transfer of wealth from rich nations to poor The visits of Israeli Prime Minsiter Menachem Begin and possibly King Hussein of Jordan this fall will insure the Adminstration will have to face up to the need to develop a more coherent strategy in the Middle East White House officials said Beyond that the White House has perhaps its hardest Congressional fight ahead as it moves to win approval of the sale of highly sophisticated air reconnaissance planes known as Awacs to Saudi Arabia Most Congressmen oppose the sale which the Administration regards as key to its efforts to bring Arab nations to its strategic consensus opposing Soviet influence in the Middle East The Awacs saddle underscores the need for Mr Reagan to maintain smooth relations with Congress That he has proven he knows how to do Still his aides concede the toughest days are yet to come

THE TROUBLES OF TIP O'NEILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/16/magazine/the-troubles-of-tip-o-neill.html,Martin Tolchin reports on the Congress for The New York Times By Martin Tolchin The afternoon was cool and brilliantly clear for a summer day in Washington but inside the House of Representatives at the seat where Speaker Thomas P Tip ONeill Jr sat in rumpled solitude gloom was heavy in the air On the floor where members chatted or paced in the aisles tension was palpable When the Speaker finally rose and moved to the rostrum  a large familiar figure with a hank of offwhite hair spilling across his forehead  Congressmen on both sides of the aisle stood to applaud him They knew what he was going to say  that the taxcut measure being offered by the Reagan Administration was a terrible gamble that it could wreak havoc with the economy education health care They also knew that the Speakers cause was all but lost Tip ONeill had tried to hold the Democratic majority of the House together in the face of an allout campaign by a skillful determined President The Speaker had lost the first two rounds the battles over the budget in May and June Now a month later he was back on the ropes facing a Congress filled with young men with blowdry hairdos who were more at home with computer printouts and media advisers than with the Speakers oldstyle personal kind of politics They had been children when he first stood at this rostrum almost three decades ago The passionate New Deal liberal had changed little since then while many of his listeners even within his own party were in his view defectors The Congressmen gave the Speaker a standing ovation all right Then they broke his heart By a vote of 238 to 195 they approved Ronald Reagans threeyear taxcut package the largest in the nations history The President in his six months in office had engineered a revolutionary change in the direction of Government reducing its size powers and appetites He had effectively taken control of the Congress raising questions about the ability of the House and Senate to compete on anything like an equal footing with a popular President who knows how to use the power of his office Moreover the Reagan victories had led many in Congress to entertain doubts about Tip ONeill and his leader ship Was this the Speakers last hurrah or would the durable old pol be able to round up his scattered troops and prepare for new battles in the fall As Congressmen fled Washington for the August recess his fellow Democrats differed on the future of Mr ONeill Representative John Conyers Jr a Michigan liberal was calling for Mr ONeills resignation while Les Aspin the liberal from Wisconsin who had announced to his constituents in a newsletter last winter that Tip was in a fog and had no idea where to go was now suggesting that the Speaker had begun to supply the fractured ranks of the party with a sense of direction For the future of the Democratic Party much depends on which point of view is correct When Congress reconvenes next month Mr ONeill will be confronted with the next round of dueling with the White House and the Speaker bloodied and licking his wounds from the tax and budget defeats will need all the craft and courage within him to withstand the Reagan onslaught Last November the Democrats lost control of the Senate for the first time in a quartercentury and in the House 27 incumbents were defeated at the polls reducing the size of the majority to 51 it is now 53 a precariously narrow margin given the divisions within the party Next year with Congressional redistricting cutting into the Democratic bastions of the Northeast and Middle West the party will be in danger of losing even nominal control of the House There are now 244 Democrats and 191 Republicans in the House The Democrats will use their summer recess for soulsearching and replenishment hoping to develop a strategy for the upcoming legislative battles As yet no such strategy has emerged It is possible that pressure from the Republican right could force the White House to undertake a major effort to push across profamily legislation on abortion and prayer in the schools that could bring moderates back into the Democratic fold and attract a few Republicans as well Regardless nearly any Democratic strategy will be defensive shoring up the partys flanks and hoping that the White House overreaches the limits of the coalition that provided the President with his resounding summer successes Despite his loss of power however Tip ONeill is still King of the Hill He exercises more authority over the unruly House than any other member of Congress and his only real rival is the President Yet all of Mr ONeills power experience and resourcefulness were inadequate to the task of bringing to heel the renegade boll weevils within his own party the predominantly Sun Belt conservative Democrats who backed the Presidents economic packages in spite of the Speakers attempts to extract loyalty Tip ONeill is fond of saying that in any other country in the world the Democrats would be five parties In fact they are three  liberal moderate and conservative  and they coexist uneasily in the 97th Congress On the face of it though the different kinds of Democrats cannot escape their ultimate interdependence Conservative Democrats for example would lose committee chairmanships if the Democratic liberals were defeated at the polls and the Republicans gained majority control of the chamber Yet the three factions of the party have gone their own ways Senator Edward M Kennedy once his partys most dynamic spokesman for the poor the elderly and the sick now occupies a position on the partys outermost fringes On a summer afternoon seated on the deck of his woodandglass house overlooking the Potomac Mr Kennedy lights a cigar and muses about the disarray within his party I dont question that theres a lot of soulsearching he says Were going through a tumultuous period in the party The center of gravity may have moved toward the right but he believes the Democrats still stand for something They believe in Government and in Governments duty to help the helpless We do not need two Republican Parties he says both of them fearful of Government both protecting the interests of the rich A leader of the moderate Democrats Representative James R Jones of Oklahoma is chairman of the House Budget Committee He was chief of staff in Lyndon B Johnsons White House helping to put together many of the Great Society programs In our zeal to achieve our social goals he says rocking back and forth in a black leather chair in his Capitol Hill office we lost sight of the management of Government Too many excesses occurred We werent as aggressive in checking the excesses as in reaching the social goals Representative Leon E Panetta a moderate California Democrat adds Were going through a selfanalysis that we probably should have done a long time ago Our greatest failure has been the lack of fiscal discipline An echo of that sentiment comes from Senator Ernest F Hollings a South Carolina Democrat and one of the founders of the new 12member conservative Democratic caucus in the Senate most of whose members come from the formerly Solid South where Republicans have made significant inroads and where many voters idolize President Reagan For such Democratic lawmakers conservatism is the vehicle for political selfpreservation Fiscal responsibility is what elected me to the Legislature 30 years ago says Senator Hollings and what elected me Governor When Tip ONeill says Im the biggest spender I got 10 million for knockkneed kids that may be good for Tip but its bad for me The Speakers initial problem in the 97th Congress was how to cope with the 47 Democrats who formed the Conservative Democratic Forum in the House and were under pressure from rightwing groups to oppose Mr ONeills reelection as Speaker though they never proposed a serious challenger The Speaker attempted to appease the conservatives by giving them choice assignments on key leadership committees including Budget and Ways and Means These appointments were assailed by some liberal and moderate Democrats not on the grounds of the appointees conservative philosophy but because many of them had not proved themselves loyal Democrats who would go along with the leadership when their votes were urgently needed and their constituents were not directly affected Such fears were quickly realized One conservative appointee Representative Phil Gramm of Texas who was named to the Budget Committee opposed the Democrats budget package and became the coauthor with Representative Delbert L Latta Republican of Ohio of a budget bill endorsed by President Reagan Democrats believed that the Republicans had sought bipartisan authorship for the bill in order to be able to offset the blame in the future if the Presidents economicrecovery program proved a failure Mr Gramms mentor was Representative Jim Wright a fellow Texas Democrat and House majority leader Its unfortunate that I was as gullible as I was Mr Wright said afterward He would never have been named a member of the Budget Committee save for my intercession He came to me during a recess and pleaded with me to intercede assuring me that he would be a team player I told him of the apprehension our colleagues had Phil said Jim you can be sure that Ill make my fight within the committee and then Ill support whats done by the committee  Mr Gramm said that he offered no such assurances In any event Mr Wright sadly told a Democratic leadership meeting Caesar had his Brutus and I have my Phil Gramm Mr Wright also was instrumental in placing another Texas Democrat Kent Hance on the taxwriting Ways and Means Committee Mr Hance offered the same assurances Mr Wright said but ended up as cosponsor of the Reagan tax bill He wasnt strong enough to withstand the pressures Mr Wright said of Mr Hance Nevertheless the appointments of the conservatives enabled Mr ONeill to fend off a possible challenge to his Speakership He was unanimously reelected although Representative Charles W Stenholm a Texas Democrat and coordinator of the Conservative Democratic Forum insists That was the toughest vote I ever had to cast Mr Stenholm claims that the objectives of the conservative forum are to strengthen the party Weve always been a party of multiple philosophical beliefs he says on which there has rarely been unanimity on any issue For a change were on the winning side of the votes This is a House of Representatives We represent the people in our districts Were voting the people we represent We consider ourselves just as good Democrats as any other Democrats We just believe that the leadership of our party has moved too far to the left The man charged with rationalizing such a confusion of political views was born into politics 68 years ago in the workingclass nonHarvard section of Cambridge Mass Thomas Philip ONeill Jr was the youngest of three children of a city councilman in Cambridge whose home was a natural political center  the Democratic faithful would gather on winter mornings for example to obtain snow buttons that entitled them to a days work shoveling snow for the city county or state As far back as he can remember Tip a nickname favored by a baseball player who could hit foul tips until pitchers walked him worked on local campaigns distributing literature and getting out the vote When he was 15 he worked in Al Smiths Presidential campaign against Herbert Hoover All I knew he recalls was that Al Smith was an Irish Catholic and we had been suppressed all our lives Mr ONeill attended a succession of Roman Catholic schools received a degree from Boston College and entered the insurance business He made his first run for office in 1934 losing his bid to become a Cambridge city councilman by a mere 150 votes and learning a valuable lesson Discovering that he had lost the vote of a woman for whom he had mowed lawns and performed errands he asked why You know Tom she replied its always nice to be asked Mr ONeill has taken little for granted since then Elected to the Massachussetts House of Representatives just two years later he rose to the position of Speaker which he held until 1952 When Congressman John F Kennedy was elected to the Senate Mr ONeill won his seat in the House Becoming the protege of John W McCormack also from Massachusetts who became the Speaker in 1962 during the John F Kennedy Administration Mr ONeill was brought into the House power structure by his second term he had been put on the Rules Committee a choice assignment for a young lawmaker He became majority leader in 1973 and four years later was voted Speaker The Speaker is elected every two years at the beginning of the Congressional term Throughout his leadership Tip ONeill has been an activist one of the first of the Democratic leaders to come out against United States involvement in the Vietnam War one of the first of them to suggest that President Nixon resign Eventually he played a major behindthescenes role in the impeachment effort In 1977 he shepherded a controversial Congressional ethics code and a difficult energy bill through Congress Though the two have frequently been compared Mr ONeill has exercised far less power as Speaker than the man who held the job during his freshman term in Congress  the legendary Sam Rayburn Mr Sam acquired his clout during the World War II years when the nation willingly ceded extraordinary power to its elected officials Mr ONeill tells the story of a freshman Congressman who had run afoul of the Justice Department on incometaxevasion charges and went to see Mr Sam for help Mr Rayburn summoned the Attorney General to his office and persuaded him not to press criminal charges The Congressman was so grateful that he pledged eternal loyalty to Mr Rayburn including his vote whenever the Speaker needed it Funny you should mention that Mr Rayburn told him There was an offshoreoil bill coming up the following week and Mr Rayburn needed his vote Mr Speaker youve got my vote next week and whenever you need it as long as Im here the freshman told Mr Rayburn When the Congressman returned to his hometown that weekend however the local newspaper charged that he had sold his vote on offshore oil to get off the hook on incometaxevasion charges The Congressman went back to see Mr Rayburn the following Monday and explained his dilemma You promised me your vote on offshore oil Mr Rayburn said and I expect you to keep your promise Sit in the front row during the voting and if I need your vote Ill signal you and I expect to get it The freshman sat in the front row during the voting Two minutes before the end the Speaker signaled him that his vote was not needed As the man heaved a huge sigh of relief he noticed 17 other men in the front row also heaving sighs of relief If you want to know how this place has changed thats one example said Mr ONeill who doesnt have those extra votes to call upon or even the basic votes he needs Nevertheless the Speaker of the House can exercise considerable power because he controls the Congressional equivalent of snow buttons  rewarding his friends and depriving his opponents He is in charge of the bureaucracy of the institution which gives him a large say in matters mundane and mighty A Congressman may want an overseas trip at taxpayers expense or a better suite of rooms in the House Office Building He may want to be assigned to particular committees because they are prestigious or because they rule on issues close to the hearts of his constituents All these are matters within the Speakers province So is the fate of that bill the Congressman is so concerned about It may never get out of committee unless the Speaker goes to bat for it He is also the man who can keep it from getting stuck in the Rules Committee through which all measures must pass before they go to the floor and he can determine the form in which it arrives on the floor  whether amendments will be allowed or not He can also schedule the floor vote for a Monday morning or Friday afternoon depending on whether a small attendance will help or hurt the cause Part of a Speakers influence over his fellow Representatives reflects the political clout of his office and the manner in which he exercises it A Speaker is automatically a celebrity who can draw crowds and attract media attention and he can share that with a deserving colleague Tip ONeill makes more than 100 fundraising appearances a year on behalf of Congressmen up for reelection He is much soughtafter for the task more than most of his predecessors because he puts on a good show Labor leaders and corporate chairmen alike roar at his stories and respond to his personal warmth people feel good when he walks into a room Every day the Congress is in session the Speaker holds a press conference 15 minutes before the House convenes Occassionally he will have a colleague by his side You know Congressman SoandSo hell say to the reporters Hes been working on this bill dealing with such and such You may want to ask him about it Mr ONeill metes out such favors carefully painstakingly building relationships with his colleagues  the kind of grassroots approach that has always been his hallmark It has worked well although as the Speaker himself sadly observes the personal touch is fast disappearing from modern politics All of that he says has gone by The most dramatic example of the new politician was the man who became President just as Mr ONeill took on the mantle of Speaker Jimmy Carter was a political technocrat a master of computers and polls profoundly suspicious of machine politicians He was also a political loner who placed little value on party loyalty Though the two men were of the same party they had little in common An early confrontation came over a bill that called for the expenditure of 109 billion for water projects The Speaker regarded the measure as necessary to the survival of the areas involved not to mention the political survival of the Congressmen who represented those areas Though Mr Carter perceived the measure as a boondoggle and fought it hard the Speaker was determined and with the support of the then Senate majority leader Robert C Byrd of West Virginia he made the President back down Last year he tangled with President Carter over which social programs in the budget to cut a confrontation that ended in compromise Then came Ronald Reagan On one level the Speaker and the new President have much in common They are about the same age and they share an Irish heritage and a mutual love for and skill at storytelling Their initial contacts were friendly if guarded Last December for example Presidentelect Reagan made a pilgrimage to the Capitol to meet with the Democratic leadership Eventually everyone else left the room and the two men were alone As the Speaker recalls he told the President Im an American first a Democrat second Im not going to obstruct your program Youll get your vote on it in the House Says David R Gergen assistant to the President for communications We were very sensitive to the fact that Tip had such a rocky relationship with Jimmy Carter Indeed in the early days the Speakers views were carefully solicited and Edwin Meese the Presidents counselor called the House regularly to attend to his needs They both understand Mr Gergen says that you have to be on speaking terms with those with whom you disagree But there were tensions as the weeks went by and disagreements surfaced in small ways On one occasion the Speaker and his wife of 40 years Millie were guests for dinner at the White House and the President wore a tie handpainted with an American eagle that the Speaker had given him I didnt know Tip gave you that tie Mrs Reagan said Yes the Speaker replied without thinking I got three dozen for my staff for Christmas A particularly bitter exchange took place early in June Mr ONeill was interviewed on the ABC television show Issues and Answers his first such appearance in three years a new effort on the part of a backroom politician to be more visible He called the GOP tax package a complete windfall for the rich He then said of Mr Reagan He has no concern no regard no care for the little man of America And I understand that Because of his life style he never meets those people And consequently he doesnt understand their problems At his next press conference the President responded I grew up in poverty and got what education I got all by myself and so forth and I think it is sheer demagoguery to pretend that this economic program w ch weve submitted is not aimed at helping the great cross section of people in this country that have been burdened for too long by big Government and high taxes The Speaker was stunned by the phrase sheer demagoguery He said he could not recall a similar attack on a Speaker It is time he said for the President to cool his rhetoric stop his political broadsides and work sincerely with Congress to get this economy moving again But ever the professional the Speaker called the President to give him the news about the tax vote and Mr ONeill closed the conversation with the assurance No hard feelings old pal Ronald Reagans budget provided the first major test of the Congressional Democrats It was a blueprint for a radical redirection of the size and scope of Government with major cutbacks in a broad range of programs for the needy including welfare nutrition education and health After surviving an attempt on his life Mr Reagan began an extraordinary lobbying effort from his hospital bed that continued through his convalescence It included telephone calls cuff links tickets to the Presidential box in the Kennedy Center and other White House perquisites When Congressmen expressed concern over some aspects of the cuts such as mass transit or childhood immunization the President said that he only wanted them to agree on the size of the cuts and that there would be ample time later on to work out the details The Democrats on the other hand were uncharacteristically silent Instead of orchestrating a counterattack the Speaker used the Easter recess to make a trip to Australia and New Zealand stopping in Hawaii on the way home Who the hell knew all that was going to happen when I was in New Zealand the Speaker said when asked whether he should have stayed home and mobilized opposition to the Presidents budget The Speaker insists that opposition was hopeless Dont you think I knew the night the President was elected that hed win his first major test around here he asked The hopelessness was communicated in his daily meetings with reporters beginning two weeks before the first budget vote in May to the acute dismay of Jim Jones the Budget Committee chairman Only the Lord Himself could save this one the Speaker said a few days before the vote Liberal and moderate Democrats were furious He made it easy for everyone to get off the hook said Representative Benjamin S Rosenthal Democrat of New York He gave them a free ride He should have called them in and said If youre not with us on this dont come into my office and ask for anything He could have said You know that extra room in the Rayburn Building you want you know that chairmanship youre after Forget it  Stung by the criticism the Speaker lumbered to the well and addressed the 244member House Democratic caucus This old dog wants to learn new tricks he said I have been criticized not only by the Republicans but by my own party and by some of the members here but I do not see anybody coming forward with these new tricks they want to put in place In the end 63 Democrats joined the Republicans to give Mr Reagans budget a whopping 253176 victory The President won his second victory in June with his package of budget cuts and his third victory came in July when his tax cut passed by another huge margin 238195 Democrats initially opposed the notion of a big tax cut in an overheated inflationary economy They feared that such a cut would only place more money in the pockets of those who would spend it as soon as they got it driving up inflation and interest rates even further The President countered that opponents of a tax cut falsely believed that the Government could spend tax dollars more wisely than those who earn them The White House which originally wanted a clean bill  just a tax cut with no amendments  engaged in a bidding war with the Democrats eventually incorporating Democratic proposals including a reduction of the socalled marriage penalty Democrats countered with a host of additional provisions to cut taxes for oil producers and royalty owners eliminate estate taxes on all estates of 600000 or less reduce gift taxes provide help for thrift institutions encourage retirement savings stimulate research and development ease the marriage penalties The White House not to be outdone added its own tax reductions for oil producers as well as other provisions such as lowering the maximum estate tax to 50 percent As in the budget battle it was the Presidents persuasiveness and the ability of the White House to mount a massive lobbying campaign that resulted in the resounding victory on the House floor A new coalition sprang up there Mr ONeill said later One faction broke away from us  the ultraconservatives and some of the moderates and when they do that the Republicans gain control Now Tip ONeill is waiting He is waiting for middle America to discover that those budget cuts will harm them as well as the poor Only the rich would not be hurt he said The monkey is off the Democrats back the Speaker said The cuts brutal as they are are the Reagan cuts The deficit is the Reagan deficit Reagan has won a big victory but the horse that runs fast doesnt always run long The Democratic Party is now a leaderless party Its identity will probably be shaped more by the Reagan Administration than by its own warring parts The heart of the Democratic strategy if it can be so dignified  is to await and exploit the Administrations failures The party is hungry for new leadership Nobody now speaks for the Democrats not the Speaker nor Ted Kennedy nor former Vice President Walter Mondale nor Illinois Representative Dan Rostenkowski There are new potential leaders on the horizon  Senators Gary Hart of Colorado or Paul Tsongas from Massachusetts or Dale Bumpers from Arkansas  articulate men trying to redefine the party Thus far however the redefinitions seem vague and inadequate How much of the Democrats rout can be attributed to the Speaker Could a younger more aggressive more moderate Speaker have halted the Reagan juggernaut Few on Capitol Hill think so They believe that the Reagan successes stemmed from a combination of a newly elected conservative President and a Congress in which Democrats held a fragile majority that was offset by conservatives more attuned to the Republican ideology than to the Democrats Representative Jim Jones the Budget Committee chairman was a younger aggressive more moderate Democrat and he got nowhere in trying to put together a Democratic alternative to the Reagan budget package Mr Jones is one of those who seems destined for a leadership role in the Congress as does Representative Leon Panetta of California who also played a major role in the budget battles Waiting in the wings if the Speaker should retire next year is Representative Jim Wright the majority leader a moderate Texan who could be challenged by Representative Dan Rostenkowski a protege of the late Richard Daley and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee Others on the leadership ladder include Tom Foley of Washington the Democratic whip and Gillis Long of Louisiana chairman of the Democratic caucus It was a scene from another era the annual reunion in July of Tip ONeills old crowd at Barrys Corner in North Cambridge Mass They are old men now and they revel in tales of their youth stories of mischief and mayhem Earlier making the rounds of the Eighth Congressional District of Massachusetts Mr ONeill had seemed as he often does in Washington these days bent burdened saddened He had gone through the motions at a clambake in Somerville Mass pressing the flesh with most of the 1000 guests who had come to hear the annual report of their Congressman He knew most of them by first name Lord love you you look like your mother he told one woman Hows the golf Johnny he asked another supporter They lined up to be photographed with him many observing sadly as they turned away that he was beginning to look his age But as he walked into the Barrys Corner reunion on the second floor of the VFW hall a light came into his eyes a spring to his step and the years began to drop away There were perhaps 100 men in the room beer bottles in hand He knew each one by name and had a story to tell about most The invocation was delivered by Msgr Vincent Mackey one of the few in the room who did not owe his job to the guest of honor Nothing in this life not even death can ever separate us from Gods love or the loyalty of our Barrys Corner friends he said And Father Dan Reidy told the assembled I have a favor to ask of you  dont die this year The Speaker who still lives in a frame house a few blocks away led in the reminiscences Everybody who didnt walk by DiNapolis fruit stand and grab a tomato or an apple raise your hand he said and the laughter began There was a nod to Frank Cahill now a surgeon the only one who went to the library when it wasnt raining There were stories about the thirdbase performance of Jeremiah Sullivan for whom Mr ONeill obtained a judgeship and about others who were the recipients of state and Federal jobs And there was talk of the President I get to see the President quite often to be perfectly truthful the Speaker said I have a tremendous liking for him You people would like him too Hes got the charm hes got the grace hes got the humor And hes kicking the hell out of me And there were some of the Irish stories that he exchanges with the President like the one about Uncle Dinty who got flattened by a steamroller whose operator was distracted by a pretty girl Flat as a pancake he was Tip said And when they went to give his widow the bad tidings she couldnt open the door Im indisposed she said Im taking a bath Just slip him under the door And the Speaker ended as he usually ends the reunions by reciting a longmemorized poem by Charles Hanson Towne It was passed on to him years ago by James Michael Curley Bostons legendary Mayor who thought the budding politicians oratory would be improved by a touch of poetry Around the corner I have a friend In this great city that has no end Yet days go by and weeks rush on And before I know it a year is gone And I never see my old friends face For life is a swift and terrible race He knows I like him just as well As in the days when I rang his bell And he rang mine We were young then And now we are busy tired men Tired with playing a foolish game Tired with trying to make a name Is Tip ONeill ready to join his old cronies in retirement Is he ready to spend more time at Eastward Ho  the magnificent golf course near his summer home in Harwich Port on Cape Cod where every fairway but two has a view of both Cape Cod Bay and the Atlantic Ocean  working on his driver and his fairway woods as he has been since Congress recessed The Speaker is a proud man who will not easily be driven from office But he knows that he is considered a burden by many Democrats too large a target in the legislative battles and on Election Day And he also knows tha
 his problems would be compounded if the Democrats lost even nominal control of the chamber It is possible that Mr ONeill should he win reelection in 1982 would wind up minority leader in the next Congress His best reason for not quitting is his son Thomas P ONeill 3d Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts who is running for Governor Mr ONeill knows that his Speakership will help attract contributions and media attention to his sons campaign The Speaker probably is making up his mind this month on the golf course He hits a nice ball usually splitting the fairways while entertaining guests with recollections of a lifetime in politics But the pressures of Washington have become mercifully remote as the Speaker revels in the sea breezes and the sunshine On good days he even breaks 90,,
THE BAR WEIGHS IN AS A FRIEND OF COURTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/16/weekinreview/the-bar-weighs-in-as-a-friend-of-courts.html,When legislators return to Washington next month they will face one of the most momentous constitutional issues to come before Congress in years The question they will be weighing through a series of bills is whether Congress can  or should attempt to  restrict the Supreme Court and lower Federal courts from enforcing constitutional precedents with which a majority in Congress and the President disagree Last week in anticipation of the undoubtedly heated debates to come the American Bar Association meeting for its annual convention in New Orleans offered some strong advice As to making the attempt the nations largest organization of lawyers answered with a resounding no The associations House of Delegates went on record as opposing more than 25 Congressional bills that would strip the Federal courts of jurisdiction to decide cases involving matters such as abortion busing and school prayer To make the point even more forceful the vote and the discussion leading to it demonstrated that many conservative lawyers and legal scholars who disdain judicial activism on social issues nevertheless will join their liberal colleagues in opposing such a drastic cure Court jurisdiction bills they essentially said threaten the Federal judiciarys supremacy in matters of constitutional interpretation and thus the nations very system of governmental checks and balances But the Congressional battle to contain the judiciary is just beginning Powerful forces on the right are organizing for an assault on what they consider the Federal courts usurpation of power An early test of their strength will be the vote scheduled for Sept 10 to end a liberal filibuster against restricting the Federal court power to order school desegregation through busing Last month the antibusing majority in the Senate fell just one vote short of the 60 necessary to limit debate on antibusing amendments to the Justice Departments authorization bill But Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut and his supporters hope the bar associations influence will swing more senators to their side These legislative efforts to reverse the Court are part of an increasingly powerful movement in Congress to return power over civil liberties issues to the states Dr James McClellan chief counsel of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Separation of Powers told one bar association symposium He further noted that several bills to restrict Federal court jurisdiction have excellent chances of passage Jurisdiction is legal jargon for the power to decide cases Since 1803 Federal courts have made their constitutional interpretations the law of the land by deciding individual lawsuits the practice having begun with Chief Justice John Marshall who first voided an act of Congress as unconstitutional in the case of Marbury v Madison In recent decades the Supreme Court has interpreted the vague wording of the Fourteenth Amendment to mean that the Bill of Rights applies to state as well as Federal actions Armed with that interpretation the Court has struck down state laws dealing with an everbroadening range of issues from discriminatory taxation to nude dancing Thus in 1954 the Court overturned state school desegregation laws as denying black people the equal protection of the laws in the past decade it has upheld sweeping busing orders as necessary correctives to statesponsored segregation in the early 1960s it prohibited statesponsored school prayer as an unconstitutional establishment of religion and in 1973 it voided state antiabortion laws as inconsistent with the rights of women not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law Such decisions have outraged many officials and citizens But efforts to overturn them by proposing constitutional amendments have fallen short of the required twothirds majority in each house of Congress Congress clearly has no constitutional power to overturn constitutional precedents directly by legislation The pending proposals therefore seek to overturn these precedents indirectly by leaving state courts free to disregard them without fear of their decisions being appealed to the Supreme Court and by keeping cases out of the Federal court system Speaking at the bar association meeting Prof Charles E Rice of Notre Dame Law School called efforts to restrict Federal court jurisdiction a surgical remedy for a judicial usurpation of state legislative power over issues such as abortion But Representative Barney Frank Democrat of Massachusetts said that to enact such restrictions is to allow a transient majority of Congress and the President to legislate constitutional change any time they wish Racial discrimination would have remained the law of the land in the 1950s Mr Frank said if Congress had felt free to prevent Federal courts from enforcing unpopular desegregation rulings He added that in the future a radical or socialist majority might be tempted to strip the courts of power to enforce constitutional property rights If the effects of trying to limit court jurisdiction has prompted legal debate the question of whether Congress can legally do so is proving equally divisive In Congressional testimony scholars have disagreed as to the constitutionality of the proposals although the majority agreed that constitutional or not they were dangerous and unwise Mr Rice Dr McClellan and other proponents of jurisdictional curbs disagree and cite a constitutional provision empowering Congress to create exceptions to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and a 112yearold Court precedent suggesting that this power is broad and unlimited Still many conservatives would join Robert Bork a former Solicitor General of the United States and now a Yale Law School professor who has criticized the Supreme Court for making up constitutional law as it goes along but who would not restrict the Courts jurisdiction over constitutional issues Addressing one group at the bar association meeting Mr Bork who was recently considered for a Supreme Court appointment and whom Administration spokesmen said last week President Reagan plans to appoint to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia contended that the framers of the Constitution did not invest in Congress the power to destroy the Supreme Court as a coequal branch of Government and thus render the Constitutions meaning a different thing in each of the states

THE TITLE X BATTLE IS WON--FOR NOW,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/21/opinion/l-the-title-x-battle-is-won-for-now-241380.html,To the Editor Among recent frontpage reports about the dismantling of Federal health and social service programs Congresss vote to retain Title X of the Public Health Service Act as a categorical grant  an important progressive victory  has gone largely unnoticed itle X the main source of Government funds for family planning in the United States has served about 45 million lowincome women every year since its initiation during the Nixon Administration Through helping to avert an estimated 800000 pregnancies annually the program saves about two dollars for every dollar spent making it one of the most costeffective bills ever to come out of Washington Yet in spite of this proven record  and notwithstanding a strict prohibition against the use of its funds for abortions  Title Xs renewal was vigorously opposed by two archconservative senators Republicans Orrin Hatch of Utah and Jeremiah Denton of Alabama Their wrath was stirred by a single aspect of the bill its provision of birth control to adolescents without parental consent Thanks to a lastminute telephone and telegram campaign and the dedicated efforts of a few Democratic legislators chiefly Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio John Dingell of Michigan Henry Waxman of California and New Yorks own James Scheuer Title X has been saved for now But the maximum funds for the program have been severely cut And we can expect that when the question of appropriations is raised in the fall a few fireandbrimstone legislators will once again blast away at Governmentfunded family planning It is ironic that these men who most vehemently condemn women for resorting to abortion would like to deny them birth control as well ALFRED F MORAN Executive Vice President Planned Parenthood of New York City New York Aug 13 1981
Invidious Comparison,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/23/books/l-invidious-comparison-242973.html,To the Editor In her review of Susan Griffins Pornography and Silence and Andrea Dworkins Pornography Men Possessing Women July 12 Ellen Willis links both authors and the feminist antipornography movement to the conservative fundamentalist backlash Yet Ellen Willis fails to offer any evidence in support of such a connection except to intimate that it is suspicious that both movements are opposed to pornography and both have emerged at the same time A crucial fact that Ellen Willis chooses to ignore is that feminist objections to pornography are the antithesis of those of the Moral Majority Feminist opposition to pornography is founded on the belief that pornography is a powerful agent of socialization that shapes human sexuality in such a way as to bolster male dominance and female subservience As long as men are taught that female bodies are objects of conquest and possession feminists argue sexual crimes from harassment to rape and a cultural devaluation of women will prevail In striking contrast fundamentalists are against pornography because they believe that female bodies and female sexuality are evil and corrupting the true legacy of Eve Moreover the Moral Majority can afford to oppose pornography because unlike other maledominated movements it does not need pornography in order to keep women devalued and subservient  it has the Bible and the traditional family for that The concern of feminists with pornography is not as Ellen Willis should know a recent development coinciding with the rise of the Moral Majority A glance at the history of the current wave of feminism which began in the midsixties reveals that from the start pornography has been an issue central to feminist thought Kate Milletts brilliant groundbreaking Sexual Politics published in 1969 explored male dominance through an analysis of the pornographic writing of Henry Miller and Norman Mailer And two of the most important feminist protests in the late sixties the demonstration at the Miss America Pageant and the sitin at Grove Press  targeted the exploitation and degradation of womens bodies and sexuality Rather than hunting for the origins of feminist opposition to pornography in the conservative fundamentalist movement Ellen Willis would be better off looking for them in the pornography itself particularly in the brutal blatantly misogynistic imagery that came to the fore in the 1970s More than any other factor the impetus behind the decision of feminists to organize against pornography was the June 1978 issue of Hustler which appeared on newsstands around the country Its cover showed a womans body being fed into a meat grinder and emerging as ground meat If anything coincides with the resurgence of conservatism it is not feminists against pornography but attacks against feminism from both ends of the political spectrum  from conservatives who are fighting abortion and the ERA to liberals who champion pornography Ellen Willis is part of this backlash DORCHEN LEIDHOLDT Women Against Pornography New York City Ellen Willis replies Dorchen Leidholdts attempt to lump me with liberals who champion pornography seriously misrepresents my views First I am not a liberal I am a radical feminist active in the movement since its inception Second I am hardly an uncritical apologist for pornography which I characterize in my review as the return of the repressed in distorted solipsistic sometimes frightening form What I reject is the reductive equation of pornography with violence and the moralistic politics that equation fosters The effect of these misrepresentations is to deny quite erroneously that there is significant feminist opposition to the antipornography movement

No Headline,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/23/magazine/l-no-headline-242965.html,With all due respect to Betty Friedans past contributions to feminism she has long since become hopelessly confused about whose side shes on The following is I think a fair summary of her argument A rightwing reaction against feminism threatens to reverse the gains of the womens movement This has happened because we offended people by rejecting our traditional role in the family displaying a lack of reverence for childbearing and appearing to promote licentious familythreatening sex Therefore if feminism is to progress we must embrace the family and motherhood and stop making offensive demands for freedom The right is focusing on sexual issues because control and manipulation of sexuality and the family have always been key elements in authoritarian power Therefore feminists should steer away from these issues because theyre too controversial and anyway theyre not important The ERA is the symbol and substance of womens rights At the same time the ERA has nothing to do with either abortion or homosexuality  in fact it has nothing to do with sexual behavior at all Misguided slogans like free abortion on demand give the sordid impression that feminists support sexual and personal freedom for women The proper reason for favoring legal abortion is that it permits the choice to have children sic Demands for freedom of sexual preference violate the right to sexual privacy In short Betty Friedan would destroy feminism in order to save it and beat the Moral Majority by joining it ELLEN WILLIS New York City
WRITER-ACTRESS RUNNING HARD,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/23/nyregion/writer-actress-running-hard.html,Broadway hit musical I Cant Keep Running in Place has been off and running hard  on stage ever since her first leading role at age 6 in South Orange I played Mother Nature in the South Mountain School firstgrade production of The Crocus That Wouldnt Bloom  the slender 25yearold playwright recalled They gave Father Nature a very small role Maybe the play was written by a woman Miss Schottenfelds own play using the vehicle of an assertivenesstraining workshop deals with seven women who gain insight into and make changes in their lives Since its opening in May it has been playing to mostly soldout audiences at the Westside Arts Theater on Manhattans 43d Street Though Running in Place has an allfemale cast and concerns womens issues Miss Schottenfeld vehemently refuses to call it a feminist play If I had made a Feminist statement with a capital F it would have been a political doctrine rather than a play she said I wanted to be entertaining first and very few people have written political plays that are entertaining Thats why nobody wants to go see a feminist play  In personal politics too Miss Schottenfeld shrinks from what she calls the feminist label If you ask me issue by issue Im for womens rights the ERA abortion she said But people become so unreceptive when they hear the word feminism  its like a disease Labeled or not Barbara Schottenfelds own life story reads like a classic feminist tale of success It began in South Orange and Maplewood where she sang danced and acted in school From there it moved in 1974 to Princeton where she told professors that the welltrodden student thesis path of academic commentary on established works was not for her Instead she wanted to write a creative thesis It was unheard of she said And at the very least they assumed I would write an adaptation of someone elses work No one expected an original fulllength musical She hadnt expected it either Never having written a play shed seen her role in the theater primarily as performer So during the fall of her junior year she began dutifully plowing her way through the old masters  Shaw Ibsen  in search of a play to adapt Until the day she tossed the books aside and told herself Why dont you write something you care about Its your thesis What she cared about it seems were human problems and psychological catharses The stage for this had been vividly set in her mind three years earlier when she had attended a psychodrama session for a psychology class And more of the scenario developed when she heard about the new assertivenesstraining workshops popping up in the late 70s They were only for women then which was one reason for my allwoman cast The other reason she said is that I was intrigued by the idea of an allfemale musical She collected her cast of characters during her junior spring trip abroad Apartmenthunting in Paris she bumped into a sign that read Assertivenesstraining workshop In English Ten sessions Ironically said Miss Schottenfeld the workshop leader was an American woman doctor who was giving assertiveness training to kill time while her husbands job took them to Paris Back in Princeton she wrote book music and lyrics and directed her thesis at the Princeton Inn Theater It sold out for three and a half weeks in the spring of 1978 in its thenincarnation as A Woman Suspended It also got her an Aplus Meanwhile she rushed scripts to Off and OffOff Broadway producers The Actors Playhouse Theater called asking to do a reading of the play Instead she recalled I chartered a bus piled everyone on it  the cast musicians  and took the whole show into the city for one night All 150 seats sold out After her Princeton graduation with honors cum laude and offers from producers she moved to New York City to live and to rewrite polish and flesh out my characters By the spring of 1979 the college thesis had metamorphized into its postgraduate state acquiring its present title along the way which better represented the fun comic side of the play she said La Mama Theater put it on as a showcase production and again it was a sellout The next step was a producers audition in the fall of 1980 in which Miss Schottenfelds talents as a performer were tested I sang through the whole score she said from beginning to end with some of the actresses from the La Mama production helping me Those efforts rewarded her with the current successful run All this wouldnt have ended happily without much hard labor behind the scenes Before the La Mama production for instance the aspiring playwright trudged up and down Broadway knocking on scores of producers doors hawking her flyers Id say Hi Im Barbara Schottenfeld and you dont know who I am but we just did a show at Princeton thats running at La Mama and I really hope youll come  That was pretty gutsy she conceded And for the producers audition she spent weeks on the phone trying to get them to say theyd come I try to get the key words in fast like sold out wonderful reviews I didnt just say Im Barbara Schottenfeld from New Jersey and I like vanilla ice cream and wait for them to hang up she said I think my performing ability helped a lot Im probably pretty convincing I had to believe in my work  my product  and then sell it A lot of artists dont know how to separate their work from the business of selling it You have to talk about your work as an item people will want  and if they pass it up you get on the phone and sell it to someone else Next on the agenda are two more plays One is a commissioned work for the OffCenter Theater which she said shell perform in because she acknowledged I still see myself as a performer Shes also collaborating with Gary William Friedman composer of The Me Nobody Knows and Tommy Tune director of The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas on Camptown a musical based on the life of Stephen Foster On a personal level shes already beaten her own running goal which was to be established in the theater by age 26 Ive been lucky she said and then quickly corrected herself No no  Ive worked very hard to get there

POLLS FIND BLACK-WHITE GAPS ON VARIETY OF ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/28/us/polls-find-black-white-gaps-on-variety-of-issues.html, By ADAM CLYMER Black Americans have more faith in government but less faith in politicians than whites have and they remain liberal and Democratic as whites become more conservative and more Republican The black liberalism however is concentrated on economic matters and does not carry over to other ideological battlegrounds such as the issues of abortion or prayer in schools These conclusions emerge from an examination of five years of New York TimesCBS News Polls and from interviews with leading authorities on black public opinion There are some major immediate differences of opinion between the races on the Reagan Administration in particular and on the nations prospects over the next five years in general Whites are much happier than blacks on both counts Blacks also favor domestic spending especially to help the poor while President Reagan and whites generally favor cutting it Widening of Gap Is Not Clear On most issues there is no clear evidence in the polls that the gap between the opinions of the races is widening But Robert M Teeter president of Market Opinion Research in Detroit a leading Republican polling organization said that he believed the gap was widening Blacks appear to be more polarized from whites than they were and not only politically he said in an interview describing his poll findings In TimesCBS News Polls the shift to the right in white thinking is shown by an increase in Republican allegiance among whites from 21 percent in 1977 to 29 percent in 1981 and by an increase in the percentage of whites who call themselves conservative to 36 this year from 30 in 1977 Meanwhile black political allegiances were more stable In 1977 7 percent of blacks said they were Republicans This year 8 percent did Twentynine percent called themselves conservative four years ago and 29 percent do so now These selfdefinitions are not precise compasses pointing to likely attitudes on more specific questions Many people call themselves conservative because of life style not politics But these selfdescriptions seem strongly connected to opinions on issues involving government and the economy Responses in Polls Combined The percentages of party identification and political philosophy were computed by combining the responses of all blacks and all whites interviewed in TimesCBS News Polls in a given year a technique that greatly reduces the range of sampling error It is possible only when the identical question is asked over and over In the typical TimesCBS News Poll a difference of 10 or more percentage points between black and white responses would have to be found in most cases before sampling error could be discounted as a possible contributor to the variance On attitudes toward government many of the differences are large Some are topical In June threefourths of the blacks but only half as many whites said they thought they would be hurt personally by President Reagans budget cuts But other differentiations are general In that same June poll twofifths of blacks interviewed said the Federal Government was more efficient than state or local authorities but only onefifth of whites gave that response That confidence in Washington is a logical result of their having relied so much on the Federal sector said Alvin F Poussaint associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School Even so he said it is anything but an absolute faith tempered as it is by a distrust of politicians that reflects black experience For example a poll taken in June 1978 asked what level of government wasted more money Sixtyfive percent of the whites cited the Federal Government as against 45 percent of the blacks Enthusiasm for Federal Programs Over many years blacks have remained more enthusiastic than whites about existing or proposed Federal programs including loans to New York City national health insurance and most existing domestic programs especially those intended to help the poor The percentage of blacks saying they felt the Government social programs of the 1960s were generally helpful increased to 51 in November 1980 from 40 in June 1978 White approval of the same efforts stayed level at about 30 percent M Carl Holman president of the National Urban Coalition said in an interview Its quite clear that blacks are continuing to believe in things that whites no longer believe in Included among these was the Federal Government not only because of the help it provided over the past half century he said but because If blacks are weaker at the Federal level now than they were they are infinitely weaker in most state capitals and county seats But as Dr Poussaint noted that greater faith in Government does not extend to faith in the politicians who do the governing Even though they had a higher opinion of President Carter than did whites more blacks than whites disbelieved the reasons based on foreign policy that he expressed for not campaigning or debating in early 1980 They said the reason was politics Bad Job by Officeholders In September 1978 a CBS News Poll recorded that twothirds of blacks but just half of whites believed that elected officials do a bad job Three blacks in four as against three whites in five said they believed politicians were less trustworthy than other people In February 1980 after the arrests in Abscam investigations of white politicians three blacks in 10 but only two whites in 10 said they believed their Congressman would take a bribe That suspicious tone may explain why blacks have often been less ready to believe government pronouncements than whites have Last June 60 percent of whites but only 35 percent of blacks said they believed that the Social Security System was running short of money That warning had come from President Reagan whom blacks oppose strongly in polls But it was not a unique indication of skepticism about official pronouncements Blacks were often less credulous than were whites in recent years when asked if they thought the oil shortage was real Blacks however are uncertain allies of liberals on some other important kinds of issues LifeStyle Conservatism Julian Bond a widely traveled State Senator from Atlanta said he had always felt that black Americans on socalled lifestyle issues were more conservative than whites The polling data does not make exactly that point but it shows a blurry picture on these issues and certainly one that leaves blacks more like whites than unlike them On prayer in schools for example 77 percent of whites and 78 percent of blacks said in April 1981 that they favored a constitutional amendment to allow such prayers On abortion blacks have sometimes been less ready than whites to accept the proposition that the issue should be left to a woman and her doctor But at other times there have been no significant differences between the races attitudes It appears that the gap on this issue may be narrowing But when the question has been phrased in terms that relate abortion to the needs of poor women blacks have been much more supportive of abortion and government financing of it than have whites Mr Holman said that black opposition to abortion which he acknowledged may be eroding could be explained in that a much larger proportion of blacks are religious than whites and religious in the oldfashioned sense of cherishing life The TimesCBS Polls offer some support for that analysis Last April blacks reported more frequent church attendance than whites did and in June 1980 64 percent of the blacks interviewed said they listened to religious broadcasts frequently compared with 26 percent of all whites and 46 percent of white Protestants who called themselves bornagain Christians Direct Involvement of Race Perhaps the most obvious series of differences develop when race is directly involved in the question Busing is one such subject and the differences between races have remained wide for many years On questions about progress in dealing with discrimination and on the obligation of government to take specific steps to end it the racial differences have been both predictable and distinct Probably no racially related question has produced a disparity as striking as that resulting from the question of whether higher levels of black unemployment have been caused mainly by unwillingness of blacks to work In April 1981 43 percent of whites said it was and only 7 percent of blacks did On issues that relate to the poor even if the question has no direct racial reference the pattern of results is similar In November 1980 54 percent of whites said that people on welfare did not really need the help Only half as many blacks did Foreign policy issues have generally produced less dramatic differences But blacks were less willing than whites to see the country take actions that would involve it directly in crises in Afghanistan Poland and Iran They were also less likely than whites to say after the fact that strong action earlier would have brought a quicker release for the hostages held in the American Embassy in Teheran Finally there is an apparent deep black skepticism about many widely held opinions that seem almost standard with some elements of white American society For example in July 1979 whites divided almost evenly on whether the moon walk a decade earlier had been worth it On a more mundane level in the same poll whites split evenly on whether youth should study specifically for highpaying jobs or pursue what interested them academically By 3to1 margins blacks rejected the moon walk and preferred training for high pay
DATE WITH JUDY COLLINS AT THE SAVOY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/28/arts/date-with-judy-collins-at-the-savoy.html,WHILE pop music today has many fine interpretive singers perhaps none is as discriminating in the choice of material as Judy Collins who will appear at the Savoy 141 West 44th Street tomorrow night at 9 with a fourpiece band tickets are 1050 and 1250 information 9219490 In the last 20 years Miss Collins has helped establish a canon of modern pop standards that spans 50 years embraces several languages and treats such disparate songwriters as Bob Dylan Stephen Sondheim Jacques Brel Ned Rorem and Leonard Cohen as artistic equals Even so Miss Collins a 42yearold veteran of 18 albums including three anthologies is still often routinely labeled a folk singer I dont mind being called a folk singer as long as that means the music comes from the heart Miss Collins said the other day over coffee in her spacious apartment on Manhattans Upper West Side My father was a radio entertainer and I grew up around great music of all kinds Ive always felt that a good song whether you find it in a folk form or on a Rodgers and Hart lead sheet is something thats going to last For the last three years I havent even played the guitar on stage It had become a crutch that prevented me from learning how to move freely Miss Collins rebelled into folk music when she was a teenager growing up in Colorado Her previous musical training had been on classical piano with Antonia Brico the teacher and conductor who was the subject of Miss Collinss awardwinning documentary film Antonia Portrait of a Woman seven years ago Along with Joan Baez Miss Collins became one of the two most prominent female voices in the folk boom of the late 1950s and early 60s But after recording two albums of traditional material she began singing the urban folk songs of Bob Dylan and others From then on her repertory rapidly expanded On her sixth album In My Life 1966 Miss Collins presented a heady mixture of Dylan Brel BrechtWeill John Lennon and Paul McCartney and Randy Newman songs A Strong Debussy Influence A year later the album Wildflowers yielded Miss Collins her first big hit singing Joni Mitchells Both Sides Now the song that established Miss Mitchell as a major pop composer Wildflowers also marked Miss Collinss debut as a writer with three original songs including the impressionistic Since You Asked the first of several songs with a strong Debussy influence Like all of Miss Collinss songs it was composed on the piano On Who Knows Where the Time Goes 1968 Miss Collins experimented further by using countryrock musicians and scored a sizable hit with Ian Tysons countryflavored Someday Soon From that album Miss Collinss song My Father has become something of a standard The album Judith 1975 mixed prerock chestnuts like Ill Be Seeing You with more recent rock songs like the Rolling Stones Salt of the Earth It also gave Miss Collins an international hit with Stephen Sondheims Send In the Clowns  Send In the Clowns was two years old when I first heard it Miss Collins recalls and Sinatra had already recorded it But as soon as I heard it I knew it belonged to me I have that feeling of deja vu sometimes about a song Its almost as though I knew it from another life A Dynamic Relationship Miss Collins has since recorded three more Sondheim songs The obscure and lovely I Remember Sky which was composed for the television musical Evening Primrose in 1966 is the high point of her Hard Times for Lovers album while her most recent album Running for My Life includes two songs from Sweeney Todd Miss Collins views her relationship to any song she sings as dynamic and constantly deepening First you have to know how to do what you want to do with a particular song she said Then theres the next step which is turning the song into your own If someone else were to choose the same material it would be a totally different experience where the personality of the singer stamps whatever it is and then you hear that person through the material One of the things that troubles me about writers who sing their own songs is that they often seem unable to interpret what they write very effectively because they cant take the necessary step back from it Its something I constantly have to remember myself Miss Collinss singing career has not been without its problems Four years ago she had a hemangioma removed from her left vocal cord And after she appeared on Saturday Night Live with a bad case of the flu there were reports that she had lost her voice Miss Collins says however that her recovery from the operation was perfect and that with voice lessons her range has expanded to a solid three octaves To protect her voice she now leads an abstinent life having completely given up smoking and drinking Miss Collins also remains staunchly political In the early 1960s she worked for voter registration in Mississippi and in the late 60s she was very active in the antiwar movement Writing Skills Honed Integration and the Vietnam War were the two great issues of my day she maintains More recently there has been the cause of abortion rights Musically Miss Collins continues to hone her own writing skills while keeping an eye out for young songwriting talent Her favorite young writer today is Hugh Prestwood who wrote the title song of her album before last Hard Times for Lovers Some other upandcoming writers she admires include Wendy Waldman a West Coast writer and Kate and Anna McGarrigle the Canadian sisters Next month Miss Collins is set to go into the studio with Arif Mardin the producer to cut her 19th album She will have performed many of the songs in concert for months ahead of time Perhaps the one artist

U.S. PERSONNEL CHIEF ASSAILS FREEZE ON EXECUTIVE SALARIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/30/us/us-personnel-chief-assails-freeze-on-executive-salaries.html,Thousands of Federal executives whose salaries are frozen at 50112 a year deserve raises but are not likely to get more money until the public thinks they have earned it according to the Administrations chief personnel officer Donald J Devine director of the Office of Personnel Management formerly the Civil Service Commission said the salary freeze for toplevel executives distorted the pay structure because supervisors earned no more than those they supervised Those workers continue climbing the pay scale until they reach the bosses level he said In the military colonels wind up making as much as generals and the same pattern holds in civilian ranks he said But as a matter of political reality Mr Devine said in an interview the Administration recognized an antibureaucrat mood in the public that ruled out raises until the Government performed on a promise to lower interest and inflation rates Negative Perception Maybe well have to see some payoff in terms of productivity going up and inflation going down Mr Devine said The general perception in the country of Federal employees and it is not one I support is very negative Besides he said a period of sweeping Government spending cuts is no time to raise Federal pay scales It is difficult to argue when youre cutting back benefits for people who make less than 50000 that you should offer more benefits to people who make more than 50000 he said Mr Devine characterized as overdrawn warnings that large numbers of talented people were leaving the Government because of the pay freeze He added however that he believed Federal managers were underpaid especially when compared with workers with similar duties outside the Government Pay compression is the most irrational part of the whole government system he said Raise May Worsen Matters A forthcoming 48 percent acrosstheboard increase which will be denied workers whose pay is frozen will worsen the system he added On other topics Mr Devine said that Government employees who struck would be immediately discharged as were the 12000 air traffic controllers That lesson has gotten through to unionized Government workers he said noting that postal employees approved a new contract by a 4to1 ratio despite calls by some local officials to reject it Mr Devine also called exaggerated reports that as many as 100000 Federal employees would lose their jobs because of spending cutbacks in the Reagan Administration budget He said 14000 would be closer to accurate Mr Devine who opposes abortion said he had decided to permit the Planned Parenthood Federation whose affiliates perform 70000 abortions a year to remain in the Combined Federal Campaign the annual charity drive among Government workers
HEAD OF YALE CALLS MORAL MAJORITY 'PEDDLERS OF COERCION' ON 'VALUES',https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/01/nyregion/head-of-yale-calls-moral-majority-peddlers-of-coercion-on-values.html,The president of Yale University attacked the Moral Majority and other conservative groups yesterday as peddlers of coercion in a radical assault on pluralism civil rights and religious and political freedoms in the United States A Bartlett Giamatti the university president also expressed concern that many of the nations political and religious leaders appeared to have been intimidated into silence by the Moral Majoritys appeals for a closed society as well as by increasing incidents of antiSemitism and the spreading activities of the Ku Klux Klan A selfproclaimed Moral Majority and its satellite or client groups cunning in the use of a native blend of old intimidation and new technology threaten the values of the nation Mr Giamatti told 1267 members of Yales entering freshman class of 1985 Angry at change rigid in the application of chauvinistic slogans absolutistic in morality they threaten through political pressure or public denunciation whoever dares to disagree with their authoritarian positions he said Using television direct mail and economic boycott they would sweep before them anyone who holds a different opinion The Moral Majority is a Christian fundamentalist political movement founded in 1979 by a television evangelist the Rev Jerry Falwell It espouses conservative views on a wide range of social religious and political issues and has lobbied against the proposed equal rights amendment abortion and civil rights for homosexuals A Key Role in Elections Mr Falwell is an outspoken supporter of President Reagan with whom he has shared speaking platforms and political experts say that the Moral Majority played a major role in last years elections Efforts to reach Mr Falwell or spokesmen for the Moral Majority by telephone last night were unavailing Mr Giamatti who is recuperating from a kidney stone operation last Monday left YaleNew Haven Hospital for his home yesterday and was unable to address the class in person The text of his remarks however was made public and sent in letters to the freshmen who begin classes tomorrow at New Haven A 43yearold former history professor who is the 18th president of Yale Mr Giamatti contended that the Moral Majority and similar groups were intent on destroying diversity of opinion in the United States Those voices of coercion speak not for liberty but for license the license to divide in the name of patriotism the license to deny in the name of Christianity he declared And they have licensed a new meanness of spirit in our land he said a resurgent bigotry that manifests itself in racist and discriminatory postures in threats of political retaliation in injunctions to censorship in acts of violence Mr Giamatti said that the values espoused by the Moral Majority  love of country a regard for the sanctity of life the importance of the family and high standards of personal conduct  were obviously not evil or pernicious and were held by millions of Americans The point is he said the rest of us hold to ideas of family country belief in God in different ways The right to differ and to see things differently is our concern From the maw of this morality  he continued come those who presume to know what justice for all is come those who presume to know which books are fit to read which television programs are fit to watch which textbooks will serve for all the young come spilling those who presume to know what God alone knows which is when human life begins Members of the Moral Majority and similar groups Mr Giamatti said profess to believe that they and they alone possess the truth There is no debate no discussion no dissent They know There is only one set of overarching political and spiritual and social beliefs whatever view does not conform to these views is by definition relativistic negative secular immoral against the family antifree enterprise unAmerican he said What nonsense What dangerous malicious nonsense Denials of Traditions What a shame more of our captains of commerce have not seized the opportunity to speak up for free enterprise Mr Giamatti observed What a shame such denials of our countrys deepest traditions of freedom of thought speech creed and choice are not faced candidly in open debate by our political and religious leaders The Yale president contended that the atmosphere fostered by the Moral Majority had created a resurgence of hating in public by the mad or the malevolent He quoted the AntiDefamation League of Bnai Brith as having said the number of reported antiSemitic episodes in the United States  vandalism arson and cemetery desecrations  had climbed by 192 percent last year to 377 from 129 in 1979 The tip of the iceberg grew in a way that sickened all decent Americans Mr Giamatti said Meantime he said the Ku Klux Klan had in its name or in league with others founded or revived paramilitary camps and training activities in Alabama California Connecticut Illinois North Carolina and Texas People who have no connection or sympathy with such forms of domestic terrorism nevertheless use the new atmosphere to apologize for other forms of terrorism Mr Giamatti said Or they fall silent when it is imperative precisely to speak out or they apologize for the excesses  the spiritual violence of evangelical or political fringe groups Two Sets of Books In such an atmosphere he said it becomes possible to keep two sets of books on civil liberties two sets of standards that can be applied as ones ideology demands rather than the single standard set forth by the Bill of Rights Mr Giamatti urged that the new mood not be dismissed as merely an inevitable swing to the right or a cyclic eruption of knownothingism Such explanations he said avoid what he called the primary issue The issue he asserted is that a reactionary mood preying on the fears of those who feel dispossessed by change and bypassed by complexity is growing and that there is a moral imperative rooted in Americas best traditions to identify it and call for a cleansing of the air
MORAL MAJORITY TERMS ATTACK BY YALE PRESIDENT A 'DIATRIBE',https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/02/nyregion/moral-majority-terms-attack-by-yale-president-a-diatribe.html,The Moral Majority yesterday denounced an attack by the president of Yale University as an unprovoked diatribe saying he had ignored the truth If I had done that kind of research for a class paper I would have flunked the course Cal Thomas a spokesman for the Moral Majority said in response to the text of an address sent to incoming freshmen by A Bartlett Giamatti the universitys president In the text which was released Monday Mr Giamatti attacked the Moral Majority and other conservative groups as peddlers of coercion in a radical assault on pluralism civil rights and religious and political freedoms in the United States Mr Giamatti also expressed concern that many of the nations political and religious leaders appeared to have been intimidated into silence by the Moral Majoritys appeals for a closed society as well as by increasing incidents of antiSemitism and the spreading activities of the Ku Klux Klan Founded in 1979 The Moral Majority is a Christian fundamentalist political movement founded in 1979 by the Rev Jerry Falwell a television evangelist It takes a conservative position on many social political and religious issues and has lobbied against the proposed equal rights amendment abortion and civil rights for homosexuals In a telephone interview from the organizations headquarters in Lynchburg Va  Mr Thomas denied that the Moral Majority had tried to coerce any one or to shut off opposing points of view Were for getting people involved he said Our people have not been involved before In the address which he was unable to deliver in person because of illness Mr Giamatti said the Moral Majority and similar groups were intent on destroying diversity of opinion He said they had spawned a resurgent bigotry that manifests itself in racist and discriminatory postures in threats of political retaliation in injunctions to censorship in acts of violence ProSemitic Organization Mr Thomas who termed the Giamatti speech an unprovoked diatribe said I would challenge him to provide one accurate quote from Dr Falwell that is either racist or antiSemitic We are one of the most proSemitic organizations in the country Mr Thomas said his organization had taken strong stands in support of Israel and the Jewish people And I have letters attacking us as Jewlovers to prove it he said As for charges of censorship Mr Thomas said We havent told anybody what books to read He said the Moral Majority had never been involved in screening books for public libraries He said the organization had pressed to have its point of view taught along with those of others in public schools because children were forced to read books there and the Moral Majority wanted to make sure its views were known We just want our side to be heard he said We want scientific creationism to be taught alongside of evolution the theory that man comes from primordial ooze a theory thats never been proven Scientific creationism according to its advocates draws on both the Bible and science to explain the creation of man Mr Thomas said the Moral Majority involved itself in television programming to seek a better balance than the violence and permissiveness that is broadcast now because TV is a guest in ones home The Rev Dan C Fore pastor of the Staten Island Bible Church and New York State chairman of the Moral Majority said of Mr Giamatti He probably means well but its just a matter of ignorance His statements are plain stupid to be honest Were not trying to coerce anyone Mr Fore said Were just trying to express a point of view Theyre denying us every right to the pluralism they say were trying to destroy

NOMINATION OF JUDGE O'CONNOR PROTESTED BY ABORTION FOES AT RALLY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/04/us/nomination-of-judge-o-connor-protested-by-abortion-foes-at-rally.html,While other antiabortion leaders and representatives of broadly based conservative organizations attacked the nomination of Sandra Day OConnor to the Supreme Court the Rev Jerry Falwell president of Moral Majority insisted today that it was too early to take a stand Speakers at a daylong Rally for Life abandoned plans to avoid direct attacks on the nominee an Arizona Appeals Court judge after it became clear that some featured participants would not hedge their comments But at an evening rally whose attendance of about 6000 people fell far short of the 10000 the organizers had expected the attacks on Judge OConnor again dwindled Edward E McAteer president of the sponsoring Religious Roundtable began the proceedings by attacking Judge OConnor at a news conference He insisted that her public record is one of consistent and unequivocal support of abortion He suggested that Judge OConnor had tried to conceal her proabortion voting record in the Arizona Legislature in her dealings with the Reagan Administration Judge OConnor has said she is personally opposed to abortion but has declined to discuss her votes on the issue Broken Promises Charged Howard W Phillips national director of the Conservative Caucus said the nomination suggested that President Reagan had broken his promises to appoint judges who opposed abortion Several speakers from antiabortion organizations joined in the attacks Then Mr Falwell arrived and began a news conference by saying that the rally is not as far as Im concerned and I think I am speaking for everyone else a meeting convened for the purpose of opposing Judge OConnor or in any way taking a position for or against her confirmation He said he would take no stand until the Senate hearings on her nomination scheduled to begin next Wednesday in Washington were completed The Rev James Robison another prominent evangelist stopped short of opposing Judge OConnor outright But he said her record raised very serious questions After a meeting with Mr Falwell Mr McAteer opened the evening rally by speaking at length against abortion but without mentioning Judge OConnor at all He explained later that he had only criticized her in the morning to set the tone for the session and had never intended to mention her at night The approaches here reflect differing political judgments within the conservative camp Leaders of some organizations have said privately they do not want to make an allout stand against the nomination because they expect it to be approved without much difficulty and they do not want to appear weak B ut others such as Peter Gemma Jr execut ive director of the National ProLife Action Committee have take n the nomination of someone with less than an absolute record of opposition to abortion as an affront Were mad e to look like fools Mr Gemma said Thats why were so angr y Reagan bends over backwards to please those who have something aga inst him There was often an intense air to the meeting Virginia Armstrong a political scientist from HardinSimmons University in Abilene Tex expressed a commonly repeated theme opening the afternoon seminars by proclaiming that abortion has grown to the proportions where a mothers womb is the most dangerous place in America
ABORTION CURBS FOUND TO HAVE LIMITED IMPACT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/04/us/abortion-curbs-found-to-have-limited-impact.html,A law that nearly eliminated the use of Federal Medicaid funds for abortions has had little effect on the number of abortions obtained by poor women according to a Federal study to be published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association Nor has the Congressional restriction on abortion funds known as the Hyde Amendment resulted in an increase in illegal abortions or in large numbers of unwanted births according to the report by the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta These findings stem largely from the fact that the vast majority of women who seek abortions live in states that have continued to provide funds for abortions for medically indigent women said Dr Willard Cates Jr chief of the Abortion Surveillance Branch at the agency who prepared the report Able to Obtain Money Even among those 15 percent of women at risk who lived in states that restricted abortion funds the majority of the women managed to come up with the money Dr Cates said in a telephone interview yesterday But in those states about 20 percent of women wanting abortions continued their unwanted pregnancies to term and an estimated 4 percent obtained illegal abortions The data dont support the fears of the prochoice groups that large numbers of lowincome women would be forced to resort to illegal or selfinduced abortions or the hopes of the prolife groups that restricting funds would lead to more pregnancies being continued to term Dr Cates said in the interview Of the nearly 300000 Medicaideligible women estimated to have wanted an abortion in the year after the amendment took effect in August 1977 about 94 percent obtained one Dr Catess analysis indicates About 65 percent of the women had abortions paid for by state Medicaid funds and 29 percent used other sources of financing including private finances clinic subsidies and philanthropic donations About 5 percent of the women who might have sought abortions before the Hyde Amendment went into effect continued their pregnancies to term resulting in an estimated 14000 births and only 1 percent resorted to illegal or selfinduced abortions Dr Cates found In the states that continued Medicaid financing for abortions nearly 98 percent of the women who sought an abortion obtained one according to the study Only 2 percent had their babies and less than 1 percent had an illegal abortion the report said These states accounted for 85 percent of the Medicaidfinanced abortions They include New York and California where half of the nations Medicaid abortions are performed According to Richard Lincoln vice president of the Alan Guttmacher Institute a nonprofit family planning research agency the Hyde Amendment has been a source of great frustration to the RighttoLife movement because it hasnt affected the number of abortions much at all Its just made it much more difficult for women most in need of abortions to get them and made it impossible for some However Dr John C Willke presiden t of t he National RighttoLife Committee a major force behind the Hyde Amendment said The prime purpose of the Hyde Amendme nt was to take the Government out of the business of paying for the killing of unborn babies Government funding legitimizes this k illing in the minds of many people We realized that many women woul d find other means of financing abortions 13 Million Abortions In the fiscal year 1977 before the Hyde Amendment took effect 13 million abortions were performed in the United States Of those abortions 295000 or about onefourth were obtained by lowincome women and paid for by a combination of state and Federal Medicaid funds The amendmen t sponsored by Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois restricted Federal funds to those abortions done to save the womans life to prevent severe and longlasting physical heal th damage to the woman and to terminate pregnancies resulting fro m rape or incest The amendment was later modified to eliminate all Federal abortion funds except when the womans life wasin danger Dr Catess analysis showed that in the two years after the amendment took effect there were 6000 federally financed abortions as against 600000 that would have been expected had the amendment not been approved Of those 6000 abortions 82 percent were done to protect the womans life 16 percent to protect her health and only 2 percent for rape or incest Thus Dr Cates said the fears of the prolife groups that the physical health damage clause would result in large numbers of abortions were unfounded
STRUGGLE ON ABORTION SHIFTS TO STATES; News An alysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/05/us/struggle-on-abortion-shifts-to-states-news-an-alysis.html,An analysis published yesterday points up a number of aspects about abortion in this country that were not apparent when Federal funds were drastically diminished by a new law in 1977 Then many of those opposing abortion expected that the severe restriction of federally financed abortions would result in significantly fewer abortions some estimated that the number of abortions would be reduced by 25 percent This would have bee n a significant victory for those who opposed abo rtion Those who favored giving women the option of abortion saw only catastrophe a blood bath some said that would come about when desperate women returned to unsafe methods of terminating unwanted pregnancies But as the analysis by the Federal Centers for Disease Control indicates there was no full realization at the time of how deeply ingrained the abortion option had become for many poor women in the United States prompting them to seek safe abortions wherever they could find them Nor was there a full realization that all state governments would not automatically follow in the Federal footsteps Reaction After Amendment The analysis showed that after the new law ended Federal Medicaid funds for abortion in August 1977 the vast majority of poor women facing unwanted pregnancies obtained abortions financed by state Medicaid funds But even in those states that restricted funds for abortion twothirds of the women at risk managed to find a way to pay for their abortions The abortion option is not readily relinquished particularly by poor women for whom another child is not just an inconvenience but a catastrophe remarked Richard Lincoln vice president of the Alan Guttmacher Institute a nonprofit agency that sponsors family planning research Many undoubtedly sacrificed money for food and clothing to come up with the 200 that an early abortion costs For most this was more than their monthly welfare check Still if all public abortion funds were cut off in all states as well as on the Federal level the analysis suggests that there would be a substantial increase in the number of unwanted births and illegal abortions The analysis prepared by Dr Willard Cates of the disease control center and published in The Journal of the American Medical Association showed that only 15 percent of the women estimated to need abortions lived in states that restricted abortion funds in the two years after the new law was put into effect Projecting the rates of unwanted births 5 percent and illegal abortions 1 percent among these women to the nation as a whole if no states provided abortion funds there would be approximately 75000 unwanted births and 15000 illegal abortions among poor women each year Projected Impact Since the period covered by Dr Catess analysis four states that had been paying for Medicaid abortions stopped doing so These states accounted for about 10 percent of the total number of Medicaid abortions before the new law took effect Thus an analysis done in 1981 would probably result in a somewhat higher number of unwanted births among the poor than Dr Cates determined Nine states including New York and the District of Columbia voluntarily provide Medicaid funds for abortion In addition in California and Massachusetts state supreme courts ruled that restrictions on abortion funds violated the state constitutions And Pennsylvania and New Jersey are under temporary injunctions to continue financing Medicaid abortions Together these states accounted for nearly 85 percent of the abortions that had been publicly financed before the new law sponsored by Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois But Dr John Willke president of the National RighttoLife Committee the prime mover behind abortion restrictions expresses satisfaction with the course of events He sees the antiabortion movement as slowly succeeding in getting the government out of this grisly business With Federal Medicai d funds for abortion gone the committee is nowpressing for passage of an amendment sponsored by Representative JohnM Ashbrook an Ohio Republican which would eliminate the 25000 abortions fin anced under the Federal Employees Health Insurance program Furthermore 37 states have either passed their own Hyde Amendments or have chosen to conform to Federal policy These include six states that never provided Medicaidfinanced abortions and many that had never paid for a significant number of abortions Even if all state money were withdrawn however it would probably not mean the end of abortion financing for the poor In some states that restrict Medicaid abortions a number of municipal hospitals such as Grady Hospital in Atlanta have continued to finance large numbers of abortions for women who cannot afford to pay As long as abortions remain legal it appears that women even the poor will find ways to obtain them safely

different image not a crossroads but a cloverleaf the intersection of various intellectual superhighways The authors are sociologists but their perspective extends miles beyond that of the specialist They offer a view of the onramps the historical origins of sociology and its development in Europe and America the connecting links to history philosophy ethics and religion and the offramps the disciplines possible futures The authors main concern is to reaffirm the original integrity of the sociological way of seeing  the attempt to be as scientific as possible about a universe that is made up of human meanings not natural phenomena Because human meanings must be interpreted in their own subjective terms as well as those of science the authors reject as too rigid the positivistic ideal of a hard science But they also reject the notion that social science is therefore incapable of objectivity and might as well attach itself to this or that political ideology They particularly reject the Marxist concept of sociology as a theoretical system capable of providing definitive answers to the problems of social existence given the variability of human meanings and the obligat ion of science to doubt its own hypotheses such utopianism becomes n ot an offramp but a dead end The authors are superb writers and judging from the clarity and humor of their exposition remarkable teachers as well Their only vice is related to these virtues namely a tendency to illustrate points with a kind of armchair sociology that appears whimsical and unsupported when compared with the careful probing way of seeing they so elegantly affirm IM NOT A WOMENS LIBBER BUT  And Other Confessions of a Christian Feminist By Anne Bowen Follis 128 pp Nashville Abingdon 795 A bit breathless and quick to resolve weighty questions of philosophy and theology Anne Folliss book is nonetheless earnest and thoughtful Presumably it is intended for an audience of women much like the author herself devoutly Christian homemakers who feel torn and confused by the extreme and sometimes vicious controversy surrounding the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment Basically sympathetic to the aims and values of the Moral Majority yet not unaffected by the womens movement Mrs Follis has refused to take sides preferring to try in the privacy of her own mind to reconcile the two As the fruit of that effort this book makes a good case for the compatibility of Scripture and equality for women  a case well made against the more zealously religious antifeminists But it does not explain why the ERA is the sole or best way to achieve that equality It passes far too lightly over too many issues focusing exclusively on the legal status of married women in certain states citing evidence that is scanty and occasionally outdated As a political argument therefore the book is superficial But as a personal statement it is peculiarly affecting  especially in locating those aspects of the womens movement most likely to strike home among homemakers It combines common sense religious fervor and womanly selfassertion in a way that is both intriguing and reassuring Intriguing because it weighs each idea according to genuine feelings and principles and reassuring because it suggests that even in the most polarized situations there are ordinary American citizens who in spite of the fanatics on both sides continue to think for themselves THE FUTILITY OF FAMILY POLICY By Gilbert Y Steiner 220 pp Washington The Brookings Institution Cloth 1595 Paper 595 This book will be of interest to anyone who has ever wished the government would do something about the breakdown of the American family The sentiment has acquired a familiar ring especially since the time of the Carter Administration which advocated it often But as Gilbert Steiner repeatedly argues government policy toward the family is mor e easily advocated than executed Mr Steiners thesis is that family stability is an abstract good like peace or justice which enjoys a consensus only insofar as it remains abstract Once specifics are addressed the consensus divides into factions organized groups lobbying for the rights of women the interests of children the prerogatives of parents the authority of husbands the needs of the aged In careful detail Mr Steiner describes the inception and eventual breakup of policy initiatives on several fronts abortion teenage pregnancy child care and support welfare foster care and domestic violence Taken together the cases more than amply illustrate the point As a writer Mr Steiner a fellow at the Brookings Institution stands head and shoulders above the policyanalysis crowd Laden with facts and figures not to mention the jargon of the field his prose is nonetheless coherent even witty But the book suffers from problems of structure and scope Instead of being organized along the lines of its argument it is sectioned off issue by issue with the argument reiterated in each section The effect of this is to trivialize other themes that arise for example the interesting interplay between social scientists government bureaucrats and politicians or the climate of increasing skepticism toward government action in general Both have bearing on the fate of family policy yet neither receives the exhaustive treatment accorded Mr Steiners thesis By the end especially after a final section that recapitulates both thesis and evidence the reader wishes that a work of such length and detail would choose to take on more than one idea SCHOOLS ON TRIAL An Inside Account of the Boston Desegregation Case By Robert A Dentler and Marvin B Scott Illustrated 244 pp Cambridge Abt Books 25 The Boston desegregation case was one year old in late 1974 when Judge Arthur Garrity appointed the authors then dean and assistant dean of education at Boston University to aid with the plan for the second year After months of bitter conflict many people in Boston hoped to find a solution through better planning and implementation Along with the authors the court appointed two other educators two lawyers and an army of researchers Phase II the plan they produced in spring 1975 has been praised by observers on both sides of the issue as a reasonable compromise Unfortunately it foundered on the political rocks The plaintiffs demanded more the School Department cooperated less and during the summer the judge ordered the whole thing redrawn It was but one step in a process whose legal sociological political and educational ramifications cry out for sober and informed analysis This book does not respond to that cry Opponents of busing will be disappointed by the way their views are set up as straw men to be knocked down with puffs of rhetoric But the issue is still so polarized it may be unreasonable to seek a responsible presentation of the antibusing case in a book by proponents The chief fault of the book is the way it presents its own case It is aptly titled an inside account because that is where the authors remain on the inside They are more concerned with defining their own position relative to the micropolitical squabbles surrounding Phase II than with looking at the wider situation The legal and educational justifications for court action are clumsily articulated in scattered places throughout the text The sociological and political realities of Boston are distorted or ignored especially the history of YankeeIrish conflict so crucial to any understanding of the city It is extraordinary in fact that social scientists could permit themselves the kind of sneering sarcasm the authors direct toward the Irish Catholics of Boston They do their profession a disservice Yet the book is unique in its thorough and detailed account of the micropolitics of the most famous Northern desegregation case As such it will be indispensable when the time comes for others to answer the crying need for sober and informed analysis of the larger issues
THE 'COLORADO MAFIA' PUTS ITS STAMP ON THE GOVERNMENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/06/weekinreview/the-colorado-mafia-puts-its-stamp-on-the-government.html,DENVER WHEN Ronald Reagan began putting together his Administration last year many were surprised by the number of appointments going to Colorado Republicans First there was James G Watt the Denver lawyer picked as Interior Secretary Then Mr Reagan tapped Bob Burford a thirdgeneration rancher to serve under Mr Watt as director of the Bureau of Land Management Finally there was Anne M Gorsuch a Denver attorney who had served with Mr Burford in the state legislature She was named to head the Environmental Protection Agency Not only were they all from the same sparsely populated state but the trio Mr Reagan had chosen to oversee the management and protection of natural resources public lands and environment were ideological soulmates fiercely conservative proponents of less Federal intervention more power to state and local governments and a freer hand for private enterprise Indeed the three were quickly dubbed the Colorado mafia and its widely believed that the man behind the scenes was none other than Joseph Coors the conservative brewer from Golden Colo who is one of Mr Reagans closest confidants If there is such a thing as a C olorado mafia said a Republican politician in Denver then there is no doubt that Joe Coors is the godfather But even Mr Coors will have little power to influence the controversy surrounding Mr Watt Last week there was yet more potential trouble bubbling up with the disclosure that Mr Watt was considering reversing a Carter Administration ruling and allowing strip mining on land adjacent to Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah Environmentalists feared that such a decision could lead to much more extensive development all over the West Mrs Gorsuch may also be increasingly thrust into the spotlight Democratic Congressmen and environmentalists charged last week that despite her assurances to the contrary her agency is drafting legislation that would severely weaken the Clean Air Act An agency spokesman denied the charges but Henry Waxman the California Democrat who heads the subcommittee that will consider revisions in the law accused the Administration of talking out of both sides of its mouth Mr Coors for his part generally avoids publicity He politely declines to discuss a role in the elevation of Mr Watt and the others rather he has noted through a spokesman that he was pleased at Colorados getting three of its own into such jobs But most Colorado observers believe that Mr Watt was a clear first choice of Mr Coors When he was tapped for Interior Mr Watt was president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation a public interest group that has intervened on behalf of energy developers seeking to open public land to private development Mr Coors founded the organization in 1977 and has subsidized it heavily While the ties between Mr Coors and Mrs Gorsuch and Mr Burford are less clear both appointees were allied with a rockribbed conservative faction in the Colorado legislature that wrested control from more moderate Republicans in 1978 Coors in Kitchen Cabinet But there is probably no greater evidence of Mr Coors influence than what happened to Mary Estill Buchanan who did not become the head of the Federal Trade Commission as some of Mr Reagans advisers proposed last spring Mrs Buchanan who as Colorado Secretary of State is the highestranking elected Republican in an otherwise Democratic administration bucked the wishes of Mr Coors and other conservative Republicans last year by mounting a petition drive to win the Republican nomination for United States Senator Mrs Buchanan already on the outs with conservatives because of her stand on abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment then lost in the general election Political sour ces say that when she became first choice to hea d the trade commission Mr Coors moved quickly to quashthe appointme nt with a phone call to the White House Later Mr Coors reporte dly told Mrs Buchanan that her future in Colorado Republican po litics was limited Among Colorado Republican moderates who could easily be accused of wishful thinking there is some hope that Mr Coors influence in the Administration will wane if the President decides to move away from the kind of conservative interests that Mr Coors represents The fact that he was not named to a Cabinet post is raised to suggest that the President is seeking to put some distance between himself and Mr Coors But that is clearly the minority view Others say Mr Coors himself has eschewed any formal position in the Government in favor of a backstage role in the Reagan kitchen cabinet They reason that being able to place Coloradans in positions to shape public policy outweighs the attractions of say being named Secretary of Commerce An examination of Administration rosters suggests that people favored by Mr Coors are indeed dispersed throughout the Federal Government A former state Republican chairman Phil Winn is Assistant Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and Coloradans have been nailing down a disproportionate number of the appointments to run the offices of Federal agencies based in Denver and charged with overseeing programs over a sixstate region The regional directors of the Agency for Volunteer Service as well as the Departments of Health and Human Services the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency have all gone to or are expected to go to conservative Republican politicans from Colorado Three of them are former state legislators who were closely allied with Mrs Gorsuch and Mr Burford in the state house
HADASSAH'S WORKS GAIN DESPITE INCREASING COSTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/06/nyregion/hadassah-s-works-gain-despite-increasing-costs.html,Since the 67th annual convention last month of Hadassah the Womens Zionist Organization of America the groups awareness of the challenges facing Israel has sharpened officials of the organization say In particular they say the conventions 3000 delegates left the New York Hilton Hotel with a clearer sense of the financial difficulties of running the huge Hadassah Medical Organization in Israel at a time of continuing inflation there and tight Government budgets Yet Hadassah whose 374000 members make it the largest such volunteer association in the United States is still attracting new members and larger contributions at a time when other American charities say they believe their funds are endangered Moreover according to Hadassahs president who is now in Israel its activities there remain vigorous despite the periodic need as now to reevaluate its costly commitments to health care Most of its activities in the United States involve education When reached by telephone late last week in Jerusalem the president Frieda S Lewis of Great Neck LI said also that she and her organization looked forward to the visit to Washington this week of the Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin She said it was hoped that Mr Begins visit would advance Hadassahs desires for Israel for more progress toward peace in the spirit of the Camp David talks and for cancellation of the proposed sale of 85 billion worth of American weapons to Saudi Arabia Surprised by Optimism Mrs Lewis added that she had another cause for hope about Hadassahs interests I am always pleasantly surprised by the optimism of the people here she said despite the troubling impressions that the organizations members in the United States sometimes get of Israels contentious politics and vulnerability Mrs Lewis was elected to a second oneyear term during Hadassahs convention Aug 9 through Aug 12 She is in Israel both as a delegate to a meeting of the World Zionist Organization and to look after her own groups affairs It was announced last month that Hadassah had raised 37 million in private contributions over the past year The group founded in 1912 helps finance two large teaching and research hospitals several clinics the Hadassah Community College the Seligsberg Brandeis Comprehensive High School the Hadassah Vocational Guidance Institute Youth Aliyah an immigrants welfare organization and other projects The medical facilities are the groups costliest responsibility and the convention voted to devote at least 15 million to them this year The medical organizations total budget is 63 million and it is financed p artly by the Israeli Government A Call for Stringent Economy The organizations convention also voted to give 23 million to Youth Aliyah 15 million to its educational and vocational projects in Israel and 700000 to the Jewish National Fund This years budget in the United States mostly for educational work is 6 million These figures are expected to be expanded by further contributions over the coming year Mrs Kahn said Bernice S Tannenbaum director of the Hadassah Medical Organization announced last month that its healthcare operations would have to carry out stringent economies and set certain principles in its relations with Israels Government in order to sustain Hadassahs high medical standards while cutting costs The HadassahHebrew University Medical Center in Jerusalem has 4000 employees Recent economy moves according to Lenore Kahn Hadassahs director of public relations have included limiting services for about 240 hospital beds of a total of 1100 beds to geriatric care Mrs Tannenbaum also said the organization needed to institute a feeforservice approach and to emphasize some medical specialties at the expense of others She said that enlar ging the organizations endowment was the only way to make an academi c hospital independent Growth Has Slowed After meetings with Israels ministers of health and finance among others Mrs Lewis Hadassahs president said of its medical activities We want to keep the innovative pathfinding status She added that Hadassahs healthcare programs were no longer growing like Topsy and that the organization was reevaluating its work At the convention Hadassah extended a formal farewell to its medical director for the past 30 years Dr Kalman J Mann who has retired The new director is Dr Shmuel Penchas a graduate of Hadassahs medical school The organizations convention also awarded its annual Henrietta Szold Award to Ida Nudel the Jewish rights activist in the Soviet Union who is now in Siberia after demanding to be allowed to emigrate to Israel to join her sister It was the first time the award had been given in absentia The group adopted statements on American political issues including support for freedom of individual choice on abortion passage of the equal rights amendment extension of the Voting Rights Act stronger gun controls and steps to make the United States less dependent on imported oil The convention expressed concern over what it called threats to the separation of church and state and over the harm that Administration budget cuts might cause to the countrys disadvantaged It stated that antiIsrael and antiZionist propaganda in Europe and at the United Nations was a direct cause of what it perceived as increasing antiSemitism in this country and elsewhere President Reagan sent the convention a traditional Presidential message of support Political figures who addressed the delegates included Senator Paul S Sarbanes Democrat of Maryland and Senator Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon Governor Carey Mayor Koch and New Yorks Republican Senator Alfonse M DAmato also spoke
RIGHT WING SEEKS A SHIFT BY REAGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/06/us/right-wing-seeks-a-shift-by-reagan.html,The political right is demanding that the Reagan Administration turn its attention from economic legislation to moral issues such as abortion and prayer in schools Edward A McAteer president of the Religious Roundtable which sponsored an antiabortion rally in Dallas on Thursday began a press briefing on the session by declaring With Congressional passage of the Presidents tax bill the Administration has accomplished the foremost goal on its agenda Now it is imperative that top priority be given to the moral issues facing our nation particularly legislation to protect preborn human lives The White House and Republican leaders in Congress have largely fended off such demands since January arguing that budget and tax bills were of greater urgency But their succ ess on those matters andsome conservative unhappiness over the nomina tion of Judge Sandra Day OConnor to the Supreme Court appears to have fueled increasing pressure through mailings rallies and lobby ing for a renewed commitment to the emotional issues that matte r deeply to many consusvatives Other Difficult Issues The pressure comes at an awkward time for the Administration which is still facing economic and budget problems as well as confronting a range of other difficult legislative issues from the sale of aircraft to Saudi Arabia to Social Security to the Clean Air Act The White House may soon move to reduce some of that pressure James A Baker 3d assistant to the President said last week The Administration will be taking positions on some of the social issues coming before Congress thereby fulfilling some of the Presidents campaign commitments But one tactical difficulty will be to do that forcefully enough to soothe the right but not so dramatically that these issues appear to be President Reagans dominant interests A White House official said there was no intention of appearing to advance a highprofile broadbased agenda in this area When conservative leaders gathered in Dallas for the antiabortion rally one of their bestknown figures sought to reassure the political right of Mr Reagans intentions The Rev Jerry Falwell president of Moral Majority said he expected that Mr Reagan would soon be taking stands on the moral and the social issues Compromise Amendment Hinted One approach a wellplaced Administration source said might be to support a compromise constitutional amendment on abortion one that would not prohibit the operations outright but would restore to the states the right to ban them While some antiabortion leaders would adamantly reject that approach Mr Falwell said his reaction would be that half a loaf is better than none However the White House and Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the Senate majority leader deal with the situation conservatives are increasingly demanding more attention to their priorities Senator Baker indeed acknowledged in late spring that his desire to keep all those emotional issues off the Senate floor until this fall or next year was being abandoned The Rev James Robison a Dallas evangelist with a national television following said he felt the time had come when the President needs to step in and take a little heat on these issues heat that until now has been directed largely at leaders like Mr Falwell Others echoed those arguments One of the convictions held by the political right is that it was not the economy or the failures of the Carter Administration that got Mr Reagan elected but abortion and school prayer Getting Voters to Polls Connaught Marshner chairman of the National ProFamily Coalition and chairman of the Family Policy Advisory Board in the Reagan campaign insisted Thursday that even if voters told polltakers that the economy was the biggest issue before the nation the moral issues were what got them to the polls in the first place Mrs Marshner and other speakers such as Paul M Weyrich executive director of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress contended that White House and Administration officials did not understand the kind of voter who was motivated by those issues Mr Weyrich told the rally that the very idea of voters motivated by noneconomic issues is beyond their comprehension One of the bluntest arguments being made is expressed by Peter Gemma execut ive director of the National ProLife Political Action Committee Wh ile he was most angered over the nomination of Judge OConnor he argued that the political right in general should be asking of Mr Reagan What have you done for me lately The dissatisfaction is not at a constant level Richard A Viguerie the direct mail entrepreneur on whom many conservatives depend has denounced the OConnor nomination bitterly But in an interview yesterday he said that his only further demand of the Reagan Administration was a veto of legislation extending the life of the Legal Services Corporation If we get that he said thats all were looking for And the restiveness with Mr Reagan is hardly unanimous Mr Viguerie said I am very very happy with this President Mr Falwell even though he said questions needed to be asked about Judge OConnor and opposed the sale of surveillance aircraft to Saudi Arabia said of Mr Reagan Hes the greatest President weve had in my lifetime and history may say the greatest President ever
"Civil Courts, Uncivil Campaigns",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/07/opinion/civil-courts-uncivil-campaigns.html,The most important point to make about the contests for Civil Court Judge in Thursdays Democratic primary is that they shouldnt be taking place at all Though New York State has elected most of its judges since the mid19th century the legal community has become uneasy with the process in recent years for good reason Many judgeships are decided well before Election Day in political party clubhouses But even genuinely contested elections are a dubious way to choose judges The outcomes of two such contested races in this years primary campaign are likely to be decisive in November In Manhattan Harold Tompkins Salvatore Fiorella and Jeffry Gallet are running in the 6th Judicial District in Brooklyn Barry Hurowitz and Ira Harkavy seek a boroughwide seat In the Manhattan race Mr Tompkins wins our endorsement as the best of three wellqualified candidates His long career as litigator Federal prosecutor and Assistant State Attorney General gives him a maturity and depth of experience not shared by his opponents The Brooklyn race presents a curious issue Mr Hurowitz a highly qualified candidate already serves as a Civil Court Judge He won his seat as an independent and resists an alliance with the party organization Though his current term runs for five more years he seeks reelection only to gain early renewal of his lease on the bench His opponent Mr Harkavy however presents a more serious problem He has a commendable record as a lawyer and civic leader but the judiciary committee of the city bar association refused to approve his candidacy citing his distribution of misleading campaign literature in an earlier judicial campaign We endorse Mr Hurowitz Mr Harkavys difficulty illustrates a strong reason to question election of judges The pressures of politics hardly encourage appropriate judicial behavior In addition most voters are unfamiliar with the various kinds of judges let alone the qualifications of individual candidates There is a fatal flaw even in the theoretical argument that a campaign might serve to educate the public The state code of judicial ethics forbids judges to comment publicly on matters that might come before them in court If somebody asks how I stand on abortion says one judicial candidate I have to say Sorry I cant answer that  and I lose the vote In 1977 the state began selecting Appeals Court Judges by merit A bipartisan commission nominates candidates for the Governor to appoint Mayor Koch also uses a merit system to select judges for Criminal and Family Court The concept should apply to the entire judiciary

REAGAN APPROVES CUTS OF $10-15 BILLION FOR 1982,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/09/us/reagan-approves-cuts-of-10-15-billion-for-1982.html,Congress which left town exhausted after a long hardfought dispute over Federal spending and tax policies will return from its summer recess tomorrow to face a cluster of difficult issues and a new confrontation with President Reagan After a White House meeting today with his top economic advisers Mr Reagan authorized an Administration move to trim an additional 10 billion to 15 billion from the budget for the next fiscal year as a way of holding the deficit to 425 billion To achieve the new cuts the President is expected to propose a legislative innovation as sweeping as his budget and tax plans an omnibus appropriation bill which would afford a yesorng vote on an entire package of cuts rather than a piecemeal approach in which legislators would be subject to constituent pressures The Next Battlefront The appropriations front is the next battlefront said Edwin L Dale Jr a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget Although economic problems are expected to dominate the fall session the lawmakers will also turn their attention to other issues The Senate will weigh confirmation of the first woman nominated to the Supreme Court and consider whether to expel Senator Harrison A Williams Jr Democrat of New Jersey the only Senator to be convicted on charges resulting from the Federal Bureau of Investigations Abscam investigation Congress will also consider a controversial Middle East arms sale proposed revisions of the Clean Air Act extension of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 restructuring of the Social Security System a farm bill and revision of Federal regulatory procedures In addition conservatives in Congress will press for action on social issues including abortion school prayer busing and a family protection act intended to reinforce traditional moral values Operational Funds Needed The most pressing legislative need will be the appropriation of funds to continue Government operations beyond Sept 30 when the current fiscal year expires This the final step in the Federal budget process was delayed by battles last spring over the budget resolution in which Congress approved a spending ceiling of 6955 billion against Mr Reagans request of 6954 billion An omnibus appropriation bill would be in line with David A Stockmans dictum that Congress is more conservative than the sum of its parts Mr Stockman director of the Office o f Management and Budget who is a former Representative fr om Michigan has also said There is no such thing as a fiscal co nservative when it comes to his district or his subcommittee One legislator Robert Michel of Illinois the House Republican leader suggested today that Mr Reagan be given special powers for a year by Congress to impound funds that have already been appropriated by the Senate and House The outcome of the battle over new cuts will determine whether President Reagan who won a series of legislative victories on his budget and tax packages can continue his mastery over the Democraticcontrolled House and the Republicandominated Senate Congressional Democrats still looking for their first major victory in the 97th Congress are expected to campaign against additional cuts in social programs while supporters of military spending are apprehensive about proposals to slow the growth in the military budget President Likely to Get His Way House Democratic leaders are committed to opposing additional cuts in social pro grams but few are betting against the President The President is still in the saddle said Representative Stephen J Solarz a lib eral Brooklyn Democrat who serves on the Budget Committee  Hes likely to get his way on the next round of cuts Nor are opponents sanguine about their ability to block the sale to Saudi Arabia of 85 billion worth of weaponry including five Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft called Awacs Last June 54 of the 100 Senators including 20 Republicans and 252 of the 435 House members expressed opposition to the sale which can be blocked by a majority vote in both chambers by Oct 30 Mr Reagans popularity is such that even Senator Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon who is a leading opponent of the sale has conceded that a determined Presidential effort would probably prevail on the Awacs issue Far less of a contest is expected over the confirmation of Sandra Day OConnor the Arizona Court of Appeals judge nominated to the Supreme Court The initial opposition by antiabortion groups who disapproved of her voting record as an Arizona legislator has not picked up much steam Words to Soothe Conservatives Judge OConnor meanwhile has been soothing conservative fears by expressing her opposition to judicial activism saying that judges are ill equipped to substitute their views for those of the executive or legislative branches of government The Senate will also consider whether to expel a Senator for the first time since the Civil War The Senate Select Committee on Ethics has recommended waiting action on Senator Williams until a Federal district judge disposes of certain appeals relating to the trial of the Senator who was convicted of trying to help a bogus Arab sheik obtain favorable Government contracts in exchange for shares in a titanium mine and processing facility Congress will also consider easing the Clean Air Act in accordance with a set of principles submitted by the President last August The 11 principles would continue the nations progress toward cleaner air but at a more reasoned pace according to Anne M Gorsuch administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency But Representative Henry A Waxman Democrat of California chairman of the Health and Environment Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee called the principles a dangerous retreat from current progress toward cleaner air The principles call for continuing the current method of setting air pollution standards without applying a test of the costs against the benefits but with the standards based on sound scientific data Voting Act Extension Congress will also consider extending the enforcement provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 The President has said that he expects to support full extension of the legislation with only minor modifications Although he originally supported a Southern move to make some sections of the law nationwide instead of applying primarily to Southern states the President now says that such a change would make the law too cumbersome The Administration plans to introduce legislation to protect the solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund as well as legislation to aid those who are truly needy but who lost benefits with the elimination of the 122amonth minimum Social Security benefit Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress are committed to swiftly enacting legislation to ameliorate the unintended hardships of the elimination of the minimum benefit A farreaching revision of Federal regulatory procedures will reach the Senate floor this fall according to the Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr Republican of Tennessee The bill would require Federal regulators to analyze the costs and b enefits of major rules those that would cost businesses 100 million a year to comply with and require regulators to pick the least cost ly alternative The billwould also allow crossexamination of witness es in informal agency proceedings and erase the benefit of the doub t now given to regulatory agencies in court challenges Conservatives Social Issues Congressional conservatives who have chafed under a quarter century of Democratic rule of both houses intend to press for action this fall on a broad front of social issues Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah who is chairman of the Labor and Human and Resources Committee has announced that he will introduce a constitutional amendment to give the states full discretion on abortion laws Other conservative Republican senators including Jesse A Helms and John P East of North Carolina and Strom Thurmo nd of South Carolina wil l press for legislative action on school prayer and busing A hum an life bill that would protect the rights of the unbornfrom the mome nt of conception has already been introduced as has a family protec tion act which would give parents more control over activities su ch as sex education The White House had sought to keep the social issues in the background so it could focus the nations attention on the

the professional qualifications required of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States despite a relative lack of extensive or challenging judicial experience a committee of the American Bar Association told the Senate Judiciary Committee today The bar associations Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary submitted its appraisal which was solicited by the Judiciary Committee on the eve of Judge OConnors confirmation hearings The Judiciary Committee will conduct three days of hearings beginning tomorrow and is expected to recommend that the 51yearold Arizona Court of Appe als judge be confirmed to the Supreme Court seat vacatedtwo months ag o by Associate Justice Potte r Stewart The bar association committee examined three aspects of Judge OConnors professional qualifications judicial temperament integrity and professional competence On the basis of interviews with lawyers judges law school professors and deans Arizona legislators and Judge OConnor herself the 14member committee unanimously concluded that the nominee meets the highest standards of judicial temperament and integrity View of Professional Competence The committees appraisal of Judge OConnors professional competence was less enthusiastic Her professional experience to date the committees report noted of Judge OConnors six years on the Arizona state bench has not been as extensive or challenging as that of some other persons who might be available for appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States The bar committee submitted Judge OConnors judicial opinions and published articles to practicing lawyers and law school professors Those consulted expressed differing views concerning the strength of her opinion writing the report said adding that because the cases involved questions of state rather than Federal law the opinions did not involve the elaborate legal analysis or complex social issues often found in Supreme Court decisions However the report said the opinions are competently written and her writing style is clear and logical The report concluded After considering her outstanding academic record her demonstrated intelligence and her service as a legislator a lawyer and a trial and appellate judge the committee is of the opinion that she is qualified from the standpoint of professional competence for appointment to the Supreme Court Committee Members First The confirmation hearings begin tomorrow with opening statements by several of the Judiciary Committees 18 members Judge OConnor will probably not be called until the afternoon and is expected to spend all day Thursday answering the senators questions The committee will spend Friday listening to 25 outside witnesses Public television and radio here will cover the proceedings A spokesman for WNET Channel 13 in New York said today that the station did not plan to broadcast the hearings Among scheduled witnesses are elected officials from Arizona where Judge OConnor served as majority leader of the state senate The officials including Gov Bruce Babbitt are expected to endorse the nomination warmly Leaders of religious and antiabortion groups are expected to speak against Judge OConnor including the Rev Charles Fiore chairman of the National ProLife Political Action Committee and Dr Carolyn Gerster vice president of the National Right to Life Committee Another witness the Rev Carl McIntire of the International Council of Christian Churches is organizing a demonstration against the nomination on Capitol Hill tomorrow as is an antiabortion organization called March for Life Voting Record in Arizona While Judge OConnor according to the White House told President Reagan that abortion was especially abhorrent to her her voting record in the Arizona State Senate reflects something less than implacable opposition to abortion As a result antiabortion groups and the socalled religious right have campaigned strenuously against the nomination accusing President Reagan of violating campaign promises to appoint only foes of abortion to the High Court The OConnor Report a publication started by Richard A Viguerie the conservative political activist as a forum for opponents of the nomination is filled with charges against the President of betrayal and calls for him to withdraw of the nomination Mr Reagan has been unmoved telling critics he was satisfied with his nominees record and views Judge OConnor has spent the last week in Washington preparing for the hearings with the aid of Justice Department officials She is expected to answer questions on her record and beliefs but to decline to answer questions on how she would have voted in past Supreme Court cases or how she might rule in the future While the hearings may provide a lively platform for the antiabortion groups there is no indication that the opponents will pick up much support among the Senators Nancy Thurmond whose husband Senator Strom Thurmond Republican of South Carolina is chairman of the Judiciary Committee is holding a tea in Judge OConnors honor at 4 oclock Friday afternoon
O'CONNOR HEARINGS OPEN ON A NOTE OF FRIENDSHIP,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/10/us/o-connor-hearings-open-on-a-note-of-friendship.html,Judge Sandra Day OConnor appeared today to move easily toward confirmation as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court emphasizing before a generally appreciative Senate Judiciary Committee her belief that the proper role of the judiciary is one of interpreting and applying the law not making it The first of three scheduled days of confirmation hearings produced few surprises Members of the Judiciary Committee asked the Arizona Court of Appeals judge questions that she seemed to have expected and she provided answers that the Senators seemed pleased to hear Members of the committee including its chairman Strom Thurmond a South Carolina Republican indicated that confirmation was a virtual certainty But if the hearing lacked doubt it did not lack drama or a sense that history was being made by the imminent confirmation of the first woman to be appointed as a Supreme Court Justice in the Courts 191year history Better 190 years late than never Senator Bob Dole Republican of Kansas told the nominee You are among friends Happily Share the Honor As the first woman to be nominated as a Supreme Court Justice I am particularly honored Judge OConnor told the committee in her opening statement But I happily share the honor with millions of American women of yesterday and today whose abilities and conduct have given me this opportunity for service Her opening statement set the tone for much of what followed She outlined the theme to which she would return frequently in the questioning that her experience as a legislator and state court judge made her sensitive to the role of the states in the Federal system that lawmaking was the job of legislators and not judges and that state courts could provide adequate forums for protecting constitutional rights The 51yearold judge who had to pass antiabortion pickets to reach the hearing room also quoted from a marriage ceremony she had written in which she referred to the family as mankinds basic unit of society the hope of the world and the strength of our country Antiabortion groups oppose the nomination on the ground that Judge OConnors voting record when she served in the Arizona Senate does not reflect implacable opposition to abortion Asked for Views on Abortion In the first few minutes of questioning today Senator Thurmond asked Judge OConnor for her views on abortion and an explanation of her four votes in the State Senate that her opponents had found most objectionable I am opposed to abortion as a matter of birth control or otherwise Judge OConnor said The subject of abortion she continued is a valid one for legislative action subject to any constitutional restraint or limitation Acknowledging that she had cast a preliminary vote in 1970 in favor of a bill to repeal Arizonas criminal abortion statute Judge OConn or said that at that time I believed some change was appropriate in a law that made it a crimina l offense to assist a rape victim in obtaining a D and C procedur e  a method of abortion in early pregnancy  within hours or days after the assault In 1973 Judge OConnor said she cosponsored a bill to make birth control information more widely available She said the bill did not provide for abortions and that she did not view it as an abortion meas ure In 1974 she voted against a resolution calling for an antiabortion amendment to the United States Constitution because she said the measure had not received proper reflection or consideration In the same year Judge OConnor said she voted against an amendment to prohibit abortions in some state hospitals because the measure was a nongermane rider to another bill If Senator Thurmond hoped to deflect the abortion issue by allowing Judge OConnor to clarify her record at the start of the hearing he apparently succeeded with the possible exception of two or three committee members One of them Senator John P East Republican of North Carolina tried repeatedly late in the day to get the nominee to give her opinion of Roe v Wade the 1973 Supreme Court decision that declared abortion to be a constitutionally protected right But she refused to be pinned down saying she could not prejudge an issue that could well come before the Supreme Court again Hints of Her Own Views Judge OConnor also deflected questions about other subjects that might come before the Court Sometimes she answered in generalities that may have contained hints of her own views At other times she replied with brief summaries of Supreme Court precedent on the matter She hinted in answers to questions by Senator Paul Laxalt Republican of Nevada that she favored some judicial limit on the socalled exclusionary rule which bars the use at trial of illegally obtained evidence but added that she wouldnt want to be accused of prejudging a question likely to come before the Court The committee plans to finish its questioning of Judge OConnor tomorrow and to hear testimony from outside witnesses on Friday
MONEY FOR LEGAL SERVICES SURVIVES ATTACK BY CONSERVATIVES IN HOUSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/10/us/money-for-legal-services-survives-attack-by-conservatives-in-house.html,The House defeated a new effort by conservatives to kill Federal support for legal aid for the poor today After the 272to122 vote against the amendment to a 88 billion appropriation for the Departments of State Justice and Commerce the House went on to pass the money bill The House voting 333 to 54 did amend the measure to forbid the Justice Department to use appropriated funds to interfere with voluntary school prayer programs This occurred despite an acknowledgment by the sponsor of the amendment that the department had never supported such programs and would not be likely to do so under President Reagan In other action on the day Congress returned from its August recess the Senate resumed the longstalled debate on antibusing amendments to a Justice Department authorization bill A vote was scheduled tomorrow on an effort to cut off the filibuster of Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut who says the antibusing amendments are unconstitutional A Test on Social Issues The skirmishes over legal aid funds school prayer and busing provided a foretaste of what are likely to become increasingly important issues in the rest of the session Conservatives chafing for Congressional action on such controversial social questions as abortion school prayer and busing have become increasingly reluctant to go along with requests that they hold off until President Reagans fiscal program is in place The vote on legal aid came on an amendment offered by Representative F James Sensenbrenner Jr Republican of Wisconsin He proposed to eliminate the 241 million for the independent Federal Legal Services Corporation approved in July by the Appropriations Committee Mr Reagan has also called for eliminating the corporations funds in order to leave the states the option of using money from Federal block grants to assist legal aid offices Mr Sensenbrenner said that the Legal Services Corporation would be a good place to save almost a quarter of a billion dollars when the budget deficit apears to be growing But supporters of legal services stressed that the House decided in June after three days of debate to continue the program for two years at the 241 million level They contended that this decision should be pursued to give a semblance of equal access to justice Legal Services Future in Doubt The question said Representative Tom Railsback Republican of Illinois is do we believe that the poor people in the country are entitled to some kind of equality of justice The outcome of the sixmonth battle over legal services is very much in doubt however Edwin Meese 3d the counselor to the President and David A Stockman director of the Office of Management and Budget have said they would recommend a veto of the corporations appropriation The Senate has not yet voted on the programs authorization bill and the Senate Appropriations Committee has not yet approved money to keep Legal Services in business after Oct 1 The corporation could survive however under a stopgap resolution made necessary by the jam in both houses on appropriations measures Thus the most that supporters of legal aid can expect may be the 241 million approved by the House eve n thou gh it is a 25 percent reduction from current spending of 321 milli on Restrictions on Program Lawyers The House has imposed stringent new limits on activities of the 6000 legal a id lawyers around the country The restrictions were adopted to me et the concerns of conservatives who complain that legal aid law yers are social activists whose time is spent in lobbying and in efforts to reform existing laws and to force Government ag encies to raise social welfare payments Among the restrictions are a bar on filing class action suits against Federal state or local government agencies and restrictions on lobbying The school prayer amendment sponsored by Representative Robert S Walker Republican of Pennsylvania bars the Justice Department from using appropriated funds to prevent the implementation of programs of voluntary prayer and meditation in the public schools The lopsided vote in favor of the amendment demonstrated once again the strength of the sentiment in Congress against Supreme Court decisions prohibiting statesponsored school prayer as unconstitutional Other proposals pending in Congress directly attack the power of the Supreme Court and other courts over school prayer Mr Walker said his amendment was needed because some school districts have been deterred on the issue by the fear of being taken to court But he acknowledged that he knew of no case in which the Justice Department had ever challenged a school prayer program Mr Reagan has said he supports voluntary school prayer and his Justice Department has shown no interest in interfering with prayer programs
Ban on Demonstrators At Court Found Illegal,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/10/us/ban-on-demonstrators-at-court-found-illegal.html,A 1976 law banning all demonstrations in the Supreme Court Building or on sidewalks surrounding it is unconstitutional a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has ruled Judge Harry T Edwards writing for himself and Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg said yesterday that such a demonstration would be unlawful only if it was aimed at influencing the Justices Another statute makes it unlawful to do that he said Judge Geor ge MacKinnon who dissented in pa rt said that at least a portion of the 1976 law was constitutional Judge MacKinnon saw a threat to the decorum of the Supreme Court if picketing and demonstrations were permitted What would start as two lonely peaceful pickets today would eventually lead to the hordes of tomorrow bannering and distributing leaflets on abortion school busing prayers in public schools civil rights greater rights for the press and media free speech and a host of other issues he said The case arose when two persons one distribuuting leaflets and the other carrying a sign reciting the First Amendment were told to leave the Supreme Court sidewalks The appellate court ordered the Government to stop enforcing the statute
CHICAGO ARCHBISHOP UNDER U.S. INQUIRY ON FUNDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/11/us/chicago-archbishop-under-us-inquiry-on-funds.html,John Cardinal Cody who became head of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago 16 years ago is under investigation by a Federal grand jury here on charges of improper diversion of church funds Federal officials said today The Acting United States Attorney Dan K Webb confirmed published reports that his office was looking into allegations that the 73yearold cleric used two discretionary funds to divert more than 1 million in taxexempt church funds to a St Louis woman he has known for decades This office has received allegations of improper diversions of church funds by Cardinal John P Cody Mr Webb said in a statement At this point these are allegations and should not be taken as proof of wrongdoing He declined to say who had made the accusations The Cardinal who was attending a regional conference of bishops in nearby Mundelein when the investigation was announced denied the charges late this afternoon in a statement issued through the archdiocese Tragically Painful Innue ndoes The statement said that the Cardinal was deeply saddened by erroneous and tragically painful innuendoes and said that the St Louis woman Helen Dolan Wilson 74 years old was his stepcousin Mrs Wilson was quoted today by The Chicago SunTimes as saying that her mother and the Cardinals mother were sisters and that she and the Cardinal were cousins The article said that Mrs Wilsons father married the Cardinals aunt in the early 1900s but that they were not related by blood The paper and the archdiocese have had a running dispute for the last year over the papers reports on the church Mrs Wilson was quoted in an interview with The St Louis PostDispatch as calling the article a vicious joke The SunTimes said the grand jury was investigating accusations that Cardinal Cody had spent nearly 100000 in 1970 to build a winter home for Mrs Wilson in Boca Raton Fla Prohibition Under Law Federal law forbids taxexempt institutions to use their funds for the personal enrichment of people with no official ties to the institution The SunTimes said that Mrs Wilson had retired from a Catholic church job in St Louis and collects a small pension Religious experts and church historians said today that they could not remember a Federal grand jury ever investigating an official of the Catholic Church of Cardinal Codys rank and stature As head of the nations largest archdiocese he is leader of more than 25 million Catholics Last January the jury subpoenaed the Cardinals personal financial records and records for several years of the archdiocese A spokesman for Stifel Nicolaus  Company a brokerage house based in St Louis confirmed today that records of Mrs Wilsons account there had been subpoenaed at the same time and turned over to the United States Attorneys office Archbishop Phillip Hannan who succeeded Cardinal Cody as Archbishop of New Orleans said that the allegations were completely unfair and that the investigation doesnt mean anything Groups Refuse to Comment The National Conference of Catholic Bishops an umbrella group for Catholic dioceses in the United States and the Apostolic Delegate for the Vatican in Washington refused to comment on the investigation When asked about the practice of maintaining discretionary accounts for bishops a spokeman for the conference said Across the board including the financial matters the policies and practices vary enormously from diocese to diocese The Rev Thomas Libera president of the Association of Chicago Priests said that he was shocked and sympathetic even though there had been constant battles between his group and what he called the authoritarian Cardinal in the past This isnt the pound of fle sh that hi s critics would want to extract he added Because of the great size of the diocese the Cardinal has been courted assiduously by political and business leaders But his politics were lowkey and he seldom endorsed candidates Mayor Jane M Byrne who lives a few blocks from Holy Name Cathedral the archdiocese headquarters is one of the Cardinals parishioners She generally is seen occupying a conspicuous seat at many of the special masses when the Cardinal is the celebrant Mayor Byrne is vacationing in Palm Springs Calif and her office had no comment on the investigation Standard of Journalism Assailed In its statement today the archdiocese criticized The SunTimess standard of journalism and said The SunTimes presents charges that are so ambiguous as to hamper a pointbypoint rebuttal In the morning editions the tabloid ran six full pages describing the results of several months of investigations A year ago The Chicago Catholic the official newspaper of the archdiocese learned that The SunTimess inquiry was under way and ran a long article attacking the papers methods Last November the Cardinals office assailed the newspaper saying its investigation was an affront to Chicago Catholics It accused The SunTimes of making a personal attack on the Cardinal because he enunciated a lifestyle opposed to that of The SunTimes The statement said that areas of disagreement included abortion aid to parochial schools and divorce At that time The SunTimes responded editorially None of the inquiries we have made have anything to do with church doctrine religious practices or the Cardinals philosophy Criticism of the Cardinal in the diocese or iginally stemmed from liberal positions that he had taken When he came to Chicago he had a reputation as a committed liberal having a ided the integration of church schools in St Louis and New Orleans w hen he held high church posts in those cities He was a high church official in New Orleans during the excommunication of Leander Perez the political leader who had taken an active stand against integrating the churchs schools Criticism Over Integration In Chicago the Cardinals advocacy of churchschool integration was criticized immediately by some conservatives So was his relatively swift adoption of the reforms undertaken by Vatican II Cardinal Cody was roundly attacked also for retiring elderly priests and for closing many churches in old neighborhoods Ultimately his critics said his autocratic manner alienated the liberal priests Two and a half years ago newspapers reported that the priests association wrote the Vatican asking it to intercede by sending an observer into the archdiocese It accuse him of disregard for the human dignity of priests and people The request was denied but critics have not stopped attacking From time to time it has been rumored that the Cardinal would be given a position in Rome to diffuse the criticism But each time the rumors have proven groundless
BUSING FOES LOSE 4TH CLOTURE VOTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/11/us/busing-foes-lose-4th-cloture-vote.html,The Senate refused today to shut off a threemonth filibuster that is blocking antibusing legislation After the vote the majority leader Senator Howard H Baker Jr tried to placate conservatives with an offer of debating time on such emotional domestic issues in November After the 57to33 vote three short of the 60 votes that Senate rules require to cut off debate the Senate leadership scheduled another attempt for next Wednesday but said that if it failed the bill would be dropped Senator Baker said Sometime toward the end of the session Im going to schedule three debates  on abortion busing and prayers in schools But he added that he did not know if his promise would satisfy the conservatives who are under pressure from some supporters to move ahead on these issues now after allowing them to be sidetracked earlier for consideration of budget and tax bills Mr Baker and the Reagan Administration have sought to forestall Senate debate on such issues as abortion partly to insure that economic legislation would be settled first But concerns over political image also figured in that decision Republicans have been warned by their pollsters that younger mobile voters support the party on economic issues but not on social issues Debate on Abortion Feared A senior White House aide said this week that he feared a debate on the abortion issue might split the party but at the same time he did not want to anger supporters on the right by appearing uninterested in the issue One of the leaders of the Republican right Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina said that his present dispo sition was to go alongwith Mr Bakers offer None of those issues should be on the back burner or perceived to be on the back burner Senator Helms said but Howard and I usually reach accommodations on these things Those accommodations however have sometimes fallen apart after Mr Helms has heard from his followers Senator Bakers effort earlier this year to keep amendments on such matters as abortion off the Senate floor failed when conservatives came to him and said their backers insisted on immediate action The vote today was an example of the failure of the earlier Baker effort for it was the fourth cloture vote on the Department of Justice authorization bill a measure that has been considered on andoff since Jun e 12 Busing Legislation Planned The controversy on this bill involves efforts by Senator J Bennett Johnston Democrat of Louisiana to prohibit the department from getting into school cases where busing could be a remedy to bar Federal courts from ordering busing beyond neighborhood schools to allow the Attorney General to sue school boards to halt voluntary busing and to enable old desegregation suits to be reopened to end busing now in force Some version of Mr Johnstons proposal may reappear later in the session as the busing legislation that Senator Baker plans to call up Two subcommittees of the Senate Judiciary Committee headed by Senators Orrin G Hatch of Utah and John P East of North Carolina are planning busing legislation But the two Republicans may conflict in their approaches to the issue with Mr Easts proposal going even further than Mr Hatchs which resembles the Johnston approach Mr Baker said he thought the chance for action was strongest on busing because the school prayer and abortion proposals appeared more likely to require a constitutional amendment which needs a twothirds vote for passage But the majority leader added that he expected legislation to be before the Senate on all three issues Earlier in the year Senator Baker had talked of just having debates on these issues without any formal legislative vehicle Baker Approach Welcomed Two other conservative Republicans welcomed the Baker approach Senators James A McClure of Idaho and William L Armstrong of Colorado said that Mr Bakers promise of action in November and the continued problems connected with the budget should minimize efforts to raise the subjects sooner Senator Armstrong said that the social issues were brought up as appropriations riders in previous Congresses because their Democratic leaders seemed committed to squelching regular legislation on such matters Howard has created a climate of tolerance in which members of the Senate believe his promises of later action Mr Armstrong added Senator McClure called the Baker approach a useful way to avoid having to face the same issue a dozen different times Support From Laxalt In his effort to keep the social issues from a preeminent position on the Senate calendar Mr Baker has had the strong support of Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada President Reagans closest friend in the Senate and a leader in his own right for such measures as the family protection bill Senator Laxalt said that while he expected the usual isolated amendments on social issue legsilation he did not feel that appropriations measures the sale of Awacs electronic surveillance planes to Saudia Arabia and efforts to deal with high interest rates would permit extended consideration of such matters as abortion or school prayer I just dont see any room for them he added
JUDGE O'CONNOR WINS PRAISE AT HEARING,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/11/us/judge-o-connor-wins-praise-at-hearing.html,Judge Sandra Day OConnor her confirmation to the Supreme Court all but assured completed a second day of testimony at Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings todayShe answered questions about her views on subjects from criminal law to women in military combat as members of the committee praised her record her stamina and her prospects to become the first woman to serve on the Court While some Senators persisted in questioning he r views on abortionand some scat tered antiabortion pickets remained at their post outside the S enate Office Building the tone of the hearing was considerably more relaxed than at yesterdays opening At a midday recess Judge OConnor her husband John and their three sons were guests of hon or at a lunch given by the Judiciary Committees chairman Str om Thurmond Republican of South Carolina Im proud of you Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah told Judge OConnor as he completed his questioning Ill be proud to see you serve on the Supreme Court Senator Jeremiah Denton Republican of Alabama said I have a tremendous respect for you as a woman who has filled the indispensible roles of wife and mother and who has then gone on to professional accomplishment in pretty much of an ideal format Working for Womens Rights After Judge OConnor indicated that she did not think it would be appropriate to campaign from the Court for adoption of the proposed Federal equal rights amendment she was exhorted by one member of the allmale panel to use her position to champion the rights of women Dont wall yourself off Senator Joseph R Biden Jr Democrat of Delaware told the somewhat startled nominee It is your right if it is your desire to go out and campaign like the devil for the ERA You are a singular asset You have an obligation to the women of this country to speak out on these issues Dont let us intimidate you Judge OConnor a 51yearold judge on the Arizona Court of Appeals gave no hint of being intimidated in the two days of hearings Leaning forward in her seat listening intently to the Senators sometimes rambling questions she gave the impression of having researched every conceivable query and decided in advance how specific she wanted to be in responding Careful to say that she was voicing her personal views and not necessarily the conclusions she would reach as a judge she expressed doubts about courtordered busing for integration and about the exclusionary rule which bars the use at trial of illegally obtained evidence Busing in Her Childhood Her own childhood experience with a 75mile roundtrip bus ride to school from her familys Arizona ranch was very disturbing to me she said adding that busing often is not terribly beneficial to the child Her experience as a trial judge she said had led her to conclude that the exclusionary rule sometimes interfered with the administration of justice by requiring the exclusion of evidence obtained through a technical error as well as through force trickery or some other reprehensible conduct Her comments hinted at support for the socalled good faith exception to the exclusionary rule which the Supreme Court has not yet endorsed under which evidence is admissible if acquired by the police in a mistaken but good faith belief that their procedures were correct Senator Denton one of the most vigorous opponents of legalized abortion on the Judiciary Committee pressed Judge OConnor to define the circumstances under which abortion would be acceptable to her Over the Hill for Abortion For myself she replied abortion is offensive to me it is repugnant to me it is something in which I would not engage However Judge OConnor added Im over the hill Im not going to become pregnant so perhaps it is easy for me to speak She said she felt an obligation to recognize that others have different views Judge OConnor indicated that as a legislator she would permit abortions to save the life of a pregnant woman and possibly under other circumstances which she did not define On other subjects Judge OConnor said she supported Arizonas death penalty statute believed that wom en sh ould not fight in battlefield combat and did not object to the presence of television cameras in courtrooms Asked whether judges s hold belong to private clubs that discriminate in membership she sa id she belonged to threeallfemale organizations from which she did n ot plan to resign The Judiciary Committee has tentatively scheduled a vote on the nomination next Tuesday Judge OConnor will testify briefly tomorrow and the hearings will conclude with testimony from outside witnesses
ADVICE AND CONSENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/12/opinion/advice-and-consent.html,Benjamin Franklin jokingly suggested that the Constitutional C onvention let lawyers nominate Supreme Court Justices As Madison r elates it Franklin thought lawyers could be expected to select  the ablest of the profession in order to get rid of him and share h is practice among themselves But the Convention gave the power tot he President to be exercised by and with the Advice and Consent o f the Senate This week for the 52d time this century the Senate began consideration of whether to give its Advice and Consent to a nominee Judge Sandra Day OConnor if confirmed will be the 102d person and the first woman to sit on the Court What is the Senates responsibility in weighing her nomination With confirmation likely this longdebated question is easily missed Yet it is precisely now that it is best addressed Two additional facts make examination of the question of responsibility especially timely First Judge OConnor is challenged by groups opposed to her perceived support of a right to abortion Second how the Senate treats this challenge will influence the five or six additional High Court confirmations that we can expect this decade a number umatched since the 1940s History little illuminates the Senates con firmation role Hamiltonsaid the Senate should weigh a nominees me rit and reject unfit characters Madison added that it w ould prevent incautious or corrupt nomination and fl agrant partiality or error A review of the 24 rejected nominees  20 of them before 1900 reveals no clear standard for advice an d consent only a sharp decline in the rate of rejection There is however one role the Senate must not play It is not the Senates job to enforce IOUs that singleissue constituencies believe the President has given them and has failed to honor The President exercises broad political discretion in selecting Justices The Senates role is substantially narrower Many arguments freely made to the former bef ore nomination are inappropriate for the latter a t confirmation In voting on the Judiciary Committees recommendation the Senate ought to consider age and physical health intellect and judgment temperament and impropriety or the appearance of impropriety in public life But to what extent should a Senators vote be based on the nominees view of constitutional law The Senate surely has the duty to determine whether a candidate supports abiding constitutional values That the separate but equal treatment of minorities is wrong that an indigent defendant is entitled to a free lawyer that courts have power of judicial review and that the First Amendment protects communication from prior restraint are a few clear examples of these values Although they come dressed as rules of law they are by now a part of our common understanding as a people The Senate may question whether a nominee will seek to undercut these tenets through constitutional interpretation Emerging constitutional issues those now before the Court  are another matter The President may prior to nomination assess a persons likely view on these issues although predictions are perilous since positions taken in the tradeoffs of a public career are often reevaluated in the security of life tenure The Senate on the other hand is institutionally incapable of pinning a nominee down on each of the developing issues that might interest its shifting majorities If each Senator felt free to insist on a Justice who agreed with his or her view on a current question no one would be confirmed In Judge OConnors case for example liberal Senators might balk at her apparent willingness to restrict Federal Court jurisdiction over civil liberties claims Yet this would hardly be a principled reason to reject her Even if a sizable number of Senators did agree on a current constitutional issue insistence on a person who would adopt the same view would be unseemly and could preclude participation in cases raising that issue Of course there is no clear line between settled and emerging constitutional issues Nor is either category static In close cases Senators will disagree as each conscientiously decides how to vote But abortion is not a close case Many judicial and scholarly opinions recognize a constitutional right to abortion By a 72 vote the Supreme Court so ruled eight years ago If Judge OConnor concurs she is well within the mainstream of current constitutional doctrine Some who reject that doctrine are seeking to use the advice and consent power as a means to dismantle it The Constitution designates methods for its amendment Trading confirmation votes for a compliant nominee is not one of them and never should be  Stephen Gillers law professor at New York University is cochairman of the Committee for Public Justice a national organization concerned with civil liberties and civil rights

ABORTION FOES ASSAIL JUDGE O'CONNOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/12/us/abortion-foes-assail-judge-o-connor.html,Leaders of the antiabortion movement told the Senate Ju diciary Committee today that Judge Sandra Day OConnor should be dis qualified from service on the United States Supreme Court because she had not promised to vote to overrule the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion But since Judge OConnor had been dismissed from the witness stand earlier in the day with an assurance by the committees chairman Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina that she will make an outstanding Associate Justice of the Supreme Court the conclusion of the three days of hearings was something of an anticlimax The testimony by two officials of the National Right to Life Committee drew criticism from two Senators at opposite political poles Bob Dole a Kansas Republican and Howard M Metzenbaum an Ohio Democrat The ensuing debate about the role of singleissue pressure groups served to underscore two of the confirmation hearings prevailing themes the unease of a number of Senators with what some called the litmus test approach to confirmation and the implacable nature of the antiabortion groups opposition to public figures who do not agree with them AntiAbortion Group Criticized I think my prolife record is good Senator Dole told Dr John C Willke president of the National Right to Life Committee who assured him Were not worried about you Senator Senator Dole then said But Im not certain that we can just suggest that if for any reason a nominee does not totally repudiate Roe v Wade then we have to reject that nominee I dont think we can subscribe to that Apparently alluding to his standing with the antiabortion groups the Senator added I dont know what that does to me Noting that the Right to Life Committee had not challenged the last Supreme Court nominee John Paul Stevens who was confirmed as an Associate Justice in 1975 Senator Dole said Its a long way to go in six years to now say that you shou ldnt si t on the Supreme Court if youre not completely correct on this issu e SingleIssue Politics Assailed Senator Metzenbaum who said he found Judge OConnor too conservative on a number of issues added that he nonetheless intended to support her confirmation I find something unAmerican about any appointee being judged on one issue and one issue alone he said Im not sure what kind of Supreme Court you would have Who would choose that perfect person Dr Willke replied that only once or twice in a century does an issue rise that strikes so clearly at the heart of the basis of our society as to justify a litmus test for public office The killing of one and a half million innocent unborn babies a year he continued is such an intolerable evil such an abominable evil that it is that onceinacentury issue Judge OConnor said repeatedly in the hearings that she was opposed to abortion But her explanation of her voting record on abortion when she served in the Arizona State Senate as well as her refusal to discuss the 1973 Roe v Wade decision did not satisfy the antiabortion groups More Fundamental Than Slavery It also failed to satisfy one member of the Judiciary Committee Senator Jeremiah Denton Republican of Alabama who told Judge OConnor as he completed his questioning this morning I dont feel I have made any progress personally on the issue of where you stand on abortion Senator Denton said he agreed with Dr Willke that abortion is the issue of the century or perhaps the issue of our history At one point the Senator called abortion even more fundamental than the issue of slavery in the 19th century Senator Thurmond who presided over the hearings gave Senator Denton an hour to question Judge OConnor twice the time allowed the other Senators Were really not having a hearing on abortion the South Carolina Republican admonished Senator Denton at one point Were having a hearing on the fitness of this lady Vote Likely Next Tuesday The committee has tentatively scheduled next Tuesday to vote on the confirmation with action by the full Senate likely in the week of Sept 21 Among witnesses testifying in favor of Judge OConnors confirmation were officials of the American Bar Association the National Bar Association the National Womens Political Caucus the National Organiza tion for Women and the National Association of WomenJudges By midafternoon only Senator Thurmond remained to hear the testimony I think this things been stacked the Rev Carl McIntire the fundamentalist radio preacher who testified against Judge OConnor told the chairman I want to protest coming down here to this hearing and having only you to talk to

MAKING OF A LITERARY SHOGUN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/13/magazine/making-of-a-literary-shogun.html,Paul Bernstein is a freelance writer based in California By Paul Bernstein efore the end of World War II James Clavell was shot in the face and wandered lost in the jungle for days A Malay village eventually took the British Army officer in as one of its own but he was later captured by the Japanese and he is convinced to this day that if it had not been for the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end the war he would have died in a Singapore prison camp called Changi Food amounted to a quarterpound of rice per day one egg per week and occasional vegetables Flies heat disease and unimaginably harsh living conditions killed off 14 out of every 15 prisoners For 15 years after leaving Changi Clavell talked to no one about it not even his wife April whom he married in 1952 shortly before they came to America where he began a career in screenwriting and directing Long after he had stopped carrying a can of sardines in his pocket at all times and fighting off the instinct to forage in trash cans for food bad dreams and a nervous stomach kept him awake nights In 1960 for reasons he cannot explain stories about Changi started spilling out of him When the Writers Guild went on strike giving him unexpected time off his wife locked him in the den and told him he could come out when he had written five pages Twelve weeks later he had finished King Rat That was the beginning of the Asian Saga which Clavell now plans as seven volumes The fourth volume Noble House entered the national bestseller lists at No 1 more than four months ago in the same week it was published and has stayed near the top of the lists since Shogun the third volume which was adapted for television and seen by more viewers than any other miniseries in television history except Roots has now sold more than seven million copies in novel form and is in its 40th printing and plans have recently been completed to turn it into a Broadway musical Nippon is the working title of the next volume in the series which if Clavell keeps to his present production pace will be completed in 1993 with the last volume running to 3000 pages Last spring when Ronald Reagan was shot James Clavell was an hour late for a press conference in Tokyo He had just heard the news and was in a state of confusion not knowing whether the President would live or die certain only that he could not face the Japanese newsmen and answer trivial questions about Shogun He canceled the press conference but later in the day went on Japanese television to offer himself as the resident American authority in interpreting the news Later back in the United States for a publicity tour in connection with the publication of Noble House he took it as his personal mission to report at every opportunity that he had dined with the President and Mrs Reagan at the White House and that the President was in splendid health But dont say I sat next to Nancy Reagan at the White House he told an interviwer That would be pretentious James Clavells appearance at the White House for a state dinner honoring the Prime Minister of Japan occurred in large part because his Asian novels  though their historical authenticity is currently the subject of some debate both in Japan and in this country  have made him in the minds of many people something of a crosscultural phenomenon Clavell himself talks with some justification about JapaneseAmerican relations in terms of preShogun  and postShogun  And at least one Middle Eastern oil sheik agrees with the scope of that assessment The ruler whom Clavell does not identify has offered him a tanker loaded with oil if he will do for the image of the Arabs country what Shogun did for Japans Despite the enormous success of his Asian books James Clavell seems equally preoccupied at the moment with American politics as his frequent allusions to the White House dinner suggest Indeed his The Childrens Story which he is having published in book form this month 18 years after it first appeared in print has the overtones of a campaign speech on foreign policy the speech has already caused considerable controversy and can now be expected to cause more Clavell is as unshy about Childrens Story as he is sure about the correctness of his being seated between the American First Lady and the Japanese Prime Minister Its an extraordinary piece of work he says of the book Normally I write and rewrite and rewrite and in this one I changed hardly anything He wrote it in one magical day compared with an average of three years for each of his last two novels  but then The Childrens Story is only 96 pages long compared with the 1206 of Noble House and it is a a padded 96 pages at that It first appeared as a magazine story in The Ladies Home Journal in 1963 when it prompted more than 3000 letters at least half of which were expressions of vigorous protest The story concerns a young attractive welltrained teacher who rather effortlessly wins the hearts and minds of her American primaryschool pupils shortly after America loses a war and persuades them to tear the American flag into pieces One readers reaction was to suggest that Clavell would be more at home in Pravda The John Birch Society called him unAmerican and called for his impeachment though from from what it did not say If the book becomes a success  his publishers predict that it will give Clavell two books on the bestseller list at the same time  he will will have his own daughter Michaela to thank As an adult she helped design the Delacorte edition more important as a child she inspired the story when she came home from first grade excitedly reciting the pledge of allegiance Whats pledge mean asked her father not yet an American citizen Plegeilligience is plegeillegience she replied with impatience Not only had Michaelas teacher neglected to explain what the words meant but Clavell found upon asking his adult friends that none of them knew who wrote the pledge or when it became an obligatory ritual in schools or why it was considered so important It was then that I realized how completely vulnerable my childs mind was  any mind for that matter under controlled circumstances Clavell says It is curious that the heavy criticism of The Childrens Story should have come then from the right since Clavell himself sees The Childrens Story as bluntly and cleanly rightwing Actually in the 1960s as the Vietnam War dragged on it was generally the doves and the left who questioned the idea of blind national allegiance But Clavell taunts the left now for its present disarray and takes pleasure in the return of patriotism The wonderful thing about the book is that its just at the right time with Reagan the rightwing approach America first the awareness of an enemy called Communism We are in a sweep away from the leftwing attitudes that have been creeping in against our Constitution This is a democracy isnt it Its not a socialist state Advance copies have been sent off to several American politicians Senator Strom Thurmond responding to a questionaire supplied by the publisher said Any adversary whether foreign or domestic does not need to win on the battlefields of our minds if we allow ourselves to be intellectually weak Ignorance of our Constitution is an open door that will allow our passive minds to be persuaded by the decep tive phi losophy of Communism Senator Bob Dole wrote I wishevery American citizen could read it The Childrens Sto ry and Senator Orrin Hatch pledged new emphasis to my deter mination to do everything possible to make the American way of life extend to future generations President Reagan evidently wrote Clavell a warm positive letter which Clavell declined to make public about which he said Im honored that the book seems to have touched in some small way upon some of the important issues that concern the President The reaction from those who have objected to the Reagan Administrations foreign policy as oversimplifying world problems by defining them solely in terms of Communism and antiCommunism  a notion the book tends to promote  is yet to come One advance reader the California author Mickey Ziffren suggests that The Childrens Story will have a greater impact than one of simply affecting current politics Wouldnt it be ironic she says if this slim passionate and chilling volume turned out to be what Clavell was best remembered for Thus far however none of Clavells other works have riveted the American publics attention as Shogun has Shogun readers have commonly reported becoming so engrossed in the novel that their jobs and marriages pale by comparison At work they hide it in desks and sneak peeks when no one is looking On vacations they tear the paperback into sections and pass it around so that two or three can read it simultaneously Henry Kissinger the publisher proudly reports began issuing orders to his wife and addressing her as Woman while under Shoguns spell Webster Schott wrote in The New York Times Book Review Its almost impossible not to continue to read Shogun once having opened it Yet its not only something that you read  you live it The imagination is possessed  Clavell creates a world people customs settings needs and desires all become so enveloping that you forget who and where you are Shogun is history infused with fantasy It strives for epic dimension and occasionally approaches that elevated state Its irresistible maybe unforgettable and finally exhausting  Clavells hero is not a person Its a place and time Scholars who do not ordinarily bother with popular fiction found themselves besieged by students who had read Shogun and wanted to know more George Elison professor of East Asian languages and cultures at Indiana University for example found his lectures on early Tokugawa Japanese history drawing unprecedented crowds Not for a moment did I suffer under the illusion that they were there to hear me he says What the students learned about Shogun may have surprised them because scholars take issue with Clavells portrait of 16thcentury Japan Elison is probably the most outspoken Its a novel with plenty of sex plus plenty of violence equals success By God these swarthy Nippons youve got to hand it to them Their swords cut straight and never has a samurai botched a butchering job But its totally lacking the flavor of authenticity Henry Smith who teaches Japanese history at the University of California Santa Barbara gathered essays by scholars on various aspects of Shogun into Learning From Shogun Japanese History and Western Fantasy distributed by the Japan Society New York It cites numerous discrepancies Only in the late 20th century did abortion become the accepted and lowrisk operation depicted carrier pigeons though indispensable to Shogun apparently were not known in 16thcentury Japan death poems  the ritual of a warrior composing a poem before seppuku  or imminent death in battle were devised by the modern Japanese military class Elison is particularly offended by the character Mariko the highborn Christian convert who defies her husband to become the Englishman Blackthornes teacher and lover It is clear from specific detailed information Clavell provides in the novel that the model could only have been Hosokawa Gracia one of the most honored names in the history of early Japanese Christianity Theres no doubt that she was a convinced Christian almost a saint says Elison But in Shogun theres this bizarre business of if its natural it has to be good with which she leads the reluctant prudish English sailor mind you into popping into a hot tub together with her She would not thought or behaved that way he says In Japan critics panned the American television version shown there earlier this year on eight consecutive nights Asahi Televisions New York bureau chief Yasushi Miyakawa says it had some funny points some curious some inadequate Yoko Shimada who played Mariko and Edwin O Reischauer former United States Ambassador to Japan appeared on television the first evening to ask the audiences indulgence in a Western view of Japan that contained admitted errors The first night 313 percent of all televisions in use in Japan were tuned to Shogun That figure dropped to 104 percent by the seventh night Most intellectuals thought the TV version bad if not insulting reports Henry Smith from Tokyo where he has been studying this summer and most others found it harmless entertainment no better and no worse than what they normally get on Japanese TV Given this disdain for Shogun from those most familiar with its subject matter how does one explain its vast appeal t o American readers A pessimistic explanation is that it provides ste reotypes which Americans can recognize feel comfortable with and a ccept as authentic Michael J Arlen writing in The New Yorker pl aced Shogun in the long line of AngloAmerican raptures o ver a darkskinned superrace  the timehonored white mans de scent into the fascinating world of spectacular punishment William LaFleur an associate professor of Oriental languages at UCLA speculates that in Japan Clavell met Japanese who were willing to t ell him what they thought he wanted to hear If the reader feels t hat he understands Japan after reading Shogun says LaFleur it is less likely to be real understanding than a testimony to Clavel ls abilityto create realistic fantasy and the psychological impact on the reader of sharing vicariously Blackthornes exotic trans formation into a samurai Clavell has a simple if defiant explanation for Shoguns success It was a crackerjack story He reacts with amusement to the scholars Of course you have to be amused he says You have to be patient Because after all unfortunately I seem to have usurped their function more or less singlehandedly by creating an acceptance of the Japanese culture which is exactly what theyre supposed to be doing While the NBC television publicity for the show claimed that Shogun is historically accurate faithfully reflecting the conditions of its time and columnists such as Cecil Smith of The Los Angeles Times wrote that he Clavell knows Japan as it was in 1600 probably better than anyone on earth Clavell vacillates between claiming that his history is completely accurate and taking refuge in the claim that he has a right as a novelist to create a fantasy world Clavell gives you a kind of a doubletalk on that says Dwight Chuman the Englishlanguage editor of Los Angeless Japanese daily newspaper Rafu Shimp Ive heard him talk to allwhite audiences and he says This is a historical drama of Japan based on fact But then when hes with a knowledgeable or Asian audience hell cop to the fact that it is his invention fantasy based on fact Asked directly whether he believed Shogun was history or fantasy Clavell replied Well its as accurate as history can make it But historys a point of view anyway Its the point of view of the guy who writes it Its as accurate as the academicians own writings and their own readings Ive read all the same books they have Its possibly more accurate in that part of it is intuitive Clavell argues that no historian can say for certain that a highborn Japanese Christian such as the fictional Mariko could not have expressed the ideas she does Or that Blackthorne could not have achieved wa or spiritual harmony in only a few months so that he would attempt ritual suicide Have you ever been in a war Have you ever been shot at he asks his voice rising He said that after he was hit in the face with a machinegun bullet during World War II he was in a village in Malaya and in a sixmonth period I learned Malayan perfectly Its very difficult for someone sitting in Harvard or Yale as a professor of history to really know what its like when somebody stuffs a bayonet in your face and pricks your skin You cant imagine it if you are sitting outside on a sunny day sipping an icecold beer Obviously theyve never been put in a position of danger You learn very quickly Ive always felt you can only learn about life at the edge of death PICK UP PART TWO TAKE NUMBER 165957 James Clavell first heard of the Orient from his father a captain in the Royal Navy who counted the time he served in China as one of the high points of his life Only later did James realize that the long stories about charging up the Yangtze River to rescue damsels in distress were fiction Much of the Clavell family history makes good storytelling The line starts with Walterus de Clavile who went to England in 1066 with William the Conquerer and is said to have saved his life As a reward Clavile became the Kingss armor bearer and was granted 100 square miles in Dorset for himself and his descendants in perpetuity One of those descendants the legend goes lost the land in a card game For the last 200 years Clavells have served as officers in the Royal Navy I was brought up to be one of these people who ruled the empire says Clavell You know two or three people used to go out in dinner jackets in the sweltering jungle and rule the natives At the age of 17 James Clavell joined the Royal Artillery and was trained for desert warfare But when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941 the plans changed hastily Clavell and colleagues were sent to Singapore with only eight antiaircraft guns and a ship so small they had to remove the barrels to fit the guns on board In that condition they were soon sunk by Japanese bombers in the Bangka Straits but picked up hours later by a Dutch ship escaping to India That sounded like a fine idea to everyone except the major a total twit who insisted that as they were there to fight a war their duty was to return immediately to the nearest port and resume their weaponless attack Clavell tel ls his war stories as a comedy of errors but the humor is black Why he survived at all is a question he still asks himselfbut he says Changi became my university instead of my prison Among the inmates there were experts in all walks of life the high and the low roads I studied and absorbed everything I cou ld from physics to counterfeiting but most of all I learned the a rt of surviving the most important course of all After the war he returned to England spent a year at Birmingham University worked at odd jobs and through his wife a dancer and model became interested in film Bluffing his way into screenwriting and directing despite his lack of credits he eventually managed to establish himself in Hollywood as a man who could bring in a commercial film on a low budget He still does a wonderful imitation of the halfman halffly caught in the spiders web of the first film he wrote The Fly calling in a tiny voice Help me Help me Walk Like a Dragon and Watusi took 18 days each to film with Clavell producing Five Gates to Hell took 15 days To Sir With Love which he wrote produced and directed cost 625000 to make and grossed 25 million Benson Fong was sitting in the office of his Ah Fong restaurant in Beverly Hills around the time King Rat was published in 1962 chomping on a fat cigar and paying little attention to the baseball game on television when the phone rang Ben Im going to write another book It was Clavell whom he had first met at the time Clavell was writing The Fly Fong has worked in film since he played Tommy Charlie Chans No 3 son in six films of the 1940s What do you want to write about Of course the Orient  When are you going on your next trip Sometime in September May I go along with you Oh Jim by all means In fact if you go with me if you dont have the best time of your life Ill reimburse every nickel you spend He and Fong had not traveled in Asia long before he decided that it would be a big sweeping book that he wanted to write and that it would be about Hong Kong His research there began informally In a restaurant two Chinese were quarreling at the next table Whats going on over there he asked Fong Oh theyre just discussing the races Why are they so angry Theyre not angry Theyre just happy Clavell made a mental note When a Chinese goes red in the face and pounds the table he is not necessarily angry Though he did not and still does not speak conversational Chinese Clavell sought out situations in which no one spoke English Most Caucasians whom Ive taken back to the Orient would be insulted and unhappy says Fong Why dont they speak English But Jim was enjoying it because he would look at the facial expression of each person and he would know just what they were talking about Jimmy shows a very keen sense of picking up things from the ethnic people With his mind he was observing everything He knew what he was going to do The next year 1963 Clavell moved into a Hong Kong apartment with his wife and two daughters and stayed for a year Though King Rat was a best seller his publisher did not offer an advance on the next book But 157000 that he received for the film rights to King Rat spread over five years for tax purposes financed the writing of TaiPan His Hollywood colleagues thought he was crazy says Clavell for taking such a long sabbatical from his film career Clavells original idea for TaiPan was to start with the founding of Hong Kong and bring his story up to the present It got too long though so he stopped at the death of the first taipan the founder of the Noble House trading company Noble House picks up the story in 1963 he may fill in more of the years in between in another novel For historical background he relied on old newspapers and court records reading voraciously and catholically He still has 18 hours of stories on tape that have yet to find their way onto paper His writing on Hong Kong fares better with the experts than his writing about Japan The general opinion in Hong Kong about Mr Clavells novels is that they are the work of an extremely professional reporter who goes to great lengths to provide accurate background for his stories which reflect much of the spirit of the places about which he is writing says James N Dreaper publicrelations manager for the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation He is certainly regarded as one of the few writers who really knows Hong Kong Alvin Rabushka a senior fellow at Stanfords Hoover Institution and author of three books on Hong Kong was married in Hong Kong the day before Noble House opens in 1963 Aside from a slight exaggeration of the importance of the large trading companies to Hong Kongs economy he finds Noble House so uncannily accurate in all aspects that the general public may not have the background to apprec iate just how good it is John Ford the director once told Clavell always to start his films with a long shot of the hero galloping into town in a swirl of dust Being a man of the sea Clavell starts TaiPan and Shogun by bringing his heroes into town on sa iling shi ps in Noble House via MG sports cars For dust he substitu tes stormsExcept for flowery renderings of Oriental speech and expos itory breaks for history or philosophy his prose is a combinati on of Dickens had he had access to jet air travel B movies an d Sigmund Freud Dickenss bighearted orphans become Clavells largerthanlife men of action Dickenss hardhearted vill ains Clavells hardhearted business or political adversaries T he social commentary of Dickens becomes in Clavell crosscultural ed ucation andreactionary political warnings Clavell with the example of 20thcentury psychological novels to follow is not limite d to observation and action in describing his characters He ca n and freely does enter their minds to explain how Dunross mane uvers and traps his enemies or how Toranaga puts aside the pressures of state even in the worst crisis to go hunting with his falcons T his psychological approach gives many readers the perhaps mist aken impression that they have learned more of the Oriental min d through Clavell than through any number of newspaper articles or s cholarly studies When it comes to setting down on paper all his assorted facts fictions and impressions Clavell uses no outline and no researchers He lets no one read the manuscripts until he has finished and does not discuss writing with other writers He combats writers block by reading Hemingway or the King James Bible King Rat was edited heavily TaiPan moderately Shogun Noble House and The Childrens Story hardly at all He claims to start on page one with no more than a vague idea of his story and a mass of research stored uncatalogued in the back of his mind If you knew too much in advance how could you sustain the writing for three years he says professing to be as surprised as the reader at some of his plot twists Critics have called his prose anything from epic in the oldest and grandest tradition that fiction knows Webster Schott The New York Times Book Review to silly sophomoric clumsy turgid interminable Jonathan Yardley The Washington Star One mans art is another mans poison says Clavell unimpressed I think the reviewers are conning the public After 19 years of testing the waters James Clavell has evidently concluded it was safe to plunge into public view But the first interviews he granted after agreeing to hit the promotional circuit in the spring were stiff and unpleasant He still winces at some questions and occasionally allows himself a testy retort Did you go to Japan to research Shogun  Obviously How did you develop such an impressive understanding of the culture Magic He still tries to dismiss questions with the line Everything worth knowing about me is in my books James Clavells main characters are risk takers men of action and wealth manipulative adventurous powerful Though Clavell has yet to rule a nation or become a samurai he does like to describe himself as halfIrish halfarrogant his mother was Irish he is English by birth and an American citizen since 1963 and one Hollywood colleague describes him as cold hard ruthless and ready to kill But there is a character in Clavells fiction who is not like that at all  Peter Marlowe who like Clavell was incarcerated in a Japanese prisonerofwar camp for three and a half years who like Clavell wrote a book about his experience who like Clavell became a Hollywood screenwriter and producer and who like Clavell went to Hong Kong in 1963 to research a book on the large trading companies Marlowe is a likeable gentle man sensitive to cultures other than his own always an observer on the fringes of power comfortable and accepted at all levels of Oriental and British society and aware that while he may admire the high and mighty he will do best to stay faithful to his proper British military background Jimmy is a very shy very private person says Fong But theres no door he cant walk through by himself Hes a good man In fact hes more good than nice He doesnt have time to be nice So far Clavell has managed to keep his private life private Thats the English way observes Peter Marlowe in King Rat Just let out a little at a time when youre in the mood What you are or who you are is your own affair until you wish to share with a friend And a friend never asks Like Casey Tcholok the heroine of Noble House Clavell has been looking for his dropdead money enough to turn down any project or tell anyone to drop dead The success of his books and films and spinoffs from the Clavell empire including Shogun Tshirts wind chimes and tours of Japan make one skeptical of his claim that he is not a millionaire Still whatever he has earned it does not for him constitute dropdead money it is not enough to give him the kind of freedom he wants People think they own me he says referring to the position a bestselling author in American finds himself in as captive to a round of television appearances interviews talk shows This lionization is great But you cant do this sort of thing and still work Though he was clearly happy with the brief spotlight atthe Reagan Wh ite House clearly happy to sit like Peter Marlow on the fringe of power it is equally apparent that what he wants most is to be his own captor locked in his own den  as long as he holds the key He i s really interested in one thing only he says Just doing my job trying to en tertain people and illuminate th e world

The Nation; A Judicious Nominee Keeps Her Own Counsel,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/13/weekinreview/the-nation-a-judicious-nominee-keeps-her-own-counsel.html,For those who expected Sandra Day OConnor to provide a preview of her thinking about decisions she would make as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court last week was a disappointment As the Senate Judiciary Committees confirmation hearings got under way last week she was asked repeatedly about her views on abortion she just as often said she personally opposed the procedure Judge OConnor a member of the Arizona Court of Appeals also said she was for the death penalty against courtordered school busing and had some doubts about excluding ev idence that was obtained illegally Buton all points she would not say how she would vote as a member of the Court no ting that her personal opinions have no place in the resolution of legal issues Two dozen or so antiabortion witnesses filed into the hearing room Friday to testify against her primarily because of some votes she cast when she was an Arizona state legislator And a few Senators  chief among them Jeramiah Denton a Republican from Alabama  had their doubts But most members of the committee were clearly on her side Some because she had declared from the start that the proper role of the judiciary is one of interpreting and applying the law not making it Some because they found the tactics of her opponents so distasteful In an exchange with two representatives of the National Right to Life Committee Senator Howard M Metzenbaum a Democrat from Ohio who said that Judge OConnor was too conservative for him declared that I find something unAmerican about saying anyone could be judged on one issue alone That she would be the first woman on the Un ited States Supreme Court was still significant for many committe emen Senator Joseph R Biden Jr a Democrat from Delaware urged he r to never forget her sex I dont want you to wall yourself off Judge he said Youare a woman  That is something that should be advertised by you In its appraisal the American Bar Association said Judge OConnor was professionally qualified for the Court but lacked extensive or challenging experience on the bench A majority of the committee had no such reservations As she concluded three days of testimony chairman Strom Thurmond a Republican from South Carolina told Judge OConnor that she would make an outstanding Associate Justice and tentatively set a committee vote for Tuesday
A Judge Well Chosen,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/13/opinion/a-judge-well-chosen.html,Sandra Day OConnors confirmation hearings for appointment to the Supreme Court were more of a challenge to her stamina than her intellect She was if anything overprepared for the fumbling tedious questions of the Senators on the Judiciary Committee leaving singleissue inquisitors in utter disarray Senators East Grassley and Denton did what they could to make the committee look silly with repeated clumsy and ultimately futile in quiries into Judge OConnors views on pro abortion court decisionsand antiabortion legislation They affected surprise at her courteous but steady refusal to prejudge issu es that still clamor for the Courts attention They helped her lo ok very good indeed Not all of her testimony was reassuring In her desire to enhance the prestige of state courts Judge OConnor was disquietingly cool to arguments that citizens with disputes based on the Constitution and Federal law should have easy access to the Federal courts She testified with refreshing candor that the 1966 decision on confessions Miranda v Arizona which some cite as an example of coddling criminals had done little harm to law enforcement in her home state Yet she simplistically downgraded as judgemade the longstanding rule against courtroom use of illegally seized evidence She also dismissed socalled judicial activism too quickly I know the difference between judging and legislating she said the difference between interpreting the law and making the law Why couldnt she have said something like Look Senators you and I know theres a lot of baloney about that Sure judges have to be creative sometimes and maybe write something into law The hope is that they know when to do it and can do it with fairness and vision But these quibbles hardly undermine the overall impression Mrs OConnor is a quick study with an evident capacity to keep growing a person of formidable intelligence fully a match for the exclusive male club she will soon join She demonstrated that she knows the law and the legal system and will approach her new job with energy Nobody will dare to ask whether shes doing well for a woman Her political outlook is moderate to conservative  she doesnt frighten liberals but shes apparently too mainstream for the radical right On the Court though she is likely to be independent often unpredictable as any Justice should be After her hearing she seems more than ever an excellent choice
JERSEY AGENCY HELPS YOUTH IN TROUBLE BEAT THE ODDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/13/style/jersey-agency-helps-youth-in-trouble-beat-the-odds.html,It is Friday morning in a cozy office across the corridor from the police Juvenile Aid Bureau and a stones toss from the Town Hall Eight men and women gathered around a table are talking together as they do every Friday about the children of West Orange who are in trouble They are relaxed because they have worked as a team for years But from time to time their brows knit in worry If they have a really knotty case they turn to the resident father figure He is Dr Irving Markowitz a benign man who has been t he psychiatrist of Maybe a free crisisintervention and longte rm counseling program for young people that began 10 years ago Tie d ever more snugly into a network with the Mayors office the Town C ouncil the schools and the police it has had extraordinary success with children and parents and enjoys growing support from the c ommunity Georges Problems I feel like weve lost George says Audrey Baum a mental health counselor who is Maybes director to Dr Markowitz George not his real name is 14 years old skinny and pimply Everybody picks on him at school He has tried suicide  halfheartedly  three times with Lysol aspirin and berries he hoped were poison so that his mother would find him dead on the floor of their living room He failed karate Now he is the probable author of a murder note threatening one of his classmates signed with the first name of his current bully The note is in the hands of the police who questioned him and have received denials so far The team discusses what to do this time with George who first asked Maybe for help three years ago from a street pay phone while he was running away He has his parents buffaloed says Dr Markowitz and offers some fresh approaches to the boys problems Such is the programs spreading fame that during the past year what is called selfreferrals like Georges have jumped 44 percent The majority of these are from teenagers such as Marc who suddenly realized he couldnt live with his stepmother and that everything at home was spinning out of control Kids are beginning to come in on their own instead of being dragged in by the ears said Mrs Baum During the last decade more than 4000 people in West Orange a township of 40000 have received tough but compassionate help from Maybes professional counselors Police Cooperation The name of the program is now the West Orange Family Youth Service but everybody still calls it Maybe The old acronym stands for Many Aiding Youth by Experience Its telephone number 12houraday office hours address and other information are on pink referral slips carried in every police patrol car Literature is posted in every school the public library and Town Hall The mayor Samuel A Spina who looks like the fullback he once was knows the phone number by heart and so does Capt Donald E Palardy commanding officer of the West Orange Police Departments Juvenile Aid Bureau At Maybes recent meeting the litany of childrens problems today was recited drugs and drinking alcoholic parents split homes abortions schizophrenia vandalism shoplifting and burglary among other things As each team member spoke West Oranges families were sketched briefly how they looked talked and hurt what might be done to assuage their suffering and save the children from becoming hardened and lost forever in the maze of the criminal justice system Captain Palardy pointed to a flow chart on his office wall that shows the system At the top of the chart is Police apprehension of juvenile offender Step five Counseling is where Maybe comes in on a longterm basis If the kids arent stopped here Captain Palardy said they can go down the tube But often Maybes presence is felt much earlier Mrs Baum said Parents can find a note saying Dear Mom I left The police pick the kid up at the airport and bring him over right away I have never ever heard of a social agency working with police so closely If a school principal calls up with something that is wrong we can also jump right in instead of putting it off with an appointme nt fornext Wednesda y The service is free accepting children 11 and older and the ir families As Mrs Baum described it on a drive through the treelined town this overwhelmingly white community began to see the cracks in Americas great suburban dream its own dream  about a decade ago Theres the valley and theres the hill she said The valley has always been blue collar where the bulk of our clients came from 10 years ago And then theres the hill with affluent families and hip sophisticated kids The hill is like the movie Ordinary People only the families who live there dont have as much money City Problems During the last 10 years the problems city problems like Newarks or Manhattans about 15 miles to the east  have crept up the hill like lava in reverse The Juvenile Aid Bureau received more than 6000 complaints involving young people in 1980 10 times the total two years earlier The offenders came from every slice of society This town is a microcosm of whats happening everywhere Mrs Baum said One of the things that makes Maybe unusual she said is community backing The town provides office space and supplies in the publicschool administrati on building on Munic ipal Plaza Federal and state money is drying up as the Government wi thdraws from social programs so Maybe is turning to the communit y for funds The response has been encouraging Mr Spina who has worked with Maybe since 1971 first as a Town Councilman and then as Mayor called it a wellrun program that has lasted a long time with a stable team that has stuck with it since the beginning Most of the other youth agencies have gone under during the past 10 years he said When asked what else had made Maybe successful the Mayor answered It provides a viable alternative for families in trouble It used to be the Youth House or nothing For West Orange Maybe is a relief valve  one of our first thoughts when children go wrong
MARKETING THE PRESIDENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/13/magazine/marketing-the-president.html,Sidney Blumenthal author of The Permanent Campaign is writing a book on the economic and intellectual roots of Reaganism By Sidney Blumenthal s Washington sweltered through a July heat wave Richard S Beal was working on the outline of a Presidential speech Beal is not a speechwriter  he is a pollster an expert in market research And the speech he was working on was President Reagans State of the Union address which is to be delivered only next January We lay out the scenarios for winning and losing says Beal Our work concerns the identification of issues goals and principles at the macro level By analyzing polling results he believes he can tell what public views on what questions are likely to prevail at a given time in the future this helps the President decide how to proceed The whole issue of running the Presidency in the modern age is control of the agenda he says We deal with what ought to be the buildup of things six to nine months out Its a process question Ronald Reagan is governing America by a new strategic doctrine  the permanent campaign He is applying in the White House the techniques he employed in getting there Making more effective use of media and market research than any previous President he has brought into the White House the most sophisticated team of pollsters media masters and tacticians ever to work there They have helped him to transcend entrenched institutions like the Congress and the Washington press corps to appeal directly to the people Just as the methods are new the language is new Unlike the old politicos who talked of party bosses delivering the goods and mobilizing the party faithful Reagans men converse about open windows the relative openness of public opinion to Presidential initiatives targets of opportunity events or issues that can be quickly taken advantage of sequencing the timing and order of a series of actions resistance ratios the degree to which the public accepts Reagan and what he is doing and the need to be proactive rather than reactive The new order was not of course created overnight It has been evolving with the growth of television which enabled political leaders to reach the voters more efficiently than through precinct captains and Presidents from John F Kennedy on have been relying increasingly on computers and pollsters in following the fluctuations of voter sentiment But with Reagan  the leader as Communicator in Chief  the new politics is in full flower Reagans stunning success in shaping public opinion and transforming his ideas into law has derived to great extent from the new techniques This does not mean that the President goes by the polls rather than by his own conservative ideology The polls dont change his beliefs or shape his policies they tell him how to plan his strategy And the planning is generally precise enough to encompass what he will do and say six months or more in advance Private polling for politicians bears only a faint resemblance to the standard publicly reported horserace polls on who is ahead and who is slipping Political polling is a scouting operation seeking to identify groups that feel intensely on any issue It reveals which groups are wavering on which issues for which reasons It tells which issue s can be prudently avoided and which can be pressed and it suggests ways to blunt divert or win over the opposition Polling has become an essential guide for the distribution of a politicians financial and political resources the basis on which he constructs his image Consider for example Reagans Presidential campaign On Oct 9 1980 the candidate was handed an internal memo Seven Conditions of Victory The author was Richard B Wirthlin whose firm Decision Making Information is under contract to the Republican National Committee and who has been conducting polls for Reagan since 1968 Wirthlin advised Focus campaign resources to reinforce the Governors image strengths that embody the Presidential values a majority of Americans think are important  At the same time we must minimize the perception that he is dangerous and uncaring The candidate took Wirthlins advice The polls had revealed that many moderates whose votes were needed for victory had difficulty visualizing the Republican candidate as President Reagans television ads proceeded to stress what Wirthlin called leader perceptions and Reagans inauguration as Governor of California in 1967 was depicted in docudrama fashion underlining the themes of competence credibility and decisiveness And when Reagan addressed the camera he was a talking head  cool calm dry The object was to make him appear more Presidential than President Carter this would enable him to fend off Carters scathing attacks and gain the adherence of the necessary voter cohort targets in the language of the memo Immediately after Reagan won the Presidency his campaign began turning itself into a governing operation Wirthlin was named planning director of the transition office On his recommendation Reagan created an Office of Planning and Evaluation and Richard Beal Wirthlins assistant for the last eight years and a former professor of international relations at Brigham Young University was put at its head Wirthlin supervised the preparation of a memo Initial Action Plan outlining a strategy for establishing direction instead of just reacting to events and the memo provided the basis for what became known internally as The First 90 Days Project The projects chief was David R Gergen former managing editor of the Yale Daily News speechwriter for President Nixon communications director for President Ford managing editor of the influential magazine Public Opinion George Bush campaign operative and the adviser who told Reagan to end his debate with President Carter with the penetrating line Are you better off now than you were four years ago Gergen swiftly assembled a thick volume which he called The First 100 Days listing the events both major and trivial of the first 100 days of every President since Franklin D Roosevelt We drew three conclusions he says One the first 100 days is the time during which the President establishes his Presidential persona Two the general character of the Administration is established and lasts at least the first term And three the President is vulnerable to making a big mistake the obvious example being the Bay of Pigs or Carters energy program which he never made good on Both the Wirthlin memo and the Gergen book advised the new Administration according to Gergen to keep a simple focus and go strong on the economy Dont come up with other mischief Other moves whether on social issues like abortion or on foreignpolicy problems would distract from the main event and  so the argument went  tend to weaken the Presidency The advice was accepted polling and marketing were entrenched in their central role The Reagan people have merged their communications with their political needs in a tighter definition than youve seen in previous Administrations says Patrick Caddell pollster to former President Carter I could kiss them for using thematic approaches They really do understand the importance of themes as the great projecting force of political management The political managers of the Reagan White House are the troika of Michael K Deaver and Edwin Meese 3d counselors to the President and James A Baker 3d the White House chief of staff The communications needs are served by Wirthlin who makes personal presentations to the President Beal who assesses the Louis Harris George Gallup and other public polls and reports directly to Meese and Robert M Teeter head of Market Opinion Research and pollster to former President Ford who also advises the White House In the middle of this enterprise stands the 6foot5inch figure of David Gergen whose official title is Assistant to the President for Communications Having taken over from press secretary James S Brady when Brady was wounded during the assassination attempt against the President Gergen now serves as chief White House spokesman oversees the operations of the press and communications offices and plays a highly in fluential role in setting strategy a nd policy Apart from the troika no one on the White House staff s ees more of Reagan than Gergen While Reagans aides present him with varying scenarios and ideas suggesting forums where he might have the greatest impact the President alone decides what he will say The staff says a Presidential aide doesnt presume to tell him if its a question of how you persuade people No one challenges him because hes far better than anyone on the staff Everything here is built on the idea that the Presidents success depends on grassroots support says Gergen Reagan according to this concept mobilizes the people personally through television ap pearances Polls provide him with the rudiments of a script He ha s a craftsmans sense of how to translate the numbers  what the polls reveal  into a dramatic narrative replete with Aesopian anecdotes The former actor is more than the White House l eading man hes the auteur Although Reagan needs no coaching he retains a technical media consultant Mark I Goode a former Hollywood television producer has an office in the old Executive Office Building next to the White House His credits include the Johnny Cash and Pat Paulsen shows In 1968 comedian Paulsen spoofed the candidates with a series of Presidential campaign speeches on television Goode has also served as a consultant to Presidents Nixon and Ford The act of communicating on television or radio is as natural to Reagan as picking up the phone is to us he says Reagans so good the job is terribly easy Hes been at it all his life Hes a total pro Reagans advisers admit that their strategy does not always function perfectly For instance they say there was a slipup on El Salvador The Reagan Administration as aides recount that episode was sincere in its strongly held belief that the Soviet Union was intervening in the Western Hemisphere by supplying the Salvadoran insurgents with Sovietbloc arms and Cuban training The Presidents political strategists saw in this an opportunity to enhance Reagans popularity by playing on the national security theme The Administration launched a fullscale campaign portraying the Salvadoran situation as a crucial confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union But to the strategists dismay Wirthlins polls showed Reagans support dwindling as a direct result of the rising sense of crisis Women especially were mistrustful of Reagans stand on El Salvador They had been a problem to him throughout the campaign and now barely a month into his term he was again raising their suspicions Women are more concerned with the possibility of a conflict says Wirthlin They look at building up defenses with less support than men The Presidents strategists were further alarmed by the fire bell clanged by the media The White House did not appreciate how rapidly El Salvador would take off in the minds of the press as a Vietnam says a Presidential assistant We were astonished at how the news media treated it We didnt think it was a Vietnam But when it became apparent it was going to play that way we had to lowkey the issue It would drain support from the Presidents economic program Gergen had an aide draw up a chart comparing the placement and amount of time being given on the network news to El Salvador and the economic program The higher up the story and the longer it runs the greater its importance in the White House view as a public issue The Presidents strategists see themselves in constant competition with networknews producers over what appears on the screen and how it is emphasized When El Salvador began receiving more time than the economic plan Gergen showed his colleagues his chart It was a turning point in the crisis The White House decided to lower the octave One high official apparently did not get the message soon enough Secretary of State Alexander M Haig Jr who according to a Presidential aide is outside the circle of communications and sometimes gets out of sync did not reverse course immediately his slowness kept the issue alive When State Department spokesmen began blaming the press for making too much of the El Salvador affair Haig by this account was not setting policy but belatedly falling into line After that says a Presidential aide the issue began to recede in the public mind The gap between Reagans support among men and among women began to close At the height of the El Salvador crisis in late February it had widened in Wirthlins polls to more than 10 percent By midJuly it was only 5 percent What was wrong with El Salvador says Beal was the packaging of the activity in terms of policy and presentation to the public It wasnt well staged or sequenced Before Reagan was shot his control of events was slipping says a White House official Events were coming at us too fast We didnt quite have a firm grip Moreover the public impression of Reagan was somewhat foggy His image characteristics were those of a conservative rightwing Republican fiscally responsible strong on defense says Wirthlin There tended to be feelings he was brittle no t warm Reagan had carried a lot of that perceptual baggage for a good part of 1980 too Then came the assassination attempt What the crisis was about in terms of image was a totally unscripted event says Beal It focused uniquely on the President It did a lot to endear the President to the people If the endearing thesis is right his personal attributes might never have come across without the assassination attempt The change in public opinion was reflected in Wirthlins private polls Before the shooting Reagan had been regarded favorably by Wirthlins respondents by a 2to1 margin After the incident Wirthlin cond ucted another poll asking As a result of the assassination attempt have you changed your opinion of Ronald Reagan Ele ven percent said they had They admired his courage calmness and humor Reagans resistance ratio had improved it was now 3 to 1 in his favor The shooting gave us space to get back on top says a Presidential aide Less than a week after the event Deaver the Presidential counselor convened a strategy meeting in Blair House to decide how this new political capital in the words of a White House official ought to be invested At Gergens suggestion Reagans first major public appearance after his hospitalization was a speech on the economy before a joint session of Congress This decision was in keeping with overall strategy To a greater extent than any other policy initiative the Presidents economic program was being conducted as a national political campaign Before the vote in the House of Representatives on the competing Republican and Democratic taxcut bills the National Republican Congressional Committee placed radio ads deriding Speaker Thomas P Tip ONeill Jr and promoting the President Wirthlin had been profiling ONeill since 1978 But ads were a minor tactic control of what appeared in newspapers and on television was seen as the decisive factor The key vote on the Presidents budget was set for June 25 Through a procedural move the House Democratic leadership hoped to make every individual cut in funds subject to a separate vote rather than have the budget voted on as a whole this would put many Congressmen on the spot when the interests of their districts were at stake It was June 23 before Reagans advisers realized what was going on The President was then aboard Air Force One on his way to deliver a speech in San Antonio Quickly his Texas speech was amended to include a reference to the happenings in the House But Reagans strategists felt the wording was too vague We felt the speech hadnt turned the tide says a Presidential assistant It was clear from the leads on the wires By this time Reagan was in the air again en route to CaliforniaHis advisers both aboard the plane and back in Washington debated whether the President should make another speech at the Los Angeles airport or just release a statement calling attention to the urgent situation The critical thing says a White House official was to top our own story The President decided to issue a statement We got it out just as the plane landed We made two out of the three networks The White House also enlisted the support of its business allies including the Chamber of Commerce of the United States the results amazed the White House The surprising thing is the modern technology available to the special interests says a Presidential assistant Within 24 hours one Congressman had 75 to 100 calls from businessmen in his district You couldnt have done that 15 years ago The Democratic maneuver was defeated passage of the Reagan budget was assured In the subsequent taxcut battle the White House once again enlisted business which repeated its tactics with a vengeance During the 1980 campaign Reagan pledged that he would nominate a woman to the Supreme Court This was not done casually Wirthlin had surveyed public opinion on the issue and had determined that the promise would contain no pitfalls We knew it was an allwin situation says Beal We had some research on the kind of nominee We worked with the specifications When Associate Justice Potter Stewart decided to step down he provided the Administration with the opportunity it had planned for Arizona Court of Appeals Judge Sandra Day OConnor fleshed out an image that had prior statistical existence And nominating her would contribute to closing Reagans favorability gap between men and women  which had widened during the El Salvador crisis It was done says Baker to help us with the woman problem and to keep a campaign pledge The nomination was also intended to exploit residual voter feelings about Jimmy Carter who according to Wirthlin is still in peoples minds The purpose was to juxtapose a Carter who made promises he did not keep with a Reagan who delivered on a promise  demonstrating at the same time as Wirthlin puts it that while hes a conservative hes not traditionbound  he has broken the moldid living in the past  Teeter the pollster adds The contrast with Carter is serving R eagan well If the OConnor nomination is viewed in the White House as a successful marriage of style and substance Reagans initial plan for slashing Social Security payments is remembered as its divorcement which occurred because the issue managed to escape the close scrutiny of Reagans strategists Its not a tidy process says a Presidential aide Some events you create some events you go with the flow But the Social Security proposal violated a basic rule ofReagans media and marketing brain trust Dont let policy drive politics The process here was bad on Social Security says Baker We rushed it through The political side never had a chance to consider it before the horse left the barn After this experience the political side was determined to prevent any more precipitate action When the air traffic controllers struck the President himself had to be restrained Back in February Wirthlin who routinely polls on many issues had taken a poll on support for strikes by public employees It was a wash he says meaning that the numbers fell roughly even But the controllers were a special case They had broken their nostrike oaths they were isolated within organized labor and much of the public regarded their strike action as unreasonable Politically the Administration could well afford to be tough To Reagan however this was not a political but a rightorwrong moral issue says a Presidential assistant The President wanted to serve the controllers with a stern ultimatum before they walked off their jobs giving them 48 hours to withdraw their walkout threat or face dismissal To his advisers this was going too far They believed it would make him look provocative and they persuaded him to wait until the controllers struck to make his statement  get back to work or lose your jobs In the interim his strategists heightened the Administrations rhetoric so that the ultimatum when it came would sound logical And they adopted a position aimed at countering the strikers tactics As far as the Administration was concerned the strike was over and it was Day One of rebuilding the system By the time the President escaped Washington for his summer vacation at Rancho del Cielo the Administration had fulfilled the broad objectives laid down by Wirthlins Initial Action Plan and Gergens First 90 Days Project Reagans persona had been successfully established his focus on the economy had determined his Administrations character and he had made only one egregious mistake on Social Security The campaign method of governing implies a vision of the voters as passive yet movable supportive of bold action yet possessing shallow allegiances willing to endorse new possibilities yet afflicted with a short attention span Reagans strategists believe it was the volatility of the electorate that gave him his 1980 victory People hold their party identifications lightly says Gergen There are a lot of floaters in this society and theyll leave you fast We want to cement in the leavers early More than that his advisers see President Reagan as the man who with their help can bring about a long period of Republican dominance Their prescription for achieving this end turns conventional Republican wisdom on its head In 1969 in his seminal book The Emerging Republican Majority Kevin P Phillips argued that the GOP could become the dominant party by exploiting social issues He contended that bluecollar and Roman Catholic voters could be won over by playing on ethnic and regional rivalries and he viewed the Sun Belt as the potential bastion of Republican strength Richard Nixons landslide in 1972 was seen by many Republicans as fulfillment of this thesis and Reagans 1980 victory appeared to offer climactic proof A Sun Belt candidate had been supported by a burgeoning new right that owed its spectacular growth to the exploitation of social issues Reagans advisers however believe they have gained about as much as they can from social issues At a certain measurable point they believe these issues can work against the Administration That point they feel has probably been reached The Phillips thesis says Baker is deader than a doornail The Presidents strategists do not want him to lend more than rhetorical support to farouche newright causes Involving him deeply in an issue like abortion would seem to pit him against opponents of the new right and thus counteract the formation of a new Republican majority As Baker says There are some issues that are political losers Abortion cuts both ways hard If you come down one way or theocial issues are polarizing No President can govern effectively who cant build consensus The social issues says Gergen are the ones that are divisive Those are the issues on which this coalition could fracture The strategists goal in short is consensus the way to achieve it is by focusing on the economy The Phillips theory was to divide and then put the pieces back together says Teeter You dont have to do that with economic issues The Democrats taught us that Gergen agrees The issues that unite people are economic in nature The Presidents radical program of deep budget cuts and supplyside tax reductions is intended to do more than resolve the countrys economic problems It is the Administrations chosen instrument for achieving a realignment of party preferences and creating a longterm Republican majority Pat Caddell President Carters pollster thinks the White House has little choice The Reagan people he says are under enormous tension to hold what gave them the margin  essentially weakpreference Democrats The only way to hold these people is on economics But theres a contradiction in the Reagan strategy The Presidents men think they are realigning party loyalties they dont seem to appreciate that the traditional party system itself is rapidly disintegrating American politics is no longer defined by stable parties and lifelong adherents marshaled by acknowledged party bosses who make use of patronage to maintain their partisan troops Instead there is a new system in which party organizations for reaching the voters are superseded by television Supplanting the old bosses at the commanding heights are the media and marketing specialists who seek to build support on specific issues by playing on the needs and feelings of separate voter groups An early example of this approach occurred in the 1972 Democratic primaries when on Caddells advice the liberal antiwar candidate George McGovern won the conservative bluecollar voters of New Hampshire by appealing to their sense of being misunderstood and ignored The new political operators have hastened the weakening of the oldstyle political machines by identifying discontent and appealing to it in order to create swing voters who can provide the margin of victory Once elected candidates have to deal with shaky coalitions held together by momentary moods not stable party structures They then must try to govern through permanent campaigns This is something more than the selling of the President  even of a telegenic President able to project an attractive image It has become an inescapable necessity for Reagan and probably for his successors The Presidents strategists are at the center of the new political age At the end of the day they become spectators seeing their performance tested by the contents of the television news programs For the Reagan White House every night is election night on television How an Administration action is placed and portrayed on the network news often determines what initiative the President will take the next day Gergens office desk faces a television set on top of which are stacked a dozen newspapers mostly unread Like other important White House officials Gergen has a special hookup so that he receives a broadcast of the CBS Evening News from Baltimore a halfhour earlier than it is

NORWEGIANS BEGIN TWO-DAY ELECTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/14/world/norwegians-begin-two-day-election.html,Voting began today in a general election that is expected to end eight years of Labor Party rule in Norway Every public opinion poll taken in the last two weeks indicates that Prime Minister Gro Harlem Bruntland who took office in February has been unable to reverse her partys longterm decline in popularity It will almost certainly win the largest share of the vote in the balloting which ends tomorrow evening but not a share large enough to govern The new Prime Minister is likely to be Kare Willoch a 52yearold economist who served as Trade Minister from 1965 to 1970 He has rebuilt the Conservative Party which now commands its largest popular support since the 1920s when Labor parties emerged as a powerful force in all the Scandinavian countries Mr Willochs party is unlikely to receive more than a third of the vote and he had hoped to form a majority coalition with two other nonSocialist groups the Christian Peoples Party and the Center Party which was originally known as the Agrarian Party This remains a remote possibility the Conservatives are unwilling to accept the demand of the Christian Peoples Party which is dominated by fundamentalist Lutherans for a more stringent abortion law If coalition talks fail the Conservatives intend to form a minority government alone Nordic NuclearFree Zone No major changes in Norways foreign policy are anticipated under a Willoch government although talk of a Nordic nuclearfree zone which has been encouraged by the left wing of the Labor Party would end That would be welcomed by Washington which considers such proposals inappropriate from a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary of State Alexander M Haig Jr told the Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Frydenlund in Washington this summer that discussions of a nuclearfree zone could prove extremely damaging to arms limitation talks The swing to the right in Norway parallels similar developments in Sweden and Denmark In all three countries the last decade has seen a distinct fallingoff of public support for the welfare state although the Social Democrats have remained the largest parties and have managed to win some elections Dr Bruntland a 43yearold Harvardtrained physician was installed as party leader and Prime Minister in the hope that her youth and personal popularity would reverse the trend But her directness and aggressiveness have offended many of her Labor colleagues in a country where confrontation is a dirty word Rather than healing splits in the party she has aggravated them and few senior party officials have given full backing to her vigorous campaign Inflation Is Nearly 14 Percent Fueled in part by oil revenues Norwegian inflation has reached almost 14 percent and that has given Mr Willoch an opening At a news conference yesterday the Prime Minister said she would not defend inflation on that scale but she attributed much of the trouble to American economic policies which she said were starting to annoy us Mr Willoch on the other hand is an admirer of President Reagan and of supplyside economics In a series of television debates that he is widely believed to have won the Conserva tive leader has made much of his p lans to reduce Norways personal income tax rates whichare among the highest in the world He has also pledged to hold down public spendi ng to end price controls by the end of the year and to slim the bure aucracy The key is increased productivity Mr Willoch said yesterday in a presentation that was much like one of Mr Reagans or Prime Minister Margaret Thatchers though more lowkey Mr Willochs views have proved particularly popular among young people who have known only postwar prosperity and dislike governmental red tape One of the more difficult questions facing Mr Willoch if he wins will be oil policy The Conservatives agree with Labor that North Sea gas and oil output should continue with a limit of 90 million tons a year but the Center Party whose support Mr Willoch would need even if there were no coalition wants to cut it to 50 million Views on National Oil Company All three potential coalition parties agree that the power of the national oil company Statoil must be reduced Formed as a counterbalance to the multinational oil companies after the discovery of the North Sea fields the company gets a major share of all licenses and if things are not changed i t will account for a quarter of Norways gross national product by the year 2000 Mr Willoch said he wanted to increase the license share of the two other Norwegian oil companies Norsk Hydro which is 49 percent privately owned and Saga which is entirely in private hands and to encourage the formation of new companies

PANEL APPROVES JUDGE O'CONNOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/16/us/panel-approves-judge-o-connor.html,The Senate Judiciary Committee today approved the nomination of Sandra Day OConnor as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Confirmation by the full Senate could come as soon as Friday Seventeen of the 18 Judiciary Committee members voted in favor of the nomination The eighteenth Senator Jeremiah Denton Republican of Alabama voted present Senator Denton said that while he regarded Judge OConnor as a superior candidate a fine lady and a distinguished jurist he could not vote to confirm her because she had refused to criticize the 1973 Sup reme Court decision that legalized abortion The abortion issue dominated the three days of confirmation hearings last week Questioned closely about her voting record on abortion when she served in the Arizona State Senate Judge OConnor repeatedly answered that she was personally opposed to abortion but did not want to express her legal opinion on a matter that was likely to come before the Supreme Court again in her tenure Senator Denton was joined in questioning Judge OConnor on abortion by two other Republicans Senators John East of North Carolina and Charles E Grassley of Iowa The three placed into the committee record today a joint statement expressing their dissatisfaction with Judge OConnors vague and general answers Others Vote for Nominee But since Senators East and Grassley did not follow Senator Dentons lead by withholding their votes it left the Alabama Republican and by implication the antiabortion leadership whose views he had championed in the hearings submerged in the waves of praise that issued from the committee for the nominee The chairman Strom Thurmond Republican of South Carolina called Judge OConnor one of the choice nominations for the Supreme Court in his 27 years in the Senate Senator Thurmond said that Judge OConnor had all the good qualities that a judge needs which he defined as integrity ability courage and compassion In the 45 minutes of discussion by the panel this morning Senator East and Senator Grassley explained their favorable votes by saying that despite their displeasure with Judge OConnors answers on abortion they were generally satisfied with her answers to other questions and with her overall judicial approach Looked at the Whole Record Looking at the whole record Senator East said this is a conservative woman of conservative instincts He said that he admired and trusted President Reagan who made the appointment adding I suspect he knows some things I dont know But for Senator Denton nothing could compensate for what he perceived as Judge OConnors failure on the abortion issue Where any issue is so broad in its implications he said threatening the very basis of our society as is the case with our policy respecting the rights of the unborn the effect is to overshadow virtually all other considerations Two Democratic Senators Howard M Metzenbaum of Ohio and Patrick J Leahy of Vermont criticized the role of what they called singleissue politics in judicial confirmation proceedings An agreement to vote a certain way can never be the price to be paid for confirmation by the United States Senate Senator Leahy said To require such a commitment from a judicial nominee he said would de stroy the independence and integrit y of the Federal court system Judge OConnor who now serves on the Arizona Court of Appeals was nominated to replace Justice Potter Stewart who retired from the Court in July It now appears that Judge OConnor who would be the first woman Justice will be confirmed and sworn in in time to participate in the Justices weeklong conference that precedes the opening of the new term on Oct 5
GOLDWATER VOWS TO FIGHT TACTICS OF 'NEW RIGHT',https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/16/us/goldwater-vows-to-fight-tactics-of-new-right.html,Senator Barry Goldwater Republican of Arizona accused Moral Majority and other members of the new right today of undermining the basic American principle of separation of church and state by using the muscle of religion towards political ends The uncompromising position of these groups is a divisive element that Remarks by Goldwater page A32 could tear apart the very spirit of our representative system if they gain sufficient strength Mr Goldwater warned in remarks offered for the record on the Senate floor In those re marks and at a breakfast meeting with reporters Mr Goldwater con tended that members of what he termed special issue religious gro ups were uncompromising and unconcerned about upholding the integrity of the Constitution He said they were also diverting Congress from what he termed such vital issues as the economy a nd national defense toward concerns of secondary importance su ch as abortion busing the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution and pornography Names Helms East and Denton Mr Goldwaters speech did not identify groups other than Moral Majority as members of the new right but at breakfast he listed among its ranks the Rev Jerry Falwell leader of Moral Majority along with Republican Senators Jesse Helms and John P East of North Carolina and Jeremiah Denton of Alabama Saying that the religious issues of the new right had little or nothing to do with liberal or conservative politics Mr Goldwater vowed to fight them every step of the way if they try to dictate their moral convictions to all Americans in the name of conservatism Mr Goldwater previously expressed anger at Mr Falwell when Moral Majority announced its opposition to the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Sandra Day OConnor a fellow Arizonan But todays criticism constituted a broadside attack on the political goals and tactics of the new right While A Bartlett Giamatti president of Yale University recently issued a similar critique of Moral Majority and other conservative groups Mr Goldwaters remarks represent the first major assault on the new conservatives by a Republican who for many years has in his own words carried the flag of the old conservatism Mr Goldwater maintained that the birth of the new right was a direct reaction to years of increasing social activism by the liberal side of the religious house At breakfast for example he accused the National Council of Churches of engaging in activities that went far beyond religious concerns He noted moreover that he shared many of the positions held by Senator Helms and other members of the new ri ght For instance he said that he too opposed abortion However Mr Goldwater said he was sick and tired of the political preachers across this country telling me as a citizen that if I want to be a moral person I must believe in A B C and D Just who do they think they are The 72year old Senator who has acquired a reputation of late for unpredictable public statements said he prepared his remarks some time ago and had been waiting for an opportunity to express them Intead of delivering his speech on the floor he asked that it be inserted into the Congressional Record None of the colleagues he criticized offered any comment on Mr Goldwaters challenge to their conservative credentials Mr Falwell responded however that Mr Goldwaters statement would make one wonder whether time has passed him by Mr Falwell also asserted that his group will not be deterred from our constitutional right and duty to speak out on the great issues of the day Likened to Labor Movement At breakfast Mr Goldwater said he did not believe that Moral Majority and the new right would damage the Republican Party unless they become too demanding He likened the new right to the labor movement which he said had petered out and lost clout because it pressed for political goals that were unrelated to employment issues Finally he derided specific legislative proposals offered by the new right including a measure proposed by Senator Denton that would establish Federal programs to discourage teenage promiscuity Oh God Mr Goldwater said Theres no way How the hell could you regulate that
EXCERPTS FROM GOLDWATER REMARKS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/16/us/excerpts-from-goldwater-remarks.html,Following are excerpts from remarks inserted into the Congressional Record today by Senator Barry Goldwater Its a wonderful feeling to be a conservative these days When I ran for President 17 years ago I was told I was behind the times Now everybody tells me I was ahead of my time All I can say is that time certainly is an elusive companion But those reactions illustrate how far the ideological pendulum has swung in recent years The American people have expressed their desire for a new course in our public policy in this country a conservative course Being a conservative in America traditionally has meant that one holds a deep abiding respect for the Constitution We conservatives believe sincerely in the integrity of the Constitution We treasure the freedoms that document protects We believe as the founding fathers did that we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the prsuit of happiness And for 205 years this nation based on those principles has endured Through foreign wars and civil wars through political scandals and economic disasters through civil disorders and Presidential assassinations our flag has flown high Through it all weve survived every possible attack on our freedom But another force could succeed in dividing our country The specter of singleissue religious groups is growing over our land Issues Kept in Background One of the great strengths of our political system always has been our tendency to keep religious issues in the background By maintaining the separation of church and state the United States has avoided the intolerance which has so divided the rest of the world with religious wars Throughout our 200plus years public policy debate has focused on political and economic issues on which there can be compromise Madison saw this as the great paradox of our system How do you control the factions without violating the peoples basic freedoms And in a wellconstructed representative Government like ours Madison said one of our greatest strengths is our ability to break and control the violence of faction Can any of us refute the wisdom of Madison and the other framers Can anyone lo ok at the carnage in Iran the bloodshed in Northern Ireland or th e bombs bursting in Lebanon and yet question the dangers of in jecting religious issues into the affairs of state There is no position on which people are so immovable as their religious beliefs There is no more powerful ally one can claim in a debate than Jesus Christ or God or Allah or whatever one calls his Supreme Being But like any powerful weapon the use of Gods name on ones behalf should be used sparingly The religious factions that are growing in our land are not using their religioius clout with wisdom They are trying to force government leaders into following their positions 100 percent In the past couple years I have seen many news items that referred to the Moral Majority prolife and other religious groups as the new right and the new conservatism Well I have spent quite a number of years carrying the flag of the old conservatism And I can say with conviction that the religious issues of these groups have little or nothing to do with conservative or liberal politics The uncompromising position of these groups is a divisive element that could tear apart the very spirit of our representative system if they gain sufficient strength As it is they are diverting us away from the vital issues that our Government needs to address Far too much of the time of members of Congress and officials in the Executive Branch is used up dealing with specialinterest groups on issues like abortion school busing ERA prayer in the schools and pornography While these are important moral issues they are secondary right now to our national security and economic survival I must make it clear that I dont condemn these groups for what they believe I happen to share many of the values emphasized by these organizations Im frankly sick and tired of the political preachers across this country telling me as a citizen that if I want to be a moral person I must believe in A B C and D Just who do they think they are And from where do they presume to claim the right to dictate their moral beliefs to me And I am even more angry as a legislator who must endure the threats of every religious group who thinks it has some Godgranted right to control my vote on every roll call in the Senate I am warning them today I will fight them every step of the way if they try to dictate their moral convictions to all Americans in the name of conservatism Says It Destroys Perspective This unrelenting obsession with a particular goal destroys the perspective of many decent people They have become easy prey to manipulation and misjudgment A prime example was the recent nomination of Sandra OConnor as a Supreme Court Justice and the ensuing uproar over her stand on abortion No single issue ever should decide the fitness of a Supreme Court Justice To think otherwise is to go against the integrity of the Constitution There are many broad issues addressed each day by a jurist that are much more revealing of how that person might perform on the high court Of course the saddest part of the whole dispute was that Judge OConnor was attacked by these religious factions for a position she doesnt hold She opposes abortion and said so I firmly believe that she recognizes the authority of legislatures to regulate it She will make an excellent Justice of the Supreme Court She will make President Reagan proud that he chose her as the best of all candidates men or women And the religious factions will go on imposing their will on others unless the decent people connected to them recognize that religion has no place in public policy They must learn to make their views known without trying to make their views the only alternatives The great decisions of Government cannot be dictated by the concerns of religious factions This was true in the days of Madison and it is just as true today We have succeeded for 205 years in keeping the affairs of state separate from the uncompromising idealism of religious groups and we mustnt stop now To retreat from that separation would violate the principles of conservatism and the values upon which the framers built this democratic republic
NEW RIGHT LOSES ON JUDGE BUT GAINS NEW ZEAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/17/us/new-right-loses-on-judge-but-gains-new-zeal.html,The cries of outrage and betrayal with which the religious right greeted the nomination of Sandra Day OConnor to the Supreme Court 10 weeks ago had turned to whimpers by the time the television lights were shut off yesterday in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room The committee which includes several stalwarts of the new right among its 18 members did not produce a single vote against Judge OConnor The Rev Jerry Falwell the leader of Moral Majority initially labeled the nomination a disaster because of Judge OConnors less than implacable opposition to abortion But he kept his distance from the hearings and spent the day of the committee vote responding to some scathing criticism by that dean of the old right Senator Barry Goldwater So quickly did the threatened battle over the nomination wither that it might be tempting to declare the entire episode a strategic disaster for the new right But those who would most like that assessment to be true politicians of both parties who have watched with unease the ascent of the fundamentalist and antiabortion lobbies caution that it is premature to conclude that they are in disarray Serious Derailment Effort The effort to derail the confirmation was a serious one Richard A Viguerie the conservative political consultant started publishing a newsletter called The OConnor Report as a forum for critics of the nomination and Senate offices reported a heavy volume of negative mail Its failure was undoubtedly a setback Rather than weakening the religious right for the ideological battles that lie ahead in this session of Congress however the lasting political effect of the OConnor confirmation may be to raise the stakes for those battles Any Supreme Court nomination is special and President Reagans nomination of Sandra Day OConnor was so special as to all but doom any oppositio n that was not based on the discovery of personal or political sca ndal President Reagan is popular and polls showed that the idea of naming a woman to the Court was popular Unlike the Democraticled Senate that turned down two of Richard M Nixons Supreme Court nominees the Senate in 1981 is controlled by the party that controls the White House Final Stamp of Failure Even those members of the Judiciary Committee with the closest ties to the new right and the strongest personal doubts about the nomination refused to commit themselves to the opposition camp before last weeks confirmation hearings It was those hearings that put the final stamp of failure on the stopOConnor effort Well prepared and completely in control Judge OConnor presented herself as what those who know her say she is a mainstream Republican with conservative ideas about criminal justice family values and the role of the Federal courts By the time the first day was over it was apparent that by any reasonable measure the Republicans had in Sandra Day OConnor an ideal judicial nominee By the time Judge OConnors place on the witness stand was taken by the outside witnesses who had been invited to testify for and against the nomination the opposition had come to appear shrill or more devastating irrelevant During the last few hours of the day set aside for the outside witnesses only Senator Thurmond remained at the hearing his thin lined face impassive as emotional speeches about the rights of the unborn were read into the hearing record It was an anticlimactic and unceremonious end to the stopOConnor effort But the current session of Congress is far from over The new rights legislative agenda of social issues  abortion busing school prayer curbing the jurisdiction of the Federal courts  lies ahead and in the wake of the Judiciary Committee vote new right spokesmen said they felt not weakened but strengthened in their resolve to collect on campaign promises The confirmation process took the sc ales off our peoples eyesHoward Phillips of the Conservative Caucus sa id in an interview today He said the episode had taught the new right that neither the President nor the Republican Party can be tak en on faith as allies but must demonstrate that they are entitled t o continued support Conservative Senators who deserted the cause on the OConnor confirmation Mr Phillips said will be hardpressed to redeem themselves on the legislative issues in time to avert substantial defections by the demoralized and dispirited new right voters Credibility of Threat For that threat to be credible it must be assumed that large numbers of those voters do in fact equate a yes vote on Sandra OConnor with desertion on the substantive components of the agenda an assumption for which there is no concrete evidence Nonetheless the special factors that doomed the OConnor opposition are in large part absent from the coming legislative efforts There is no problem of disloyalty to the President in fact Mr Reagan is personally sympathetic to much of the social agenda While a singleissue emphasis might seem inappropriate in a judicial confirmation single issues are what legislation is about especially when there are fences to mend and disaffected friends to placate The taste of defeat has clearly given the new right a renewed taste for battle
"SENATE, 61-36, ENDS FILIBUSTER ON BUSING ISSUE",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/17/us/senate-61-36-ends-filibuster-on-busing-issue.html,The Senate took an important step today toward passage of severe restrictions on school busing for racial integration by voting to end a threemonth filibuster against the legislation The bill must still travel a long and tortuous path before it becomes law and critics of the proposal vowed to use Senate rules to continue their fight But the vote to end the filibuster which carried by 61 votes to 36 clearly indicated that a majority of the Senate was ready to end busing as a means of achieving racially balanced schools Social Issues Loom The vote also indicated that conservative lawmakers were increasingly eager to force Congress to confront the socalled social issues including busing abortion and school prayer Senate leaders have tried to keep these issues off the floor while Congress dealt with President Reagans economic program but Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the majority leader has said that he could not withstand the pressure indefinitely The legislative tangle that was partly dissolved today began last June when the Senate took up a bill authorizing funds for the Justice Department Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina proposed an amendment that would forbid the department to use funds to pursue cases that could result in courtordered busing Similar language had been adopted by the House Curbs on Busing Sought Then Senator J Bennett Johnston Democrat of Louisiana proposed an additional amendment that would bar courts from ordering the busing of students to a school more than 15 minutes or five miles from their homes In addition the Johnston amendment would allow the Attorney General to file suits challenging existing integration plans that involve extensive busing Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut immediately challenged the Johnston amendment as unconstitutional and began a filibuster in an attempt to kill the proposal Debate in the Senate can be ended only by a cloture vote which requires the support of 60 members and four times since June Mr Weicker and his allies had defeated cloture moves Today howe ver cloture was approved with the backing of 38 Republicans 22 Democrats almost all from the South and one independent Senator Harry F Byrd Jr of Virginia Immediately afterward the Senate adopted the Johnston amendment to Senator Helmss original proposal and then agreed to put the whole issue off until October At that point the Helms amendment including the Johnston language will be the business at hand Senator Johnston acknowledged that final adoption of the bill was a long way off but added It is my intention to keep going until we get it Asked to reply to charges that his bill would encourage segregation of the schools the Louisiana Democrat said This is an education amendment for people black and white who oppose forced crosstown busing This is a remedy that does not work It doesnt produce integration or provide a sound education Mr Johnston insisted that the amendment was constitutional because court decisions gave Congress wide latitude in applying remedies for segregation But Senator Weicker maintain ed that the legislation violated the Constitution because it represen ted an outright incursion of legislative power into areas r eserved for the judicialand executive branches Weicker Vows Further Fight The Connecticut Republican acknowledged that busing was unpopular and added There is no question in my mind that the Senate wants to pass an unconstitutional piece of legislation But thats why we have the rules of extended debate so that fads do not run the United States Senate Asked if his fellow senators understood the Constitution Mr Weicker replied Maybe they understand their own reelections better than they understand the Constitution He promised to continue his fight when the legislation comes back to the floor Its taken us three months to get this far he told the Senate today I can assure my colleagues it will take much more than three months before this gets to final passage In a statement after the vote the American Civil Liberties Union noted that other bills are coming along that would restrict the jurisdiction of Federal courts over a variety of issues The fight to save the Federal courts is just beginning asserted John Shattuck legislative director of the Civil Liberties Union What is at stake is the integrity of the court system

LEGAL ABORTIONS ARE STILL IMPERILED,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/18/opinion/l-legal-abortions-are-still-imperiled-018120.html,To the Editor Although I am heartened to see that curbs on Federal Medicaidfunded abortions have not significantly impeded the ability of poor women to obtain legal abortions news story Sept 4 it is premature to conclude as does Dr Willard Cates Jr Abortion Surveillance Branch chief at the Center for Disease Control that the data dont support the fears of the prochoice groups that large numbers of lowincome women would be forced to resort to illegal or selfinduced abortions As the article also states paraphrasing Dr Cates These findings stem largely from the fact that the vast majority of women who seek abortions live in states that have continued to provide funds for abortions for medically indigent women Clearly if not tautologically women who are medically indigent need to rely on governmental funding of abortion What has changed so far is merely the source of government funding and therefore there is not yet any dramatic change in the abortion rate But there will be if all government funding of abortion ceases and this is not a mere hypothetical possibility Already in Pennsylvania a package of bills has been introduced in the General Assembly to make abortions far more difficult to obtain One provision would end the funding by the state government of abortions for the indigent and for state employees through their health benefit programs except in a few narrow circumstances rape incest and to save the life of the mother These bills are not an isolated instance they were drafted by a national antiabortion organization Those who believe that all women ought to have a right to determine free of governmental strictures whether to bear children are forewarned that this right may well become an endangered species ALAN MEISEL Assoc Professor of Law and Psychiatry University of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh Sept 4 1981
ANTIABORTION PLAN: WHERE IS JUSTICE?,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/20/nyregion/antiabortion-plan-where-is-justice.html,IT is a scene I am not likely to forget  ever The year was 1969 I was a junior in college and abortion was illegal The girls in the dormitory talked about it all the time of course  what we would do if it happened to us where we would go who we could trust  or if we could possibly raise a baby on our own or survive a hasty marriage But none of us really believed it would happen We were intelligent and careful we used contraceptives and prayed a lot But Peggy became pregnant anyway I remember it was May and we were studying for finals At 2 AM I was dozing over my books when I heard screams coming down the hall At first I thought it was just some kids letting off steam but the screams were followed by moans and then shouts for help I ran down the hall and quickly discovered the cause of the commotion Peggy was wedged in the corner of the bathroom surrounded by a sea of blood Peggy was already unconscious her face white and distorted by pain We called the ambulance and she was rushed to a hospital only minutes away but she died  from hemorrhaging and infection caused by a coathanger abortion She was a bright beautiful 20yearold girl whose only sin was an accidental pregnancy Because abortion was illegal it was a sin that cost her her life Peggy was not alone that year She joined hundreds of women who died either trying to abort themselves or at the hands of untrained abortionists in nonmedical settings Hundreds of other women suffered severe psychological or physical traumas  including sterility  that would haunt them for the rest of their lives Finally on Jan 22 1973 the United States Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision in the case of Roe v Wade they ruled that women had a constitutional right to an abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy The decision was based on a womans right to privacy and on her freedom of choice as an individual Almost immediately the Supreme Court ruling was responsible for saving lives According to statistics from the United States Public Health Service illegal abortions were responsible for more than 300 deaths a year in the 1960s In 1973 alone the first year of widespread legalized abortion maternal deaths from abortion dropped to just 47 a decline of 84 percent But now in 1981 we are asked to take a giant leap backward  into the twilight era of backstreet abortions and maternal deaths  if the powerful RighttoLife movement manages to push its human life amendment through Congress Although it is almost impossible to believe the following conditions would prevail if this amendment was added to the Constitution Abortion for a woman carrying a child with severe birth defects would be denied Abortion for a woman who conceived while being raped would be denied Abortion for women with serious health problems including cancer severe hypertension heart and kidney disease would be denied even though the pregnancy might cause serious complications and ultimately shorten the womens life Even some contraceptives such as the intrauterine device and morningafter pill would be outlawed Miscarriages would be subject to investigation to determine if they resulted from abus e carelessness or criminal negligence And comp lications and death fromillegal abortions would once more be commonpl ace For those of us who favor safe legal abortion the questions raised by this kind of legislation are staggering Where is the justice in a law that would force a woman to carry a child conceived in rape  and then who is supposed to raise and love this child once he is born Where is the humanity in a law that would bring children into the world with serious birth defects when we have the technology to detect these genetic tragedies during pregnancy Arent the lives of women just as sacred as the lives of their unborn children or is one life more sacred than another Ironically under this new law a fetus would be declared a person with full constitutional rights from the moment of conception but the mother would forfeit all rights and privileges as an individual The RighttoLife groups have pulled out all the stops with their pictures of fetuses piled up in garbage cans but their genuine concern for all human life is tragically onesided I wish I had a picture of Peggy bleeding to death on the bathroom floor and pictures of all the other women who died because abortion was not a safe legal alterna tive to a very complicated problem If the human life amendment is passed it will be one giant step backward for all humanity There are 205000 women of childbearing age in Westchester County who could be affected by whatever decision is reached on abortion Nearly 37000 of these women are between 15 and 19 years old  typically unmarried students who are the most likely to become pregnant accidentally and most likely to seek an abortion at any cost including the risk of their own lives if legal abortion is not available But the Right to Life Movement continues to gain political strength and emotional momentum even in liberal Westchester Of

CONGRESS V. THE COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/20/magazine/congress-v-the-court.html,Irving R Kaufman is a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit By Irving R Kaufman The first Monday in October the commencement of the new Supreme Court term is normally one of the more exciting dates on Washingtons calendar The long summer recess over the nine Justices don their black robes and enter the marble and oak courtroom where they will ponder questions of truth and justice This year however Oct 5 will also be a time of no little concern for these esteemed jurists  as it should be for us all The reason The role of the High Court as a counterbalance to the legislative and executive branches of government  a fundamental pillar of the American system  is under attack Congress currently has before it more than 30 bills designed to sharply restrict the authority of the Federal judiciary and limit its power to interpret the Constitution These bills have been introduced by members of Congresss new conservative coalition individuals who have been profoundly disturbed by many of the decisions the Suprem e Court has made over the last two decades For example the Court has forbidden mandatory prayer in public schools upheld a womans right to abortion during the first three months of pregnancy and characterized busing as the only constitutionally adequate remedy in some instances of racial imbalance in public schools These decisions all formed on the basis of constitutional principle and constitutional principle alone  undoubtedly appear as obstacles to the social changes the new legislative coalition intends to make in this country now that the political pendulum is swinging in its direction The way the coalition proposes to overcome these obstacles threatens not only a number of individual liberties but also the very independence of the Federal courts an independence that has safeguarded the rights of American citizens for nearly 200 years The current legislative outlook is ominous A subcommitee of the Senate Judiciary Committee has already approved a bill that would forbid the lower Federal courts to entertain challenges to state antiabortion legislation even legislation that defined abortion as murder In the last Congress the Senate easily passed a proposal to withdraw lower Federal court jurisdiction in school prayer cases A discharge petition to move the bill from the House Judiciary Committee to the floor failed by only 32 votes The bill has been reintroduced and its chances for passage are rated better in this years Congress Other bills which would take from the Supreme Court the power to revise state and lower Federal court decisions in school prayer abortion and busing cases are now wending their way through the SenateHouse Judiciary Committees Legal experts from all sections of the political spectrum have begun stepping forward to denounce these proposals The American Bar Association calls them a danger to the fundamental system of checks and balances And Prof Laurence H Tribe of the Harvard Law School has gone so far as to characterize one of the bills as too palpably unconstitutional to permit reasonable persons to argue the contrary Still the possibility that some of these bills may be enacted into law cannot be dismissed If that should happen the Supreme Court would either have to accept the Congress mandate or adjudicate the constitutionality of the laws If the Supreme Court then decided that the laws were indeed unconstitutional it would be up to Congress either to back down or to permanently reduce the Courts power through constitutional amendment Such dilemmas have come close to occurring in the past Today it is the conservative wing that is attempting to circumscribe the Courts historical role At other times in the past the attack against the Court has been led by liberal reformers  while conservatives stood as sentinels guarding the sanctity of the Constitution In the early 20th century the Court struck down many pieces of legislation that sought to promote social change including laws regulating child labor setting minimum wages and maximum hours forbidding the use of injunctions in labor disputes and providing compensation for accident and illness In response liberals and progressives led by Robert M La Follette attacked not only the concept of judicial review but the judges themselves Statutes were introduced in Congress to require the votes of at least six justices to invalidate legislation and some Congressmen supported constitutional amendments that would have mandated the popular election and recall of Federal judges Some years later after the Supreme Court invalidated much New Deal legislation President Roosevelt proposed a bill that would have allowed him to increase the Courts membership Had that bill passed Roosevelt would have been able to pack the Court with political allies insuring that it would always decide as he saw fit Fortunately that plan died in the Senate Judiciary Committee Efforts to curb the courts have if anything become more frequent in recent years and they have been proposed by politicians of almost all political stripes After the Supreme Courts l954 decision in Brown v Board of Education which declared an end to the purposeful segregation of public schools a number of bills were introduced in Congress proposing to remove all Federal court jurisdiction in desegregation cases At about the same time the call for popular election of Federal judges was renewed Later in l958 at the height of the cold war serious and widespread support gathered for a bill that would have overturned Supreme Court decisions guaranteeing First Amendment freedoms to political dissidents by removing appelate jurisdiction in cases involving alleged subversive activity And in l964 the House of Representatives but not the Senate passed a bill that would have deprived the Supreme Court and the lower Federal courts of the power to hear cases regarding enforcement of the Courts new rule of oneman onevote for apportionment of state legislatures a rule that was intended to redress inequities in voting strength caused by racial animus The reapportionment decisions spurred a furious attack on the Court led by proponents of states rights some of whom went so far as t o propose that a Court of the Union composed of the Chief Justices of all the states be established to review the decision s of the Supreme Court All the bills under consideration this year invoke the concept of jurisdiction the basic authority of a tribun al to decide a case Sponsors of the bills cite Article III of the Constitution which assigns to Congress the power to define and r egulate the jurisdictionof all Federal courts including the Supreme C ourt Using this power the Congress has for example denied Federal judicial authority in some cases involving lawsuits for less than  10000 No one questionsthe legitimacy of that restriction So why t he sponsors ask can Cong ress not also declare as one bill does that the Su preme Courtshall not have jurisdiction to review  any case arising out of anyState statute ordinancerule or regulation  which rela tes to abortion The answer is not simple It rest on an unders tanding of the scope of Congresss authority over the jurisdiction of the Federal courts which in turn depends on an understandin g of the Constitution and the role the Constitution mandates that t he Federal courts play in the American system The framers and early expositors of the Constitution did not fear the power of the courts With no innate authority either to enforce its own judgments or to control the purse strings the judiciary was expected to be the weakest of the three branches of government It was rather the legislative branch that the framers felt a need to restrain Steeped in English parliamentary history they knew the dangers of legislative tyranny James Madison the principal architect of the Constitution observed The legislative department is everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex The framers set up the Federal court system as one means of checking the Congress Using the power of judicial review the courts would invalidate any leglislative acts that were inconsistent with the strictures of the Constitution The theory was and still is that Congress should exercise only a delegated authority derived from the people The Constitution in contrast was intended to represent the actual embodiment of the peoples fundamental and supreme will Thus when presented with a case in which a legislative act contravenes the constitutional mandate it is the duty of the courts to uphold the latter To deny this said Alexander Hamilton would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than his principal that the servant is above his master that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves The Supreme Court has therefore struck down laws passed by Congress that conflict with the Constitution ever since the landmark l803 case of Marbury v Madison For almost as long the Court has invalidated constitutionally offensive state statutes as well That duty scholars insist is grounded in Article VI of the Constitution which commands This Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof  shall be the supreme law of the land It was inevitable that the judiciary of the three branches of government would be charged with the responsibility of assessing the constitutional validity of legislation To insure the judiciarys ability to perform this sensitive duty faithfully and neutrally the framers deliberately shielded the judges from political pressures by guaranteeing them within the Constitution itself life tenure and by further providing that their salaries could not be diminished through legislative act Their independence to quote Hamilton again would insure that inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the Constitution which we perceive to be indispensable in the courts of justice This is not to say that the Federal courts judgments relating to the the constitutionality of legislation  including legislation on such issues as abortion school prayer and busing  cannot be overridden An unpopular Supreme Court decision on a constitutional issue can be overturned through a constitutionally prescribed means an amendment to the Constitution In fact three times amendments have been proposed and ratified as a way of nullifying controversial Supreme Court decisions The 11th Amendment which forbids a suit in Federal court against a state without its consent was adopted to overrule a 1793 holding that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction over a case brought by two South Carolinians against the State of Georgia In 1868 during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War the 14th Amendment was enacted This amendment which proclaims that all persons born in the United States are full citizens of the United States with all rights and immunities of citizens overruled the infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857 which had declared that black slaves as no more than pieces of property lacked the rights of citizens Finally in l913 the 16th Amendment was adopted to overturn a Supreme Court decision holding that the Federal income tax was unconstitutional Constitutional amendments however are not a means most critics of the Court are eager to employ to bring about the changes they seek Their passage requires a cumbersome procedure of ratification  as supporters of the proposed equalrights amendment well know The framers deliberately made the amendment process cumbersome because they did not want expediency to prevail over constitutional rights They believed that any alteration of the fundamental law of the land should enjoy the overwhelming and sustained s upport of the citizenryA simple majority in both Houses of Congress sufficient to pass the ordinary statute should not be enough to jus tify permanent changes in the nations charter of basic freedoms Herein lies the tactical appeal of the withdrawalofjurisdiction strategem Many supporters of the 30 or so divestiture bills n ow before Congre ss freely admit that they are attempting to bypass the amendment pro cess Their rationale is simple Since the popular support to ov erride Court decisions by amending the Constitution is difficult to garner why not accomplish the same result with a simplestatute restr icting the power of the courts to consider the constitutiona l principles they dislike In 964 following the Supreme Court s landmark decision on legislative reapportionment Senator Evere tt M Dirkson introduced a bill to withdraw Federal court jurisdi ction in apportionment cases When asked whether he was attempting to enact a constitutional amendment in the form of a statute he responded There is no time in the present legislative session to do anything with a constitutional amendment We are dealing with a condition not a theory A candid and revealing response then as now The rationale of our Constitution is not to be lightly ignored It was designed to protect individual rights by vesting the Federal courts with the final binding authority to interpret the fundamental law The only way to override the Constitution as so interpreted is to amend it The backdoor mechanism of withdrawing the Courts jurisdiction is clearly antithetical to the judiciarys role in the constitutional scheme If the bills depriving the Court of the authority to hear cases on such topics as abortion school prayer and busing are considered constitutional Congress might just as well pass laws depriving the Court of the authority to hear constitutional claims based on such freedoms as speech and religion The potential consequences are astonishing There is another contention being put forward by the proponents of the withdrawalofjurisdiction bills that needs to be discussed These legislators note that the Constitution states that the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact with such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress shall make The exceptions and regulations clause they argue grants Congress wideranging authority to restrict the substantive categories of cases that may be appealed from the state and lower Federal courts to the Supreme Court But to assert that the framers who clearly intended the Supreme Court to exercise the power of judicial review also intended to grant Congress plenary authority to nullify that power is to charge the framers with baffling selfcontradiction Indeed the history of the exceptionsandregulations clause suggests that it was never intended to carry the heavy constitutinal baggage with which the bills supporters are now loading it The clause originated in the fears of some members of the Constitutional Convention that Supreme Court review of factual determinations appellate review was to be both as to law and fact would impair the right of jury trial in the states Hamilton stated The propriety of this appellate jurisdiction has scarcely been called in question in regard to matters of law but the clamors have been loud against it as applied to matters of fact Since the practices with respect to appellate review of factual determinations varied so widely from state to state the framers decided to leave to Congress in the exceptionsandregulations clause the authority to regulate the scope of Supreme Court review of facts The clause was never meant to confer a broad control over appellate review of substantive legal issues including issues of Federal constitutional law Indeed the Convention considered and rejected proposed constitutional language that the judicial power shall be exercised in such manner as the legislature shall direct Far from a mandate to effectively abrogate the vindication of constitutional rights the clause was intended merely as a way to give Congress the authority to regulate the Supreme Courts docket with reasonable housekeeping measures Thus in the Judiciary Act of 1789 Congress restricted the Courts appellate jurisdiction over cases coming from the United States Circuit Courts to those in which the amount in controversy exceeded a prescribed minimum On only two or three occasions in its history has the Supreme Court passed upon the constitutionality of legislation seeking to limit its appellate jurisdiction Both cases occurred over a century ago and both reveal constitutional defects in the current proposals relating to jurisdiction In the first case Ex parte McCardle decided in 1869 the Court upheld a restriction on its appellate jurisdiction Although relegated to a small niche in history this case was enormously important in its day for it involved a challenge to the postCivil War Reconstruction program in which Congress had placed 10 of the former Confederate states under military rule McCardle had been imprisoned by the military government of Mississippi for the publication of allegedly libelo us material Pursuant to a Federal statute passed in l867 he applied to a lower Federal court for a writ of habeas corpus ord ering his release He asserted that the Reconstruction Acts were un constitutional The court denied his application and he appealed to the Supreme Court onthe basis of that same Federal statute Befor e the case was decided by the Court however Congress repealed that part of the 1867 statute which authorized appeals to the High Court We are not at liberty to inquire into the motives of the legislature the Court held We can only examine into its power under the Constitution and the power to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of the Court is given by express words Despite this pronouncement the McCardle case is not ordinarily read as authority for a broad Congressional power to restrict the enforcement of constitutional rights in the Supreme Court Under the Judiciary Act of 1789 McCardle could still apply for an original writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court Therefore the repealing act actually cut off only one avenue of habeas relief The Court concluded as much in the 1869 case of Exparte Yerger a case that was in many ways strikingly similar to McCardle Yerger held that the repealing statute did not affect the petitioners right to apply for an original writ pursuant to the act of 1789 In contrast with the statute under consideration in McCardle the bills that would forbid any Supreme Court review of busing school prayer and abortion decisions would totally foreclose the possibility of a Supreme Court hearing on a claim of Federal constitutional right Surely McCardle cannot be considered a precedent for that This view is confirmed by United States v Klein decided in 1872 in which the Court struck down a limitation on its powers of appellate review Klein administered the estate of a cotton plantation owner whose property was seized and sold by Union agents during the Civil War Under legislation providing for recovery of seized property of noncombatant rebels upon proof of loyalty Klein sued and won in the Court of Claims proferring a Presidential pardon as proof of loyalty The Court had previously interpreted a Presidential pardon as carrying with it a proof of loyalty But pending the Governments appeal to the Supreme Court Congress passed an act which legislated that acceptance of a pardon was on the contrary conclusive proof of disloyalty and one which in addition required the Supreme Court to dismiss for want of jurisdiction any appeal in which the claim for recovery was based on a pardon Invalidating that legislation the Court concluded that Congress had unconstitutionally attempted to interfere with the Courts duty to interpret and give effect to a provision of the Constitution The language of the proviso shows plainly that it does not intend to withhold appellate jurisdiction except as a means to an end Its great and controlling purpose is to deny pardons granted by the President the effect which this Court had adjudged them to have The proviso declares that pardons shall not be considered by this Court on appeal We had already decided it was our constitutional duty to consider them and give them effect in cases like the present as equivalent proof of loyalty In a similar manner the current withdrawalofjurisdiction proposals do not intend to withhold appellate jurisdiction except as a means to an end And the end in this instance is precisely the same as it was in Klein the circumvention of the Supreme Courts authoritative interpretation of a constitutional provision As Klein demonstrates Congress does not have the power to subvert established constitutional principles under the guise of regulating the Courts appellate jurisdiction Those who would read the exceptionsandregulations clause broadly also argue that state courts which frequently rely on the Federal Constitution in striking down state legislation could adequately protect constitutional rights without review in the Supreme Court The short answer to this contention is that a Federal constitutional right is of dubious value if it means one thing in Mississippi and another in Minnesota State courts have at times differed profoundly on the meaning of constitutional provisions To cite but one illustration in 1965 the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts concluded that the book Fanny Hill was unprotected by the First Amendment At about the same time the New York Court of Appeals found that it was Obviously the need for uniformity in matters of Federal constitutional interpretation is essential and the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was designed to meet that important need Chief Justice John Marshall said in Cohens v Virginia The necessity of uniformity as well as correctness in expounding the Constitution and laws of the United States would itself suggest the propriety of deciding in the last resort all cases in which they are invovled  The framers of the Constitution declare that in such cases the Supreme Court shall exercise appellate jurisdiction In connection with this uniformity function there is an interesting tale concerning one of the most eminent jurists in American history Judge Learned Hand of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit In 1958 at the ripe age of 86 Hand still nimble of mind and capacious of spirit was asked by Senator Thomas C Hennings Jr of Missouri c hairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Righ ts to comment upon a thencurrent bill to remove Supreme Court app ellate jurisdiction in cases regarding internal security Hand promp tly responded It seems to me desirable that the Court should h ave the last word on questions of the character involved Of cours e there is always the chance of abuse of power wherever it is lodge d but at long last the least conte ntious organ of government generally is the Cou rt I do not of course mean that I think it is always right but some final authority is better than unsettled conflict It should also be selfevident that the framers saw independent tenured Federal judges  knowledgeable in Federal law drawn from all over the country and as prescribed in the Constitution itself appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate  as more appropriate arbiters of conflicts between constitutional and state law than elected state judges many of whom are popularly elected and who might be partial to state law The framers realized that only the Federal judges could insure the supremacy of Federal law As James Madison said In controversies relating to the boundary between the two jurisdictions Federal and state the tribunal which is ultimately to decide is to be established under the general Government  Some such tribunal is clearly essential to prevent an appeal to the sword and a dissolution of the compact The argument for giving Congress the authority to determine the kinds of cases and the types of remedies that the inferior Federal courts may hear is a bit more complicated  if equally unpersuasive It too is based on Article III of the Constitution which gives Congress the right to establish such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish Since this provision has been interpreted by many legal experts as giving Congress the right to establish or abolish the lower courts does it not follow that it also gives Congress the authority to regulate the subject matter of their jurisdiction The fallacy of this argument is that the framers predicated Congressional discretion on the assumption that litigants would in all cases be able to present their Federal claims or defenses to some Federal court either in the district court or on appeal And it was further assumed that even if no lesser Federal courts were created the Supreme Court itself would serve as the requisite forum by hearing all constitutional cases appealed from the state courts Throughout most of the 19th century this was possible The Courts docket was almost empty by todays standards and it could ordinarily hear a constitutional case any time one of the parties so desired But beginning about l875 the Supreme Courts case load began to grow enormously giving rise to a series of acts culminating in the Judges Bill of 1925 which gave the Court the discretion to decide which cases within certain categories it would hear In the process the Supreme Court was transformed from a general court of appeal into a court which would decide only cases of great constitutional moment or high precedential value As the Supreme Court has found itself deciding a progressively smaller percentage of the cases involving Federal constitutional and statutory law the role of the lower Federal courts in protecting constitutional rights has expanded to the point of practical and effective primacy And over the last two decades a period during which there has been an explosive growth of litigation the inferior Federal courts have become in most instances the only forums in which a litigant could secure a decision on his constitutional claims by a judge life tenured under Article III of the Constitution If Congress were now to abolish the lower Federal courts it would effectively cut off almost all opportunity for Federal adjudication of Federal rights And clearly the framers did not wish to leave to the states final authority to decide matters of Federal constitutional law For this reason the argument that Congress can withdraw jurisdiction over certain classes of Federal cases or rights because it has discretion to abolish the lower courts does not hold up under examination Authoritative precedent also strongly suggests that even if Congress had the power to abolish some or all of the lower Federal courts it may not use its power over lower court jurisdiction to thwart the vindication of constitutional rights The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said in Battaglia v General Motors Corporation decided in 1948 that while Congress has the undoubted power to give withhold and restrict the jurisdiction of courts  it must not so exercise that power as to deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law The conclusion that can be drawn from all of these arguments is this Congress does indeed have broad discretion to withdraw jurisdiction from lower Federal courts  where no substantive constitutional rights are at issue The statutory rights that owe their existence to Congress as distinguished from constitutional rights may be taken away either by a repealing statute or by a provision withdrawing Federal court jurisdiction Where rights embodied in the Constitution are concerned however the discretion of Congress is limited When Congress deprives a Federal court of the authority to hear a litigants constitutional claims or defenses it must provide that litigant with another Federal forum in which to seek an adequate remedy The distinguished legal scholar Henry Hart once decried the use of statutes withdrawing lower court jurisdiction to undermine constitutional rights Why what monstrous illogic To build up a mere power t o regulate jurisdiction into a power to affect rights having nothing to do with jurisdictionAnd into a power to do it in contradiction to all the other terms of the very document which confers the power to regulate jurisdiction Applying these lessons to the divestiture bills now before Congress there can be no doubt that all of them trench upon established constitutional rights The Supreme Court has determined that busing may be a constitutionally required remedy in an appropriate case for violations of schoolchildrens equalprotection rights to an education in a desegregated public school Chief Justice Burger has written for the Court Bus transportation has long been an integral part of all public educational systems and it is unlikely that a truly effective remedy could be devised without continued reliance upon it In the landmark case of Roe v Wade the Court firmly established a womans constitutional right to an abortion And for nearly two decades the Court has found mandatory prayer in the public schools to violate the constitutional principle of separation of church and state One may disagree with these decisions they may even transgress ones deepest moral convictions But one cannot doubt that they were based upon informed interpretation of the Constitution and not on the basis of political or ideological expediency It is worth recallling the pungent words of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes We are under a Constitution but the Constitution is what the judges say it is and the judiciary is the safeguard of our liberty and of our property under the Constitution Depriving the Federal courts of the power to adjudicate cases relating to such issues as desegregation abortion and school prayer effectively precludes Federal protection  the constitutionally envisaged and most reliable form of protection  of our cherished constitutional rights The result of the proposed legislation would be to deny citizens the protection of constitutional rights that the Supreme Court has declared they possess It would be strange indeed if Congress could accomplish through a jurisdictional bill what it clearly may not accomplish directly a reversal of constitutional principle by an act of Congress The law is clear for example that Congress has no power to declare racial discrimination in Federal Government employment legal The logic of the arguments raised by the proponents of the divestiture bills would however permit Congress to remove from the Federal courts all jurisdiction to hear cases involving racial discrimination against Government employees The motive discrimination would be equally patent in either instance If one needs to find language in the Constitution as a source for these restrictions on the power of Congress to control the jurisdiction of the lower Federal courts it is in the dueprocess clause of the Fifth Amendment The overarching guarantee of due process is the sacred assurance that the Federal Government will govern fairly impartially and compassionately All the powers of Congress  to tax to make war to regulate commerce  are constrained by its constitutional inability to deprive us of our rights to life liberty and property without due process of law As a power of Congress the authority to control jurisdiction is therefore restricted by the right of due process That is the wonder of the American Constitution as it lives and breathes Should Congress insist upon restricting the judiciary in ways that the Supreme Court may view as unconstitutional the Supreme Court might well strike down the withdrawalofjurisdiction legislation leaving Congress and the judiciary in conflict This institutional dissension would continue until Congress either accepted the Courts determination or passed a constitutional amendment restructuring the basic relationship between the judicial and legislative branches of government It is understandable that politically vulnerable legislators would react adversely to judicial nullification of their 
nactments Yet those who criticize the courts for their unresponsiveness to the present national mood tend to forget that the judicial branch was not designed as just another barometer of current public opinion Congress is superbly adequate for that function and we ought not to presume that the framers intended the judiciary as an institutional redundancy In exercising their power of judicial review the courts have represented the longterm slowly evolving values of the American people as enshrined in the Constitution And when the people have recognized Congressional courtcurbing efforts for what they are  assaults on the Constitution itself  they have in every instance rejected them It is of no small interest that even some of the supporters of the divestiture bills have begun to question the constitutionality of these proposals And indeed there is a glimmer of hope that these doubts will eventually permeate Congress The long history of Congressional courtcurbing measures reveals that the legislative branch has in every instance ultimately yielded to the judiciarys duty to interpret the Constitution and has not at least since passing the statute involved in the Klein case more than a century ago challenged the courts with a jurisdictional bill that would impinge upon the fulfillment of that duty Robert McKay former dean of the New York University Law School wrote of bills to withdraw jurisdiction over apportionment cases Once again as so often in the past when the implications of the proposed legislation were madeclear the Congress would not quite cross the threshold of no return The political risks attending bills to withdraw Federal jurisdiction create another check on the legislative goal of certain Congressmen Groups of all persuasions have attempted to achieve their political aims through attacks on the Courts authority to decide constitutional cases While it is true that political conservatives are the strongest supporters of the current efforts to withdraw jurisdiction liberal reformers have also utilized this strategy in the past Employed successfully by todays political majority it could easily be manipulated tomorrow by a different majority  and to other ends In the final analysis then while the current divestiture bills should be a cause for concern about the ability of our constitutional system to withstand the onslaught of restrictive legislation there is also room for hope In the long history of courtcurbing efforts the majority has always in the end acknowledged the clear intention of the framers To preserve the rights of the people the Federal judiciary must interpret and apply the Constitution unfettered by unseemly limitations on its jurisdiction The current Congress is a body of distinguished and wise legislators who are unlikely to sacrifice the longterm good of the Republic for speculative and shortterm political gain As the New England poet James Russell Lowell once said Such power there is in cleareyed selfrestraint As the first Monday in October draws near there is reason to believe that Congress will be instructed by the lessons of history and see that the constitutional powers of the highest court in the land  and of other Federal courts should remain inviolate,,
"260,000 IN CAPITAL RALLY FOR PROTEST O F REAGAN POLICIES",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/20/us/260000-in-capital-rally-for-protest-o-f-reagan-policies.html,Members of organized labor and civil rights groups angry over President Reagans deep cuts in the social programs and changes in job safety rules that unions have promoted so fervently streamed into Washington today by the tens of thousands to register their resentment in person The marshaling of the participants by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations for the Solidarity Day rally marked the first Kirklands remarks page 34 effort by that organization to regroup its scattered forces and halt the decline of labors political influence in the capital This evening the National Park Service whose jurisdiction includes the Mall area where the rally was held estimated the crowd at 260000 Kirkland Assails Reagan Lane Kirkland president of the labor federation told the crowd that President Reagan was wrong in telling Americans that he alone speaks for the working people of this country and that we do not He asserted We have come too far struggled too long sacrificed too much and have too much left to do to allow what we have achieved for the good of all to be swept away without a fight And wehave not forg otten how to fight And he warned But the winds are changing as they always do The winters chill is approaching and the bloom is fading from false mandates Wide Participation by Unions Virtually every major union in the AFLCIO brought delegations from around the nation They were joined by leaders and members of many civil rights groups representing women blacks Hispanic Americans and other members of minorities as well as the elderly and the disabled Mr Reagan left Washington this weekend for the Presidential retreat at Camp David Md But a statement read by David R Gergen the senior White House spokesman said The President believes that working men and women clearly need a break from high inflation high taxes high interest rates and high unemployment By midmorning Washingtons subways rented for the day for 65000 by the organizers who opened its turnstiles free to the public were disgorging train loads of union members into the streets that lead to the expanse of the Mall at the base of the Washington Monument Led by Mr Kirkland they marched in orderly echelons up Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues to the eastern end of the Mall carrying signs denouncing the President and his administrators and shouting their protests Along the way members of the Pro fessional Air Traffic Controllers Organization handed out leaflets denouncing Mr Reagan for dismissing them after their walkout in August and for the Governments attempt to bar the union as the controllers bargaining agent Mr Kirkland has said he called for todays huge rally because he felt insulted by President Reagans remark last February that union leaders had lost touch with their members and because in regional meetings held last spring union leaders demanded a large protest against the policies of the Reagan Administration The decline in labors influence has been attributed in part to the large labor vote Mr Reagan received last fall According to postelection surveys 44 percent of households with union members voted for the Republican candidate Long Line of Speakers The long line of speakers who mounted the windwhipped platform included Douglas A Fraser president of the United Automobile Workers the Rev Benjamin L Hooks executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Eleanor Smeal president of the National Organization for Women and Coretta Scott King widow of the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr They denounced what they said were Mr Reagans efforts to alter the Social Security system diminish the enforcement of equal employment opportunity rules and for what they asserted was his bias against organized labor Sam Church Jr president of the United Mine Workers though not affiliated with the AFLCIO brought union members from Appalachia to the rally Their protest target was the Administrations reductions of Federal aid for agencies that supervise mine safety and job health programs Noti ng that Mr Reagan had left Washington Mr Church declared I am not surprised that he arranged to be o ut of town so he would not have to face this show of solidarity and strength But he is going to have to eventually face up to the da mage he is doing to the men women and children of the country who wi ll bear the burdens of his economic program while the rich reap its rewards In recent weeks organized labor has begun to abandon its traditional stance of not being formally identified with either political party Many unions have been openly raising money to support Democrats in next years Congressional elections Todays rally offered Democratic leaders a chance to thank them Several Democratic Senators and Congressmen rode on buses carrying delegations from their states and several including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan Democrat of New York joined the march In a message of congratulations on the rally Charles T Manatt chairman of the Democratic National Committee urged union members to work for the election of Democratic candidates who were committed to restoring social programs No American should stand idle while the Reagan Administration cuts guts and punishes the nonrich and the nonpowerful the message asserted Message From Kennedy In a simila r message Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts  said opponents of the Democrats believed they had a mandate to  dismantle our Federal Government and all it stands for But we are confident that the vast majority of our people will soon understand that the prevailing philosophy of this moment is alien to our history and contrary to our hopes he declared From San Francisco former Vice President Walter F Mondale who may be one of Senator Kennedys chief opponents for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1984 sent the text of the speech he is making to a similar Solidarity Rally in that city But I would remind some of our nations highest elected officials that you cannot support free unions in Poland and then work to weaken and cripple free unions here at home he asserted The Presidents opposition to the equal rights amendment and abortion and his Administrations slashing of special programs for women and children brought an angry denunciation from Joyce Miller president of the Coalition of Labor Union Women and the first woman to serve on the labor federations executive council Sex Bias in Pay Assailed Mr President more than 60 percent of this countrys women are now in the work force she declared But no matter how hard we work we still earn only 59 cents for every dollar a man earns and thats discrimination Among the demonstrators were many who expressed surprise at the turnout and pleasure at the feeling that the event would make a difference Dan Lillienstein president of local 2704 International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers traveled 12 hours by bus from Burlington Vt He said the demonstration had renewed my faith in the American worker and he added This shows that Reagan doesnt have the working people behind him You cant stop organized labor Its

THE P.L.O.'S POWER TO CHANGE MIDEAST REALITIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/20/opinion/l-the-plo-s-power-to-change-mideast-realities-019595.html,To the Editor I too find it saddening that Flora Lewiss thoughtful comments on the Middle East provoked abusive letters from readers column Sept 14 Anyone involved in public discussions of this complex and highly emotional issue is not unfamiliar with this phenomenon I doubt however that the quotient of unreasonable people to be found on this issue is any larger than on other emotional issues whether it is the situation in Ireland or the issue of abortion or even the strike of the air traffic controllers The suggestion that supporters of Israel are singularly mindless is therefore unfair and itself no contribution to reasoned discussion of a difficult problem I wish to touch on one aspect of that problem one referred to by Flora Lewis as the need for Israel to compromise for peace For reasons that elude me the American press generally celebrates the slightest hint  no matter how unlikely or farfetched  of the possible willingness of the PLO or Saudi Arabia to compromise while virtually ignoring the vast and painful concessions already made by Israel in order to obtain peace with Egypt These concessions include return of the entire Sinai peninsula to Egypt the return of oilfields that are critical to Israels survival the complete evacuation of Israeli settlements from territories to be returned to Egypt and the abandonment of two of the worlds most sophisticated air force installations Editorial appreciation of these concrete and costly compromises by Israel are few and far between I agree that fu rther compromises are necess ary Indeed I am in full accord with those Israeli leaders  incl uding some in Mr Begins own coalition  who maintain that Isr ael cannot rule permanently over one million West Bank Arabs and for long retain its Jewish or democratic character I would be ha rd put to argue that MrBegins approach to this problem has been suf ficiently imaginative orgenerous But here again as with other eleme nts of the ArabIsraeli conflict the emphasis on compromise by Israe l is imbalanced and lacking in political realism The fact of the matter is that it is within the power of the PLO  and only the PLO  to change the situation on the West Bank If it were to tell the world tomorrow that it renounces its Charter which calls for the destruction of Israel and that it accepts Israels right to a secure and peaceful existence Middle Eastern realities would be changed dramatically and irreversibly overnight The PLO would immediately be seen as an unavoidable party to negotiations concerning the future of the West Bank There is no doubt that Western European countries and the US would immediately shed remaining inhibitions about dealing directly with the PLO and within Israel itself there would develop powerful political pressures for a change in Israeli policy Even the most hardnosed Israeli administration would have to respond to so dramatic a change in the PLOs position With these simple words  we accept the existence of Israel  the PLO could change all current Middle Eastern realities prevent the annexation of the West Bank and place Palestinian selfdetermination on the agenda of all future ArabIsraeli negotiations These simple words the PLO refuses to utter It prefers instead a continuation of bloody terrorism against Israel With whom then lies the blame for the frustration of Palestinian aspirations if not with the PLO And if the purity of the PLOs hatred of Israel and the retention of its eschatological hope of someday destroying the Zionist entity are greater than its passion for a Palestinian homeland on the West Bank what is one to answer those in Israel who believe that any kind of Palestinian state on the West Bank would pose a mortal danger to Israel I agree with Flora Lewis that compromise for peace is essential but it cannot be demanded endlessly of one side in the conflict only It is time to redress the balance HENRY SIEGMAN Executive Director American Jewish Congress New York Sept 14 1981

ANTIABORTION FORCES IN DISARRAY LESS THAN A YEAR AFTER VICTORIES IN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/22/us/antiabortion-forces-in-disarray-less-than-a-year-after-victories-in.html,ELECTION By LESLIE BENNETTS Less than a year ago antiabortion leaders were exultant over what they saw as political triumphs in helping to elect a sympathetic President and members of Congress opposed to abortion The future looked unexpectedly bright for the movements ultimate goal of a Constitutional amendment outlawing abortions Today however the movement is troubled openly pessimistic about winning passage of such an amendment in the foreseeable future and divided over what other course to follow We are a movement in disarray and we had better get our act together and restore our credibility and do it fast or were going to be in real trouble Paul Brown executive director of the Life Amendment Political Action Committee said in an interview Political reality has come home to the prolife movement and it has been totally unpleasant Reagan Betrayal Seen One of the movements most unpleasant surprises has been President Reagans refusal to give top priority to the fight against abortion Antiabortion leaders were dismayed at Mr Reagans early decision to deemphasize social issues in favor of the economy but the bitterest blow was his nomination for the Supreme Court of Judge Sandra Day OConnor who sometimes voted against antiabortion interests in the Arizona Senate Mr Brown describes antiabortion groups as devastated by the nomination The Senate vote yesterday confirming her nomination was unanimous At the moment however the movements most pressing problem is seen as in ter nal disunity With hearin gs on the proposed amendment scheduled for October by the Senate Ju diciary Committees Subcommittee on the Constitution antiabortion leader s have been meeting with such Congressi onal allies as Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah the chairman ofthe Subcommittee on the Constitution to work out a propos al that might unify the various antiabortion groups Any such new course would represent a major change in strategy for the movement which has long agreed that its objective is a human life amendment to the Constitution defining a fetus as a human being with full legal rights from the moment of conception Likely to Be Topic Next Month But the prospects for getting such an amendment through Congress remain bleak and a growing number of activists now discuss seeking a Constitutional amendment authorizing Congress and individual states to regulate abortion Senator Hatch is considering introducing such a measure Antiabortion groups hope that the October hearings will generate support rather than the criticism set off by hearings last spring by the Senate Judiciarys Subcommittee on the Separation of Powers Under the chairmanship of Senator John P East Republican of North Carolina those hearings focused on the proposed human life bill under which Congress would declare human life to begin at conception Assailed as biased and unfair even by some opponents of abortion the hearings also exposed sharp differences of opinion in the movement And although many leading opponents of abortion spent the summer trying to heal the division the movements sympathizers on Capitol Hill are still waiting with increasing exasperation for different groups to pull together behind one plan or another Difficult to Get Consensus Its very difficult to get a consensus in the righttolife community behind anything besides the human life amendment and that makes things very difficult for us up here Senator Hatch said in an interview Those who say a woman has a right to choose an abortion are watching the turmoil with cheerful interest The strategists in the righttolife movement are trying to figure out what the hell to do said Jeannie Rosoff president of the Alan Guttmacher Institute Although their views consistently show up in polls as those of the majority and there are signs of mobilization most abortionrights activists caution that it is premature to herald any decline in strength in the opposition The basic problem for antiabortion activists is the dim prospect for a Constitutional ban on abortion despite the gains in the 1980 elections We just dont have the votes to do it Senator Hatch said Whatever the merits of an alternative proposal many leaders in the antiabortion movement are also concerned lest a change in course be interpreted as an acknowledgement of failure on the primary objective Perception is what really counts and were very cautious of being perceived as changing strategies Peter Gemma executive director of the National Prolife Political Action Committee said in an interview Were not rethinking the goal just the means to get there A recent memorandum circulated among antiabortion leaders presents a stark assessment It is no secret that in spite of better than expected results in the 1980 elections many of the most experienced righttolife leaders are far less optimistic about the possibility of passing and ratifying the ideal amendment in the foreseeable future than they care to admit in public David OSteen codirector of the Committee for a ProLife Congress wrote Some privately speak of 20 to 30 years being necessary to end abortion Rising Sense of Urgency As more and more American women have abortions at a rate currently estimated at 15 million a year many antiabortion activists feel an increasing sense of urgency The longer abortion on demand continues unchecked the more it becomes a custom and the harder it will be to ever eradicate from our society the OSteen memorandum warned The idea of a human life bill was apparently a tacit acknowledgment that the human life amendment had reached an impasse A bill would need only a majority vote in Congress to become law whereas an amendment would require a twothirds vote of Congress and ratification by 38 states However the idea of having Congress legislate the issue of when life begins has divided Congressional leaders I personally have real problems with that said Senator Hatch who withdrew as cochairman of the East hearings I question its con stitutionality first of all Even if it were passed it would be taken up to the Supreme Court  and youd wait five years before the matter was decided If t he Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional you would have wa sted five years The human life bill was shelved after the E ast hearings and many considered the proposal dead But several org anizations are now attempting to put together a coalition to sup port the bill A Third Approach Other groups are rallying behind a new proposal under study by Senator Hatchs staff Variously labeled the Federal rights amendment the federalist amendment or the legislative authority amendment the proposal would consist of a constitutional amendment giving Congress and individual states joint jurisdiction over abortion removing the judicial authority that has so angered the antiabortion movement since the Supreme Court struck down bans on abortion in 1973 The federalist amendment would be the first step in a longterm strategy The suggested scenario holds that once the nation has become used to living without the freedom to abort then we would come back with the human life amendment and lock it in said Dr John Willke president of the National RighttoLife Committee which has not yet taken a position on the approach Most activists view the federalist approach as more likely to succeed than the human life amendment But some are already strongly opposed I think its foolhardy and a sellout of our principles Mr Brown said Those on the other side the prochoice activists agree that the political prospects of a federalist amendment would be far brighter than those of a strict human life amendment Congress wants to get rid of the abortion issue and enough members of Congress might see this federalist amendment as an easy way of getting the monkey off their backs and sending it back to the states to deal with says Karen Mulhauser executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League It would be easier for us to defeat the human life amendment because its so extreme I see this new approach as ultimately more dangerous Prochoice groups place much of their hope in national poll results that consistently show a majority of Americans oppose a ban on abortion Ultimately I think the power of the majority can preserve legal abortion but only if it gets active politically Mrs Mulhauser commented There are some signs that this may be happening The National Abortion Rights Action League reports more than a 50 percent jump in membership since last years election from 80000 to 125000 For the first time people are alarmed that abortions could become illegal again Mrs Mulhauser said However antiabortion leaders discount poll data and other indications that their movement represents a minority asserting that they can prevail through superior organization It really doesnt matter what the polls say Mr Brown said Whoever can deliver politically is the group thats going to get its way

THE MANDATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/25/opinion/the-mandate.html,Have you noticed the increased sightings of strange creatures The Loch Ness Monster in Scotland a new beast in Lake Champlain and in the nati ons capital lurking in the Tidal Basin The Mandate Mandate sightings have occurred before usually by Presidents every four years Recent sightings have been reported almost weekly even by lowly Cabinet members With Congress back in session this is a good time to answer some of the more frequently asked Mandate questions What is The Mandate As in the cases of its Scottish and New York relatives little is known about The Mandate It seems to be a chameleonlike creature that changes its appearance to reflect its surroundings Recent reports describe it as a combination of a middleclass American union member bluecollar worker suburban homeowner and regular churchgoer Despite The Mandates uncertain appearance there is agreement that those who contact it receive a crystalclear understanding of what is good for America When did the recent sightings begin President Reagan reported the first recent sighting last winter stating that in his close encounter The Mandate expressed great concern about Americas economy Few became excited since a sighting was due and The Mandate had been known to be concerned about the economy for years However many eyebrows were raised when David Stockman Director of the Office of Management and Budget reported a second sighting The Mandate apparently had obtained a correspondenceschool MBA and had adopted supplyside economics because as Mr Stockman recounted it directed that Congress make huge cuts in the Federal budget Incredibly Mr Stockman claimed The Mandate had actually specified the budget items it wanted cut mostly social programs benefiting the nations poor minorities and elderly A second sighting so soon and an appearance to a mere quasiCabinet member were hard enough to take but it was too much to believe that The Mandate which had always spoken in generalities knew enough about educational loans  school l unches and legal services to cast an evil eye in their directi on Before the controversy surrounding Mr Stockmans claims subsided a third sighting was reported This time Treasury Secretary Donald Regan claimed that The Mandate had directed that Congress cut Federal taxes Remarkably The Mandate apparently a subscriber to Fortune gave specific directions for 30 percent cuts over three years benefiting upperincome earners more than average taxpayers Well this went too far Led by Doubting Tip ONeill the nonbelievers called on the President to substantiate his advisers claims The President took an unprecedented action and broadcast an appeal on national television no one knew whether The Mandate watched ABC CBS or NBC for The Mandate to reappear Stunned observers then watched as The Mandate made selective appearances in the offices of the nonbelieving members of Congress Before it was over some 48 converts were made and Congress passed the budget and tax bills as The Mandate had directed Will the sightings continue Given the Presidents successes you cant blame others from trying to ride on The Mandates coattails and so it is very likely that reported sightings will continue There is even talk that the President plans to capture The Mandate housebreak it and move it to the backyard of the White House Is The Mandate dangerous The Mandate is not itself dangerous in fact it can be quite a benevolent beast When it speaks clearly it can provide great help in deciding difficult issues The danger arises from those who falsely claim to have seen The Mandate to support their own ideas Now that The Mandate is making appearances to more people it will be almost impossible to tell when someone has actually seen it In fact already many are claiming The Mandates blessings for abolishing protections against discrimination prohibiting abortions delaying automobilesafety standards selling Awacs aircraft to Saudi Arabia eliminating prohibitions against spying on American citizens and scores of other proposals Given The Mandates proclivity for the murky waters of the Tidal Basin the cleanwater standards probably will be the next to go How can we make sure The Mandate is speaking To protect ourselves against false Mandate prophets we must develop a healthy skepticism of those who repeatedly cry Mandate When the President or his advisers announce yet another sighting we should take a second look ensuring that it is The Mandate speaking and not some wouldbe Mandate keeper If we dont we might as well start submitting names for the new Presidential pet  Abbe David Lowell special assistant to the Attorney General in the Carter Administration is in private law practice

REAGAN'S HONEYMOON,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/26/opinion/reagan-s-honeymoon.html,82WASHINGTON  President Reagan has shown remarkable skill in managing Congress on two significant economic issues the tax and budget cuts He convinced the lawmakers to cut more deeply than ever before and thereby reversed half a century of steady expansion of Government The establishment of these economic issues as his priority was essential to his success Thoroughly disillusioned with the economy the American people demanded that their representatives give President Reagans policy a chance and they did It was not conservative Southern Democrats who proved such a surprise  they rarely have voted with their leadership on such issues but it was the Republicans Virtually every Republican including moderates and liberals stayed with Mr Reagan But now the task becomes more difficult In addition to further budget cuts proposed by the President the Congress must turn its attention to noneconomic matters where no national consensus exists The Presidents break with Congress will come on a number of issues foreign and domestic Mr Reagan will face a particular dilemma when Congress takes up the socalled social issues but he a lso faces stiff opposition on the sale of A wacs aircraft to Saudi Arabia and on the basing of MX missiles Soc ial Security reform also will divide him from many of his supporter s in Congress In his televised address Thursday Mr Reagan made e very effort to soften adverse political reaction to changes in th e Social Security system that his Administration eventually wi ll recommend Reversing positions he endorsed the Democratic pr oposal to transfer funds within the system in order to avert the imp ending financial crisis To distribute future blame he announced est ablishment of a commission to recommend changes in the system and d esignated that five of the 15 positions be appointed by his chief pol itical adversary Thomas P ONeill Jr the House majority lead er Nevertheless as budget cutting becomes increasingly difficult Mr Reagan will no doubt break his pledge andrecommend red uced benefits When that happens he will face major difficulties in holding his Congressional coalition together The most serious set of problems the President will face in managing the crisis are the social issues a constitutional restriction on abortions a constitutional change to allow school prayers a prohibition on busing imposition of the death penalty and passage of the Moral Majoritys Family Protection Act Mr Reagan supports these changes but he also knows how deeply they divide his party By working carefully with his Congressional leaders he was able to delay taking up these issues until his economic priorities were addressed But time is running out on that strategy Congress must now consider appropriations measures to fund Government activities in fiscal 1982 Senator Jesse Helms North Carolina Republican and his ultraconservative colleagues who are behold to certain elements of their constituences surely will attach the social issues to these measures Nevertheless the majority of the Republicancontrolled Senate will oppose this maneuver setting the stage for crippling filibusters A similar problem will occur when the ultraconservative senators propose changes in Supreme Court jurisdiction Intent upon redefining the Constitution through legislation this wing of the Republican Party will find no more sympathy from the partys moderates and liberals than it does on the family and social issues Defense and foreign policy issues will divide the President and Congress as well The Senates vote Wednesday requiring the President in advance of any further assistance to El Salvador to certify to Congress every six months that progress is being made in human rights there is only an early example of Presidential setbacks Mr Reagan has officially notified the Congress of his intention to sell the Awacs to Saudi Arabia and the Congress will have until Oct 31 to veto this action Opposition to the sale aligns the ultraconservative Republican supporters of Israel with liberal Democratic supporters More than half the members of each house are on record as o pposed to the sale The Preside nt will suffer a serious farreaching foreign policy defeat i f the sale is vetoed The question of where to base the MX missile also presents an impossible dilemma for the President If he decides to base it in the West his loyal party supporters in Congress from that region will oppose him If he decides to put the missiles in aircraft John G Tower Texas Republican who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and William L Dickinson the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee both of whom are crucial to his success have vowed to oppose him There seems to be no significant support for a seaborne basing system The President cannot win whatever course he takes As the Congress proceeds with upcoming business the President will discover that the honeymoon is over  Dick Clark a Democrat who represented Iowa in the Senate from 1973 to 1979 is a senior fellow at the Aspen

New Jersey Journal,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/27/nyregion/new-jersey-journal-028920.html,THE Moral Majority isnt the voice of the clerical majority says the Bergen County Committee for Religious Tolerance a coalition of clergymen opposing the Rev Jerry Falwells group The committee held its first major conference at the First Presbyterian Church in Teaneck last Wednesday No one group like the Moral Majority can speak for the religious community said Joseph Chuman leader of the Bergen Ethical Culture Society and founder of the committee Our purpose is to preserve religious freedom and pluralism especially in light of the threats from the new fundamentalism The Rev S Howard Woodson former Speaker of the Assembly now president of the states Civil Service Commission and pastor of the Shiloh Baptist Church in Trenton urged the clergymens group to become a continuing ongoing body giving ourselves to study and analysis of the issues and to develop viable programs to put to the Legislature We must not be like a Greek chorus coming out only between the acts to bemoan the situation of the state he added The Rev Dudley E Sarfaty associate secretary of the New Jersey Council of Churches called for a positive program rather than our seeing ourselves in terms of being against a particular group Thats letting the other side define the issues he said The clergymen plan to bring their collective voice out of the pulpit and into the legislative arena They will lobby against such Moral Majority political issues as the introduction of prayers in schools reintroduction of the death penalty deep cuts in social services and the teaching of scientific creationism as a science in the schools One issue that the committee has chosen not to deal with at least temporarily is abortion it was sacrificed for the sake of ecumenical unity When we formed the committee last June we felt it was important to include Catholic priests Mr Chuman explained Another antiMoral Majority group this one in Essex County is in its incipient stages Spearheaded by Frank Askin a RutgersNewark law professor it includes an ad hoc coalition of community and relgious leaders from the county Our mission Mr Askin saidis to do public consciousnessraising on the benefits of pluralism rather than wait for a specific sort of crisis to be created by the New Right in New Jersey Babyland Nurseries

not going to be able to serve the population we were geared to in Babyland 3 due to the fact that we didnt receive any Title XX Federal funds for the center from the states Division of Youth and

in New Jersey schools have settled in their new classrooms but as the weekend approached there were still many unsettled school districts so far as teachers contracts are concerned The New Jersey Education Association the teachers union reported 32 districts in l4 counties in which teachers were working without contracts Still in negotiations are five districts in Bergen and Cumberland Counties one each in Sussex Atlantic Camden Cape May Mercer Gloucester and Middlesex Counties two each in Union and Monmouth Counties four each in Morris and Ocean Counties and three in Burlington County According to Robert Broderick associate director of press relations for the union Of the five unsettled districts in Cumberland County Millville looks hot though there isnt any strike action imminent as yet Battles over contracts recently erupted in strikes or came close to doing so in several districts Striking teachers in Penns Grove Salem County reached agreement with the school board on Sept 13 In Bergen County teachers in Demarest and Old Tappan settled negotiations two days before their threatened walkout on Sept 18 In Mercer County the East Windsor school support staff clerical and custodial workers struck for one day  Sept 18  before they reached terms with the school board there In Highland Park in Middlesex County the teachers staged a sickout on Sept 18 but reached contractual settlement on Sept 23 Its not unusual for this many districts not to have settled yet Mr Broderick said Theres no specific date for contract signing but working with no contract certainly doesnt do wonders for teacher morale The school employees get the idea that the school board doesnt care about the financial wellbeing of their teachers Thanks to the Casino Control Commissions

RELIGIOUS LEFT AND RIGHT SPLIT ON ROLE IN SOCIETY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/27/us/religious-left-and-right-split-on-role-in-society.html,The debate over the role of religion in public policy prompted by the rise of conservative Christian political action groups is increasingly polarizing liberal and conservative Christians and challenging the nonfundamentalist churches to sharpen their positions on moral issues Beyond such emotional topics as abortion prayer in public schools pornography the proposed equal rights amendment and the arms race church and lay leaders are now focusing on the broader issue of churchstate relations and how a specific theological system may contribute to secular morality Signs that the controversy is widening include these  Two conferences last week one at Pittsburgh Th eological Seminaryand another at Old Dominion University in Nor folk Va pitted conservative Christian activists against mode rate and liberal theologians and historians who contend that g roups such as Moral Majority intend to make their theological vie ws the law of the land  In October a professor at Wheaton College Wheaton Ill will convene a group of theologians and church leaders disaffected with both the liberal leanings of many nonfundamentalist Protestant churches and the rhetoric of the fundamentalist religious right Prof Robert Webber author of the book The Moral Majority Right or Wrong says that the acrimonious debate may cause large numbers of Christians to move to the middle on moral questions  Prompted by the widely disseminated views of the new religious right an increasing number of Christians are questioning the liberal positions adopted by establishment denominations One independent organization the Institute on Religion and Democracy says that educational materials used in some American churches are unsympathetic to democracy  Next months meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion will discuss the social consequences of new evangelical movements Religion in a Pluralistic Society What is at stake in the wideranging debate is not the right of religious activists to enter the political arena and lobby for laws consistent with their beliefs Rather it is the place of a religiously defined morality in a pluralistic American society Dr Charles Rice of the University of Notre Dame Law School told the conference at Old Dominion University that the United States Supreme Court decision banning compulsory prayer and Bible reading in public schools required the state to suspend judgment on the validity of theistic or nontheistic religion According to the Notre Dame professor who has written several books on the topic The state therefore becomes officially agnostic That does not trouble many liberal theologians nor does it bother conservative believers who argue that religion is a private affair but it is heresy to conservatives who back such movements as the Moral Majority political action group and the Roundtable a religiously oriented educational organization Unless the United States affirms its commitment to God and the JudeoChristian tradition the nation is doomed said Senator Jeremiah Denton Republican of Alabama Mandate From a Higher Truth The problem is defining that tradition Former United States Senator Dick Clark of Iowa told an audience at the Pittsburgh seminary W e dare not expunge religious values from American life The difficult y comes when one religious group takes the position thatthey alone sh ould determine policy because they have access to a higher truth  Mr Clark a United Methodist layman echoed several speakers at the United Presbyterian school when he asserted that the religious right needs a healthy dose of humility Most of the positions adopted by the religious right are based upon a fundamentalist theology which takes a narrow view of biblical interpretation This hard line on many issues bothers liberal political activists Spokesman Embraces Tolerance Spokesmen for Moral Majority say they do not intend to impose their convictions on anyone At the Norfolk conference a Moral Majority vice president Cal Thomas stressed what he called the movements tolerance However Mr Thomas admits that the political program of Moral Majority represents only one facet of the Christian tradition At the meeting Edward E McAteer president of the Roundtable spoke of a Biblebased society with such fervor that critics complained he appeared to endorse a theocracy leaving no room for those dissenting from traditional religious beliefs Mr MacAteer a leading figure of the religious right wing argued that true Biblebelieving Christians will share the goals of Moral Majority This view is troubling more conservative believers says Prof Webber of Wheaton CollegeA lot of people out there are disgusted with the rhetoric of the Moral Majority he said He is hoping that the group he plans to meet with next month will endorse a statement declaring The Kingdom of God is not accomplished through moral legislation coercive measures or political power At the same time Dr Webber says people are disaffected from the liberal views of the National Council of Churches and World Council of Churches The challenge to the churches he says is to sharpen ethical sensitivities so members are not tempted to extremism Constitutional Problem for Sects When religious activists try to translate t heir concerns into legislation they often create constitutional problems said a lawyer who addressed the churchgovernment co nference in Norfolk The more religious the justification for a particular law said Prof Frederick Schauer of the College o f William and Mary in Williamsburg Va the more likely it is to be unconstitutional Laws protecting secular morality or the pu blic good are valid he said but a law requiring prayer in public schools is unconstitutional because it has a specifica lly religious purpose Liberal Christians like the idea of the state being coldly neutral on religious matters and tolerant of personal ethics that embrace a range of opinions But Dr Rice argues that while the state is to be neutral regarding sects the nations founders believed Government should promote belief in God Conservative Christian activists therefore hold to their conviction that public morality in the United States must have a spiritual base
THE PRICE AND THE PRIZES OF COOPERATING WITH THE LAW,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/27/weekinreview/the-price-and-the-prizes-of-cooperating-with-the-law.html,By disclosing that a Fe deral grand jury is investigating the financial act ivities of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Chicago John Cardinal Cody The Chicago SunTimes has pulled a journalistic coup The off icial inquiry and its implications for a test of church and state rel ationships is a substantial story But in going beyond the fact of t he Federal investigation to tell 650000 readers what its own 18mo nth inquiry had revealed the newspaper has stirred controversy o ver its repertorial methods and motives The SunTimes reported that the 73yearold head of the nations largest archdiocese had diverted as much as 1 million in church funds to help his longtime friend and stepcousin Helen Dolan Wilson Over five days the paper explored the relationship between the two charging for example that a personal loan helped Mrs Wilson build a home in Florida and that her son had received thousands of doll ars in commissions as an ins urance agent for the Archdiocese of Chicago One of the chief questions raised about The SunTimes stories is the timing of their publication and whether the tabloid used the fact of grand jury subpoenas to justify printing reports that it had believed earlier could not stand on their own The editor Ralph Otwell has declined to discuss the timing in detail saying only that the paper published as soon as its editors felt they had the facts Even before The Washington Post reporters cracked the Watergate grand jury other newsmen had found the workinprogress of prosecutors a fertile field of information Reporters say tips sometimes come from a subpoenaed witness sometimes from a government official and frequently from the prosecutors office directly But most editors and reporters understand that a grand jury inquiry is not proof of wrongdoing and many will protect the reputation of people suspected of a crime but not indicted by delaying reporting an inquiry  at least until they are convinced that indictments are imminent Robert Phelps executive editor of The Boston Globe says that being able to report a grand jury investigation offers a paper some protection from libel suits and bolsters the reporters own suspicions that something is wrong somewhere since somebody else thinks theres smoke But he added the papers role is to do the job other institutions are failing to do Absent a showing that the grand jury is shirking its task Mr Phelps said the paper is better off pursuing its own leads To Cooperate or Not Investigative reporters in Chicago however have often cooperated with other agencies in the pursuit of wrongdoing The SunTimes for instance several years ago worked with the semiofficial Better Government Association on the Mirage tavern stories  a series in which reporters operated a bar and detailing their dealings with local officials revealed that law enforcement officers were taking bribes More recently the newspaper collaborated with health officials in the investigation of abortion centers Part of the rationale for cooperation in Chicago reporters said is that convictions count Its an important part of your story to be sure you get results said one former Chicago newspaper reporter who asked not to be identified by name Editors he recalled had asked him How many indictments can you get He and other journalists said reporters routinely alerted lawenforcement officials to upcoming blockbusters Forewarned the officials could respond to a newspapers revelations with promises that their offices were investigating the matter If an official investigation was already under way reporters said they might offer law enforcement officers information about what they had found in exchange for details that would support their stories Youve got to prime the pump a little bit if you want water to come out of it said Robert Greene the assistant managing editor who directs investigative efforts at Newsday in Long Island Some newsmen worry that cooperation can backfire by encouraging prosecutors to seek reporters confidential sources or by making it appear that journalists served as an arm of the law Someday you might be investigating the same cop said Jerry Uhrhammer a reporter for the Eugene Ore RegisterGuard who heads the national organization Investigative Reporters and Editors In any event there was no lack of possible sources for the Cody case including the Rev Andrew M Greeley a priest sociologist and author In his justpublished novel The Cardinal Sins the central figure is a Chicago archbishop touched by a financial scandal involving a stepcousin with whom he is intimate Father Greeley has declined to specify what role if any he had in the work of The SunTimes or Federal prosecutors Meanwhile The SunTimes has been silent on the other major question raised about its stories  the lack of documentation Reporters and editors say they assume the paper has documents that substantiate its reports of Cardinal Codys financial dealings They simply wish the paper felt it could p ublish the documents and thus diffuse criti cism of the expose particularly the Cardinals accusations t hat the paper is antiCatholic The Gannett News Service which won a Pulitzer Prize for its investigation of the Pauline Fathers in Maryland was working on the Cody story at the same time as The SunTimes and unearthed some of the same tips John C Quinn a Gannett vice president said the results of the investigation were not published because We didnt have all the papers we needed Having it and thinking you have it he added are two very different things

TRANSCRIPT OF PRESIDENT'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/02/us/transcript-of-president-s-news-conference-on-foreign-and-domestic.html,MATTERS Following is a transcript of President Reagans news conference in Washington yesterday as recorded by The New York Times OPENING STATEMENT Well welcome to my first annual press conference Last night I signed the bill that raised the debt ceiling to more than 1 trillion It was necessary to do that to continue Government operations But it heightens the significance of this first day of the 1982 fiscal year because on this day our economic recovery program begins The 1 trillion debt figure can stand as a monument to the policies of the past that brought it about policies which as of today are reversed Tax cuts and spending cuts that take effect today will put America back on the road to economic recovery In the next several years we can create 13 million jobs reduce inflation and reward the spirit of liberty and enterprise that were responsible for our nations economic might Our programs wont be instantaneous The mistakes of four decades cant be turned around in eight months Theres recently been some improvement in the area of shortterm interest rates The prime rate has begun to turn down rates on Treasury bills almost 16 percent when I took office are down to 14 12 Sticking to the Plan Fluctuations in the various economic indicators such as inflation and unemployment rates will probably continue for several months But we will not be swayed from our plan by every changing current every passing trend or every shortterm fluctuation In times past Administrations have failed to come even close to their spending targets and the Congress has ignored its own announced spending ceilings Those times are over I will sign no legislation that would quote bust the budget unquote and violate our commitment to hold down Federal spending New subject This morning Congress was notified of our intention to sell Awacs aircraft and F15 enhancement items to Saudi Arabia I have proposed this sale because it significantly enhances our own vital national security interests in the Middle East By building confidence in the United States as a reliable security partner the sale will greatly improve the chances of our working constructively with Saudi Arabia and other states of the Middle East toward our common goal  a just and lasting peace Serving Israels Interests It poses no threat to Israel now or in the future Indeed by contributing to the security and stability of the region it serves Israels longrange interests Further this sale will significantly improve the capability of Saudi Arabia and the United States to defend the oil fields on which the security of the free world depends As President its my duty to define and defend our broad national security objectives The Congress of course plays an important role in this process and while we must always take into account the vital interests of our allies American security interests must remain our internal responsibility It is not the business of other nations to make American foreign policy An objective assessment to US  of US national interest must favor the proposed sale And I say this as one who holds strongly the view that both a secure State of Israel and a stable Mideast peace are essential to our national interests Concern Among Blacks Q Mr President as I think youre aware a number of black leaders in this country have expressed some reservations about your policies  not only economic policies but other policies  and I wonder if you might have something to say today to reassure the blacks in this country concerning your attitude and your policies and specifically sir whether or not you are in favor of extending the Voting Rights Act as it is now constructed A Well I have not had an opportunity  a report that Ive been waiting for is on its way to my office and didnt get here before the press conference But I am wholeheartedly in favor lets say in principle of the Voting Rights Act because I believe very deeply that weve had experiences in this country a nd not alone on a racialbasis of vote fraud and discrimination and t hats a sacred right that must be upheld and I will uphold it I think that possibly there are some leaders of organizations in the black community who have followed the lead of others and have been attacking from the very beginning our programs But I have been gratified by the support that evidenced to me through mail through calls through personal meetings with members of the black community that have told me they believe in the program I had one letter just a few days ago from a 16yearold boy who identified hi mself as black and he said I am wholeheartedly behind what you are trying to do and I think it means much for my own future I had another from a young black man who had just become the father of a b aby girl and he was telling me that he  and he had come all the way over from being a diehard Democrat to support this program becau se he said I think it means a better world for my daughter Les ley Victims of Budget Cuts Q Thank you You talk about the effect of your economic program being mainly something that will affect and hurt administrators But I wonder if you can talk about some specific individuals in the country who may be getting some of their eligibility  or have you had programs  reducing the eligibility requirements of some programs  what do you say to the single working mother whose eligibility for Medicaid and for food stamps has been cut What would you like to say to her today about how she cannot provide medical care for her children or feed them with food stamps A I dont believe that were actually doing that I dont say that there wont be some cutbacks and reductions and I think that any of us if theres any reduction in income it forces us to change some of our plans and reorder our priorities Where the cuts have come is around the periphery where we  and some may be hurt more than others  but where we have tried to find those areas where people have other income in addition to their public grants and therefore we can reduce some of that public grant but those people that are totally dependent on government that is our obligation and nothing is going to happen to them Bigger Cuts in Military Q Mr President would you be willing to accept larger cuts in your 82 defense budget if the Congress prepares a proposal along those lines A I would hesitate to say that I would or that they should do this because these cuts were not just made on the basis of saying oh lets take a percentage of the money away from them We went into what in the planned military buildup that we believe is essential to our national security  what does each cut mean what must we eliminate I would like to call to your attention that before the program even went into effect or before this 2 billion cut for 1982 Caspar Weinberger Secretary there had already come up himself with 35 billion in cuts in defense spending Q Why didnt you go for that A What Q Why didnt you go for 35 billion A Oh we did Well we found because he was able to find where he believed he could make the additional cuts trying to be helpful without any important setback to our military buildup Security After Awacs Sale Q Are you aware that the same people right now in the State Department who now want you to sell Awacs planes to Saudi Arabia four and a half years ago wanted that very same weapon system sold to the Shah of Iran  just before the Shah fell Given the fact that when the Shah fell the United States lost much top secret military equipment in Iran  Phoenix missiles and F14 fighters  can you now guarantee the Congress and the people of the United States that the Awac system if its sold to the Saudis will not compromise American security or will not fall into the wrong hands A I can make that guarantee  that it will not compromise our security I dont believe itll fall into enemy hands but it would not compromise our security even on that if it had Now with regard to four and a half years ago I wasnt here then and Iran  I have to say that Saudi Arabia we will not permit to be an Iran Veto of Natural Gas Tax Q Mr President do you still plan to honor your commitment to Congressman English of Oklahoma that you would veto any windfall profit tax on natural gas A Well Ive always hesitated to say  Ill talk about vetoing in general principles such as I will veto generally attempts to bust the budget But I have always refrained from and long before I came here from talking of specifics I would have to see a bill a nd what finally winds up on my desk before I would gi ve an answer as to veto or not Winning a Nuclear War Q Mr President weve talked about limited nuclear war Do you believe that either the Soviet Union or the United States could win a nuclear war Is there a winnable nuclear war A Its difficult for me to think that theres a winnable nuclear war but where our great risk falls is that the Soviet Union has made it very plain that among themselves they believe it is winnable And believing that that makes them constitute a threat and wh ich is oneof the reason s why Im dedicated to getting them at a table not for arms limitati on talks but for arms reduction talks Yes Sam Military Superiority Q Sir on that same subject general subject Can you reassure our European allies and anyone else nervous about your policy that youre not seeking military superiority over the Soviet Union or in fact is that your policy A Were seeking whatever is necessary to insure that that window of vulnerability Ive spoken of has been closed and that the risk has been reduced of there being a war at all And I think our allies very largely in Europe do know that I also do think that there is  there are groups among our allies as there is here in America who are increasingly vocal in carrying their own message and it is one there of pacificism and neutrality and so forth I think theyre very unrealistic and if we listen to them I think wed all be in trouble Guns and Butter Q Mr President some of your critics are saying that by cutting taxes and at the same time spending more for the military you are like Lyndon Johnson saying it was possible to have guns and better at the same time and that it wont work for you anymore than it did with Johnson and that it will indeed damage the economy What do you say to this A Well the great difference is the tax portion of our program because when we say cutting taxes were really leaving a word off There is a difference between reducing rates and reducing tax revenues and we only have to look back just shortly before Lyndon Johnsons term to when John F Kennedy was President and when he followed the policy across the board against the same kind of economic advice that weve been getting  that he couldnt do that But he cut those tax rates and the Government ended up getting more revenues because of the almost instant stimula to the economy Now thats whats being called today  they didnt use the term then  supply side economics And you dont even have to stop at that point If you look at our reductions in capital gains tax if you go back to the 20s when Mellon was the Secretary of the Treasury under Coolidge and was doing this every time that kind of a tax cut brings us back Ive told I think some of you before to a principle that goes back at least I know as far as the 14th century when a Moslem philosopher named Ibn Khaldun said In the beginning of the dynasty great tax revenues were gained from small assessments At the end of the dynasty small tax revenues were gained from large assessments And were trying to get down to the small assessments and the great revenues Reason for Spending Cuts Q Mr President youve just sounded the theme that you sounded many times that the tax cuts will in effect be selfreplenishing and produce more revenues than they take away If thats true why do you have these huge spending cuts Some of your colleagues like Congressman Kemp say they wont be necessary because revenues will grow If you think revenues will grow why are you cutting the budget A Im cutting the budget because the Federal Government is taking too high a percentage of the gross national product to allow for prosperity And if the Government is taking money out of the peoples pockets which they could use as they saw fit to continue to support things that are not properly Governments business or that are not that are not costeffective then you have an obligation to do away with those things and let the money  the people retain their own money Q Your own projections show that revenue wont grow Are they wrong A No our projections dont show that We are  there are two things I mentioned the gross national product We are also taking in taxes a higher percentage of the gross national product than has been taken in  other than wartime  in our entire history And if you go back to the beginning of this century and the classic economists you will find that they themselves tied business slumps to those moments when Government went beyond a certain level in its taking money from the people PICKUP SECOND AD REAGAN TEXT Millionai res on Parade  Q The style of your Administration is being called millionaires on parade Do you feel that you are being sensitive enough to the symbolism of Republican mink coats limousines thousanddollaraplate china at the White House when ghetto kids are being told they can eat ketchup as a vegetable A Well we changed that Somebody got overambitious in the bureaucracy with their ketchup for a vegetable and we had to pull back on some regulations that were suggested On the other I dont think its a millionaires p arade and I havent counted any of the mink coats th at have been around But also you mentioned the china Lets set tha t straight once and for all because Nancys taken a bitof a bum rap on that There has been no new china for the White Housesince the Tru man Administration  some partial augmentation under Lyndon Johnso n but not a full set of china Now breakage occurs even in the White House I know that everyones supposed to be walking around on feathers and that doesnt happen but it does And the truth of the matter is at state dinner we cant set the tables with dishes that match We have to have a mix so dont look too closely at other tables in there And this was the result of an anonymous contribution and the company making the china made it at cost So there was nothing out of the taxpayers Yes Curbing Interest Rates Q Sir you have been told by a number of members of Congress who say that have proof from intelligence they have that the big central banks are totally responsible for influencing Paul Volcker of Federal Reserve Board to keep the interest rates high Now they tell you that can do something about this despite the fact we know how separate the Federal Reserve is supposed to be from the executive and all that Now they say that the rates now are 10 percent above the inflation rate and that theres no ordinary reason for that Now will you do something about this A Well those who say that without trying to move in on the Federal Reserve that we could do something are ignoring the simple truth of the marketplace Those interest rates are based on the amount of money that is available for borrowing and the competition the amount of people who want to borrow And the truth of the matter is we will bring down inflation or bring down interest rates when we bring down inflation and when we can once and for all get the Government out of the financial market and end its excessive borrowing which is taking too great a percentage of the money that is available Q But sir the inflation rate is lower than the interest rates  10 percent 10 points A Yes But out in the open market where you go in to sell bonds and so forth and where corporations must go when they want to expand and borrow money and individuals must go to borrow for a mortgage on a house it is supply and demand and the competition that is generated by that And were hurt as much as anyone else What has thrown our budget estimates off It is the excessive interest we have to pay to borrow the money to pay for the debt thats left us by other Congresses Takeover in Saudi Arabia Q Mr President you said a few minutes ago that you would not allow  you would not permit  what happened in Iran several years ago to happen in Saudi Arabia How would you prevent that Would you take military intervention if that was necessary to prevent it A Im not going to talk about the specifics of how we would do it except to say that in Iran I think the United States has to take some responsibility for what happened there  with some very shortsighted policies and let a situation come to a boiling point But there was no need to do that But in Saudi Arabia I just would call to your attention it is not only the United States its the whole Western world There is no way as long as Saudi Arabia and the OPEC nations there in the East  and Saudi Arabias the most important  provide the bulk of the energy that is needed to turn the wheels of industry in the Western world Theres no way that we could stand by and see that taken over by anyone that would shut off that oil Criticism on Wall Street Q Mr President if youre so certain that the American people are in back of your economic program why the overt concern on the part of the Administration on how Wall Street reacts to it  I mean the constant banging away at Wall Street A Gary we havent been so constantly I just thought that somebody would ask a question about Wall Street and I have a letter here from the Securities Industry Association signed by the president Edward OBrien and by the chairman of the board Ralph DAnnunzio And they said Dear Mr President Widespread interpretation of recent weakness in securities prices as an indication of significant disenchantmen t with the Administrations economic program has become a source of major concern within the securities industry Therefore as chairman and president of the Securities Industry Association which represents more than 500 firms accounting for approximately 90 percent of the securities business done in this country we want to assure you that this interpretation is not correct The SIA board comprised of senior officers of brokerage and investment banking firms from all parts of the nation has just concluded a quarterly meeting in Dallas Tex We can ass ure you that the thrust of your economic program reduced Federal spending major tax reduction s for business and individuals business deregulation and slow but steady growth in the money supply enjoys overwhelming support in th e stock brokerage and investment banking community Just as it will take time for this program to achieve its goals it also will take time for the millions of investors whose multiple concerns and perceptions determine stock and bond prices to recognize the magnitude and the potential of the fundamental change in economic policy youve set in motion Concerns have of course been expressed over the extent of future Federal deficits as well as the prolonged effects of present high interest rates We know that you share these concerns and are addressing the problem Continued evidence of your determination to impose budgetary discipline will surely exert a positive influence on securities markets over a reasonable period Well Im very grateful for that  I left out a few lines modesty caused me to do that but  Q Im sorry I asked Mr President A Im not because Ive been carrying that letter all day I was beginning to think none of you would get to it Social Issue Agenda Q Mr President The New York Times Magazine three weeks ago reported that unnamed Presidential strategists do not want you to give more than rhetorical support to socalled social issue agenda  that is such issues as abortion busing and voluntary school prayer My question sir is do you plan to do more than give rhetorical support to the social issue agenda and if so what it is you plan to actually do Thank you A Well I think Ive made over the months and even years my position clear on most of those social issues And I shall be happy to see them come to my desk for a signature Financial Market Attitude Q Mr President there has been despite your letter that you enjoyed there a feeling in the Administration that the financial markets have not shown the proper optimism  the kind of support that we would think they would have had for a man of your economic policies Do you have no disappointment or no feeling of something of a letdown from high interest rates and so forth A Well if I had some I have less now than Ive read that gotten that letter But and thats sort of what Garys question was also It is true that we have had difficulty reconciling the stock market with the evidence that we were getting from business and industry all the way from retail to manufacturing about their optimism their plans for expansion and their outright support Business organizations ranging from the national chamber on to various industrytype groups have been wholehearted in their support of us and what we were doing So it was hard to understand but as they pointed out if you really look at it on Wall Street these are people that are basing their own investment on what they see in the future Frankly I think that it reflected less of a lack of confidence in us than it did in a pessimism that we wouldnt be able to get through the Congress the things we were trying to get and that was based on long sad experience But now I think that with a 35 billion cut in one package asking for continued cuts I think that theyve got reason to be optimistic Possible China Visit Q Mr President Could I walk up to you A Yes this is the one that was  Maybe I used three fingers I dont know Q Id like to take you pretty far from Wall Street to the Peoples Republic of China There is a standing invitation here for you as the American President to go to China In Peking they are talking about that possibility In Cancun at that summit conference later this month you will be there and the head of government of the Peoples Republic of China will be there What is your thinking now about traveling to Peking A Well thats something that I look forward to with interest but I dont think for a while yet Q What do you think of the spring of next year Is that possible A Well that may be a little earlier than it shou ld happen And then I remember that all of you say that Pres idents only travel when theyre in trouble and I dont want to be in trouble next spring Well thank you

NEW YORK LIBERTIES UNION LAUDS LEGISLATURE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/04/nyregion/new-york-liberties-union-lauds-legislature.html,The New York Civil Liberties Union this year gave the State Legislature the highest rating it has ever accorded the body in the 11 years it has been issuing legislative score cards Leaders of the organization said the findings of their study released today were unexpected It was somewhat surprising that in spite of whats going on in the country the New York State Legislature held the line on civil liberties said Barbara Shack the organizations legislative director Despite the rise of anticivil liberties New Right forces in Washington this years legislative session resulted in no major losses for civil liberties The groups ratings were based on votes c ast by individual legislators o n a variety of issues The organization judged the questions acc ording to its own standard of whether a legislators vote advanced or retarded the cause of individual liberty Carey Gets 88 Rating Generally the organization is regarded as politically liberal  for example it judged a vote in favor of Medicaid financing for abortion as a plus But Mrs Shack said that its stands also reflected opposition to government intrusion in the lives of individuals Overall the Civil Liberties Union gave the Legislature a rating of 62 percent up from 51 percent last year and from 16 percent in 1970 when the group began rating legislators The group rated Governor Carey at 88 percent The Civil Liberties Union opposed only one of his actions on legislation his signature on a bill that would allow courts to revoke the bail of an accused felon if the suspect is subsequently arrested for another crime Supporters of the bill said it included a variety of safeguards for the accused but the civilliberties group claimed it was a step toward preventive detention Democrats Rank Highest In keeping with the organizations liberal public image the groups highest ratings tended to go to New Y ork City Democrats particularly those from Manhattan But Senate Republican leaders also received relatively high marks Warren M Anderson of Binghamton the Senate Majority Leader was one of the three highestrated Republicans in his house at 70 percent The Republican floor leader Senator William T Smith of Big Flats also received 70 percent as did Senator Roy M Goodman a Republican of Manhattan The Senate minority leader Manfred Ohrenstein a Manhattan Democrat received a rating of 100 percent In the Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink a Brooklyn Democrat received a rating of 94 percent while the Republican minority leader James L Emery of Geneseo was given a score of 34 percent Among the votes regarded as plus votes in the groups ratings were votes against the death penalty and the bail bill signed by the Governor Also support for such measures as a bill prohibiting discrimination by insurance companies against former mental patients another guaranteeing the confidentiality of library records and one repealing restrictions against the licensing and employment of resident aliens in the state
ALIENS' RIGHTS AND CURBS ON FEDERAL POWER AMONG CASES FACING HIGH COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/04/us/aliens-rights-and-curbs-on-federal-power-among-cases-facing-high-court.html,With the ceremony of a new Justices arrival behind it the Supreme Court returns to business Monday to grapple with such issues as the rights of illegal aliens the limits of Federal authority over the states and the ability of ordinary citizens to sue high Government officials The 109 cases that the Court has scheduled for review in the new term combine the familiar and the novel As in almost every recent term the Court will have to weigh the public benefit of limits on political campaign expenditures against the burdens that such limits place on free speech For the first time the Court will address the right of mentally ill people in institutions to refuse medication and the constitutional rights of retarded people to treatment and special training The docket so far does not for the first time in several years include cases involving either affirmative action programs or abortion But that could easily change From Monday until the end of January the Justices will accept perhaps 75 additional cases for argument and decision before the term ends next June or July So as viewed on the first Monday in October the term is necessarily an incompletely developed snapshot However the new season develops it is likely to be one of unusually high visibility for the Court In addition to the arrival of Associate Justice Sandra Day OConnor the first woman member of the Court the attacks by Congress on the Courts jurisdiction and the Reagan Administrations developing legal views are likely to focus attention on the Court Reagan Philosophy to Emerge The Federal Governments positions in most of last terms cases were developed in the Carter Administration and indicated little about the new Administrations priorities But the Governments Supreme Court filings in the last few months provide a clue to the Reagan Administrations legal philosophy as well as a view of what could be some of the new terms more interesting cases Based on its actions so far the Administration like the Court itself is likely to prove unpredictable In two of the terms more important civil rights cases the Administration has abandoned one Carter Administration position and has reaffirmed another The first case is an appeal by the State of Texas from lower court rulings that the state is constitutionally required to provide the same free public education to children of illegal aliens that it provides to legal residents and citizens The case Plyler v Doe No 801538 is a significant test of the scope of the 14th Amendment which states in part that no state may deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws Under the Carter Administration the Justice Department intervened in the lower courts on the side of the alien children But last month the department told the Court that while it still believed the 14th Amendment covered all people regardless of citizenship it would now take no position on whether Texas had violated the alien childrens constitutional rights Review of Rights Law The second case involves an interpretation not of the Constitution but of an act of Congress a 1972 civil rights law known as Title IX that bars Federal aid to educational institutions that discriminate on the basis of sex Because so many educational institutions depend on Federal money Title IX has been regarded as a powerful legal weapon against discrimination against women in providing programs equipment and other school resources The question in the case North Haven Board of Education v Bell No 80986 is whether Title IX also covers sex discrimin ation in employment at educational institutions The Carter Administration believed that it did and enforced Title IX accordingly Several months ago the Department of Education asked the Justice Department to change its position But Solicitor General Rex E Lee refused the request and filed a brief last month telling the Court that Congress intended Title IX to cover employees as well as students Another area of particular interest this term is the constitutional boundary between Federal and state authority Five years ago the Court revived the littleused 10th Amendment which provides that powers not specifically delegated to the Fede ral Government are reserved to the states as a brake on som e aspects of Federal regulatory authority The Federal courts are still grappling with theimplications of that ruling and the 10th Ame ndment is a subject of rapid legal development US Against Some Changes Despite the Administrations oftenexpressed desire to give power now in Federal hands back to the states the Justice Department has filed briefs strongly supporting Federal preeminence in energy and labor matters In Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v Mississippi No 801749 the Government has appealed a lower court decision that Congress lacked the constitutional authority to require state utility commissions to consider various energysaving approaches to ratemaking and regulation In United Transportation Union v Long Island Rail Road No 801925 the question is whether employees of a stateoperated railroad can exercise the right to strike as guaranteed by Federal law despite a state law that forbids strikes by public employees Ruling for the railroad in a case growing out of a labor dispute the Federal appeals court in New York held that the 10th Amendment barred the application of Federal labor law and that the railroad workers therefore had no right to strike The Justice Department last month filed a brief in support of the union arguing that the amendment did not apply to such an unconventional state function as the operation of a railroad A Sampling of Other Cases Other cases the Court has agreed to decide include these selected to indicate the range of issues on the Justices agenda Election Law The Court will decide the constitutionality of the 1000 limit on spending by a political action committee in behalf of a Presidential candidate A Federal court struck down the limit midway through the 1980 campaign on the ground that it violated the freespeech rights of wouldbe contributors As a result expenditures by socalled independent committees mushroomed to 14 million from 16 million four years earlier Common Cause v Schmitt No 80847 Patients Rights Pennsylvania has appealed a Federal appeals court ruling in a case concerning the Pennhurst State School that mentally retarded people in state institutions are constitutionally entitled not only to basic care but to skills training and to care in the least restrictive circumstances possible Youngberg v Romeo No 801429 Massachusetts is appealing a decision that gave mentally ill patients involuntarily committed to Boston State Hospital a constitutional right to refuse medication Mills v Rogers No 801417 Immunity From Suit In the latest of a series of cases exploring the boundaries of the official immunity doctrine the Court will decide whether former President Richard M Nixon can be sued for ordering the dismissal of A Ernest Fitzgerald a Pentagon aid who exposed cost overruns on a plane Nixon v Fitzgerald No 791738 is one of several immunity cases on the docket Campus Rights Two cases present challenges to the rights of universities to control access to and use of their facilities In Widmar v Vincent No 80689 the University of Missouri is appealing a ruling that it must allow student religious groups to meet on campus In Princeton University v Schmid No 801576 Princeton is appealing a New Jersey Supreme Court ruling that it must provide reasonable access to outsiders who want to distribute leaflets and solicit funds on campus State Regulation In the latest of several cases challenging state protectionist policies toward natural resources the Court will decide the constitutionality of New Hampshires refusal to allow a utility company that generates hydroelectric power within the state to sell the power elsewhere in New England New England Power Company v New Hampshire No 801208 The Court will also decide whether a state has the authority to regulate corporate takeovers in a manner that differs from the Federal takeover statute the Williams Act The case Edgar v MITE Corporation No 801188 involves an Illinois law but is of interest to the 35 other states with similar laws The Court w ill decide whether efforts to regulate the cable television in dustry can subject municipalities to suit under Federal antitrust law s States are largely exempt from antitrust liability but many stat es have delegated the cable television issue to localities C

TV: 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' BACK WITH NEW CAST,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/05/arts/tv-saturday-night-live-back-with-new-cast.html,TRAILING a reputation wildly exceeding its actual accomplishments NBCs Saturday Night Live returned last weekend with a new cast and personality Rabid fans of the old shows may not be overly enthusiastic The program is more slick less adolescent not as smugly clubby as in the giddy days of yore On the other hand the overall content was far funnier on a sustained basis than it has been for the last few years In the beginning circa 1975 Saturday Night Live offered a kind of outrageous sassiness that served as a refreshing antidote to the normal blandness of television entertainment In a year or two the program had reached its peak coalescing in a superb ensemble that included Chevy Chase Gilda Radner John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd However the usual egoambition rot of show business set in quite noticeably and the gradual erosion with predictable talent defections to the silver screen ended with a couple of years of embarrassing mediocrity With Dick Ebersol as the new producer this latest version of Saturd ay Ni ght Live is clearly determined to make amends and recoup losses  If nothing else the show has gotten off to a very encouraging s tart There are the familiar sendups of television personalities  from the mincing dietandexercise boy to quite wickedly CBS Newss Andy Rooney Ive been doing some serious thinking abou t shoes Ever notice what a weird name Morley Safer is And t here is the required newscast segment complete with Reagan jokes A nice addition here is the black film critic who lobbies for s eeing brothers in more movies like Isaac Hayes in Kramer vs Kramer or Jimmie Walker in The Elephant Man But there is also a willingness to tackle more sacred cows A nifty tweaking of Brian DePalma movies ended with the irrefutable observation that once a year Brian DePalma picks the bones of a dead director and gives his wife a job A film on prison writers jokingly but scathingly attributed to Norman Mailer featured a black poet threatening to killcillmy landlord A long sketch about a young woman desperately trying to convince an inexhaustibly boring pickup that she didnt love him the least little bit proved hilarious in the manner of a Lily Tomlin or Richard Pryor character exercise For entertainment on the music side Rod Stewart offered his bestselling raspy voice and punky gyrations At one point noting the absence of what was supposed to be a surprise host he muttered something about the geezer going around the pubs A spokesman for NBC said yesterday that the show had hoped to get a prominent actor as host but no firm commitment was made before air time Perhaps the most significant indication of the programs new look was the guest appearance of Michael Davis a juggler who would have been quite at home on the old Ed Sullivan Show As it happens Mr Davis is a terrific entertainer That kind of addition to the Saturday Night Live mix can hardly hurt On NBC at 9 tonight Sidney Shorr stars Tony Randall as a bachelor advertising artist in search of a family An extra added fillip in this case is the fact that Sidney is homosexual something that has already prompted certain selfappointed watchdog groups to register complaints about the new NBC weekly series Love Sidney which has been developed from the film As it turns out Sidneys sexual preferences are kept carefully inconsequential to the central story There is a passing reference to a former lover who has either moved away from their Upper West Side apartment or died The point is that Sidney is a desperately lonely man reduced to eating his delicatessen suppers out of a paper bag Enter pert Laurie Lorna Patterson an aspiring young actress Sidney has met at the Thalia Theater while watching Greta Garbo in Camille Rather improbably Laurie moves in to Sidne ys rambling apartment and he becomes her doting Jewish mother wait ing up for her at night and disapproving of her dates When Laurie is made pregnant by a married man Sidney convinces her not to get an abortion Her daughter Patti Kaleena Kiff transforms Si dney into a fiercely possessive Jewish mother When Laurie finally decides to get married the inevitable crisis explodes There are some charming moments in Sidney Shorr which Oliver Hailey adapted from a story by Marilyn Cantor Baker But the production fails to find a unifying tone Pathetic Sidney suddenly becomes silly Sidney not wholly convincing in the Yiddish inflections assumed by the normally haughty Mr Randall Gently moving scenes are followed by annoyingly calculated routines most notably when a protesting Sidney wins the applause of the onlooking women at an abortion clinic On top of everything else the movie is cinematically lazy reverting to cute photograph sequences to move the plot along Sidney Shorr was initially intended to be a theatricalrelease film Something obviously went wrong from the very beginning
AWACS CHILLS A SENATOR'S WHITE HOUSE WELCOME,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/06/us/awacs-chills-a-senator-s-white-house-welcome.html,When Ronald Reagan invited Senator Bob Packwood to the White House for a chat recently the President was not handing out cuff links or warm expressions of gratitude The Oregon Republican is the leading Congressional opponent of the Administrations plan to sell Awacs reconnaissance planes to Saudi Arabia and the President had a blunt message to deliver Youre cutting me off at the knees If a President of your own party wants a direct favor the political heat is turned on full blast And after 45 minutes Mr Reagan asked Mr Packwood to end his crusade As politely as possible the Senator recalled I refused Why did Bob Packwood take on the Awacs fight in the first place And why has he so staunchly refused to give in For an answer the Senator mused in a recent interview you have to go back to the hot dogs Doing It Yourself As a young lawyer in Portland Mr Packwood had the hotdog concession at a local festival and there he learned that if you want a job done right you do it yourself I discovered he said that there are relatively few people you can count on who will get down in the trenches and work Mr Packwood has been applying that lesson for the last few months ever since he decided that the Saudis were unreliable allies and should not get sophisticated American weaponry With the diligence that he brought to selling hot dogs back in Portland the Senator has carefully collected 50 cosponsors on a resolution opposing the Awacs sale and in the process he has presented the White House with a huge political problem The dispute goes beyond the immediate issue however because it represents the first real crack in Mr Reagans domination of Capitol Hill That break could also affect next years elections since Mr Packwood is chairman of the Republican Senatorial Committee and raises a great deal of money for his colleagues The Portland parable on the importance of hard work and selfreliance was reinforced when Mr Packwood arrived in Washington 13 years ago as a 36yearold freshman It became obvious he said that most causes in the Senate have no leaders and if youre really serious about a cause youd better do your own counting There is something else about Bob Packwood  a streak of ferocious independence that borders some would say on downright orneriness In his early days as a Senator President Nixon asked him as a personal favor to back Clement F Haynsworth Jr for a seat on the Supreme Court Mr Packwood voted no and contributed to a humiliating defeat for the President The Oregon Breeding Ground In his first race for the Senate Mr Packwood defeated Wayne Morse one of the great political mavericks of his day and the question naturally occurs Why does Oregon breed such flinty iconoclasts One reason the Senator responded might be the cosmopolitan character of Portland a major trading center Another might be the Scandinavian heritage of many early settlers They have a tradition of tolerating each others opinions said Mr Packwood whose grandmother was born in Norway Mr Packwoods voting record has been consistently moderate and he ranks right in the middle of the 53 Senate Republicans in terms of loyalty to President Reagan But when he decides to take on a fight he does his own counting and his own cajoling And he does not scare easily Over the years for instance he has emerged on Capitol Hill as a leading defender of abortion and righttolife groups have targeted him for political ext inction In reply he ha s started to plot strategy for defeating a constitutional amend ment that would ban abortions The lawmakers outrage over the Awacs sale was triggered by his belief that Saudi Arabia had failed to fulfill past promises to play a moderate and stabilizing role in the Middle East Since the Camp David accords he said all that Saudi Arabia has done is swing a wrecking ball through the Middle East If they had been willing to join the negotiations when Egypt did wed have peace in the Middle East now In the same period he added Saudi oil prices have almost tripled Theyre playing us for a patsy he said Some Colleagues Dismayed Mr Packwoods effective and embarrassing efforts against the Awacs sale have left the White House sputtering with frustration and some of his Republican

arguments have been made pro and con After Mr Packwood refused to call off his campaign press reports quoting White House sources asserted that he was opposing Awacs in order to court Jewish financial contributors But while the lawmakers proIsraeli stand has made him a popular figure with Jews he denied that money was his motiviation Was someone trying to discredit him by planting the story Not the President Mr Packwood said an answer that specifically did not exonerate White House staff members The Senator obviously likes his feisty image and the publicity it attracts and he takes comfort in the customs of the Senate a place that tolerates rebels fondly as long as they do not impugn the integrity of their colleagues I think Packwoods wrong on this issue said Senator Jake Garn Republican of Utah but I defend his right to be wrong If Senators took things personally wed be mad at each other all the time If he has to choose Mr Packwood said between his conscience and his President he would take his conscience A conscience wont forget you but a President might he said But he also knows that conscience has a cost Ive had a lot of vicotries that Ive taken joy in he said but I will take no joy in beating the President If I beat him

HOUSE BACKS SOCIAL PROGRAMS FUNDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/07/us/house-backs-social-programs-funds.html,With Republicans divided the Democraticcontrolled House of Representatives approved an 873 billion financing bill for social programs tonight despite a threatened Presidential veto The key vote on a motion to send the bill back to committee for deeper cuts was 249 to 168 or 29 short of the twothirds majority needed to overcome the expected veto The Administration contended that the measure was 763 million above the Congressional budget ceiling and nearly 4 billion above the 12 percent acrosstheboard reductions President Reagan has recommended This was a message to the budget cutters that the House does not want to see the safety net cut to shreds said Representative Bill Green Republican of Manhattan who had voted for the budget and tax packages BudgetBusting View Backed The Administrations contention that the bill was in Mr Reagans words budgetbusting was supported by Representative James R Jones Democrat of Oklahoma who is chairman of the Budget Committee He told the House that although the bill represented a 12 billion reduction from last years spending level it exceeded the spending ceiling and would add to the deficit The bills supporters argued however that Congress had responsibility only for budget authority the amount authorized to be spent rather than the amount actually spent The authorization in the bill was 74 million over the budget authority ceiling which may cover a number of years in contrast to the spending ceiling which is for just one year Before approving the measure the House voted 383 to 30 to delete the 74 million and bring the figure under Congressional budget goals Only some liberal Democrats opposed the move The legislation did not include a 12 percent acrosstheboard reduction in discretionary spending requested by President Reagan and the Republican leadership urged that it be sent to committee to act on that request Past Unity Breaks Down House Republicans had demonstrated unusual unity assuring enactment of the Presidents budget and tax package But today moderate Republicans from the Northeast and Middle West broke with the President and their Republican colleagues The bill was approved by voice vote after 39 Republicans deserted the President to oppose a motion to recommit it to committee They were joined by 210 Democrats Opposing the motion were 28 Democrats t he socalled boll weevils and 140 Republicans This bill is Americas investment in humanity said Representative Silvio O Conte of Massachusetts ranking Republican on the appropriations panel But Representative Robert H Michel of Illinois the Republican leader told the House The bills over budget Its excessive and the President will surely consider it unacceptable This bill before us is a paradox Mr Michel said It is the best of bills it is the worst of bills It is an honest response to the budget adopted last May In ordinary times he might vote for it he said but were moving in front of an economic locomotive thats been gathering steam for a decade or more Safety Net but Over Budget Ralph Regula Republican of Ohio said This bill is the safety net for the truly needy But he added Clearly the bill before us is a candidate for a veto Its over the Presidents budget and our own budget terms The House action was the first since the President proposed 13 billion in added budget cuts and threatened to veto financing measures that exceeded the budget However budgets consist of both mandatory and discretionary expenditures and authorizations leaving room for debate on whether a particular measure remains within budget ceilings The President meanwhile has asked Congress to make a 12 percent acrosstheboard reduction in discretionary spending based on the budget he submitted in March rather than the budget adopted in May This has led Democrats and some Republicans to charge that the Administration is reneging on agreements made in working out the Congressional budget resolution in May There was growing speculation moreover that the Administration intended to veto individual appropriations in order to force Congress to adopt an omnibus stopgap appropriations bill that would be a vehicle for the 13 billion in added budget cuts Mr Reagan requested The President could then offer the cuts as a package as with the budget and tax packages A major reason for their success was that they were immune from the assaults of interest groups who can more easily fight piecemeal cuts Family Planning Funds In debating the appropriation bill the House rejected by a voice vote a proposal by William E Dannemeyer Republican of California to cut family planning funds by 12 percent from 1245 million to 110 million Mr Dannemeyer noted that the program had been criticized as being ineffective Mr Conte responded however If youre opposed to abortion you should support this program intended to help women plan their pregnancies The House approved by voice vote a proposal by Representative Robert S Walker Republican of Pennsylvania to bar funds for implementing racial guidelines particularly with regard to hiring or admissions policies

'GYPSY MOTH' GROUP PLANS ITS STRATEGY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/11/nyregion/gypsy-moth-group-plans-its-strategy.html,WASHINGTON FOUR moderate Republican Representatives from New Jersey and some two dozen of their House colleagues may play a more prominent role in White House plans to guarantee legislative victories than the y did in the last session of Congress The four  Harold C Hollenbeck of East Rutherford Marge Roukema of Ridgewood Millicent Fenwick of Bernardsville and Christopher H Smith of Old Bridge  were brought together by shared regional concerns As members of a NortheastMiddle West frostbelt coalition they have taken the name gypsy moths in counterpoint to a group of conservative Southern Democratic boll weevils The latter had wrested concessions from President Reagan in the flurry of lastminute horse trading before last summers taxcut vote Concerned with Social Security cuts the plight of the cities fragile masstransit systems and high energy costs these Republicans have struggled while hewing to the Reagan political line to temper the effect of the Presidents budgetcutting But unlike the boll weevils they have not coalesced around easily identifiable political issues like water projects or concessions to the oil and gas industries and have not shown the same willingness to break party ranks Mr Hollenbeck a member of the gypsy moths Steering Committee said four months ago that the group was little more than a loosely knit nonpublicityseeking group brought together to better explain the problems and difficulties of the Northeast and Midwest We were not a counter to the boll weevils  he declared The New Jersey Representatives were prompted to act by the combination of lastminute giveaways before the July taxcut vote and the threat upon their return from the summer recess of a second round of budget reductions We dont want to be boll weevils  Mr Hollenbeck said We dont want to be traitors we dont want to sell out We want to represent our region That is the difficult thing to get across to our Republican colleagues especially the ones from prosperous districts The New Jersey gypsy moths are struggling to find a way to support the Presidents new direction while also finding a way to tailor Mr Reagans initiatives to the needs of their districts There is substantial diversity within the gypsy moths including the four from New Jersey but that stems in part from the makeup of their respective districts With Congressional elections near and redistricting a certainty New Jerseys gypsy moths are carefully weighing how closely to align themselves with the Presidents domestic policies Mrs Fenwick a 10year Congressional veteran seems unlikely to face drastic redistricting She is with the group she said because they agree as to what the outstanding difficulties are  what should be saved and what should be shaved Nevertheless her own brand of moderate Republicanism and her largely middle and upperclass district have limited her activity in the organization and her opposition to the Administrations new economic direction I dont like to flout or defy the President Mrs Fenwick asserted I am very anxious to support him But being gypsy moths puts us in a difficult position We appear as if were defying the President Even so she has felt compelled to call for larger defense cuts and a review of the windfallprofits tax Mr Smith is a firstterm Representative from the Fourth Congressional District one that has been Democratic for a quarter of a century and is likely to be redrawn He is trying to vote his district and yet knows that he needs the support of the Administration in the next election One of the nice things about the gypsy moths  Mr Smith said is that there is continuing agreement regarding the thrust of the Reagan program The issue is where the cuts should be made He is puzzled by the oppositionist cast that the frostbelt alliance has acquired I dont know where it comes from Mr Smith said I go to Trenton  the heart of Democratic politics  and hear that Reagan is doing the right thing Mr Smith advises his morezealous gypsy moth colleagues to be patient The Administration is like an aircraft carrier he said It takes miles to change course to turn around Mrs Roukema a supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment and who opposes curbs on abortion is a fiscal conservative Her guiding fundamental principle she said is to support an economic recovery program that makes sense She is most concerned by threats to the Social Security system and excessive defense expenditures It would make me uncomfortable if the gypsy moths a label she dislikes made themselves a strictly localized group promoting regional interests she said Right from the beginning Mr Hollenbeck went along reluctantly with the Presidents economic program However he hopes there willbe room for a djustment Mr Hollenbeck considers the regional approach of the gypsy moths vital to counter the excessive influence of the boll weevils some of whose projects threaten to sap vitally needed funds from the Northeast The basic planks of the gypsy moth program consist of additional cuts in the defense budget the inviolability of Social Security benefits and opposition to expensive water projects like those involving the Tennessee Tombigbee and Clinch Rivers Whatever sense of unity the New Jersey gypsy moths have been able to foster and whatever success they will achieve appears to hinge on their ability to concentrate on a few basic issues while agreeing to disagree on a host of others

room A gust of wind billows the curtains inward and the guttering candles distort the dinnerparty guests shadows on the walls and ceiling They have been contemplating lost and gone Democratic Administrations Looking ahead  and assuming that Ronald Reagan does not make such a success of his Presidency that a second term is guaranteed  a visiting Episcopal bishop lights a cigar and asks Well whom will you chaps run for President next time round Fritz is so divine a Washington matron gushes in a soft Southern accent Fritz is surely gonna run Teddy a heavyset lawyer says Then theres Jay the hostess intones sweetly My dears Jay Rockefellers spending oodles of money for it Gary Hart might just make it a college professor observes as a lightning flash turns the room milky white What about John Glenn another guest inquires just before the thunder rolls In the quiet that follows nobody responds immediately Oh my dear the hostess says the astronaut Well hes a good man of course But we dont know him my dear we simply dont know him  I dont know him very well says one Senator Actually hes a hard man to get to know says another longtime colleague They pay attention however when Glenn takes the lead as he did recently about the proposed sale of Awacs radar reconnaissance planes to Saudi Arabia In a characteristic initiative he invited the special Saudi representative for promoting a sale Prince Bandar bin Sultan to his office before the matter was debated by Congress to discuss a compromise designed to maintain American control over the Awacs In his own way Glenn has made an impression on the electorate In a recent Harris poll Glenn  who has as yet done nothing major in the way of seeking the Democratic candidacy for President in 1984  ranked third just behind Edward Kennedy and Walter Mondale Is John Glenn running  In the Dirksen Senate Office Building atattered brown folder rests on a cluttered desk On the folder 1984 is scrawled and the desk is in the warren of staff offices of Democratic Senator John Herschel Glenn Jr who last November against the tide of Ronald Reagans victory won reelection to a second term with the largest plurality ever accorded a senatorial candidate in Ohio a state once known as the mother of Presidents One item in the folder is an internal staff memo dated Nov 25 1980 which concludes with Suggestions for JHG Define a vision play an active role in the formation of centrist Democratic policy highlight and expand Senate experience The folders forlorn condition exemplifies Glenns steady political underplaying during months that have seen other hopefuls scrambling energetically to put together the basics for 1984  attracting the best and brightest staffs and soliciting bigmoney donations Glenn partisans chafing for him to announce his candidacy feel that he is a genuine national hero who can restake Democratic claims to that huge section of Middle America lost to Ronald Reagan Glenn his supporters say is honest hardworking and has built a record of real achievement in the Senate Besides Glenn who can outgrin Dwight D Eisenhower has sharpened his intuitive political judgment and improved as a homestate campaigner although this has not yet been obvious nationally His 1980 senatorial victory with 69 percent of the vote  including 55 percent of those who voted for President Reagan  makes him a formidable political presence Why then have a bakers dozen of recent outofWashington speaking engagements offered little more than a hint that he is an active candidate for the 1984 Democratic nomination The explanation is to be found in his taste for understatement his competitiveness and his enormous capacity for control particularly of himself For good or for ill the former test pilot and Marine fighter pilot keeps the throttle in his own hands In 149 combat missions in World War II and Korea he never once bailed out Nor did he falter as he rose in the space capsule Friendship 7 to become in 1962 the first American to orbit the earth Glenn has not always made politically advantageous decisions Friends and critics cite his rejection of all contrary counsel as well as speechwriting help when he accepted the invitation of the then Democratic national chairman Robert S Strauss to speak at the 1976 convention His chances for the Vice Presidential spot died as his listless address crashed into the restless crowd which found no magic in him Glenn has recovered from that debacle and that office no longer seems to be an acceptable goal to him Still he has not changed his patient controlling style even though other politicians have begun to play for blood Walter F Mondale for one did not even break stride as he left the Vice Presidency Accepting a position in the Washington office of the Chicago law firm of Winston  Strawn Mondale has been vigorously working the preconvention territory for months Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts exulting in his position as the last liberal not only has a familiar face but new zest for the campaigns ahead Both men have welloiled political organizations and have won permission as potential candidates from the Democratic National Committee to have two representatives each on the committee determining the procedure for selecting delegates to the 1984 convention Mondale chose his politically experienced law partner John Reilly and the longtime political professional Robert Torricelli Kennedy chose equally experienced veterans in Scott Lang and Carl Wagner John Glenn whose candidacy is still a glimmer was limited to one appointee  his administrative aide William White who has yet to be tested in a national political campaign Sophisticated Washington gatherings buzz with speculation about the potential candidates for 1984 John D Jay Rockefeller 4th 44 Governor of West Virginia poured millions of dollars into his reelection campaign last fall His television spots were placed to carry over the border and advertise him extensively in the District of Columbia The efficiency of his organization is attested to by the Democratic leader elected recently in Pinellas County Fla who was astounded to receive within a few days a personal letter of congratulations from Rockefeller Such attention to detail is not uncommon in the organizations of other hopefuls such as Senator Gary Hart from Colorado who at 43 is an energetic candidate much concerned with national defense and environmentalism His fundamental problem  lack of national recognition  faces all newgeneration Presidential hopefuls except perhaps for Gov Edmund G Jerry Brown Jr of California and Gov Hugh L Carey of New York Brown is still something of a star even if his flame has been guttering a bit should he win a Senate seat next year and gain a national platform on Capitol Hill he could reignite his hopes Carey though is like a provincial wine in that he has yet to prove that he travels well beyond his home district Still to achieve nationwide prominence are Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware Gov James B Hunt Jr of North Carolina who is chairman of the Commission on Presidential Nominations former Gov Reubin O Askew of Florida Gov Bob Graham of Florida Senator Paul E Tsongas of Massachusetts even New Jerseys Senator Bill Bradley of basketball fame and Kentuckys friedchicken mogul Gov John Y Brown Jr  all of whom despite their varied notoriety register infinitesimally on national name recognition and not at all on face recognition The days are not long enough now for the speech making article writing and television guest appearances that aim to alter their condition before 1984 Glenns dimpled smile which might have popped off the cover of Boys Life despite his having turned 60 in July is now counterpointed by the seams of middle age His blue eyes  the right one the slightest fraction lower than the left  ride in comfortable nests of wrinkles Ive said he replies goodnaturedly to reporters who question him about 1984 that I thought it was premature to speculate about this I still do The journ alists remind him of his mammoth victory in Ohio last November  Yes he responds we did have a big victory My main interest is where the country is going I want to know if were headed in the ri ght direction Translation Does Reagan have any idea of wha t hes doing or not The reporters prod on What about the future Are you going to run His smile flattens out as he gives his familiar response Im keeping my options open Did you read Tom Wolfes The Right Stuff This from a brighteyed reporter who wants to see what this man whom the journalists follow but do not fully know may reveal about himself in reply Glenn laughs out loud Ive skimmed through it a little Was that really you Are you really the goodygoody allAmerican he says you are Wolfe was excellent says Glenn taking evasive action on the feelings of the test pilot the idea of the last of the pilots who were up against the unknown Theres something in that Glenns eyes twinkle We did a lot of wild flying in those days he says dryly Glenn who likes outdoor activities  jogging and skiing  still takes his greatest sparetime delight in flying What about the right stuff  Wolfes combination of guts daring and ambition Glenn smiles again and his answer like so many he gives about his personal life and his public ambition seems a combination of guile and innocence I think I came off pretty well in the book Then he beams a fullstrength rightstuff smile and moves off for a television interview Later that day waiting on the Senate floor to cast a vote Glenn leans against an aisle desk Other Senators mill about shaking hands or patting each other on the back or arm squeezing out benign signals of approval There are few such weareallpalshere gestures in Glenns repertory His smile is easy but it conveys no gift of intimacy Although he was close to both President John F Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy his relationship with Edward Kennedy  as with other Senators  is cordial and slightly distant Glenn is like a man who goes to a gym but works out by himself Closeness is reserved only for Annie his wife of 38 years who helps with the navigation on his new Beechcraft Baron that he frequently flies back and forth to Columbus Ohio Their relationship dates back to their childhood days in New Concord Ohio The most important thing to me about John Glenn a longtime female staff member says is that he loves his wife In this crazy town I know Im never going to wake up and find that hes done anything strange or dishonorable Indeed Glenns goodness which is often taken for the whole of him has its Norman Rockwell characteristics When he drives through the cemetery where on each Memorial Day his father a World War I veteran who ran a plumbing business would play taps while Glenn below the brow of the hill would echo taps one senses the utter Americana of his roots Such revelations are drained of sentimentality when one realizes that the Senator is a measured and measuring man In showing you the truth about himself his upbringing and his values he is methodically watching you and your reactions There is some calculation some shrewdness of spirit to the man Glenn does not attempt to manipulate others into liking him because his selfesteem does not depend on that Indeed his almost serene selfconfidence his capacity to watch and wait madden those who want him to start his takeoff before he has completed his checklist Indeed his staff members sometimes buzz round him like hornets One day in May when Glenn is deeply involved in voting against Reagans initial budgetcutting resolutions he sits with military stiffness in his office chair As he listens on the phone a visitor has time to inspect the place a plain workmanlike room containing souvenirs of the Senators military and political careers a breakfront filled with model planes an oil painting of Glenns space capsule orbiting the halfshadowed earth globes and maps everywhere On the window ledge is a small electrical connection splayed out like a miniature hydra in a cube of Lucite the plaque reading At las 109D Umbilical Disconnect  Last Connection With Earth  First Mercury Manned Orbital Flight 20 February 1962 Thereare only a fe w personal pictures  one of Glenn in fatigues during survival training others of the Glenns son and daughter and their spouses A young woman enters with a clipboard and Glenn crooks the telephone on his shoulder as he takes some papers from her Another assistant comes in and there are traces of tension in Glenns voice as he peers up at his gathering staff He hangs up and looks expectantly toward his young assistants There is some confusion among the staff about whether youre going to vote for the Presidents budget or not one of the young women says There is an impatient edge a slightly pushy tone to her voice Boy thats a hard one Glenn says He puts his hand on his jaw and frowns Beneath his desk his feet begin to tap the floor Two other assistants enter the room and stand nearby One of them says You may want to talk to Catherine Before you do that you may want to have a discussion Dan says no Bill says yes for political reasons and if you vote no there should not be any publicity Glenn frowns and begins to do what he frequently does when others are trying to pressure him to make a decision before he is ready to do so He does not wave them off or speak curtly he fidgets and does something else In this case he looks for a key in his desk drawer But the staff members familiar with such tactics form a semicircle by his desk The public they are saying seems to be behind the President Is the Senator going to go along with what appears to be widespread sentiment in favor of the Reagan budget With a smile of genial reluctance Glenn rises to follow his aides into the office of his administrative assistant William White to hear them out The Senator sits on a hard chair in the corner of the room A young woman speaks A no vote on the Presidents budget should be positioned What do you mean another staff member asks while Glenn watches them without discernible facial expression Well if John casts a no vote then I think we should make a statement to explain it No a male staff member interjects I just think that we dont want to advertise a no vote What Im talking about is the misconstruing of a vote Why Glenn asks betraying the slightest irritation If you disagree whats wrong with registering that People may take this as a litmus test another man offers We just should be sure of the way we market your vote Glenns staff members seem like earnest students who do not want their teacher to make a public mistake Glenn sits quietly although in another of his classic gestures of withdrawal from the discussion he leans forward and begins to retie his shoelaces Youve got to have the courage of your convictions a young woman says sharply All I said was that John cant vote quietly counters a man who does not wish to be misunderstood Finally Glenn looks up and speaks in a relaxed voice The call to go to the Senate for the vote has already sounded My inclination is to vote as I did last night He laughs since he has voted several times this week against aspects of the Reagan plan As I did today His decision like the rocket disconnect hanging in the plastic block in his office has broken cleanly free of the discussion There is no way to join his thought processes to it again There is a dry settled quality in his voice as rising from his chair he summarizes his position This is a nonbinding resolution Reagans plan unbalances the budget too much and it assumes too low an inflation rate And it gives tax breaks mostly to the rich It chops energy He looks back at his staff members who have been making notes on what he has said Just put out a statement on it Back at his desk Glenn smiles easily like a father familiar with the manipulative tactics of his grown children Its haveto time he says Again he knows exactly what he is letting a visitor see about himself In the military youre trained to wait and wait before you make a commitment of your forces In Government you have a lot of pressures the push of the press and everything else But I think you want to get everything you need to know first Theres no need to take a position until that time As he is about to leave for the Senate an aide comes in to ask him about a matter that he is not ready to discuss Have you noticed since the Republicans came in Glenn asks the aide all our clocks get readjusted every day to the Naval Observatory time Under the cover of this distraction he moves past the staff member and out the door Its haveto time he says again and smiling heads down the hallway Do the movers and shakers of the shaken Democratic Party see in John Glenn the heroleader who could head the ticket in 1984 Some skeptics ask whether Glenn is bright enough others wonder whether he is colorful enough to attract votes in a national campaign Is his record truly welldefined or is he as one Democratic officeholder in Washington puts it all things to all men Under strong Carter Administration pressure to support the strategic arms limitation treaty Glenn persisted in his criticism launching an extensive series of lectures and interviews in Ohio to present his analysis of the documents weaknesses keying in on the lack of a guarantee that the United States could adequately verify Russian missile testings His presentations which won national attention convinced many that he was neither saber rattler nor unreconstructed cold warrior but simply a tough negotiator He was instrumental in reversing President Carters decision to withdraw American troops from South Korea He was also the moving force in negotiating the agreement which permitted the United States to continue using two strategic military bases in the Philippines He also shepherded the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty through the Senate In taking the lead on an issue Glenn follows his own instincts  especially when the questions as with the Philippine air bases and the Awacs deal have a technical base with which he is thoroughly familiar He takes such initiatives alone sometimes floating the idea at a Senate committee hearing He then follows through again on his own brokering the idea quietly until some action is taken Even those who support Glenn enthusiastically admit that he has had difficulty in attracting public attention to his Senate accomplishments On the day the Senate passed the legislation on nuclear nonproliferation for example only two Ohio reporters were there to cover it Despite these accomplishments in foreign affairs and the legislation he introduced on domestic questions ranging from civil rights to arson control and despite his reputation in the Senate as a man who does his homework and whose support is crucial in the areas of his expertise Glenn either will not or cannot publicize himself with the unfailing ease of say Howard Metzenbaum Ohios junior Senator appointed in 1973 and elected in 1976 for whom public relations is a way of life or of Illinois Senator Charles H Percy for whom it is a mellifluous second nature Percy chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on which Glenn sits is never bashful about taking credit for its activities Senator Glenn known as a committee workhorse may seethe at this but he does not seem to have the flair Glenn is also on the Governmental Affairs Committee and the Special Committee on Aging and he believes in taking equally forthright stands on domestic issues  as he did greeting a large contingent of Roman Catholicschool students on the Capitol steps and in answer to a question from a priest announcing his opposition to Federal aid to nonpublic schools Glenn holds quietly traditional liberal positions on abortion prochoice and in favor of paying for abortions for poor women with Medicaid funds he also supports the equal rights amendment Although Glenn voted regularly with the shrunken Democratic minority against Reagans initial spring budgetcutting proposals he voted for the final budget in July  after losing on several amendments he proposed to restore slashed funds  feeling that there was a need to reduce Federal spending Also in July he voted reluctantly for the Presidents tax cuts judging that some tax bill was better than none at all He did not emerge as the spokesman for traditional Democratic positions the way Edward Kennedy battled the President down to the last lost vote Glenn has developed a foreignpolicy study group but in keeping with his underplaying style he has no political organization and he has as yet retained no professional political consultants or media advisers He has also stood pat with a Senate staff which lacks the professionalism to engage in a national political campaign Critics point for example to continued constituent complaints about not receiving replies to their letters and to Glenns seeming reluctance to discharge staff members unless their offenses  like those of a woman who threw the mail away  are major The media consultant Bill Connell who worked on Glenns 1980 Senate campaign and whose own experience with national elections stretches back a quarter of a century is unperturbed by criticism of Glenn whom he views as a natural televisionage candidate Hes dynamite in quiet communication and it comes across espe cially when hes with sma ll groups Hes thought about problems and it comes across in wha t he says Hes oldfashioned enough to think that the Government ca n help the people Connell dis counts the possibility that Glenn is already too late tomake a start for the Democratic nomination Everybody knows who Glenn is Wit h a little television exposure he could come up very fast and be a real superstar Think of it this way Reagan may end updisillusioning the people and the pendulum will swing back quickly A Democrat who gets the nomination in 84 will be the odds on favorite The two major liberals Mondale and Kennedy may collide inthe left wing of the party You may have Lloyd Bentsen  who is the Democratic Senator from Texas on the right and Jerry Br own just about everywhere Joe Biden who is the Democratic Senat or from Delaware and the other newcomers because they have cam paign financing will all be competing for that 35 percent liber al segment of the Democratic vote Of course Jay Rockefeller will la nd whereverhe thinks it will do him the most good There wont be anybody in the middle who is right politically on defense and who is at the same time acceptable to blacks Jews and the other groups you need to be elected Glenn positions himself by instinct He could be in the right place in 1984 Glenn cannot according to Connell be pushed He wants to make a decision by the summer of 82 before the campaign really begins Dont forget that win in Ohio He only spent a quarter of what anybody would who was fighting for his political life He spent 300000 to 400000 on media buys thats all He didnt have any organization no telephone banks none of that stuff His big asset is his personality which projects his true strength of character Although it is not yet time on Glenns schedule for a public declaration about 1984 close observers assume that the decision has already been made According to a former aide Annie Glenn says everything by not saying anything when the subject of the Presidency comes up She vigorously and consistently opposed Vice Presidential talk when Glenns name was floated as a possibility in 1976 That she withholds protest about the Presidential race now shows that she is at peace with her husbands decision As further proof of Glenns intentions those who know Glenn well cite his profoundly competitive nature Glenn did not after all become a fighter pilot a test pilot an astronaut a successful businessman as a vice president of Royal Crown Cola and finally a Senator by waiting passively for lightning to strike him The former astronauts competitiveness was accented in dramatic public fashion during his 1974 Democratic senatorial primary contest against Howard Metzenbaum who had defeated him for that nomination four years previously In a debate Metzenbaum  on the run because of Glenns charges that although a millionaire he had not paid taxes  accused Glenn of never having held a real paying job Responding Glenn exhibited as Bill Connell noted the instincts you see in a great fighter the Dempseylike moves not to kill but methodically to finish off his opponent Glenn expanded a defense of his own military service to cover all who had served their country Did Metzenbaum think that the hundreds of thousands of men who gave their lives for America had never held real jobs Could Metzenbaum say that to the Gold Star mothers of the country What emerged from that encounter was the vivid image of Glenn the MIG killer who went on to win the primary Glenns political base of course is Ohio where his rockhard support according to the political consultant Stephen Avakian  who managed Glenns 1980 campaign and served as his press secretary for five years before that lies with the now large bloc of independent voters Glenn might not stand up so well to a challenge from a more traditional Democrat Avakian says Remember he has a rural background and had no early experience with labor and not a lot of involvement with liberal causes The independents identify with him strongly Avakian explains Glenns popularity among the states bluecollar workers by saying that he doesnt float pipe dreams in the snow belt He does not denounce management when a plant closes or introduce a bill demanding two years notice before factories can be shut He comes back with something positive and as the senior Senator from Ohio he gets to announce these things like retraining programs for laidoff workers Glenns financial backing for a Presidential campaign would depend primarily on fellow Ohioans like Milton Wolf the head of a large Cleveland construction firm who served as Ambassador to Austria during the Carter Presidency Bernard Rand a prominent Cleveland attorney and Marvin Warner of Cincinnati who served as Carters Ambassador to Switzerland The Senator himself has displayed little interest in or talent for tapping into the centers that are the traditional sources of support in national campaigns New York Chicago the big cities of California Avakian says of Glenn He wont shake people down In raising big money for a campaign there are certain details that only the principal can effect He would have to get into that for a Presi dential campaign While Paul Tipps Democratic chairman in Ohio says that Glenn has thus far engaged in zero activity in organizing for the Presidency he is thought to have urged the Senator to run Glenns power base among professionals rests ultimately with those Ohioans who have strong political interests and with people like the media expert Bill Connell and the Washingtonbased pollster Peter Hart who also does work for Edward Kennedy Some observers feel that former Democratic chairman Robert Strausss recent hint that he might himself seek the Democratic nomination is a maneuve r to neutralize Texas oil money and that he will eventually s upport Glenn Former aides like Steve Avakian and Columbus lawyer Stephen Kovacik who is described as the closest thing Glenn has to a n utterly pragmatic adviser may also participate There is no Edwin Meese or Jim Baker masterminding a campaign for him Avakian observes Continued delay in choosing consultants and advisers may render Glenn vulnerable to political mercenaries who might be brought in or be attracted to him if he looks like part of a hot ticket in 1984 Those sharks are not what he needs He needs solid professionals who believe in him The Ohio Senators platform would undoubtedly echo the themes of his recent speeches and interviews in which he has shown himself to be the natural spokesman for Americas fullest commitment to space exploration not only to fulfill Americas pioneering character but for the obvious commercial opportunities of such adventures Glenn likes to emphasize that the space program has already returned benefits on the order of 8 to 1 on the Governments investment Glenns greatest strength is considered to be his grasp of international affairs In this area he constantly reiterates Americas need for a foreign policy whose objectives are not determined by the kinds of weapons we make but by a carefully articulated view of our purposes in the world He sees the Soviet Union as a colonialist power on the march and is a strong advocate of defense spending although he favors stocking Americas arsenal with a careful blend of weapons instead of relying excessively on a single system such as the MX missile One of the most effective ads in Glenns 1980 campaign portrayed him as a man who understands war but who loves peace which to many is an agreeable echo of Eisenhowers successful transformation from national hero to President Energy may be a hot issue for the Senator who has devoted much time to this question He feels that research will allow the United States to solve the energy problem and to exorcise the inflationary devil of oilprice increases Glenn can go into staggering detail on the subject It is a standing gag among reporters who follow him that if you ask Glenn for the time he may tell you how to make a digital watch and that if you ask him about new energy sources he will glaze your eyes with his detailed command of the facts about solar and wind power photovoltaic storage batteries and the electric car Senator Glenn in short remains the scientist who believes that American research and investment can recycle the country for the space age and to hell with small is beautiful and settle for less And so Senator John Glenn waits as always for haveto time as he did lying on his back waiting for the ignition of the rocket that would carry him into orbit three times around the earth He waited through a year of convalescence after an injury to his inner ear caused by a fall forced him to postpone his political career in the 1960s He learned more about waiting after he was defeated by Metzenbaum in his first try for the Senate nomination in 1970 Right now he is waiting for that moment when the controls firmly in his own hands he may lift off on the most interesting journey of his life
BANKERS DANCE TO A SOMBER SONG,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/11/business/bankers-dance-to-a-somber-song.html,SAN FRANCISCO I T seemed like any other annual convention of the American Bankers Association Some 11000 bankers and their wives bankers are still overwhelmingly male took over San Francisco most of last week all wearing blueandwhite identity cards all monopolizing the citys taxis cable cars and best hotels and restaurants But behind the bustle rang a sober note Banking is enmeshed in the tumult of deregulation and new legislation and not even the most prescient banker knows whats in it for him At the very least however most bankers here suspect that fewer of them will have a place in the ABA a year or two from now They anticipate a sharp erosion in the number of banks from the 15000 now doing business in this country and the vast majority of American banks perhaps 12000 out of the total are actually small businesses many of them familyowned For them the changes are particularly frightening Many will be gobbled up as bigcity and regional banks begin sweeping across state lines to become gargantuan national banks Then there are those that fear they wont be gobbled up  that no one will want to buy them Small bankers are the reason why this convention is held As at most business conventions the ABA affair is actually a selling event The big parties are thrown by the large banks to wine and dine their smaller customer banks Smaller banks traditionally have purchased many services from larger banks which range from travelers checks to money transfers to financial advice These were some of the sights and sounds of the convention a diary of sorts Saturday Oct 3 On a beautiful day filled with sunshine most delegates arrived straining the resources of the citys good hotels At the Hyatt on Union Square guests waited an hour or so to be assigned rooms after checking in By afternoon a somber undertone infiltrated the usually convivial affair Despite the weather and the allure of San Francisco at least 500 bankers spent the afternoon in the dimly lit huge auditorium of the Civic Center listening to economists debate the interestrate outlook There is widespread agreement that rates are likely to drop another percentage point or two but that little more could be expected in the next six months Despite fears that high interest rates may drive more deposits out of their banks the bankers still seem to back President Reagan Im kind of a Reagan man said Jack Devereaux president of the Homestate Bank a 30 million institution in Loveland Colo And Im a strong proponent of independent smalltown banking But he was unhappy about indications that the Administration would back plans to allow interstate banking and other attempts to deregulate the industry For that he blames Treasury Secretary Donald T Regan I dont think Regan gives a darn about a small country bank I dont think he has any compassion for us he said I like Reagan but not Regan Across from the Civic Center is a small park where a man dressed in a black suit was sitting on a bench A number of groups were doing their things one rallying in support of abortion another passing out religious literature The man in the black suit stopped a passerby and pointed to a young man standing on his head Do you know who he is the man in black asked the visitor He must be a savings and loan man theyre all upside down the man in black said answering his own question Oh are you a banker the visitor asked No answered the man in black Im in the limousine business But I drive around a lot of bankers Sunday Oct 4 Again a beautiful day At a news conference Lee E Gunderson the outgoing president of the ABA and president of the Bank of Osceola Wis said many banks were worried about the damage that high rates were doing to their clients But he said that many small banks had raised a lot of money in highrate 30month certificates so that they would not be able to lower their lending rates much even if short term interest rates were to decline For many bankers the ABA convention was a reunion At a reception given by the First Interstate Bancorporation formerly the Western Bancorportion W James Tozer Jr a former Citibanker who is now senior executive vice president of the Marine Midland Bank greeted his old buddy John S Reed a senior executive vice president who heads Citibanks consumer banking business Mr Tozer said he was looking for a tennis partner Mr Reed said he had heard that Thomas Labrecque president of the Chase Manhattan Bank also was trying to get a tennis game together Oh said Mr Tozer Labrecque looks like he might be too strong a player for me According to other convention sources however a slight case of tendinitis would keep Mr Labrecque off the courts But Mr Labrecque was in good form at Chase receptions Last night Chase threw a dinnerdance at the California Academy of Science for about 80 corporate customers and tomorrow it will do the same for other customers at the Young Museum This morning it lured some 1500 consumeroriented bankers to a breakfast at the Stanford Court Hotel Later it gave a brunch at the top of the Bank of America Building for representatives of industrial companies Tomorrow and Tuesday it will serve two more breakfasts both to wholesaleoriented bankers Why all the parties Weve got 3500 correspondents and thats a lot of banks said Mr Labrecque The First National Bank of Boston was among the banks giving receptions today It served dumplings and strawberries Among the guests A Robert Abboud who was dismissed last year as head of the First National Bank of Chicago and is now president of Occidental Petroleum Monday Oct 5 Bart J Engram and his wife Elizabeth were sitting at a table covered with a pink tablecloth and pink napkins at a champagne breakfast thrown by the First Alabama Bancshares Inc this morning Mr Engram is vice president of the Enterprise Banking Company in Enterprise Ala Its a familyowned bank with about 100 million in deposits Mr Engram said Mrs Engrams uncle founded the bank in 1903 and her two brothers are chairman and president We are real proud of the bank thats a fact said Mrs Engram She said that in the 1930s the bank closed for a few days only because it was forced to by the Roosevelt Administration When there were runs on other banks she said my uncle sat in the lobby with a pile of money and said anybody who wanted their money could come and get it But Mr Engram noted that times were changing and that many independent banks in Alabama were linking up with big holding companies Mrs Engram flinched Well be the last to go  I hope she said The convention officially opens James D Robinson 3d chairman of American Express began a speech in the convention hall of the Civic Center This weekend everybody had the opportunity to see his 15000 closest friends and all on a stopwatch he said No one laughed Maybe it was because Mr Robinson is viewed by many bankers as Enemy No 1 American Expresss T  E card its travelers checks and its recent acquisition of Shearson Loeb Rhoades the New York securities firm that runs aggressive money market mutual funds have all come to represent threats to the banks But Mr Robinson carried on What he said in essence was that he was really a partner of the banks not a competitor Many smaller bankers said they didnt know who was worse  American Express or the big banks One of the small bankers more articulate representatives is Marlin V Jackson chairman and president of the Security Bank in Paragould Ark He drew the only burst of applause as a panelist at a session today on the outlook for the financial service industry Small banks he said feel like a country dog thats brought to the city We dont know who our friends are a nd were getting kicked from both sides Mr Jackson like many of his colleagues is a populist banker He accused the money funds o f sucking money out of local communities but never putting any back and he accused the big banks of wanting to do the same He said that the financial conglomerates and the big banks care mainly a bout upscale individuals with lots of money There are a lot more people with small savings than there are people with 100000 deposits Mr Jackson said And they havent been heard from yet A burst of applause Heard at a luncheon of the Chemical Bank Norborne Berkeley Jr the banks president said Chemical had sold 50 million of the socalled All Savers certificates in the first two days the y were on sale Oct 1 and 2 Thats a lot he said By tracing where the checks came f rom Chemical estimated that about half the money flowedout of money market mutual funds Chemical had expected only about 30percent from that source Citicorp gave a lunch for banks that sell its travelers checks The guest speaker was Milton Friedman the economist Each guest was given a copy of Mr Friedmans book Free to Choose and each woman was given a longstemmed red rose Mr Friedman said he expected interest rates to come down and that they were far too high according to his theories But he admitted he expected rates to drop last July They didnt So he like almost everyone else at the convention was reluctant to make new predictions Tuesday Oct 6 President Anwar elSadat of Egypt was assassinated The event put a pall on the days activities and the bankers stood for a minute of silent prayer in honor of the slain leader Its a terrible thing said Richard Cooley chairman of the Wells Fargo Bank reflecting the reactions of most of the bankers The majority of the bankers here are from small banks with no foreign loans and many said they feared that the assassination could lead to war If the nations small bankers are worried that their business is being dehumanized the ABAs audiovisual effects in the convention hall must have reinforced those fears Above the speakers heads was a 20footby60foot video screen that dwarfed even the biggest and tallest of bankers As each speaker addressed the audience he was televised live on the huge screen his voice augmented by the supersound of the audio system At times the cameras zeroed in on the speakers head enlarging it to a height of 20 feet Even with great effort it was difficult to concentrate on the speaker Worse the theater was kept so dark that interested bankers couldnt take notes and the uninterested ones couldnt read their papers or do crossword puzzles The convention is winding down Some bankers have begun to leave and the number of parties has declined sharply Wednesday Oct 7 Oct 7 has a special meaning for the ABA Two years ago today when its convention was held in New Orleans the Federal Reserve announced a basic change in its monetary policy It gave up trying to control interest rates and shifted to an attempt to control the growth of the money supply Since then interest rates have become far more volatile and the banking industry has changed dramatically The bankers that were left filed into the convention hall early today to hear Paul A Volcker chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and Treasury Secretary Regan Both said they favored deregulation of the banking industry and the bankers greeted them warmly But by then 1030 AM most were tired of partying and eager to get home Some said they wondered if next year they would return as independent bankers
RIGHT TO LIFE CANDIDATE IN LIMITED CAMPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/11/nyregion/right-to-life-candidate-in-limited-campaign.html,Dr Jeronimo Dominguez the mayoral candidate of the Right to Life Party is offering proposals that he says would improve life in the city but his chief goal he asserts is to sound an alarm against abortion Abortion is the greatest holocaust of human history said Dr Dominguez a 45yearold internist who operates a busy practice in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan It is like the killing of the Jews under Hitler he said The Jews couldnt do anything about it because they were being killed The babies who are killed in abortions cant defend themselves Its up to me to defend them Dr Dominguez who lives with his wife Gladys and his two sons in the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx entered politics two years ago when he ran unsuccessfully for Bronx Borough President Limits His Campaigning Dr Dominguez has no separate campaign office and he says he does no campaigning on the streets He said he preferred to address large groups He has a following in the Hispanic community he said because of his broadcast talks on the Bible He started a regular halfhour television program on Channel 47 in New York about a year ago and it has been picked up by Spanishlanguage stations in Los Angeles and Puerto Rico Dr Dominguez said he believed there was a link between abortion and some of the citys other problems Think about it he said We didnt have the problem of abandoned buildings in New York City until 1970 when abortions were allowed God was punishing us for allowing abortions he said Seeks New Tax Revenue Dr Dominguez whose office is at 600 West 157th Street said the problem of abandoned buildings could be solved with money and work Many people are not paying what they should be paying he said Some realestate taxes go uncollected he said because the owners cannot be found He also said commuters were not paying an adequate amount of taxes If you make the money here he said you should pay the taxes here Work to rehabilitate buildings could be done by prisoners who he said should be forced to make restitution to societyHe says the criminaljustice system has collapsed because punishment has not been swift or severe enough Drawing on the Bible as he often does Dr Dominguez said he would deal with prisoners by following St Pauls admonition If any would not work neither would he eat Dr Dominguez opposes capital punishment because I dont like to kill people The best deterrent of all to crime he said would be an amputation sentence Start by cutting one finger off he said Dont even put them in jail Just cut off the finger and warn them that if they commit a crime again youll cut another one off I dont think youll see them doing any more crime Dr Dominguez who was born in Spain and received his medical degree there established a practice in New York 20 years ago At first my hours were 9 AM to 9 PM and I often didnt get out till midnight he said About 10 years ago he said he decided to cut the hours back to 9 to 5 so he could be with his sons Jerome and Francis who are now 17 and 15 But the boys went to bed at 8 oclock and then I had nothing to do so I took up writing he said His first work was a treatise on sexual happiness in marriage which he said he published himself He has now writ t en 30 books and booklets publishing them on his own In the citywide races next month the Conservative and Right to Life Parties share the same candidate for Comptroller but have separate candidates for Mayor and City Council President
Hospital and Parents In Pact on Baby Defect,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/11/us/hospital-and-parents-in-pact-on-baby-defect.html,The University Medical Center agreed yesterday to pay 900000 in settlement of a suit filed on behalf of a severely retarded baby who might have been aborted if his parents had been told of a prenatal test that might have detected the fetuss condition The agreement between the hospital and the family was reached yesterday but the key decision in the case came last month Judge Eugene Gualco of Superior Court ruled that the child 27monthold Alejandro Aragon could recover damages if the jury found that the hospital should have notified his parents of the prenatal test The ruling was based on a California appeals court decision last year allowing a child to recover damages from a medical laboratory that failed to tell the expectant parents that they carried a genetic disease The disease caused the child to be born with severe defects The appeals court said in effect that in some cases a child had a right not to be born The state Supreme Court refused to hear the case Maria Aragon was 36 when she became pregnant and 37 when in June 1979 she bore Alejandro who had Downs Syndrome The hospital did not inform her of a test amniocentesis that would have determined whether the fetus had the genetic defect that causes the syndrome The Aragons lawyer Morton Friedman said Mrs Aragon would have had an abortion if she had had the test and learned of the condition of the fetus The hospital argued that by the medical standards of 1979 it had no duty to inform the Aragons of the test
MUSINGS OF A DOCTOR: URCHINS AND ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/11/opinion/musings-of-a-doctor-urchins-and-abortions.html,F or nearly 100 summers biologists at Woods Hole Mass have performed the classic experiment of the Marine Biological Laboratory They have fertilized urchin eggs with sperm in a small dish Persuaded that urchin eggs holds lessons for human disease I have spent a dozen seasons watching this ritual This summer while waiting for the eggs to divide my attention was repaid by another lesson I turned to Science magazine to discover that a Senate committee was engaged in defining the beginning of human life the junction of sperm with egg What coincidence On my left urchin life was stirring in the dish on my right Science informed me that the Government was legislating biology with the stated intent of supporting the Right to Life movement The urchins tell another story Sea urchins Arbacia punctulata are ubiquitous in Massachusetts waters The adult females shed clusters of claret eggs into beakers after salt water is injected in their body cavities Under the microscope one can follow the onset of life in their clear interiors When a drop of sperm is added to the eggs scores of the tiny fellows surround each ovum They scuttle about in competition only one will connect Once sperm and egg have joined the development clock is set within two minutes refractile halos appear around each egg These fertilization membranes prevent the egg from penetration by other sperm By 40 or 50 minutes the eggs furrow and cleave  where each membrance enclosed 1 egg we now observe 2 Soon after the cells divide again  first 4 then 8 16 etc The cells become uncountable and by next morning our dish is filled with motile embryos plutei which swim about in random celebration of their right to urchin life that began when sperm joined egg In Science I discovered that the Senates deliberations had been aided by a number of physicians associated with the Right to Life movement Most argued that human like Arbacia life began when sperm joined egg a position based on incontrovertible biological fact Their views were countered by Leon Rosenberg of Yale who doubted whether the beginning of life could be subject to a scientific definition But the issue was charged with political content  this was no transient academic skirmish Most of the adherents of the spermmeetsegg definition were outspoken proponents of legislation designed to prohibit abortion or at least abortions sought by the poor However  the difference between urchin life and the life of mammals depends upon another incontrovertib le fact of biology Urchins drop eggs in water mammals nurture t hem in the womb The human embryo is not a free swimmer in an open ocean The fertilized egg of the human requires the life of its mot her for sustenance until at birth the individual is ready for independent life And inthe course of gestation two lives are admixe d the mothers womb guarantees the childs life Not for naught h ave the proabortion forces chosen the rusty coat hanger as their symbol I recalled the many frightened young women brought bleeding into Bellevue before abortions were legalized Many of these injur ed and abused teenagers were near shock Unlike their wealthier siste rs who could afford more savory if illegal practitioners some of the women lost their wombs in the process In the most awful sense  any future children they might have borne were robbed of the righ t to life This vision of a gynecological abbatoir in the era befor e legalized abortions troubled me I turned back to the urchins under the microscope Division was in full swing The eggs would soon be on their way to urchinhood In the saline world of Arbacia union of sperm and egg was not only necessary but sufficient for viability of the young Is this true of human life as well I suppose that human lifeofasort begins when a fertilized egg is implanted in the womb But this necessary event is not sufficient for human life Given presentday medical technology an embryo requires the better part of gestation before independent life is possible Within that time span the two lives are one the smaller dependent entirely on the wellbeing of the larger The onset of urchin life is probably correctly defined as the moment when sperm meets egg For the human this necessary act is made sufficient by nurture in the womb For this reason at least there is probably no way to ground a definition of human life in facts common to human and marine biology Sitting at the seaside I sympathized with those who place the sanctity of any human life  even of the fertilized egg at the top of their code of moral values But here at Bellevue I remember too many victims of rusty coat hangers of furtive abortionists of tumbles down tenement stairs  the fractured wombs and broken lives  in the era before legal abortion The urchins of summer remind me of the two lives involved in the bearing of human children the facts of biology do not tell me which life to cherish over the other My social urges and a liberals conscience persuade me to support a womans freed om of choice  Gerald

Unwanted Pregnancies: Support Is Needed,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/11/nyregion/l-unwanted-pregnancies-support-is-needed-052923.html,The incident described in Susan Schneiders recent critique of the antiabortion amendment Antiabortion Plan Where Is Justice Sept 20 was indeed tragic Too many women have been victimized by back alley abortionists rapists and communities that offer no alternatives to selfinduced abortions An unexpected unwanted pregnancy especially one that is the result of a violent sexual assault is a frightening personal burden Women who seek abortion are not murderers as some overzealous antiabortionists would have us believe They are rather the women with whom we work and socialize the women we marry and with whom we raise our children They are burdened with the unexpected and unwanted responsibility for another life and are offered little support to help manage this responsibility within the context of their careers relationships financial constraints etc Theirs is an unenviable situation one that too often involves their suffering severe psychological or physical trauma Legal abortion is an instrument to manage this responsibility while leaving the rest of their lives intact somewhat It does at least preclude potentially fatal resort to an untrained abortionist in unsterile conditions Legal abortion is in short perceived to be the least dangerous and disruptive method for managing the burdensome pregnancy It is appropriate to ask however whether we as members of communities in a wealthy and technological advanced society cannot do better than this for the women who must manage an unwanted pregnancy and for the developing fetuses whose lives are routinely terminated Both the mother and the fetus require support but neither receive it The mother is merely afforded a means of disposing of the burden a t the expense of the fetuss life Selfdoubt guilt frigidty even suicide ofte n plague the women who choose to abort the fetus Ms Schneider is r ight to fight for the lives of victimized women She would do bette r however to fight forthe life of the fetus as well for both are s acred To accord a fetus full constitutional rights seems threatening to some perhaps as womens suffrage did at the turn of the century and as civil rights did in the 1950s and 60s To recognize that human life is a continuation of different types of dependency need not be threatening however At every point in our lives we have some type of dependency for which there is a source that sustains us The farmers upon whom we are dependent for our daily food the educators upon whom we are dependent as children to develop our thinking faculties our families and friends upon whom we depend for affection encouragement and comfort  these and other post partum dependencies are as substantive as those of the fetus Consider for example life without access to our food and water supplies Without consultation or choice we would die victims of a dependency over which we had limited control we cannot after all avoid our dependency upon food and drink to sustain our lives To take another example what of the elderly heart patient whose oncevigorous life is now characterized by dependence upon medical attention therapies and lifesustaining medications Surely that person did not choose this state of dependence it was cast upon him by forces in his environment life style and genetic makeup over which he had limited control To deny that such post partum dependencies exist is folly to cut a life off from that food education affection medication etc is cruel often fatal The fetus is not unlike the rest of us in his dependency except that to cut him off from his lifesustaining source id more acute the results much more easily recognized There is no justice in forcing pregnant women to bear the guilt of terminating an innocent developing life because she has no other choices that adequately embrace her life situation The life the pregnant woman carries is precious as is the woman who carries it She cannot manage responsibility for that life alone She needs the support of those whose lives are linked with hers as well as the support of institutions within our society to make the choice that preserves both her life and that of the fetus Two lives were lost when Susan Schneiders college friend died of a selfinduced abortion Neither need have beenJERRY PARISELLA White Plains
CHRISTIANS DEBATE NEW RIGHT'S VIEWS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/12/us/christians-debate-new-right-s-views.html,A meeting of more than 50 clergy lay people and theological professors here has drawn attention to the difficulty moderate and liberal Christians have in defining their opposition to what they call the ethical absolutism of groups such as the Moral Majority The meeting held yesterday at the Chicago Temple Methodist Church drew people from a wide spectrum of beliefs including conservative Christians from Wheaton College in Illinois and representatives of mainline Protestant denominations All agreed that many of the positions taken by the politically active Christian right on such issues as family life patriotism and peace were too rigid and represent only a narrow stream of the Christian tradition Latitude in Defining Positions However discussions over how much latitude there should be in defining Christian moral positions complicated nearly every paragraph of the fourpage statement that was finally approved at the close of the day The drafters call the document an alternative to hardline fundamentalism Sponsors say they will seek support for the statement from other church leaders in the Chicago area They also said they would urge Christians in other cities particularly conservative  evangelicals to adopt similar statements Picking up some of the key issues of the new religious right the statement calls upon believers to be prohuman projustice procreation promorality pronation profamily and propeace The declaration attempts to broaden ethical reflection on such things as the socalled right to life movement by asserting that the proliferation of nuclear arms modern medical issues such as genetic manipulation and euthanasia and the drive to restore capital punishment also raise right to life questions Paper Intended as Centrist But the participants in the meeting had to tread carefully on every issue because of their admittedly diverse views on ethical questions While drafters said they intended the paper to be centrist some felt the final document was merely vague The diversity of the group was evident in a long discussion of a paragraph on family life Through prodding from Prof Zondra Lundblade of Wheaton College a paragraph defining the family as a gift from God was rewritten so that it would not appear to endorse nearly any human relationship possibly including homosexual ones as family The group also had difficulty with a paragraph affirming the sanctity of all human life It skirted the issues of abortion and capital punishment by deploring permissive abortion and urging broader discussions on capital punishment as an ethical concern Conservatives Not Ambiguous The lack of precision in the statement bothered some of t he signers The reason the conservatives are d oing well is because they are not ambiguous on the issues said the Rev Gerald Forsheya United Methodist clergyman Many felt however that a major goal of the meeting was not to define in detail a Christian viewpoint on contemporary ethical issues but to declare that a growing number of conservative Christians want to distance themselves from the positions of Moral Majority spokesmen such as the Rev Jerry Falwell Referring to the mass media efforts of Mr Falwell and other leaders of the religious right the Rev Jack Lundin said There has been almost a singular religious voice heard in America today Mr Lundin the pastor of the Community of Christ the Servant Lutheran Church in suburban Lombard moderated the Chicago discussion People get the impression that Jerry Falwell is what Christianity looks like he said Objections to Liberal Views Conservatives involved in the discussion said they were uncomfortable with the more liberal positions taken by major ecumenical organizations such as the National Council of Churches The statement endorsed here declared that God may not be on the side of merely the political right or the left and said the Kingdom of God cannot be reduced to an agenda of moral legislation coercive measures and political power Organizers said they would continue their efforts to show that Christians can hold differing views on moral issues and to counter the assertions of the religious right The Moral Majority is speaking to issues we should have addressed said Dr Reidar Bjornard of Northern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wheaton
"Conservatism, Privacy and Abortion",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/12/opinion/conservatism-privacy-and-abortion.html,Pity the New Right It finally gets its man in the White House and he appoints a Supreme Court Justice with moderate views on abortion Even worse he seems to care more about the economy and Awacs than a constitutional ban on abortion All this has forced the foes of abortion to do some backing up What they want most is a constitutional amendment simply banning abortion But Congress is not receptive Nor will Congress proceed any further with the human life bill which would end abortion without an amendment by defining conception as the start of human life and allowing the states to strike down abortion as murder Now there is a more subtle idea urged by Senator Orrin Hatch Utah Republican at hearings last week Its an amendment that would end any constitutional protection of abortion including the right to privacy delineated by the Supreme Court in 1973 The idea is to give the states and Congress the power to limit abortion  but no state could have a looser standard than one set by Congress That may sound like only a states rights amendment but the real purpose is clear when one focuses on this Congressional override The Hatch proposal is yet another effort to overthrow the Supreme Courts 1973 decision Constitutional amendments can be written to take away individual liberties rather than to guarantee them  though that has happened only once Prohibition it was called and it did more to breed disrespect for law than temperance and was ultimately repealed A similar fate we think awaits the constitutional tampering that Senator Hatch proposes if only for the most practical of reasons Abortions cannot be stopped by law only legal abortions can be To forbid abortion is to risk forcing women back to the sad era before 1973 when an unwanted pregnancy was synonymous with exploitation and fear Rich women would once again go abroad for safe abortions poor women would be left to risk health even life with illegal practitioners That is hardly enlightened social policy It may not even be good politics Polls show wide support for the Supreme Courts defense of a womans right to an abortion early in pregnancy without state interference Such privacy is an aspect of personal liberty that no government should invade Its akin to the right to marry and to raise children free from political intrusion Senator Hatch contends that his amendment would help calm the nations jangled nerves on the abortion issue Its hard to see how His proposal would invite every national state and local politician into a decision that is already painful enough when left as it should be to a woman and her doctor What strange proposals these are emanating from the conservatives who dominate Washington now pledged to restrain governmental overreaching If they are sincere let them stop talking about any intrusive constitutional amendment and fight instead to defend the privacy that the Supreme Court defined in 1973 That would reflect both true conservatism and true compassion

AROUND THE NATION; Court Blocks State's Ban On Abortion Referrals,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/13/us/around-the-nation-court-blocks-state-s-ban-on-abortion-referrals.html,A Federal appeals court ruled today that a state may not cut off funds to an agency because it advises women on abortions The ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit was in a suit filed by Valley Family Planning Grand Forks ND a nonprofit group organized to offer family planning services The court said that the family planning staff informs women of the risks and costs of an abortion and if asked will give the names of physicians North Dakota passed a law directing that no state funds or Federal funds through a state agency could be given to an agency which performs refers or encourages abortion The court agreed with a lower court that the prohibition of abortion referrals violates the free speech rights of Valleys employees and held that the word  encourage in the statute is unconstitutionally vague
CUTS IN AID TO YOUNG MOTHERS DEPLORED,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/14/garden/cuts-in-aid-to-young-mothers-deplored.html,REDUCTIONS in Federal assistance to pregnant teenagers and adolescent mothers as called for in the Reagan Administrations budget which went into effect Oct 1 will ultimately cost the Government more than they will save according to a study released yesterday City Council President Carol Bellamy flanked by three adolescent mothers and their infants at the Door a center for teenagers at 618 Avenue of the Americas outlined the findings of a study entitled Impact of the Reagan Administrations Proposed Budget Cuts on Adolescent Pregnancy Programs The report was compiled by the New York City Task Force on Adolescent Pregnancy which was formed by the office of the City Council President and comprises 43 public and private agencies and individuals The report was based on statistics gathered from a variety of public and voluntary agencies and advocacy groups It is uncertain how the state will divide up the Federal funds for social services now consolidated into block grants Given that the document detailed as precisely as possible the ways in which programs will be eliminated or reduced and the effects of the cuts for the citys 33000 teenagers who are pregnant in any given year In addition to cuts already made Miss Bellamy said that proposals for reductions of an additional 12 percent this year would actually have the effect of a 24 percent cut because they would be implemented in the middle of the year Laura Genero a spokesman for the Federal Department of Health and Human Services said We cannot comment on what we have not seen We would like to see the study Teenagers account for 17 percent of all pregnancies and 14 percent of all births in the city Miss Bellamy said They face increased risks of complications and mortality 90 percent of teenage mothers drop out of school and go on public assistance within a year of giving birth and they are more prone to abusing or neglecting their children She called the Federal cutbacks pennywise and poundfoolish According to the report Teenagers are now facing cuts in vital educational vocational counseling medical and recreational services  the very services that could give them a more affirmative sense of the future and reasons to defer parenthood What is more these cuts are occurring at a time when sexual activity among adolescents is steadily increasing In addition the report contends the budget cuts will increase the dependence of adolescents on such government entitlement programs as welfare food stamps and Medicaid For example the report states for every dollar spent on family planning three dollars are saved from other human services programs Every daycare dollar lost will generate virtually the same increase in entitlement programs The losses cited in the report include components of the following  Maternal and Child Health Block Grant which provides health care prenatal and family planning services to pregnant women new mothers and their children It is estimated that in New York State 2027 pregnant teenagers and adolescent parents and 11793 children will be denied services unless the state or city replaces some of the funds  Social Services Block Grant which includes Title XX and training funds and which serves sexually active teenagers through familyplanning clinics and teenage parents through daycare centers It is expected that among other budgetcutting measures at least 90 daycare centers in the city would be shut down and services in the clinics reduced unless funds are replaced by the state or city  Title X of the Public Health Act which provides financing for family planning programs used by many adolescents Estimates are that services will be denied to 48530 women in the state including 15545 teenagers  Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act through which New York State is scheduled for a 21 million reduction in funds for disadvantaged students including pregnant adolescents and teenage mothers It is expected that services will be denied to at least 35000 teenagers in the states 19000 of them from the city  The Vocational Education Act which also provides education for pregnant students and the provision of daycare services for children of teenagers The New York City Board of Education receives 165000 for the education of pregnant students and parents and 35000 for day care which served 814 parents and 25 children in the last fiscal year Budget cuts are expected to eliminate 564 mothers and children from that program In addition the report points out that the one adolescent assistance program for which financing has been increased the Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Program has also been revised to make it more difficult for teenagers to obtain family planning and abortion services Because of recently enacted restrictions on the program the law now requires parental notification for teenagers seeking familyplanning counseling or services and money may not be used to provide contraception to adolescents even with parental consent unless it can be shown that such services are unavailable elsewhere in the community
WASHINGTON TALK; BRIEFING,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/14/us/washington-talk-briefing-050156.html,D ESPITE a court finding that ideology has been placed in the way of due process the Reagan Administration persists in its attempt to deny Federal workers coverage for therapeutic abortion in their health care programs Last week a Federal district judge found that the Administrations director of personnel management Donald J Devine had exceeded his authority in ordering abortion benefits to be cut back in Federal workers health plans A victory was proclaimed by the American Federation of Government Employees but Mr Devine then sent the union a letter telling it to voluntarily drop general abortion coverage by 5 PM yesterday or be dropped as a health care agent The union quickly responded with its own ultimatum that Mr Devine retreat by noon or face a contempt proceeding Mr Devine then set aside his deadline but promised to go back to court and argue that a budget resolution and antiabortion amendment only partly approved by Congress give him administrative authority for the move The union thoroughly angry with the fight insists Mr Devine is merely rehashing arguments rejected by the court and indulging in antiabortion militancy The nasty letters to us are signed by Devine said James Rosa the unions general counsel And the retractions are signed by his counsel A kind word about the Moog Synthesizer rating it right up there with the zipper and the ice cream cone was inserted in the Congressional Record the other day by Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York a clear partisan since the electronic Moog music makers are manufactured near Buffalo Mr Kemp contended that the Moog was easily the most popular item in a special Eureka Exhibit of small businessess 12 most innovative inventions of the past 200 years an exhibit now wending its way across America and heading for permanent display at the Smithsonian Institution Others who have seen the exhibit say the fivefootlong working zipper with wooden teeth rivals the Moog Beyond the ice cream cone the rest of the Eureka inventions selected by the Association of Science Technology Centers of Washington are the bifocal the steam engine lubricant the safety razor the surgical heart valve the telephone xerography the phonograph light polarizing film that led to instant photography and Bakelite the first commercial plastic C ONGRESSIONAL staff members note that lawmakers have had some delicate calls lately from news executives expressing concern over a bill that critics feel might leave news reporters who touch on intelligence matters open to prosecution Congress has already been lobbied from the other side of the issue by the intelligence community and by the Administration They warn that intelligence agents have been compromised and even endangered by calculated attempts by leftwing critics to disclose agents identities An attempt to ban the practice is under consideration in the form of two bills and the stronger of these may threaten legitimate news gathering in the view of some of the news executives who have been in touch with their Congressmen Congressional workers say the issue is difficult and the pressures are growing They cite the Senate Judiciary Committee vote earlier this month in which nine members supported a narrower version of the ban more acceptable to the media while eight others backed the more sweeping ban Senator Howell Heflin Alabama Democrat the 18th vote was on the spot He could join the eight for a tie that would in effect advance the tougher version and risk editorial criticism Or he could join the majority for the narrower version and risk criticism from conservatives His decision was to join neither to vote merely present on the ground that neither bill does the right job He raised various technical questions and declared It seems to me that under this youll never convict anybody While he questioned the narrower bill his nonvote moved it forward for now but the issue is far from settled P ERHAPS the best evidence that the Reagan Administration is seeking a change in antitrust policy is academic An eightweek course in economics has been established for the 443 attorneys in the Justice Departments antitrust division by their new chief Assistant Attorney General William F Baxter He taught antitrust law for 23 years at Stanford and thought it was time Government got back to basics Enforcing the antitrust laws is 30 percent law and 70 percent economics he declared in a recent interview T HE current round of political reapportionment now taking place in statehouses across the nation is such a distraction to members of Congress that one selfinterested group the 21 California Republicans in the House has formed a committee and raised funds to push for a favorable redrawing of the legislative lines The Federal Election Commission has ruled that the committee formed by Representative William M Thomas is not required to register and report its finances with the commission The influencing of the reapportionment decisions of a state legislature although a political process is not considered electioninfluencing activity the commission ruled in response to an inquiry from Mr Thomas The Congressmans office said that the Republicans got together to defend against feared gerrymandering by the Democrats and that because no financial accounting of contributions and donors is required none would be available Francis X Clines Bernard Weinraub

FLORIO: RESTLESS LONER IN RACE FOR JERSEY GOVERNOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/15/nyregion/florio-restless-loner-in-race-for-jersey-governor.html,In a rare moment of relaxation between campaign stops his athletic body stretched out in a motel chair Representative James J Florio reflected on how he had emerged from what he calls the cesspool of Camden County politics in South Jersey to become Democratic candidate for Governor I saw people who became totally dependent on that cast of characters he said of the political bosses They were pressured overtly or less overtly to do things they didnt want to do I didnt want to be in that position so I built my own army of followers in different consituencies The bosses included former Mayor Angelo J Errichetti who is appealing a conviction in the Federal Abscam investigation and who was once one of Mr Florios greatest fans An Individual Since 1979 Mr Florio 44 years old with a schock of dark hair and a bouncy gait that recalls his experience as an amateur boxer says he parted ways once and for all with the Camden party organization in 1979 Mr Florios name and face had become so golden among the countys Democratic voters by that time that even though he himself was not running for an office the candidates he supported routed Mr Errichettis Mr Florio says he has not spoken to the former Mayor since just before that election Working around people whose faces belong on the Post Office wall he said taught him two things to rely almost entirely on himself and to work industriously They are characteristics that dominate his approach to campaigning On the campaign trail he tries to cover as much territory as quickly as possible  often by helicopter  and he usually travels withouth an aide In contrast with his more easygoing Republican opponent Thomas H Kean Mr Florio never seems to unwind Immigrant Background Stressed Born in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn Mr Florio is the son of a secondgeneration Italian shipyard painter and an Irish mother On the campaign trail he tells of his immigrant grandfather who had a horse and cart for hauling ice in the summer coal in the winter and who never bought a second suit because you couldnt wear two suits at once The candidate uses the story to illustrate the virtue of thrift which he says can be restored to government and to remind people of his Italian background in a state where 15 percent of the registered voters are estimated to be of Italian ancestry But at ItalianAmerican clubs Mr Florio  a noticeably selfcontained politician who has mastered the art of being cautious without seeming indecisive and who could never be called ebullient  always seems slightly removed from his enthusiastic listeners He has never been to Italy and indeed has been out of the United States once  on a two day Congressional trip to Geneva Mr Florio dropped out of Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn to join the Navy where he was a weather technician and in his spare time a lightmiddleweight boxer He gained two permanent physical marks from his fouryear stint in Alaska and Key West a dent in his left cheek from boxing and a tattoo of the American flag on his upper bicep that says Jim 55 Graduation With Honors After leaving the Navy he pursued scholastic endeavors until the age of 30 He graduated magna cum laude from Trenton State College then attended Columbia University on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship and graduated from the Rutgers University Law School in Camden While a sophomore at Trenton State Mr Florio married Maryanne Spaeth from whom he has been separated for the last three years They have three children Mr Florio said that if he won on Nov 3 he would be entering the Governors mansion by himself His daughter Catherine has expressed an interest in going to Princeton University and may join him next year Mr Florio said He said he maintained a friendly relationship with his wife who lives in their house in Runnemede but had rejected an offer by her to campaign for him I think its inappropriate to convey something thats not there he said Shes enthusiastic about me as a person but not about politics and the demands of time Mr Florios sole passion is politics according to his press secretary Fred Hillman Occasionally he finds time to pummel a punching bag at a gym although not since the beginning of the campaign The last book he read several months ago  was Milovan Djilass Tito He dresses neatly but always uniformly in a white shirt and dark suit He lives as a transient staying with friends when he is in the Camden area in motels on the campaign trail and in a small apartment in Washington His net worth is approximately 104000 including a 50000 stock portfolio according to the accounting firm of Alloy Silverstein  Shapiro in Cherry Hill A Conservative Dresser Mr Florio is a moderate Democrat and always has been While his law partner James Maloney appointed by Mr Florio as State Democratic Committee chairman supported Senator Edward Kennedys Presidential effort the Representative held back and then finally came out for President Jimmy Carter But he does not mind the comparison made by some of his supporters between himself and the late Robert F Kennedy When asked if he had a political mentor Mr Florio replied that he thought of himself as rather eclectic but he said he would like to be able to emulate the late Senators ability to move people Before he said anything Mr Florio said he was able to move people He had a charismatic effect of nonverbal communication as well as verbal Mr Florio is experienced on the stump but is not a backslapper and he is not always eager to please photographers by nuzzling babies or shaking every hand in a room He usually seems anxious to move onto the next stop  in part because his schedule usually comprises many short appearances At New York Citys recent Pulaski Day parade however he was more outgoing walking alongside Mayor Koch smiling waving and calling to the crowd A Republican Assemblyman Donald Albanese endorsed Mr Florio last week saying that he and the candidate had long agreed on many conservative issues such as opposition to gun control opposition to abortion and his support of capital punishment Mr Florio said he had no problems with that statement He has consistently voted in Congress in favor of an amendment that would ban the use of Medicaid funds for abortion He describes himself as a family planning proponent and believes that while the Constitution allows a woman to have an abortion Im not sure that translates into a constitutional right for a woman to have an abortion paid for One has the right to go in a Cadillac he said but it doesnt mean one has to have a public subsidy He quickly added That sounds callous But he reiterated that he was opposed to Medicaid funding for abortions Mr Florio said he had accepted the support of the National Rifle Association He added I dont believe they gave me any dollars The membership of the NRA in New Jersey is made up of sportsmens clubs who I know to be good people who by definition have been through two police checks and one FBI check Such people he said undermine the argument that all guns are in the hands of dangerous thugs After six years in the State Assembly where he is probably most remembered for twice voting against a state income tax Mr Florio entered Congress in the postWatergate class of 1974 He has won reelection each time with large margins  last year by 78 percent even though President Carter lost the Representatives First Congressional District Chairman of House Panel In 1978 Mr Florio won the chairmanship of the House Subcommittee on Transportation and Commerce which has jurisdiction over railroads and toxic wastes He guided last years rail deregulation bill and won passage of the Superfund which establishes a Federal system for disposing of dangerous toxic wastes In Washington too Mr Florio is viewed as a loner One public administrator who had to find out for the purpose of lobbying the Representatives friends on Capitol Hill found there were none Because of his lone nature he had problems in building constituencies others had to pitch in the public administrator said He is knowledgeable  and stubborn So it was untypical to find Mr Florio at a small fundraising dinner several weeks ago in the Georgetown home of Cathleen Douglas the widow of the Associate Justice of the Supreme Court William O Douglas After dessert and before leaving for a 10 PM vote in the House the candidate told the intimate group of supporters that President Reagan was the rolling cannon on deck He is coming to New Jersey Mr Florio said and is still popular in the abstract But the Representative added I am

CODD'S CAMPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/16/nyregion/a-family-involved-in-politics-helps-mrs-codd-s-campaign.html,Helped by her big politically active family and hindered only slightly she insists by her small campaign treasury  all of it from the Liberal Party  Mary T Codd is running for Mayor of New York City Staten Islandstyle The less than 18000 the Liberals have raised so far is hundreds of thousands less than Mayor Koch will spend on his reelection campaign as the Democratic and Republican nominee Still four years ago Mrs Codd upset the Democratic organization to become Staten Islands Councilwoman at Large Mrs Codd the first woman nominated for Mayor of New York City by an established party runs a busy citywide campaign with the same family effort that helped carry her home borough Mary Codd for Mayor read the greenonwhite placard her son John squeezed through sidewalk crowds at the Columbus Day parade preceding his marching mother by half a block The independent Democrat on the Liberal line Mrs Codds husband Martin J a tugboat captain was at work but she marched between her son Bill and her daughter Melinda Her son Martin carried one of the four grandchildren Martin 3d 5 years old Confusion at an Outing The former Mary Theresa Mahoney a 53yearold mother of eight a lector at St Patricks Roman Catholic Church on Staten Island campaigned at an Irish outing and someone told her You must be the Right to Life candidate She grinned I told them the Right to Life candidate is a man she said Im Catholic and Im antiabortion but Im prochoice In her four years on the Council she built a reputation for being outspoken and during an interview the other day Liberal Party officials surrounded her warily in their headquarters at 1560 Broadway She struck out instantly at Mayor Koch and they brightened He doesnt know how to bring people together she said All that howling on the Brooklyn Bridge Instead of standing at the bridge cheering on pedestrians during the transit strike in the spring of 1980 she said the Mayor should have been helping the two sides bargain Equality of Sacrifice Urged Under Mr Koch she said services have deteriorated streets are dirty subways are unsafe and unreliable and crime has risen Fiscal pressures forced the city to cut back she asserted but there should be an equality of sacrifice that she said she did not discern in City Hall under Mr Koch At her side in the interview were James Notaro the Liberal Partys executive director who is managing the Codd campaign Walter Kirschenbaum a longtime city publicity man who is parttime press secretary and Carl Grillo a Staten Island party official They all smiled They frowned however when she agreed she might lose But the ritual response out of the way  that she is confident  she pondered what she would regard as a victory and then set a tough test At least 42 percent she said At least what Cuomo got Mario M Cuomos close 1977 challenge to Mr Koch on the Liberal line was viewed by many politicians as an arithmetical aberration a spillover from their onetwo finish in the Democratic primary Even that mark Mrs Codd said on reflection was modest Mr Cuomo in the runoff against Mr Koch was outmaneuvered for black and Hispanic support Unified AntiKoch Vote Urged Her eyes twinkled as she spoke within the watchful ring of Liberal Party officials all more sober about the political pieties than she is Then she sharply dismissed her other opponents Frank J Barbaro had his chance in the Democratic primary and lost to Mayor Koch Now she said there should be a unified antiKoch vote from the liberal community John A Esposito lost the Republican primary to Mr Koch but continues as the Conservative Hes funny Mrs Codd said shortly But one clown in the election is enough That description applied to Mayor Koch she indicated Some regular Democrats from Staten Island say she ran for Mayor because they had ticketed her for certain defeat in the Council election Mrs Codd smiled sweetly From everything I hear she said I would have trounced them She decided to enter politics  her third career she said after teaching school and being a housewife  in 1976 when she was defeated in a race for the State Assembly by Guy V Molinari He bested her again in 1980 when she ran on the Liberal line for United States Representative from Staten Island and lower Manhattan By skipping this years primary Mrs Codd was left out of the candidate debates But she said she looked forward to debating Mr Koch before the Nov 3 vote He expected a coronation she said Well Im giving him an election

THE BETTMANN BEHIND THE ARCHIVES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/18/magazine/the-bettmann-behind-the-archives.html,Helen Markel is a contributing editor of McCalls By Helen Markel Within an hour after the 1978 birth of Baby Louise the first testtube baby an 1832 woodcut showing an alchemist brewing up a child in his chemical retort turned up on the desks of major newspaper editors The next morning the old print appeared in papers across the country with the familiar credit line The Bettmann Archive running chastely up the righthand side The Bettmann Archive is a remarkable repository of visual history ranging from photographs of George Washingtons springpowered dentures to pictures of Sigmund Freuds original leather couch It is the creation and life work of Dr Otto Bettmann an enterprising scholarly GermanJewish immigrant who spent 45 years building it into an invaluable irreverent and original source of graphic materials that have rescued several generations of art directors book publishers encyclopedia compilers Tshirt manufacturers and cerealbox designers from creative gridlock Instead of visual cliches I provided them with a graphic shorthand that illuminates the present by revealing the past preferably with humor Bettmann now a dapper 78 says with characteristic immodesty I always used to tell my staff what Harold Ross of The New Yorker told his Dont only gimme that grim stuff  Thanks to the mustiness of the word Archive most people envision the place as an old curiosity shop with Dr Bettmann a Dickensian relic if indeed he exists at all A recent dinner partner of his upon discovering Bettmanns identity over her vichyssoise looked up in shock I thought youd died 300 years ago she said In point of fact the archive is more IBM than Dickens and the recently retired lord of its files more Clifton Webb than Scrooge Part scholar and part Barnum Bettmann has a theatrical sense as shrewd as his editorial judgment There is a certain commercial value to maintaining an image of antiquity he says cheerfully So I live happily with all rumors of my demise His flawless tailoring impeccable ascots silver goatee and Herr Professor accent made Bettmann as giltedged a landmark for Dry Dock country as Hammacher Schlemmer the archives longtime neighbor across East 57th Street Indeed Bettmann looks so much like Freud that a leading New York psychoanalyst keeps his picture in his waiting room and no patient has yet questioned it Unlike Freud however Bettmann smiles a lot especially for an archivist To be more accurate he actually twinkles a word everyone eventually resorts to in an effort to describe him The twinkle the wry wit the Old World courtliness conceal a fiercely competitive drive and an elegant wheelerdealer charm Last January Dr Bettmann sold his archive to KrausThomson Organization Ltd a small international publishing firm for an undisclosed sum Undisclosed Bettmann says because they dont want to defile the purity of the archive with the vulgarity of a price tag However informed sources estimate that the sale was a multimilliondollar photo finish for its founder I was fortunate to marry a fine Bostonian lady who is a strong astute swimmer on the ocean of life just what this little German scholar needs Women always have their feet planted more firmly on the ground than men especially American women to whom I am strongly addicted He calls her Lieb the diminutive of the German Liebchen she calls him Sweetheart tells him when he is driving in the wrong lane monitors his phone conversations selects his clothes Anne is my stylist my art director the creator of my physical persona he says gazing lovingly upon her We are a kind of marital phenomenon  this combination of retiring German librarian and withit American woman has worked miracles personally and professionally She is a wonder woman During the sale she spoke calmly while I became very emotional flinging my arms about and wringing my hands As we say in America I sold the steak but she sold the sizzle After the sale the Bettmanns moved from Manhattans Sutton Place to Floridas giltedged Boca Raton near Fort Lauderdale where Dr Bettmann continues to enjoy the life of the mind in an opulent condominium I reject the words condo and senior citizen  he says with a small shudder We have simply set up a little corner of New England on Floridas Gold Coast where I am spending a semiworking retirement The life of the mind is our true wealth but the ambiance in which one lives it is not to be sneezed at I admit that I surprised myself at the ease with which I have adjusted to the languors of this climate I find my time here a very pleasant hiatus between being and nothing Since I do not believe in the hereafter the archive is my afterlife and I feel fortunate in knowing in advance what footprints I will be leaving behind The uninitiated believe that the Bettmann Archive like the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress is a nonprofit institution The fact is that it is a business with profit margins any Harvard Business School graduate would envy Bettmann has cautiously admitted upon occasion that the profits may run close to 30 percent in a good year and insiders estimate that the business brings in about 1 million annually Bettmann made his fortune by charging handsomely for materials that are in the public domain He created a unique enterprise in which no sale ever reduces his inventory The archive simply rents a copy of one of its three million pictures to a customer for onetime use Although Dr Bettmann does not agree that one picture is worth a thousand words even though I realize I am biting the hand that has fed me handsomely he has definitively proven that it can be worth a thousand dollars  and often more Fees range from 50 to 3000 depending on the length of the rental and the size of the target audience Lower rates are charged to academic and church institutions hospitals and the like For example a small picture he bought for a few francs during a Sunday stroll among the Seine picture stalls turned out to be just the background a photographer needed for a Vogue cover He paid the archive 1000 for onetime use When a Scotch whisky distiller wanted to do an advertising campaign based on English drinking habits Bettmann remembered a small cartoon book of 19thcentury barflies he had picked up in a London flea market The distillers advertising agency rented 12 pictures from the book for 2000 And thats how the money rolls in Bettmann was born in 1903 in Leipzig the city of books and of Bach which were to become the two major influences in his life together with his grandmothers chicken soup  the ne plus ultra of Jewish culinary arts he says Although I am not a religious man in the templegoing sense that soup has kept me genetically anchored to Judaism throughout my life To be a Jew in Germany was always to be a fugitive of sorts America enabled me to be a Jew proudly a free man striving to lead an orderly life governed by the ethics of Judaism I have never returned to Germany and I never plan to His father was a bibliophile and a noted Leipzig bone surgeon who studied with Roentgen the discoverer of Xrays At age 12 Otto began methodically culling through the familys wastebaskets for discarded mailing pieces with anatomical and medical illustrations  the seminal kernels from which my archive would grow He took his PhD in art history at the University of Leipzig and worked in a Berlin publishing house before becoming the rarebooks curator of the State Art Library He made his name there with an exhibition of Goethe on the art of the book and had the foresight to photograph each entry for his personal collection He was fired on the eve of Hitlers takeover On a gray November morning in 1935 he sailed for America wearing his fathers best suit and with 5 in his pocket He chose to leave his clothes behind and instead pack two steamer trunks with thousands of feet of exposed 35millimeter film the images of Western civilization he had gathered over the years The contents of those two trunks which were of no interest to a bored customs man were the beginning of one of the worlds finest private graphic collections that 45 years later would fill two floors of an elegant Manhattan office building An uncle in Cincinnati a successful lawyer staked his young German nephew to the rental of a tiny office above a small German restaurant on West 45th Street  the place always smelled of sauerbraten  and the smell was all I could afford But his timing was pictureperfect Life and Look had arrived on the scene and photojournalism was in its infancy Everybody needed pictures Magazine and book editors heard about him and one afternoon Frank Stanton then head of research for the Columbia Broadcasting System dropped by in search of something different to illustrate the impact of fledgling radio for a doublepage advertisement in Fortune Bettmann produced a blockbuster from one of his fathers rare books he had smuggled out of Germany  a 300yearold line drawing by a Jesuit priest of a medieval castle with huge snailshaped trumpets that transmitted sound from room to room We had a big run on that print after Watergate Bettmann says nostalgically The advertisement won awards for CBS and put the small archive on the graphics map Bettmann invested in a new suit and his first ascot He moved his quarters uptown and his archive into the 20th century by buying up picture morgues that had fallen upon hard times Ten years ago he joined forces with the film publicist John Springer for Springers collection of old movie stills Snob that I am Bettmann says looking back on that venture I admitted Michelangelo but refused Cecil B De Mille to my salon But wiser  and younger  heads fortunately prevailed Today film has become a serious discipline and King Kong Tarzan and WC Fields are big serious business Thanks to them even The Late Late Show which I am never awake to see has achieved a sort of status With the advent of television and the demise of Life and Look Bettmann took up the slack by anticipating new demands for graphics depicting black nationalism womens liberation solar energy urban blight and suburban flight  You name it I was after it During the Kennedy years he collected a prodigious file of firstrate rocking chairs and the archive keeps a treasure trove of Thomas Nast political cartoons available for all New York mayoralty campaigns What Bettmann wrought is a pictorial history of the world as classified by subject matter Now there are row upon row of spaceage filing cabinets containing more than three million pictures fully annotated crossfiled and indexed into 50 groups 5000 subject categories and thousands of subcategories We simply go from the Creation to Reagan Bettmann says matteroffactly The Reagan file is said to be developing nicely Personalities range from A Beverly Aadland the 17yearold girlfriend of the late Errol Flynn seen taking her ease in her duplex Manhattan penthouse to Z Vladimir Zworykin the inventor of the cathoderay tube for television Freud outsells Jesus today  we could never get enough Freuds Bettmann says glumly since he holds the master personally responsible for the cult of personality a phenomenon he deplores as much as he does Marshall McLuhan McLuhan sounded good but there was nothing there He was one of those meteorites  after he died they packed up his institute and he was never heard from again As I kept telling my staff the medium is the medium the message is the message The staff currently consists of three picture researchers a photo librarian a permissions manager a bookkeeper and four harassed clerks backed up by an elaborate photo lab and a battery of computers and other electronic marvels that process about 50 orders a day Give us everything you have on abortion to Need a file on old bidets by noon Unfilled requests range from a profile shot of the Mona Lisa to Thomas Jefferson eating spaghetti which a Midwest pasta manufacturer insists exists The archive maintains a standing offer of 1000 for an authentic picture of the Earl of Sandwich eating a sandwich or of the camerashy Gabriel Fahrenheit with his mercury thermometer The 57th Street archivists consider stock pictures a dirty word and politely pass on all requests for alligators in Cypress Gardens or Nancy Reagan in the Rose Garden to commercial photo agencies I taught my staff that a firemans scrapbook a circus employees photo album  the discarded bread wrappers of daily life rather than the official photographs  are the archivists gold Bettmann is an inveterate throwerouter He prided himself on rejecting most of the 100000 pictures the staff or outsiders brought to his desk each year It has been said that my pictures and my staff both trembled before me he boasts The staff was rumored to go through his wastebaskets after hours in the hope they could start their own archive from his discards What they dont have Bettmann says comfortably is the key that makes it all come together The Smithsonian and the Library of Congress have about the same stuff an old customer said recently in some awe Its just that you have to spend days wading through it What they dont have is Otto Bettmann for a memory bank The archives chief competitors are Culver Pictures Inc and Brown Brothers We have plowed the same furrows for many years in peace and harmony Bettmann says He admits Culvers superiority in film and theatrical pictures but maintains firmly that the archive cannot be touched in its overall global collection of pictorial history We cover a wider field with a more critical eye But I am not running down my confreres he adds hastily Brown Brothers which has dropped out of the New York scene has a very valuable collection from the 1890s and 1900s of the Teddy Roosevelt era and the rise of our industrial and social empire But both outfits are much less organized than we are The heart of the archive is its retrieval system as intricate and precise as a Bach fugue on which it is based Its all there in Bachs music if you only take the time to listen to what he is telling you Bettmann says By following his ground rules for composing a fugue you can learn how to set up an archive or become a good writer I play the piano every day to try to get closer to the meaning of his work The only spanking I ever got was when my piano teacher Fraulein Schutze those two ominous umlauts told my parents I was not practicing Today I am eternally grateful that they engaged in that piece of unprogressive education Its amazing what dogged application combined with simple fear can accomplish Thanks to Fraulein Schutze and a favorable number in my genetic lottery I have the ability to work relentlessly  my good wife would say compulsively It is a gift that fate smuggles into some fortunate cradles that is as vital as a good larynx to an opera singer This morning the compulsive worker is taking a break from what he calls his hangup a biography of Bach to talk to a visitor about his new life in Boca Raton Although he claims that he has officially retired his staff affectionately reports that his fine Renaissance hand still reaches to East 57th Street with a new idea a fresh manifesto I have an incurable love affair with New York the most obnoxiously beautiful dehumanizing illsmelling overpriced and ethereal city in the world he says Florida is still Frontierland in many ways  although I have finally managed to find some luncheon companions who are not retired vice presidents of ballbearing companies The thing I miss most in Boca is the Manhattan Yellow Pages which I consider the greatest research tool in the world At my age you cant sell 300 days of sunshine short nor the fact that you can go out for a walk without fear Older people should live in a kinder ambiance than New York even though I return every month to recharge my batteries and look in on the archive I have finally learned that you are not as old as you feel you are as old as you are and I have adjusted to that fact There is a certain wisdom to leaving the party before youre asked to go he continues quietly I knew I would eventually have to face the music so I did while I could still dance to it Wearing a navy blue blazer a blue polkadot ascot and Teutonically pressed gray slacks Bettmann at 78 looks as though he could dance all night He attributes his physical and marital longevity to his wife We have grown young together over 40 years So many people die young of their own dietary debaucheries he says sipping a glass of iced tea I live an orderly Bachinspired life I refrain from excesses of all kinds I avoid cholesterol and the only pill I believe in is a daily dose of that invaluable vitamin the book But above all a good wife helps you defy the calendar That plus a fivemile beach walk every day with Bach on my Sony Walkman Melvin Gray Bettmanns stepson and president of the archive for the past 10 years says My mother is a very dynamic woman She wore out the two young men who came down to Florida to start the negotations for the sale of the archive Soon after that confrontation in Boca Raton Hans P Kraus 74 a formidable international rarebook dealer announced the sale The ceremony was held at Mr Krauss East Side townhouse Present were the two operating heads Herbert W Gstalder president of KrausThomson and Melvin Gray Since Gstalder is Krauss soninlaw and Gray is Bettmanns stepson both sides put in a good word for nepotism Then with his usual sense of theater Bettmann turned the occasion into a publishing party for himself a sort of last hurrah during which he autographed 100 copies of his latest book A Pictorial History of the World The inscription to one of the young men who had come down to Boca read To Arthur in the hope that he will soon return to Florida but that the next trip will be less expensive Since 1975 Bettmann has been taking a Sun Belt excursion into academia Appointed an adjunct professor of history at Florida Atlantic University he gave a course in the pictorial history of civilization and was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 1979 After that he says I withdrew into this wonderful monastic office overlooking the Atlantic among my books and my records and my picture gallery of the men with whom I have had personal concord over the years Goethe Santayana Henry James Emerson  the friends of my interior lifetime And Bach Bach above all  He is devoting full time to his Bach book although he is less sure about that project now than he once was That book will probably never be written he says slowly A book is a long nights journey into day a Sisyphean task requiring the spiritual mental and physical discipline of a young man As a Brandenburg concerto plays on his stereo he muses on the meaning of the man he calls an enormous human being I have lived with him so long now I know him so well that I want to introduce him to others so that he can enrich their lives too Knowing him has given me a willingness to face death and to realize that everything is preordained Like the inexorable laws of a Bach fugue one has to come full circle as it is written in the book of life Curiously this man of five million pictures still puts his faith in the written word I know of no picture that is worth one perfectly constructed sentence or a single page of Flaubert or the noble ideas of Tolstoy Matthew Bradys photograph of Lincoln is a remarkably sensitive likeness But you must read the Gettysburg Address to see the man whole This unreconstructed bookman has written or collaborated on nine books among them A Word From the Wise a compilation of ideas and quotations that caught his vast reading fancy over the years ranging from Adlai Stevensons definition of diplomacy  Protocol alcohol and Geritol  to Don Marquiss jaded cockroach archies observation An optimist is a man that has not had much experience Despite archie he says I am a man of experience who remains a confirmed optimist I deplore the cult of nostalgia even though I have made a hell of a living from it because it blinds us to progress Nostalgia is papiermache history sterilized of all pain in which life is seen as a continuous performance of the Ziegfeld Follies and the blood sweat and exploitation of the poor have been swept under the Aubusson rugs To prove his thesis he wrote The Good Old Days  They Were Terrible an unsparing look at the alleged Gilded Age Published in 1974 it is now in its 15th printing and has become something of a cult book In it he reminds New Yorkers who yearn for clean air that their city in 1900 was a nasal disaster There were 150000 horses each of which produced about 20 pounds of manure a day with no pooperscooper law in sight Pigs roamed Broadway along with thousands of young ruffians fleeing slum housing And like the drugaddicted veterans of Vietnam the Civil War survivors returned home hooked on laudanum He straightens a portrait of Henry James Our misplaced passion for the good old days blinds us to the good new ones he remarks We refuse to accept the price tags of progress Welfare benefits create welfare abuses atomic energy brings in its wake terrible health hazards the Model T produces gridlock But we do keep moving forward  I dont hold with the currently fashionable view that the world will end in nuclear war in the year 2000 From my post at the picture window of history I see the pace of our progress like the march of the Crusaders as they approached Jerusalem  two steps forward one step back With Faulkner I believe that man will not only endure but that he will prevail  He smiles apologetically at his own solemnity History does not repeat itself historians simply repeat each other Of course its safe for me to prophesy  If Im wrong I wont be around to eat my words Otto Bettmann stretches stands up and puts Bachs Fugue for Flute and Oboe on his Sony Walkman Then he heads for the beach to admire the mysteries of the ocean and the intricate life of the shells at his feet He picks up a perfect pale pink conch and offers it to a visitor Bach at his best he says gently Pure inexorable ageless perfection How can one fail to be optimistic about the future in the face of that
BRINGING UP MOTHER,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/18/books/bringing-up-mother.html,BED REST By Rita Kashner 266 pp New York Macmillan Publishing Co 1095 RHINE MAIDENS By Carolyn See 272 pp New York Coward McCann  Geoghegan 1395 THE busy life of Beth Clahr suburban supermom and nascent singer seems to be functioning smoothly In her mind she ticks off the mornings minutiae  lunchbox sandwiches car pool small sons fox costume She has two rude children a handful of Junior League friends and Gideon a wouldbe lover who is always on the telephone saying things like Youre high and sweet this morning Though her husband Richard a character straight out of late60s womens fiction especially Diary of a Mad Housewife seems insensitive  in bed he tells her shes ready when she isnt and he is less than enthusiastic about singing lessons  Beth has apparently made her peace with his imperfections She still winces though when she hears herself say I want to be interesting for you Rich Youre a dynamic man I dont want you to wake up and find yourself married to a useless and boring woman who hasnt grown in twentyfive years But this winning first novel takes a different turn from those housewifely consciousnessraisings with which we are familiar Rather than leave the husband or take the lover Beth  bright appealing and seemingly well adjusted  chooses to bathe very carefully every day make up her bed with clean sheets she launders them daily and lie there still as a stone figure on a crypt singing Toora loora loora These afternoon retreats become a funny kind of clandestine oasis in her day Is this some monstrous retreat from a life that has become too complicated a nay vote against contemporary womans role juggling Mrs Kashner is a deft and subtle writer Beths life shifts before our eyes ever so delicately from one that runs smoothly to one that calls for difficult choices The onenightaweek choral singing becomes a potential demanding career when Beth learns she has the talent to go the distance to sing solo and give up the chorus where singers must learn to merge their voices with the group A fellow chorus member urgently wants to make love to her A close friend has cancer and Beth initially frightened by a suspicious lump in her own breast finds she is pregnant and must decide about an abortion Overnight her daughter turns as daughters do from an obnoxious child into a woman None of these things is overwhelming in itself but together they throw Beth offbalance She has increasing numbers of Walter Mitty fantasies and the tunafishcarpool litany which at first seemed purely functional takes on an obsessive quality now she must recite it like the Lords Prayer during crises She longs for the time when her mother bathed her put her to bed smoothed her hair and sang her a lullaby One of the most gratifying things about Bed Rest is that Beth negotiates her crisis with its attendant painful early memories without the help of a psychiatrist She rides it out herself  an expression possibly of increasing female selfsufficiency  and when it is over she is better and stronger and finally able to make her choices Bed Rest is a graceful and touching tour through a familiar landscape made interesting by the authors intelligence skill and light touch Though some mothers stroke their daughters hair and tuck them in bed Grace the mother in Rhine Maidens isnt one of them She never says my word or knits a sweater She cant stand her daughter Garnet a Brentwood matron who looks like someone had reached in her head and scooped out all her brains with a spoon or Garnets husband Ian the Jewish Jerk or their decorator house or their children the disgusting little creeps Grace lives and works in Coalinga a small dreary California oil town full of other lonely women like herself Her problem is not unusual  life just didnt turn out the way it was supposed to Once she had a tiny waist and auburn hair She lived in Los Angeles in the 40s She went teadancing at the Ambassador and met her first husband a newspaperman who took her into his world of glamour and LA lights and then left her supposedly to write his novel saying Dostoevski always said that wives and children killed more artists than cholera Then there was Dick with his rosebud mouth who whispered to her from the bar If I were a gopher Id go for you enough for another marriage another child and Coalinga because Dick was in oil  though more often in a bar Rhine Maidens is written in alternating sections in the voices of Grace and her daughter Both women describe a dreadful visit with each other and a sad meeting with Sandy Graces son and Garnets half brother who reveals that he is a homosexual druggie To entertain Grace Garnet takes her to a Green Energy seminar where young men dressed as dollar bills seek to raise the audiences moneyconsciousness Grace leaves with Ed one of the few eligible males who has crossed her path He has some money and he very soon wants to marry her It could be a satisfactory ending to a hard life that has left as its residue an angry bitterness Mother and daughter have nothing in common but a chance biological connection and an eerie penchant for losing husbands Though Garnets life is lightyears from her mothers it is only after Ian has left her that she understands that she must put her life together in her own way She must stop endlessly trying to please an unpleasable mother and maybe she dreams she can live the way Jane Fonda does Carolyn See is a skillful writer and she makes us like both the irascible vital Grace and the not very bright but somehow touching Garnet A shrewd and funny observer Miss See looks at that welltrodden territory Southern California from some new angles I was interested in Graces unusual nostalgia for the Los Angeles of 40 years ago where she walked to work to lunch and to Bullocks to shop just as though LA were like any other city Yet Graces coming to terms with herself is the only part of the book that takes place outside California Is it necessary to leave there to see oneself truly
A THIRD OF NEW YORK BIRTHS IN '80 WERE TO THE UNMARRIED,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/18/nyregion/a-third-of-new-york-births-in-80-were-to-the-unmarried.html,More then onethird of the almost 100000 infants born to New York City residents last year were born to unwed mothers according to statistics released by the Department of Health The department also said in a report issued last week that 14 percent of all women giving births in 1980 were teenagers This is a decrease from 1979 of 126 births Last year 13944 teenagers gave birth and more than 75 percent of the women were unwed The median age for teenage births was 182 years compared with a median age for unwed mothers of 23 years and a median age for all births of 265 years A breakdown by the Departments Bureau of Biostatistics shows that the vast number of the births to unwed mothers were to women from poorer sections of the city To me I can only see them showing a perpetuation of poverty said Saul Blumenthal of the bureau referring to those figures which are 4 percent higher than 1979 The Figures for 1980 Citywide 36699 births were out of wedlock in 1980 or 37 percent of the 99911 births to residents that year But in Central Harlem 77 percent of all births were to unwed mothers and in Mott Haven in the south Bronx 65 percent of the births were out of wedlock By comparison in Flushing Queens the figure is 7 percent and in Kips Bay and Yorkville on Manhattans East Side 136 percent of the births were to unwed mothers Having an outofwedlock child is generally not going to help move people out of poverty said Mr Blumenthal Particularly if they are teenagers they are now saddled with a child and may have to give up school That means theyre not likely to get a good job Its like another nail in the coffin Mr Blumenthal attributed the slight decline in births to teenagers to the fact that the number of teenagers in the city has declined The citys highest rate of births to teenagers was recorded in Mott Haven in the South Bronx where 28 percent of the births were to teenagers The lowest rate in the city was in Flushing Queens where the figure was 3 percent In Manhattan the highest figure was central Harlem with 246 percent of the births to teenagers and the lowest was in Kips Bay and Yorkville with 89 percent Many Mothers on Medicaid In 1980 323 percent or 34558 of all births were to mothers on Medicaid up 05 of a percentage point from the 33697 Medicaid births recorded in 1979 This is high no question about it said Mr Blumenthal The department has not yet correlated figures on the numbers of abortions recorded in 1980 but it is expected that the figures will not differ dramatically from 1979 when 104424 abortions were performed Many of these abortions were performed on visitors to New York City A breakdown shows that the highest percentage of abortions were to residents of the lower West Side of Manhattan where for every 1000 births there were 1772 abortions The lowest figure was in WilliamsburgGreen Point Brooklyn with 442 abortions per 1000 births The poorer people are not necessarily getting the abortions said Mr Blumenthal
"DELBELLO, PISANI FACE TO FACE ON THE ISSUES",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/18/nyregion/delbello-pisani-face-to-face-on-the-issues.html,THE political debate a timehonored campaign device seems to have come into its own this year in the race for county executive Alfred B DelBello the twoterm Democratic incumbent and his Republican challenger State Senator Joseph R Pisani have met nearly a dozen times so far and plan 20 more confrontations before Nov 3 Neither candidate seems to be much impressed with the meetings We havent had a real debate yet Mr Pisani said last week as he prepared to attack Mr DelBello before several dozen leaders of voluntary healthservices agencies in White Plains And Mr DelBello said later theyre not real debates some attract as few as 20 people But they also draw hundreds at other times and they provide insights  whether those attending represent small groups with special interests or large gatherings of neighborhood civic or religious organizations And however the debates go each candidate manages each time to establish his major arguments Mr DelBello emphasizes what he feels is an eightyear record of achievement He says that Westchester County has the highest financial credit rating in the state and the lowest unemployment rate that he has lowered county taxes three years in a row and that his administration has avoided crises because it has anticipated them Mr Pisani has said that the good credit of the county has less to do with its government than with Westchesters longterm appeal to homeowners and industry that the low county taxes are a product of this same economic well being and that despite Mr DelBellos claims he has mismanaged Playland the Westchester County Medical Center and other countyowned facilities He has sought to characterize Mr DelBello as a big spender at the head of a big government claiming that as his replacement I will reduce your taxes even more than he did because I will shrink government Mr Pisani For a schedule of debates between the two candidates see Page 7 who played a significant and acknowledged role in revising the states childcare legislation emphasizes his considerable experience in Albany and the more sympathetic ear he would find as a Republican in Washington We know there is going to be a new era in Washington he told one audience last week and you want a forceful voice there one that wont take pot shots at President Reagan It is an appeal to the political majority that swept Mr Reagan into office and Mr Pisani arguing forcefully makes the point frequently in a county that still has a slight Republican edge in voter registration But Mr DelBello who also knows how to raise his voice rebukes Mr Pisani for voting for almost every one of the 1200 state mandates that Albany imposed on our county and others requiring them to finance programs in the socialservices field As for Westchesters voice in Washington Mr DelBello argues that you need somebody who is willing able and politically free to speak against the Reagan cuts that are compounding disaster in our budget and elsewhere Mr Pisani as the challenger is generally the more strident of the two both in tone and substance He knows he must carry the attack to Mr DelBello who is probably the better known outside the Senators own district of the Long Island Sound communities Mr DelBello also won handily the last time he ran beating Assemblyman Gordon Burrows by a 3to2 margin So Mr Pisani has to be aggressive and innovative accusing Mr DelBello for example of a preoccupation with the ousted Sheriff Thomas J Delaney  accused by the County Executive of seeking to destroy the 1979 police merger  while at the same time offering evidence that he would function more efficiently at the head of a 500 million county government Last week Mr Pisani proposed a creative economicdevelopment plan for such hard areas of the county as Yonkers Mount Vernon New Rochelle and Peekskill where he said Mr DelBello had turned his back in favor of helping the easy areas The Tax Increment Plan as it is known in 14 states where Mr Pisani said it is working well requires a state constitutional amendment It would have the county the city and a developer agree to improve a designated area Assessed valuations there would then be frozen to ensure no loss to the city while enabling any increased tax revenues to pay off bonds that the county or its agency would sell to pay for sewers roads utilities and parking The value of the plan Mr Pisani said is that the developer would not have to assemble the project and would not have to spend his money until he was ready to build At the same time the city would be guaranteed no loss of taxes although it would have to wait until the bonds were paid off to begin collecting the extra taxes on the improved property If the developer went bankrupt Mr Pisani conceded a new developer would have to be found Mr DelBello said Its a great idea thats been around and if the municipalities want it wed be happy to work with them But he said New York State has not seen fit to permit it because it believes that local municipalities do not want to wait 20 years the time it would take to pay off the bonds to sacrifice increased tax revenues they just dont believe any area in their community will lay fallow for that time And as he tends to do in debates Mr DelBello offered a counterexample The state gave us permission to abate taxes on industrial development and Westchester opted into that he said so if anyone wanted to build they would get a 10year deescalating abatement or declining tax forgiveness But very few communities have used it because they feel they can develop the land without the abatement and make a decent return These arguments which can confuse some audiences come from candidates who are articulate and informed as well as politically experienced They know each others responses so well by now that oncenaive or faulty comments have been removed while other points contain anticipated responses and answers to them Each has been touched by scandal in the sense that friends or political associates have been charged with wrongdoing or convicted of crimes but neither has been personally involved enough to become a political target at least so far in this campaign They snipe at each other occasionally however Mr DelBello made a brief reference during one debate last week to several paid members of the Temporary State Commission on Child Welfare  which Mr Pisani headed while he reformed the states laws who seemed to have no connection with the work of the commission a reference to alleged political associates of the New Rochelle Senator Mr Pisani declined to respond to Mr DelBellos comment Mr Pisani for his part focuses on Mr DelBellos credibility saying that the incumbent has created new agencies during his eight years in office while not solving any major problems Mr DelBello argues that on the contrary his government has not grown in size that it has solved problems on its own and in partnership with private industry and that it is performance that counts There is also a RighttoLife candidate Rita Lombardi in the race for County Executive Mrs Lombardi said she has been invited to several debates but has declined to appear because the party doesnt get into most issues Mrs Lombardi who described herself as a housewife and the mother of six children said our idea is to fill every voting slot and keep people aware of abortion We are trying to save unborn babies
PROTESTS PLANNED OVER BUDGET CUTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/19/us/protests-planned-over-budget-cuts.html,A coalition of more than 100 labor social and political organizations meeting over the weekend to devise a strategy for combating the Reagan Administrations slashes in social services voted overwhelmingly to conduct a week of major demonstrations around the country beginning April 26 The All Peoples Congress pledged to work through the winter to devise imaginative ways to pressure President Reagan to rescind his cuts in social programs for the needy and to stop the United States military buildup The demonstrations called Days of Resistance will take place in Detroit Washington New York Chicago and other urban centers spokesmen for the coalition said The twoday gathering at Cobo Hall drew about 2000 delegates from 43 states They sat through speech after speech in which Mr Reagans was denounced and his program was described as a ploy by the greedy to take from the needy Coalition Issues Statement The Reagan program of cutbacks attacks on labor racism sexism lesbian and gay oppression and buildup for war the coalition said in a statement is meant to increase the enormous privileges of the rich at the expense of the majority of the people particularly the poorest most discriminated against and most oppressed Speakers included representatives of unions black Hispanic and womens organizations Vietnam veterans homosexuals politicians community organizations and foreign activists Despite the overall cohesiveness and buoyant mood there were signs of dissension When William Cousins president of Local 321 of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization finished an attack on the President there was a short shouting match among delegates over whether his union should be supported since it backed Mr Reagan in the Presidential election Hisses and Catcalls And when Herbert Jackson prepared to speak on behalf of homosexuals there were hisses boos and catcalls from some in the audience But these were drowned out by cheers and applause Similarly there were shouts of What about the babys rights as Eleanor Bader coordinator of the New York City chapter of the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights gave her speech Outside the meeting a group of Nazis demonstrated for a short time and vendors sold copies of The Workers Vanguard a Marxist biweekly newspaper which denounced the congress as All Peoples Circus Front for the Democrats Although the congress was much more diverse in its issues and makeup and its members on average were much older it resembled the antiwar rallies of the 1960s and 70s Audience Brought to Its Feet When Debbie Thurman of the Illinois Welfare Rights Organization said We must tell Pharaoh Reagan to release our people or face the consequences of the Red Sea the audience rose and began chanting Were fired up we wont take it no more When Raphael Cancel Miranda a Puerto Rican nationalist described Mr Reagan as a Grade B actor repeating lines written by the big corporations the audience again rose and chanted Free Puerto Rico right now By far the biggest difference between the coalition and the antiwar movement was the diversity of the organizations the former represented The antiwar effort was largely conducted by white college students but the All Peoples Congress is made up of groups ranging from veterans organizations to Dykes United Against Racism Everywhere to United Automobile Workers Local 900 to the National Black United Front Some of the organizations involved helped orchestrate the Peoples Antiwar Mobilization that brought thousands of people to Washington May 2 to protest American involvement in El Salvador WorkingClass Movement In the protest at the Pentagon participants pledged to forge a workingclass movement that would embrace the needs of the poor minorities women homosexuals and the disabled Member organizations subsequently held a series of protests in Detroit Atlanta Chicago and other cities then organized the All Peoples Congress to develop a unified plan to resist Mr Reagans budget cuts Moved by the success of its congress the coalition voted to choose cities for protests this winter then conduct largescale protests in the Days of Resistance week I think it is time we put on our marching shoes and took to the streets again said Ethel Matthews an activist from Atlanta
RELATIONSHIPS; MAKING DECISIONS FOR OTHERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/19/style/relationships-making-decisions-for-others.html,T HE word is paternalism and it conjures up images of fathers telling children Get that car home by 1 AM lawyers saying to clients You are now going to plead guilty and business managers intoning Were going to move you to the Altoona office  youll be so much happier there To some paternalism is synonymous with colonialism sexism and racism Its used as a dirty word said Aviam Soifer professor of law at Boston University And yet its hard to imagine why its such a pejorative given the fact that as a species we are paternalists Our young have longer childhoods than those of other species We are born dependent We need people to care for us and we need to care for others Paternalism has a kind of inevitability Professor Soifer added Paternalism knows no gender though the word maternalism doesnt have quite the same meaning We dont have a word for the maternal equivalent but we all know the phenomenon Despite its pervasiveness however paternalism causes resentments and leads to struggles over power in families and businesses and between governments and the governed Professor Soifer a specialist on constitutional law has been studying paternalism for the last four years He has analyzed the relationships between professionals and their clients examined Supreme Court decisions and delved into paternalisms historical and philosophical underpinnings Practically paternalism is the managing of individuals businesses or nations in the manner of a father dealing with his children But Professor Soifer defines paternalism more narrowly as a decision made on behalf of someone else for the latters own good  and the subsequent actions taken to further that decision To him the word implies a lack of consent on the part of the person who isnt making the decision People are very naive in their rejection of paternalism said Professor Soifer For children do need adult supervision clients do need lawyers advice and employees do need managerial guidance In some ways he said we are all affected by the decisions of other paternalists and what we have are reciprocal paternalistic relationships But we need to know what kind of paternalism were talking about Professor Soifer has identified three significant varieties of paternalism providing deciding and protecting At one pole is deciding he said as when the military decides what individual soldiers will be doing and where no choice is offered  even if the decision is wrong At the opposite pole is providing  where for example the state provides services to encourage nurturance growth or learning The establishment say of a free university by a state government is an example of the state providing without deciding Between the poles of deciding and providing is protecting Its the protecting that causes so many of the battles said Professor Soifer When the government wants you to buckle your seat belt or wont let you buy Laetrile In the family paternalism is usually invoked in the rearing of the young We all intuitively feel that decisions must be made about very young children he said But the use of consent is clearly different for a 4yearold than it is for a 16yearold The debate about such distinctions has been receiving increasing attention recently Legal scholars such as Joseph Goldstein and Robert A Burt of Yale University have weighed the issue of autonomy as it applies to parents and the stateasparent Richard Sennett of New York University has surveyed the interplay of mans authoritarian instincts In the law such debates continue a long history of speculation about the rights of free individuals and the right of the state to intervene The focus of Professor Soifers analysis involves the meaning of seemingly contradictory rulings of the Supreme Court during the tenure of Chief Justice Warren E Burger While the Court has struck down what it calls paternalism when the Government tries to regulate utilities or corporations Professor Soifer says it has fostered paternalism on the part of doctors judges and other authority figures Many of the courts decisions involving compulsory education abortion foster care and the commitment of mental patients rely on the good judgment of such authorities Professor Soifer has a research grant to study these aspects of paternalism for the next three years and someday he says he will finish a book about it To Professor Soifer Americans have long been moving away from the antipaternalistic fervor of de Tocquevilles America We seem to have a hunger for paternalistic figures said Professor Soifer as life becomes ever more uncontrollable and chaotic But it is important to be clear in our thinking about what paternalism is and what it isnt he said Perhaps then sometimes we can be for it even though its paternalism Glenn Collins
THEATER: ONE-ACTERS BY DURANG,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/22/theater/theater-one-acters-by-durang.html,ANYONE can write an angry play  all it takes is an active spleen But only a writer of real talent can write an angry play that remains funny and controlled even in its most savage moments Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You confirms that Christopher Durang is just such a writer In this oneact comedy he goes after the Catholic Church with a vengeance that might well have shocked the likes of either Paul Krassner or Lenny Bruce and yet he never lets his bitter emotions run away with his keen theatrical sense Sister Mary Ignatius the second half of a Durang double bill that opened at the Playwrights Horizons last night is both the most consistently clever and deeply felt work yet by the author of A History of the American Film and Beyond Therapy Originally produced by the Ensemble Studio Theater two years ago it has the sting of a revenge drama even as it rides waves of demonic laughter The play is also terribly honest for Mr Durang knows better than to give himself a total victory over his formidable antagonist With pointed rue he must finally leave the church bloodied but unbowed Sister Mary Ignatius Elizabeth Franz is an aging teacher conducting an assembly in the auditorium of Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrows School She seems at first a reasonably kindly pedant As she lectures her students on the physical torments of hell her voice quivers with selfcontentment her mouth curls heavenward in a selfrighteous smile Nor is her Going My Way demeanor challenged by the impish student questions she reads from file cards Was Jesus effeminate asks one of her charges Yes replies Miss Franz cheerily closing off any further debate For about half the plays length Mr Durang uses his glibly dissembling protagonist to illustrate what he regards as church hypocrisies Sister Mary must do some fancy and unconvincing footwork to explain how supposedly infallible dogma could have been changed overnight by her least favorite Pope John XXIII She instructs her star pupil the 7yearold Thomas Mark Stefan to read a partial list of sinners going to hell and the roll call includes Zsa Zsa Gabor Christine Keeler David Bowie Betty Comden and Adolph Green The nun also tends to fondle little Thomas just a shade too playfully  thus allowing Mr Durang to score his wicked points about the hidden sexual quotient of ostensibly sinless celibacy Eventually however we see that there is one question that does throw Sister Mary If God is all powerful why does He allow evil in the world And the playwright forces the nun to confront that issue when four grownup former students show up to stage a JosephandMary pageant complete with camel for her current flock The visitors all hated their despotic teacher they soon try to settle the score by making her defend God and His rules in a world where rape and cancer seem to justify such sins as abortion and agnosticism Mr Durang successfully escalates this comic confrontation to a literally violent climax that strips the nuns moral authority bare even as it allows her to retain her crippling psychological power over her students past and present As the playwright sees his villainness she will tolerate no failings in others  but will gladly use church law to rationalize even murder when it suits her own authoritarian purposes In making his extreme case Mr Durang receives strong help from the director Jerry Zaks who wisely keeps his actors in realistic bounds The entire cast is firstrate including Mr Stefans catechismreciting choirboy and Miss Franz is brilliant After her real  and insane  personality is revealed she still remains all too frighteningly human Mr Zaks and company also do very well by the evenings curtainraiser The Actors Nightmare In this sketch the playwright gives us what his title promises  a hero appropriately named George Spelvin Jeff Brooks who suddenly finds himself on stage in a play he has never rehearsed The premise lets Mr Durang show off his gift for theatrical and showbiz satire for the playwithintheplay proves to be an everchanging amalgam of Private Lives Hamlet A Man for All Seasons and the collected works of Beckett Who but this writer would imagine that Godot will someday arrive  reeking of garlic and telling stewardess jokes The nebbishy deadpan Mr Brooks may be the least likely melancholy Dane since Jack Benny in To Be or Not to Be he is most amusing as he calls on Kiss Me Kate lyrics and other halfremembered theatrical lines to ad lib his way through his jam Like the playwright and cast the designers  Karen Schulz William Ivey Long and Paul Gallo  run joyously amok plundering the styles of four centuries of theater If The Actors Nightmare finally runs out of jokes too early and fails in its effort to deepen its hero it gets us as ready as possible for the unstoppably virulent comic nightmare thats soon to come

KOCH IS MAIN TARGET AS HE AND 6 OPPONENTS DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/23/nyregion/koch-is-main-target-as-he-and-6-opponents-debate.html,Mayor Koch was the principal target yesterday in the first debate of the election campaign  an unusual confrontation involving all seven candidates for Mayor of the major and minor parties The Mayors opponents focused on what they said was racial polarization in the city and cuts in city services and they blamed the Mayor for both Ed you polarized the city said Assemblyman Frank J Barbaro the Unity Party candidate Your message was I put them in their place  We cannot lower the quality of life more than it has been said the Liberal Party contender City Councilwoman Mary Codd Subways and an Image If you ride the subway you dont vote for Mr Koch said Dr Jeronimo Dominguez the Right to Life Party candidate Ed Koch is an image said Assemblyman John A Esposito the Conservative choice as he brought out a set of props  magazinecover photographs of the Mayor and an Esposito family picture to make his point that there should be a family in City Hall Mr Barbaro in the closing moments of the taped debate on WPIXTV angrily accused Mr Esposito of really demeaning conduct by using the family pictures The debate will be aired at 8 PM Sunday The Mayor for the most part looked bored and rarely reacted to the sallies of the opposition The rest of you dont have a record he said at one point The Mayors Response In the main he stuck to his standard contention that he had given the city fiscal stability and would make improvement of city services a priority in his second term He said that he was trying desperately to end racial discrimination in the city The Mayor said that the city had a 97 percent rate of tax collections in realestate and business taxes while the state had an 85 percent rate in collecting sales and income taxes for both city and state Two other candidates stuck to the standard themes of their splinter parties On the right Judith Jones the Free Liberatarian candidate called for reduced government and taxes and decriminalization of victimless crimes At the left end of the political spectrum Wells Todd of the Socialist Workers Party called for a labor party to represent minorities and workers Attack at Every Turn Dr Dominguez who wore a large cross on his chest repeatedly sounded the main theme of his party opposition to abortion Mr Barbaro who like Mr Esposito faced the Mayor before in the Democratic and Republican primaries attacked the Mayor at every opportunity He and Mrs Codd often sounded similar themes  racial polarization service cuts tax abatements and rent increases Mr Esposito several times brought up the death penalty which he and the Mayor favor However he noted that the Mayor supported Governor Carey who has several times vetoed bills to broaden the death penalty Mrs Codd in her closing remarks emphasized that she was a woman one of two in the race but the only woman on an established party line Six more debates have been scheduled and four of them will include all the candidates

'POLITICIAN' IS THE ONE TAG THAT STICKS TO THURMOND,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/25/weekinreview/politician-is-the-one-tag-that-sticks-to-thurmond.html,When a group of feminists appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year to express concern about clubs that excluded women Senator Strom Thurmond told them that they were the prettiest witnesses we have had in a long time He said he imagined the women were all married but if not you could be if you wanted to be Many in the audience were uncertain whether the 78yearold South Carolinian was needling the witnesses or merely trying to be courtly That uncertainty typifies the response Mr Thurmond evokes As president pro tempore of the Senate chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a member of the Presidents party clearly in step with the conservative temper of the times he is now at the height of his power But he is cautious and canny in using it He appears eager to demonstrate that he has overcome his segregationist past and is now a statesman he got high marks for his conduct of Sandra Day OConnors confirmation hearings gently reminding his colleagues that the issue was not abortion but the qualifications of a nominee for the United States Supreme Court Civil rights lobbyists have begun to focus their attention on Mr Thurmond because the Judiciary Committee is the gate through which voting rights legislation normally must pass Democratic senators used procedural tactics to keep a renewal of key provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 from going to Senator Thurmonds committee because they knew he was hostile to sections that would continue close Federal scrutiny of local election laws in states like his own with a history of discrimination against black voters The section requiring preclearance of local election laws is inherently discriminatory Senator Thurmond has said because it singles out only certain states he would support continuation of the requirement he said only if it applies to all states Critics say that a nationwide requirement is unnecessary and unworkable James Strom Thurmond the man who ran for President on a States Rights Dixiecrat ticket in 1948 who switched from Democrat to Republican in 1964 and has opposed any number of civil rights bills was applauded when he addressed a national association of black lawyers last March He also has the respect though not the affection of many blacks in South Carolina He is a master politician said IS Leevy Johnson of Columbia SC one of the first blacks to serve in the state legislature He is very adroit very astute very sensitive to issues He knows how to adjust to changing times You may not like what he produces but you have to give him credit He gets things done Many blacks said they did not believe that Mr Thurmond had a sincere commitment to their concerns But they readily acknowledged that he had funneled large amounts of Federal money to South Carolinas black colleges He has given a black man Thomas Moss an important role on his staff since 1971 He engineered the appointment of a black lawyer Matthew J Perry Jr to the United States Court of Military Appeals in 1976 when Mr Perry was a member of the Democratic National Committee then warmly endorsed Mr Perrys nomination to the Federal District Court in South Carolina in 1979 In addition when he was facing a stiff reelection challenge in 1978 Senator Thurmond supported a proposed constitutional amendment to give full voting representation in Congress to residents of Washington DC Seventy percent of the citys population is black Laughlin McDonald an official of the American Civil Liberties Union in Atlanta said that Mr Thurmond had made such moves for personal political gain in a state where blacks account for slightly more than 26 percent of the registered voters Blacks tend to agree but welcome his interest whatever the motive Senator Thurmond has fundamentally altered the course of the Judiciary Committee from its liberal tack under the chairmanship of Edward M Kennedy making sure for example that key responsibilities such as the budget of the Federal Bureau of Investigation were entrusted to subcommittees headed by unwavering conservatives Death and Taxes His priorities as chairman include revision of the Voting Rights Act legislation authorizing the death penalty for certain crimes and a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget by mandating that for each dollar spent there must be a dollar raised in revenue Although Mr Reagan endorsed such an amendment in the Presidential campaign Administration officials have asked Congress to hold back maintaining that it should be a contingency plan used only if Congress fails to enact deep spending cuts Like Senator Kennedy whose stance on crimerelated issues was conservative Mr Thurmond emphasizes the need for a comprehensive criminal code Indeed the two men endorsed the same bill last year it would abolish parole for Federal prisoners and permit the Government to seek appellate review of sentences imposed by a judge Aides to the Massachusetts Democrat say that Mr Thurmond was often helpful on procedural matters when he was the panels ranking Republican In recent years Senator Thurmond seemed to be maundering when he read off an outdated list of subversive organizations and pressed the FBI to explain what it was doing to monitor their activities His concern seemed anachronistic Now it appears that he was ahead of his time There is a whole subcommittee that investigates such questions Likewise Senator Thurmond sought unsuccessfully in 1979 to bar the issuance of food stamps to strikers Congress enacted such a ban this year Although he agrees with them on most issues Senator Thurmond does not display the zeal of newright conservatives such as Senators Jeremiah Denton of Alabama Orrin G Hatch of Utah and John P East and Jesse Helms of North Carolina Mr Thurmond says he is opposed to abortion but he does not crusade for a constitutional amendment to ban abortion He says there are not enough votes to pass such an amendment Taking a more moderate line than some other conservatives he would permit abortions in cases of rape incest and clear danger to the life of a pregnant woman Senator Thurmond is a pragmatist not an ideologue For better or worse he lacks the grand vision of those who would remake the world anew
4 CHALLENGERS TILT AT BROOKLYN PRESIDENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/25/nyregion/4-challengers-tilt-at-brooklyn-president.html,A majority of Brooklyn voters are too young to remember when the office of Borough President was held by anyone other than a Democrat but the other political parties lack of success has not deterred them from placing four candidates on the Nov 3 ballot in an effort to depose Howard Golden the incumbent None of the four  Leon F Nadrowski a Republican Frank P Taormina a Conservative Adrienne V Marciano of the Right to Life Party and Patrick W Giagnacova a Liberal  expect to be in Mr Goldens chair at Borough Hall on Jan 1 But each has a reason for running to promote a cause close to his heart and to spread its message across the borough and to City Hall and Albany As for the incumbent who says he stands ready to debate any of his rivals but has not yet received any invitations Mr Golden is campaigning by doing what he has done assiduously during his five years in office He is going around his large and populous borough to as many civic functions and community meetings as he can find Democratic Preserve Since 1940 Probably no more than a relative handful of Brooklyn residents can name the last nonDemocratic Borough President  no one in Mr Goldens office could recall offhand last week Nor could the Board of Elections until a search was made Only Justice John F Hayes of State Supreme Court a former deputy borough president had it on the tip of his tongue Raymond V Ingersoll was elected on the City Fusion ticket with Mayor Fiorello H La Guardia in 1933 and stayed in office until his death in 1940 A Democrat John Cashmore succeeded him and the Borough Presidency has been a Democratic preserve ever since Mr Ingersoll also had the Republican line but it was the fusion coalition that elected him This time around the Republicans have no partners and the candidate is Dr Nadrowski a surgeon who lives in the house in Greenpoint in which he was born 48 years ago A tall softspoken man Dr Nadrowski ran against Mr Golden four years ago and got 8 percent of the vote twice the percentage rolled up by the head of the ticket State Senator Roy M Goodman for Mayor In the 1950s and 60s Dr Nadrowski ran several unsuccessful races for Congress from Greenpoint which had then and still has a large population of the PolishAmerican stock from which the candidate comes The Dangers of Drugs Dr Nadrowskis message is that crime is the overriding problem in Brooklyn and all of New York City and that the disease blight and squalor that are its root causes must be eliminated He would seek legislation to get rid of pornography shops by requiring them to obtain licenses costing at least 1000 a month He advocates tougher laws against juveniles who commit crimes with guns and censorship of violence on television As Borough President he said I would go into every school and tell young people of the dangers of drugs Mr Taormina who has the Conservative line is a 37yearold longshore checker on the Brooklyn waterfront who lives in Bensonhurst If a miracle happens and Im elected he said last week he would like Dr Nadrowski make the fight against crime his top priority Mr Taormina acknowledges that his entire campaign budget will come to less than 500 but he believes the race is worth it if he can goad the winner into taking a tough stance on crime Importance of Life Running for the Right to Life Party is Mrs Marciano also from Bensonhurst She is a 47yearold former teacher who was afflicted with multiple sclerosis two decades ago but has managed to lead a vigorous life although forced to use crutches or a wheelchair Beyond her opposition to abortion as part of the RighttoLife platform Mrs Marciano says she hopes to impress on people the importance of life in general and respect for people The Borough Presidency she feels should be used to bring together and help all the unwanted  the poor the elderly blacks those of us who are handicapped She believes that education is the key to reducing crime and that adults must take responsibility for devising programs to help young people outside the schools The Liberal Partys candidate Mr Giagnacova is 33 years old and a party stalwart He has been the statewide assistant executive director since 1978 when he came to Brooklyn from Buffalo where he was the Liberals city chairman for six years Mr Giagnacova who was a regional construction coordinator for the state contends that Mr Golden and his predecessors have neglected to work hard for public works to improve the boroughs infrastructure and provide jobs When they send new buses to Brooklyn to test their resistance to potholes theyre sending them to the right place he said He traces the history of delayed publicworks projects for which he asserts money has been available for years and of parks that he says are in worse shape than in any other borough The Borough President he says should be more effective in getting money for public improvements Mr Golden for his part insists he has done all a Borough President can to get Brooklyns share of the scarce capital budget But he sees the creation of jobs in the private sector as the key to making Brooklyn a better place to live and work He is trying to get a European chain to build a hotel in Brooklyn which has had none for several years Except for the election he would be in Zurich this weekend with the Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation promoting the borough at a meeting of industrialists Mr Golden also defends his record on fighting crime saying he fought in the Board of Estimate for more police officers and initiated the placement of security guards in public schools
HUNTINGTON RACE FOCUSES ON DIVIDED-GOVERNMENT ISSUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/25/nyregion/huntington-race-focuses-on-divided-government-issue.html,AS Huntington Supervisor Kenneth Butterfield sees it he defeated Councilwoman Claire Kroft for supervisor two years ago but she became the supervisor as the veteran and most vocal member of a Republicancontrolled Town Board As Councilwoman Kroft sees it Mr Butterfield whenever he had a problem didnt call the Town Board he called the newspapers The two are the most visible and vocal antagonists in an election in which divided town government is the issue underlying the public charges and countercharges Two years ago Mr Butterfield a Democrat was reelected but his party lost control of the Town Board by a 3to2 margin with Councilwoman Kroft who did not have to surrender her Council seat to run for supervisor emerging as the dominant figure on the board and Mr Butterfields principal adversary Now three positions are again open  supervisor and two Council members Two other councilmen both Republicans are not up for reelection this year Mr Butterfield needs a clean Democratic sweep on Election Day for his party to regain control of the board by a 3to2 margin Mrs Kroft who is seeking reelection is part of a Republican ticket that is led by John ONeil a county legislator who has been reapportioned out of office and who is challenging Mr Butterfield The third Republican candidate is Kirk Mackey who is running for councilman The dividedgovernment issue is similar to that in neighboring Smithtown where the Democratic supervisor Patrick R Vecchio who has been confronted with a 3to2 Republican Town Board for the last two years hopes to win a majority by strongly supporting two Democratic Council candidates In Smithtown the Democrats need to win two of the three Town Board positions to gain control but in Huntington they have to win three of three Democrats now control only one of the 10 town boards East Hampton in Suffolk County The dividedgovernment issue in Huntington is most evident in the efforts of various candidates to blame each other for the towns fiscal problems in the last year These problems resulted in the layoff of some 80 town workers and nearly 4 million of borrowing to cover a budget deficit Mr ONeil 48 years old of East Northport charged that Mr Butterfield had abdicated his responsibilities as the towns chief fiscal officer Mrs Kroft blamed inflation and what she termed Mr Butterfields refusal to cooperate with the Town Board Mr Butterfield 46 a Huntington resident said he did not have executive powers without control of the Town Board It was government by committee he said of the last two years This argument is backed up by some Democratic literature that is focused more on Mrs Kroft than Mr ONeil Had enough  Defeat Claire Kroft trumpets a Democratic flier Reject the KroftONeil team urges another The argument over responsibility for town government in the last two years could provoke a plague on both your houses attitude by the voters Mrs Kroft acknowledged There arent many other houses however for the voters to choose from The Conservative Party has endorsed Mr ONeil an important factor since Democrats in Huntington regularly defeat Republicans without the Conservative line giving the GOP support The Liberals have endorsed Mr Butterfield while the Right to Life Party is fielding its own candidate John Eberle 47 an East Northport pharmacist who emphasizes the abortion issue As for the Council positions the Conservative town leader John Andrew Kay who has had a falling out with the town Republican leadership had hoped to endorse two Democratic Council candidates Councilman Joseph Clemente and Kay Ferraro the town clerk who is running for the Council But insurgent Conservatives fielded their own slate in the primary and nominated two Conservatives Daniel Flood and Victor Bonanno What is most significant politically however is that the Conservatives did not endorse the two Republican candidates Mrs Kroft and Mr Mackey Mrs Kroft won by virtue of her votes on the Conservative line in 1977 Her GOP running mate Mr Mackey has Right to Life endorsement while that party has also nominated its own candidate Theresa Flynn for the other Council position The Liberals have endorsed the two Democratic Council candidates who would have had the distinction of having both Liberal and Conservative nominations if Mr Kay the Conservative leader had not run into a revolt in his own party The major party candidates appear to have adopted different tactics as well as issues The Democrats are running as a slate with their literature emphasizing all three candidates since they need a clean sweep to regain control of the board Mr Butterfield echoed the theme with his own message to the voters If they like their supervisor they should like him enough to give him the authority to operate the town government But the slate appeal seems less evident on the Republican side where a victory in only one of the three races would maintain GOP control of the board Mr ONeil talked of the Republican team but three pieces of his literature did not even mention his running mates Mrs Kroft hardly mentioned Mr ONeil in an interview and disposed of Mr Mackey by describing him as a lovely young man who will be a dynamo someday but right now hes young She also emphasized that people are inclined to think slates but that they could vote for any two of the six Council candidates regardless of their party or position on the ballot When a reporter said that she sounded as if she were thinking only of her own candidacy and that if she were the only Republican elected she might remain the dominant figure on the Town Board she responded Everybody feels the same way about themselves
Headliners; Asking for Punishment,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/25/weekinreview/headliners-asking-for-punishment.html,In the category of beating your critics to the punch and with a vengeance Sister Jane Scully president of Carlow College a Catholic womens school in Pittsburgh last week administered her own lumps for canceling a speaking engagement by a lawyer who has advocated abortion rights for women The lawyer Sarah R Weddington argued the prochoice case that led to the 1973 United States Supreme Court decision upholding a womans right to seek an abortion and later was President Carters adviser on womens issues The school came under fire for scheduling her as a speaker But Sister Jane belatedly concluded that the more pressing issue is the violation of the principles of academic freedom She asked to be censured by Carlow faculty members who voted by a wide margin to comply
BROOKHAVEN RACE APPEARS ONE-SIDED,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/25/nyregion/brookhaven-race-appears-one-sided.html,BROOKHAVEN A 35yearold lawyer and a 60yearold town clerk are vying for Supervisor of the largest town in Suffolk County in a campaign that seems to be dominated by voter apathy a lack of serious debate and difficulty by both parties in raising funds However enrolled Republicans outnumber Democrats by a 2to1 margin and so the GOP candidate Henrietta Acampora the town clerk and a town employee for 22 years is a strong favorite The Democratic Party candidate John Fath now in private practice in Patchogue is a former Brookhaven deputy town attorney who left that post when the current Republican Supervisor Joel Lefkowitz was elected two years ago Mr Lefkowitz a controversial figure in Brookhaven chose to seek a judgeship rather than reelection but was defeated in the Republican primary John Ray a Right to Life Party candidate who was defeated in a bitter primary campaign in September by Mrs Acampora is also in the race Mrs Acampora refused the Right to Life Partys endorsement which political observers estimate to be worth 5000 votes in a town election I said no thank you Mrs Acampora said I dont believe the Right to Life Party or the abortion issue has any place in town government Brookhaven once a sprawling rural community is now a booming suburban town with a dual identity Part of the townspeople live and work in the community while a large portion commute to jobs in New York City and regard Brookhaven as a bedroom community where their highpriced waterfront homes are situated For these residents the most vivid impression they have of town government is their tax bill and the view of the Town Hall they see daily on their way to the Long Island Rail Road station which is across the street The question of how the town should be developed has been of critical political importance for the last decade Some forces have advocated the creation of more low and middleincome housing particularly apartmenthouse and garden apartments Others would prefer to see the town remain rural and have advocated more stringent zoning regulations and the preservation of the remaining open spaces Mrs Acampora is the mother of three daughters and one son and has five grandchildren I dont object to being called a grayhaired grandmother by my opponent said Mrs Acampora Thats what I am and whats wrong with it Mr Fath sees the race as a turning point in Brookhaven Town history where politics at Town Hall has long been dominated by Republican administrations In the last 22 years only two Democrats have been elected to the Supervisors post a position that now pays 35000 a year In this town said Mr Fath who once worked as a prosecuting attorney in the Suffolk County District Attorneys Office Democrats get into office in the wake of Republican scandals According to figures from the Suffolk County Board of Elections Brookhaven has 57730 enrolled Republicans 34535 Democrats 3656 Conservatives 817 Liberals and 329 Right to Life Party members There are more than 30000 registered independents in the town On the stump Mr Fath has emphasized the need for professional management of the towns business while his Republican opponent has taken a similar position citing her experience in town government as qualifications for the job I dont think that years of employment is adequate experience to be Supervisor Mr Fath said in rebuttal I find it very frustrating to be running against a jolly grandmother who wont discuss any issues other than the duration of her employment  Mr Fath has charged the Republicans with patronage abuses including the placement of people with criminal records in sensitive town positions and has also attributed fiscal irresponsibility to them Mrs Acampora has defended the Republican record maintaining that the GOP entered Town Hall two years ago with a 4 million budget deficit inherited from the previous Democratic administration The Democrats overestimated revenues and underestimated expenses Mrs Acampora said According to Mrs Acampora only one person with a criminal record has been hired by the town It was a misdemeanor Mrs Acampora said and it was on the application when the person applied for the job The town decided to hire him anyway because it was a wellqualified applicant Mrs Acampora has spent about 50000 on her campaign and has devoted a great deal of time to shaking hands and making speeches at Republican clubs and organizations for the elderly Im a popular candidate Mrs Acampora said You cant work in a town for 22 years and not know people
ISRAELIS ASSESS ROLE OF RELIGION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/26/world/israelis-assess-role-of-religion.html,One recent afternoon shortly before sunset long whistle blasts sounded across Israel to mark the beginning of the most solemn day in the Jewish calendar  Yom Kippur the Day of Atonement For twentyfive hours no car moved Television and radio stations went off the air Whole cities fell silent Each familys world shrank to the dimensions of walking distance The empty streets turned into sunny promenades for neatly dressed children and parents and grandparents many with prayer books under their arms strolling to and from parks and synagogues It seemed on the surface that all the Jews of Israel had come together in a moment of religious unity But that was just on the surface For if one could have looked into homes the variety and clash of religious attitudes and practices would have come dramatically into view Some Jews were fasting as religious law prescribes on this day Others were eating and drinking normally some even festively Some prayed others did not And there along those differences of private belief ran one of the most severe fault lines of Israeli society today Religious and nonreligious Jews in Israel have never coexisted in complete harmony and mutual tolerance In recent years however their conflicts have grown into proportions that carry major implications for the social and political values of Israel As the society has grown modern comfortable and materialistic an increasing number of Israelis have been thrown into a search for something to replace the waning socialist and Zionist ideologies Many have turned to a fundamentalist ultraOrthodoxy which retreats from the contemporary world but seeks also to remodel the immediate social structure according to ancient Jewish law or Halakha The spiritual revival and the embracing of tradition  which have parallels in the Christian and Moslem worlds combine now with newfound political power The ultraOrthodox while a small fraction of the Israeli population provide just enough seats in Parliament to put Prime Minister Menachem Begins Likud bloc into a majority and they have used this leverage to force their will The Moral Minority as one Israeli journalist dubbed the movement pushed through conservative social legislation during the first Begin Government including a repeal of the liberal abortion law and a ban on autopsies except in murder cases when a single close relative objects Last summer a confrontation between religious and secular authority erupted when militants contended that a medieval Jewish cemetery was being desecrated by archeologists digging at the City of David in Jerusalem First with demonstrations and stonethrowing then with political pressure the ultraOrthodox managed to induce the countrys more moderate Chief Rabbis into ordering the dig halted despite the archeologists insistence that no evidence of graves had been found When the Education Minister Zevulun Hammer balked at suspending the excavation license the Chief Rabbis threatened him with a form of religious ostracism under which the Torah could not be read in the synagogue where he worshiped As an Orthodox Jew himself and a leader of the National Religious Party Mr Hammer relented and suspended the license The archeologists then appealed to the Supreme Court which ruled that the rabbis had no authority over Governmental decisions The Rabbinical Council replied with the assertion that Halakha the ancient oral Jewish law was eternal and transcended temporal power Sabbath Work Permits Cited Mr Begins agreement with his coalition partners drafted under pressure from the ultraOrthodox Agudath Israel Party devotes most of its 83 provisions to pledges on religious matters Permits for work on the Sabbath would be almost eliminated and the law vigorously enforced Cities that currently have Saturday bus service such as Haifa where residents like to go to the beach on their only day of the week off  would be denied public transportation Conversions to Judaism by Conservative or Reform rabbis would not be recognized for the purposes of Israeli citizenship Extensive state funds would be given to Agudath Israel yeshivas and other institutions Only too often complained Tamar Eshel a Member of Parliament in the opposition Labor Party we find that Orthodox Jews according to their very deep beliefs feel responsible for my sins And they feel obliged to stop me from sinning and to force on me a style of life that according to them is the right one Sliding Into Clerical Dictatorship She added That is definitely against basic freedoms This is certainly not conducive to coexistence This certainly brings about tremendous divisions between various sections of our people Some intellectuals are more than annoyed they are deeply concerned about the direction that Israel is taking We are sliding into clerical dictatorship said Gershon Weiler a professor of philosophy at Tel Aviv University and the author of Jewish Theocracy a study of religion in Israel If you read Khomeinis lectures on jurisprudence Professor Weiler continued in principle it is the same as what the rabbis are saying the Constitution is divinely given and its just a matter of interpretation The American notion of a constitution expressing the will of the people is anathema to religious Moslems and Jews Today given the change if we adopted a constitution it would be like the Constitution of Iran The first paragraph would read Israel is a Jewish state  What Kind of a State Is Israel Indeed what kind of a state is Israel Theocratic or democratic Ecclesiastical or secular The question stands at the center of the debate Among American immigrants to Israel Conservative and Reform Jews are fairly numerous but their rabbis are not recognized here and cannot perform marriages or conversions The Orthodox establishment even runs newspaper advertisements before the High Holy Days warning Jews against attending services in Conservative synagogues The spectrum continues into the zone of Orthodoxy where many observers have achieved a synthesis of traditional and contemporary beliefs keeping the most hallowed elements of faith and ritual  including dietary laws thricedaily prayer and Sabbath abstinence from the use of automobiles electricity and the like  while discarding some of the more fundamentalist doctrine against birth control for example or that relegating women to inferior positions in society 20 UltraOrthodox Sects To the right is a cluster of ultraOrthodox sects generally referred to as Hasidic whose men let beards and side curls grow and dress in black suits black hats and white shirts without ties and whose married women shave their heads and wear wigs or tightly wrapped scarves to hide their hair More than 20 such sects originally from scattered shtetls of Eastern Europe now live in Jerusalem Some of them such as Neturei Karta are antiZionist believing that no Jewish nation may exist until the Messiah comes Surveys have indicated that there is a large middle ground of Israelis who keep many holiday traditions without scrupulous observance In a poll published two years ago by Haaretz for example 38 percent of 1500 people interviewed said they recited a blessing over wine on the Sabbath and 44 percent said they used separate utensils for milk and meat but only 1 percent refrained from using electricity on Saturday Sixtyfour percent said they believed in God Religious Codes Criticized The issue remains then of how religious a state Israel should be Even many nonreligious Jews rejoice in its universal observance of Jewish holidays noting that it is the only country in the world where a Jew can feel entirely comfortable wearing a skullcap and keeping the traditions Many American Jews who are uneasy wearing yarmulkes at home do so on visits to Israel But the point of real anger by the secular toward the religious comes where religious law spreads into the larger body of secular law To the observant religious codes have remained too limited in authority permitting widespread desecration of the Sabbath and other unpious behavior To the nonobservant however religious law and the jurisdiction of the rabbinical courts have impinged too much on private life subjecting marriage divorce and child custody to the archaic practices of ancient times Secular law assigns marriage and divorce to the religious hierarchies Jewish Christian and Moslem respectively  and no civil authority operates in these spheres Thus marriage and divorce is governed by strict religious precepts a Jew may not marry a Christian in Israel for example Feminists Assail Tradition If anything the restrictions appear to foster circumvention of the religious laws Couples fly off to Cyprus Western Europe and the United States to do what religious law considers illicit Feminists contend that Orthodox tradition tends to regard the wife as the property of her husband and women as unclean leading to deception and humiliation during elaborate prewedding ritual Prospective brides must be interviewed by a rabbanit a woman official at the rabbinate who asks intimiate questions about personal and religious habits She asked me if I kept a kosher home if I wanted to have children if I would go to the mikvah every month said Judi Saban referring to the ritual bath Mrs Saban who immigrated from Phoenix Ariz five years ago and married a Jerusalem bus driver last July continued She was very nice but I think everyone lies I kept thinking Somethings going to go wrong theyre not going to let us get married  Frightening Tales Ten days before her wedding day she was required to attend a lecture by another rabbanit who told frightening tales She said if you dont go to the mikvah and you get pregnant that month you can have a child who would have cancer or be mentally retarded or something Mrs Saban recalled Feminists such as Tamar Eshel and another Member of Parliament Shulamit Aloni both lawyers have protested the advantage that they say men have in rabbinical courts whose judges are all men and whose inclinations often run toward awarding the custody of children to their fathers especially where mothers are nonreligious Unfortunately Mrs Eshel said during a discussion on Israeli radio our religion is steeped in a way of thinking in a philosophy which goes back to a totally different society and we cannot say that everything that was decreed then is good for todays society The movement toward ultraOrthodoxy has gained enough momentum to penetrate the countrys slang and Israelis speak of going black when a secular Jew goes into an ultraOrthodox sect donning the black suits of the extremely religious So Many Repentant Jews Now there are so many repentant Jews youngsters said Rabbi Shlomo Goren Israels Chief Rabbi for the Ashkenazim They made a turn of 180 degrees from the antireligious kibbutzim they became superreligious  not one not ten  thousands I would say its something in the atmosphere its a heavenly phenomenon Today the secular the antireligious the leftist kibbutzim build in their midst synagogues Some Orthodox intellectuals worry about what they see as the ascendancy of extremism and the selfimposed isolation of the ultraOrthodox The most radical is considered authentic said Eliezer Schweid a professor at the Hebrew Universitys department of Jewish thought When we wear this small kipa he said using the Hebrew word for yarmulke we are not as authentic as when we are wearing that big hat He went on It is the concept of a segregated population not involved in political or cultural life whose main purpose in life is learning Torah studying Torah in keeping the mitzvoth Even in the military there is a tendency to find special groups for them in the army So they do not have common experience with others This is our most serious inner problem in Israel Professor Schweid continued Here we face the problem of being broken down into two nations There are many types of Jewish life in Israel but they are not legitimized I think the more pluralistic we will be the more united he said
Retarded Patient Dies In Abortion After Rape,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/26/us/retarded-patient-dies-in-abortion-after-rape.html,A 19yearold retarded patient in a mental hospital who went into shock during a courtapproved abortion was removed from lifesustaining machines after she was declared dead hospital officials said today A spokesman for Barnes Hospital said that the patient Diane E Boyd was declared dead yesterday by Dr William M Landau chief neurologist She went into shock while being operated on at Reproductive Health Services a clinic The exact cause of the complications are undeterminable at this time and may never be learned said Frank Susman an attorney for the clinic Mr Susman said Miss Boyds mother was notified by hospital officials Sept 25 that her daughter had been raped
NOTES ON PEOPLE; Some Former Law Clerks Recall a 'Great Judge',https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/26/nyregion/notes-on-people-some-former-law-clerks-recall-a-great-judge.html,Paul M Bator teaches law at Harvard Richard Hiegel is a partner of a major New York law firm and Norman Dorsen is president of the American Civil Liberties Union That puts them at the top of the legal profession but what brought them and two dozen other leading legal figures to the Century Association in lower Manhattan Saturday night was a bond forged at the bottom They all began their careers serving as law clerks to the late Justice John M Harlan and the gathering marked the 10th anniversary of his departure from the United States Supreme Court I dont think theres ever been anything like it for any other Supreme Court Justice said Mr Dorsen who explained the continuing appeal of the man who joined the Court in 1955 and served until a few months before his death in 1972 He was a great judge and a great man Mr Dorsen said and he had particularly close relations with his law clerks who came to admire him That assessment was echoed by former Justice Potter Stewart who spoke of Justice Harlans extraordinary personal and intellectual contributions to the court Mr Stewart countering Justice Harlans reputation as a conservative noted that the Justices opinions included striking down prohibitions against abortion and extending free speech protection to four letter words Mr Dorsen made clear however that it was something beyond his judicial opinions that kept Justice Harlan alive in the hearts of his clerks It was his personal qualities he said he had great dignity but he was a very warm and decent man
The Choice in the Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/26/opinion/the-choice-in-the-region.html,Close Call in New Jersey New Jersey voters have a good and therefore difficult choice for governor next week Either James Florio the Democrat or Thomas Kean Republican would lead the state ably and intelligently Except for some economic quarrels reflecting the national debate about taxcutting the candidates have had no significant differences Both are strong supporters of environmental causes and the arts Both want to crack down on crime expand prisons and treat violent juvenile offenders as adults Less attractively both oppose abortion rights and favor the death penalty If one must make distinctions they have to be found in executive experience and above all temperament Tom Kean is the president of a sizable real estate company and a bank director who served in the Assembly from 1968 to 1977 including two years as Speaker He was the author of much valuable legislation to aid cities He courageously supported the state income tax and opposed gambling in Atlantic City as an invitation to corruption Like many who have worked with him in business and politics we are impressed with his energy and commitment and his easy and affable way with people James Florio a lawyer also has accomplished much in pressing national environmental and transit legislation He was a state legislator for six years before going to the House in 1975 He has never run a large program or organization but contends that a governor doesnt need to if he properly inspires others Be that as it may there are some grounds for concern about the way in which Mr Florio inspires No one works harder but stories abound regarding his inability to maintain friendships his excessive demands on staff and his insistence on doing things alone Too much of this campaign has turned on economic theorizing and the alleged influences of President Reagan and the retiring Governor Byrne Neither candidate has been really forthright in explaining the great difficulty New Jersey faces in balancing next years budget And Mr Kean has exaggerated the states economic decline Mr Florios formula for stimulus through targeted rather than acrosstheboard tax reductions has been the more sensible But Mr Kean has backed off Reaganomics finally sensing that tax cuts will be possible only as the states budget permits It is a close contest  and a close call Ours is for Mr Kean And in Westchester and Nassau Westchester cannot lose in choosing a county executive this year Alfred DelBello the Democrat brings a commendable record to his bid for a third term His challenger is State Senator Joseph Pisani one of the most energetic and progressive Republicans in Albany Mr DelBello has dared to sponsor a valuable garbageburning plant at Peekskill He has expanded the county hospital at Valhalla for advanced medical care and services to the indigent To reduce power costs he backed an illadvised condemnation of Con Edisons facilities but now supports a more practical effort to buy cheap hydropower for Con Ed through a county agency Mr Pisani is the author of advanced legislation in the fields of child care foster homes and adoption He promises constructive change and new vitality particularly in tackling urban decay and institutional stagnation How then to make a choice Mr DelBello has shown some signs of weariness and even petulance he is embroiled in an unnecessary conflict with the County Sheriff and seems to have lost some of his zeal for coping with budget problems and urban blight But proven public servants should not be lightly repudiated even for a most promising rival For that reason we recommend Mr DelBello In Nassau however we urge a different calculus The Republican Francis Purcell seeks reelection as County Executive after making very little of the job He opposes the Democrat John Matthews an insulation contractor who seems vigorous and knowledgeable but has not been politically tested Thus the election is probably best seen as a plebiscite on Long Islands Republican machine controlled by Joseph Margiotta A vote against Mr Purcell can usefully curb the machines excessive power and the often questionable uses thereof
KEAN: G.O.P. CANDIDATE WITH LIBERAL TENDENCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/26/nyregion/kean-gop-candidate-with-liberal-tendency.html,Second of two profiles of candidates for Governor of New Jersey By RICHARD J MEISLIN Thomas Howard Kean was to New Jersey politics born although it took him somewhat longer than his ancestors to decide that was the case His father Robert Winthrop Kean was a United States Representative from New Jersey for 20 years Both his grandfather Hamilton Fish Kean and hisgreat uncle John Kean served as United States Senators The late President Theodore Roosevelt was a cousin  on his fathers side  and earlier Kean ancestors include the first Governor of New Jersey William Livingston and five Colonial Governors before him In that light it seems only natural that Mr Kean is now running hard to become Governor of New Jersey despite the adverse odds facing a Republican in a state that has elected Democrats to the State House in six of the last seven elections The real question might be Why did Mr Kean who is now 46 years old wait so long A Late Change of Mind I thought the last thing in the world I would ever go into was politics the candidate explained the other day as he settled into the back seat of his dark green Riviera Mr Kean was shuttling from Ridgewood in northern New Jersey to Philadelphia by car because a light rain had grounded his helicopter This was just fine with the candidate since he abhors flying I wanted to be an academic and I was headed in that direction continued Mr Kean a graduate of the St Marks School and Princeton University He had dabbled in his fathers unsuccessful race for the United States Senate in 1958 the elder Mr Kean lost to Harrison A Williams but the political flu that unshakable belief that one belongs in public life  did not come until 1964 when he went to work in the campaign of William Scranton a family friend who was trying to get the Republican nomination for President Scranton of course didnt have a ghost of a prayer of a chance as everyone knew Mr Kean said But I got a very high position in the campaign A Goldwater Supporter As he recalled it a Scranton aide called and asked  Would you be able to pay your own way to San Francisco which was where the convention was I said yes and he said Good youre our national youth coordinator  He organized demonstrations for Mr Scranton outside the convention and when those inside selected Senator Barry Goldwater he worked for Mr Goldwater In the process he set aside his intentions of going back to Columbia University to complete a doctorate It was not until 1967 at the age of 32 however that Mr Kean made his first effort to put himself into political office At the urging of the Essex County Republicans he ran for Assembly and against considerable odds he won That same year he married Deborah Bye They now have twin sons Reed and Tom Jr 13 and a daughter Alexandra 7 And at about the time he married he took over the presidency of the Realty Transfer Company his familys land development concern Mr Kean quickly propelled himself into leadershp positions in the Legislature including eventually Assembly Speaker and he amassed a 10year legislative record of proposals  many of them successfully enacted into law quite at odds with what one might expect from a purebred Republican with a net worth of close to 2 million Impressive Legislative Record He sponsored legislation that created the State Department of Environmental Protection promoted programs of state aid for urban areas and for parents who needed help paying college tuition for their children pushed through restrictions on industrial development on the Atlantic and Delaware River shorelines introduced the states first rentcontrol bill and called for a ban on the cheap handguns known as Saturday night specials He left the Assembly in 1977 to make his unsuccessful run against Raymond H Bateman for the Republican nomination for Governor partly out of frustration of being in the minority partly out of interest in the job Now Mr Kean is running on a platform whose major plank involves slashing state taxes and revenues shrinking government and promoting business growth And while he is not disavowing his more liberal past he does not seem to be making a major point of it either A Fiscal Conservative Mr Kean acknowledges a change but says it is more a change in the times  a change in the matters on the publics mind  than a change in him I suspect Im somewhat more conservative he said the other day But Ive always been somewhat of a fiscal conservative And I dont think anybodys questioning my commitment to the areas Ive always been committed to But the concentration has been on this man with the Kennedylike accent espousing the economic policies of Ronald Reagan That Mr Kean said may be the fault of the dearth of electronic media coverage of the campaign New Jersey has no television stations of its own and relies on Philadelphia and New York City for its news  and on what newspapers are choosing to cover I spent most of the day the other day taking about toxic waste and the headlines of the stories I saw were jobs and taxes Mr Kean said I spent a day talking about urban enterprise zones in the cities a lot of the stories that day were jobs and taxes I put out a crime package of 15 points endorsed by a number of people who had served in the State Supreme Court and the top of the stories that day were jobs and taxes The attention given to jobs and taxes has drawn the attention of President Reagan and his Administration and that has been something of a mixed blessing Its great to have the support of the President Mr Kean said but its distracting to people  its another of Jim Florios smokescreens running against the Reagan Administration It has however forced Mr Kean to spend time drawing distinctions between himself and Mr Reagans policies He opposes efforts to cut transportation aid and Social Security his father helped develop the program he believes the defense budget should not be immune to further cuts he supports the Equal Rights Amendment and the Supreme Court decision giving women and their doctors the right to decide about abortions An Unexcitable Person Mr Kean paused flashing his easy slightly gaptoothed grin He has chronicled these difficulties the way he seems to do everything  in a quiet and understated way  without a hint of ire or frustration Those who have worked with him a long time say he is almost always like this and that to sense when he is truly angry or frustrated one must read it in his eyes Mr Keans niceguy attitude inspires both admiration and frustration in his aides It is what keeps him chatting with reporters after an appearance until he almost has to be physically removed by an assistant which gets him a friendly press but makes his scheduling people frantic it is also what keeps him from mounting a more direct and vociferous attack on his Democratic opponent Representative Florio which many feel could improve his chances of victory next week Among the ideas Mr Kean concedes he has not gotten across as well as he would like is that Mr Florios administration might become a continuation of Brendan Byrnes a connection that a recent New York Times poll showed could be devastating to the Democrats More often he will repeat that Im offering New Jersey a real change And about as far as he will go in attacking Mr Florio is to say I keep asking him Is there any program or any policy of Brendan Byrnes that you disagree with in any way Ive never gotten an answer to that The tone is more one of academic discourse than of political attack The academic still runs heavy in this politicians blood
"FOR MARGARET PAPANDREOU, A 'QUIET RAGE' OF FEMINISM",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/26/world/for-margaret-papandreou-a-quiet-rage-of-feminism.html,Margaret Papandreou believes her husbands new Socialist Government will mean a breakthrough for Greek women who she says have been largely suppressed through our capitalist system and our patriarchal mentality The Americanborn wife of Greeces new Prime Minister is a dedicated feminist a Socialist and the guiding inspiration behind the Womens Union of Greece Womens problems are the same in Greece as in most countries though maybe to a greater degree Mrs Papandreou said in a recent interview She emphasized the need to open more jobs to women set up more child care centers change the education system revise family laws and legalize abortions Greeces new First Lady is tall and blond with the unpretentious charm of a Midwestern farm girl She comes from Elmhurst Ill and studied journalism and public health at the University of Minnesota Papandreous Met in Minnesota It was there that she met and married an economics professor Andreas Papandreou in 1951 He had left Greece in 1940 before the invasion of Mussolinis troops and had gone to Harvard University where he obtained a doctorate in economics in 1943 Mr Papandreou became an American citizen in 1944 He served in the United States Navy for two years before going to the University of Minnesota to teach In 1955 the Papandreous moved to the University of California at Berkeley where he served as chairman of the Department of Economics Their four children were born in America

economics in Sussex England recently married and expects to get a job soon Nicholas 25 is studying for a doctorate in Princeton and Andreas Jr 23 is studying at the London School of Economics It was in 1959 that Andreas Papandreou decided to return to Greece his wife recalls Mr Papandreou who had gone back with Fulbright and Guggenheim grants was asked by Prime Minister Constantine Caramanlis to set up the Center of Economic Research in Athens He resumed his Greek citizenship won a seat in Parliament and was given a Cabinet post in the 1964 Government headed by his father Prime Minister George Papandreou Colonels Arrest Father and Son The rapidly growing influence and Socialist ideas of Andreas Papandreou were said to be among the main factors that prompted the 1967 colonels coup Both father and son were arrested George was released six months later and died the next year Andreas was charged with high treason kept in solitary confinement for eight months then released under a Christmas amnesty and expelled Andreas spent his seven years of exile as a professor of economics first at Stockholm University then York University in Toronto During his exile he organized the Pan Hellenic Liberation Movement a coalition of groups opposed to military dictatorship Mr Papandreou and his family returned to Greece in 1974 when the junta collapsed after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus He then founded the Pan Hellenic Socialist Movement called Pasok It grew in seven years from a small group with 13 percent of the vote and 12 seats in Parliament to become the major political force in the country with 48 percent of the vote and 172 seats in last Sundays election Margaret Taught Us Everything His wife started to build up the womens movement in 1975 Margaret taught us everything how to make a modern organization says Titina Pantazis a young woman who has just been elected on the Socialist ticket as deputy to the European Parliament She is the brains behind the womens union and has been elected president several times but always refuses preferring the post of vice president Mrs Papandreou says her main activity has been to mobilize women wherever they are  in the marketplaces beauty shops hospitals and particularly in the villages There are now chapters of the Womens Union all over Greece But theres still a strong belief that women belong at home she said More Women Candidates She is pleased that there were more women running in the last election  205 compared with only 103 in 1977  but she is disappointed that there were not many more And only 12 women  8 of them Socialists  were elected to the 300seat Parliament just two more than in the last Conservativedominated legislature Mrs Papandreou rarely appeared with her husband during the election campaign preferring to take part in womens rallies She went to Piraeus to show support for the actress Melina Mercouri who later won a seat in Parliament and has been named Minister of Culture and Sciences Miss Mercouri arrived at the rally late with a dramatic flourish wearing the partys green colors and stealing the show with slogans No to American Bases and Out With NATO Mrs Papandreou showed up quietly and on time In a correct if stilted Greek she made a strong plea for women to vote Socialist Weve had enough of high prices and high cost of living of this archaic educational system the lack of child care centers she said Weve had enough of living in areas where our relatives or friends die because of lack of doctors of hospitals of emergency treatment Weve had enough of Government bureaucracy and corruption of getting improper and dangerous abortions SecondClass Citizens She went on Weve had enough of being secondclass citizens always pushed to the margin never listened to never given rightful positions in decisionmaking bodies Militant men in the Socialist ranks generally approve of Mrs Papandreous discretion and say she has played an appropriate role concentrating on the Womens Union In a recent interview with a Greek newspaper Mrs Papandreou said she had been interested in womens rights ever since her high school days when she wanted to play on

"IN A REPLAY OF PRIMARY, GOLDIN'S INTEGRITY IS AGAIN A KEY ISSUE IN",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/27/nyregion/in-a-replay-of-primary-goldin-s-integrity-is-again-a-key-issue-in.html,CAMPAIGN FOR COMPTROLLER By FRANK LYNN In what amounts to a rerun of the Democratic primary campaign Richard Bernstein the Republican candidate for New York City Comptroller is trying to make Harrison J Goldins integrity and competence the central issue in the campaign As Assemblyman John C Dearie did before last months primary Mr Bernstein a Republican newcomer to politics has repeatedly brought up various investigations of the incumbent Mr Goldin He has also tried to tie him to the deterioration of the subway system as the official responsible for auditing city services The subways stink Mr Bernstein declares in one radio commercial Mr Goldin in turn has taken credit for putting the city on a surer fiscal footing and for instituting performance audits that check into the delivery and efficiency of city services Bernstein aides acknowledge the difficulty of rekindling voter interest in issues that were widely discussed in the primary The primary victory cleansed the guy said a Bernstein aide of Mr Goldin and Mr Dearie helped with the cleansing by endorsing the incumbent recently Three Citywide Races Despite that assessment the race is rated the closest of the contests for the three citywide offices of Mayor City Council President and Comptroller Mr Bernstein a wealthy selfmade businessman and owner of a realestate management concern at the age of 35 is mainly using radio and television commercials rather than traditional campaigning to make his integrity and efficiency points He has already spent more than any other New York City Republican candidate since John V Lindsay ran for Mayor He expects to spend a total of 1 million with threequarters of it devoted to advertising About 200000 of it is his own money Mr Bernsteins commercials have been running almost continuously for nearly four months he is now spending at least 100000 a week for television and 25000 a week for radio Mr Bernsteins chief campaign aides are business associates and friends except for Roger Stone who is serving as chief strategist and the SeverinAviles Associates media production concern Mr Stone ran Ronald Reagans campaign in New York State last year and is also a political consultant for Thomas H Kean the GOP candidate for Governor in New Jersey People Know Im Honest In an hourlong interview on the integrity question Mr Goldin said the various Federal and city investigations of him were infuriating when you are punctilious in your honesty But he added that he did not believe his reputation had been damaged and that he had no regrets about entering the roughandtumble of politics I believe that people know Im honest said the 45yearold onetime reform Democrat who was first elected to the State Senate in the Bronx before he was 30 I hope to continue my public career Reflecting his confidence that he is the frontrunner Mr Goldin had been off the air from the Sept 22 primary until last Friday when he began a 10day 150000 advertising campaign Mr Goldin has been running a lowbudget campaign except for his commercials which will account for about 750000 of the 1 million he is spending for the primary and election His chief advisors have been Steven Matthews who was an aide to former Senator Jacob K Javits Tony Schwartz an advertising specialist Richard Dressner a polling expert and Steven Newman the assistant city comptroller A Negative Commercial Despite his apparent lead Mr Goldin has one negative commercial that raises questions about Mr Bernsteins having lived in Westchester until last June his connection with the citys realestate industry and his lack of governmental experience Indeed in a debate last week on Columbia Universitys radio station WKCR Mr Goldin repeatedly referred to Mr Bernstein as a big landlord and a slick landlord Mr Bernstein in turn noted that Mr Goldin had received substantial contributions from the citys realestate interests A third candidate in the race William Powderly who has the endorsement of the Conservative and Right to Life Parties is a 56yearold bank vice president who is taking three weeks of vacation to campaign He said in an interview that he hoped to raise 50000 but meanwhile is running a spartan campaign with no paid staff or headquarters Mr Powderly who entered politics because of the abortion issue and is Brooklyn chairman of the Right to Life Party does not concentrate only on that issue although he will usually make the point that respect for life is a mark of a candidates character The candidate who describes himself as a middleoftheroader does not appear far removed ideologically from either of his opponents in their confrontations I want to prove to people that we are not rightists he said He is concentrating his street campaigning in many of the more conservative neighborhoods of Brooklyn Queens and Staten Island where the Conservative and Right to Life Parties are strongest Mr Powderly had hoped to obtain the Republican endorsement for Comptroller but GOP leaders turned instead to Mr Bernstein He had been a longtime friend and financial supporter of Vincent F Albano the late Manhattan Republican chairman and could raise money including his own  a rare asset for city Republican candidates

EXCERPTS FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REMARKS ON PLANS OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/30/us/excerpts-from-attorney-general-s-remarks-on-plans-of-justice-department.html,Following are excerpts from the remarks of Attorney General William French Smith to the Federal Legal Council in Reston Va today Simply put consistent with the Constitution and the laws of the United States the Department of Justice intends to play an active role in effecting the principles upon which Ronald Reagan campaigned Already there have been many significant changes We have proposed a comprehensive crime package of more than 150 administrative and legislative initiatives that would help to redress the imbalance between the forces of law and the forces of lawlessness We have proposed a new approach to immigration and refugee policy designed to reassert control over our own borders We have brought the Governments antitrust policies back to the real economic world by focusing upon truly anticompetitive activities rather than outmoded and exotic theories We have firmly enforced the law that forbids Federal employees from striking We have opposed the distortion of the meaning of equal protection by courts that mandate counterproductive busing and quotas We have helped to select appointees to the Federal bench who understand the meaning of judicial restraint As significant as all these changes are however they represent only a beginning Today I will discuss the next stage in this process We intend in a comprehensive way to identify those principles that we will urge upon the Federal courts And we intend to identify the cases in which to make our arguments  all the way to the Supreme Court We believe that the groundswell of conservatism evidenced by the 1980 election makes this an especially appropriate time to urge upon the courts more principled bases that would diminish judicial activism Policy Making by High Court It is clear that between Allgeyer v Louisiana in 1897 and Nebbia v New York in 1934 the Supreme Court engaged in and fostered judicial policymaking under the guise of substantive due process During this period the Court weighted the balance in favor of individual interests against the decisions of state and Federal legislatures Using the due process clauses unelected judges substituted their own policy preferences for the determinations of the publics elected representatives In recent decades at the behest of private litigants and even the executive branch itself Federal courts have engaged in a similar kind of judicial policymaking In the future the Justice Department will focus upon the doctrines that have led to the courts activism We will attempt to reverse this unhealthy flow of power from state and Federal legislatures to Federal courts and the concomitant flow of power from state and local governments to the Federal level Three areas of judicial policymaking are of particular concern First the erosion of restraint in considerations of justiciability Second some of the standards by which state and Federal statutes have been declared unconstitutional  and in particular some of the analysis of socalled fundamental rights and suspect classifications And third the extravagant use of mandatory injunctions and remedial decrees Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the Federal courts to the consideration of cases or controversies properly brought before them Nevertheless in recent years a weakening of the courts resolve to abide by the case or controversy requirement has allowed them greater power of review over Government action Often the Federal Government itself has in the past moved courts to show less deference to the boundaries of justiciability  in particular in environmental litigation Deferring to Elected Branches The Justice Department will henceforth show a more responsible concern for such questions We will assert the doctrine in those situations that involve any of its four elements  standing ripeness mootness and presence of a political question Vindicating the principle of justiciability would help return the courts to a more principled deference to the actions of the elected branches Just as courts have sometimes overstepped the proper bounds of justiciability their analyses of equal protection issues have often trespassed upon responsibilities our constitutional system entrusted to legislatures Through their determination of socalled fundamental rights and suspect classifications courts have sometimes succeeded in weighting the balance against proper legislative action In the 1942 case of Skinner v Oklahoma the Supreme Court first emphasized the concept of fundamental rights that invites courts to undertake a stricter scrutiny of the inherently legislative task of linedrawing In the nearly 40 years since then the number of rights labeled fundamental by the courts has multiplied They now include the First Amendment rights and the right to vote in most elections rights mentioned in the Constitution In addition however they include rights that though deemed fundamental were held to be only implied by the Constitution The latter group which has become a real base for expanding Federal court activity includes the right to marry the right to procreate the right of interstate travel and the right of sexual privacy that among other things may have spawned a right with certain limitations to have an abortion We do not disagree with the results in all of these cases We do however believe that the application of these principles has led to some constitutionally dubious and unwise intrusions upon the legislative domain The very arbitrariness with which some rights have been discerned and preferred while others have not reveals a process of subjective judicial policymaking as opposed to reasoned legal interpretation A Shift on Strict Scrutiny At the very least this multiplication of implied constitutional rights and the unbounded strict scrutiny they produce has gone far enough We will resist expansion And in some cases we will seek to modify the use of these categories as a touchstone that almost inevitably results in the invalidation of legislative determinations We will seek to modify especially the application of a strict scrutiny to issues whose very nature requires the resources of a legislature to resolve The extent to which the Federal courts have inappropriately entered legislative terrain can be seen most clearly and felt in their use of mandatory injunctions and attempts to fashion for perceived violations Throughout history the equitable powers of courts have normally reached only those situations a court can effectively remedy Implicit within that historical limitation is the recognition that some kinds of remedial efforts require resources and expertise beyond those of a Federal court even one aided by special masters Nevertheless Federal courts have attempted to restructure entire school systems in desegregation cases and to maintain continuing review over basic administrative decisions They have asserted similar control over entire prison systems and public housing projects They have restructured the employment criteria to be used by American business and government even to the extent of mandating numerical results based upon race or gender No area seems immune from judicial administration At least one Federal judge had even attempted to administer a local sewer system Budget Limitations Seen Ignored In the area of equitable remedies it seems clear that Federal courts have gone far beyond their abilities In so doing they have forced major reallocations of governmental resources often with no concern for budgetary limits and the dislocations that inevitably result from the limited judicial perspective In many of these cases the department will also seek to insure better responses to the problems at issue by the more appropriate levels and branches of government We have already begun that process in the case of busing and quotas both of which have largely failed as judicial remedies The Constitution directs the President to insure the faithful execution of the laws which forms the basis of the Attorney Generals litigating authority for the Government as a whole That constitutional command also requires the executive branch to defend measures duly enacted by the Congress even those with which the Administration does not agree Statutes with which we disagree are nevertheless the law of the land As such they must be defended against attack in the courts They must also be fully enforced by the executive branch when their validity and meaning are clear Some have suggested that this Administration intends to do less Others have suggested that this Administraton should do less Following the Constitution In fact the Department of Justice intends to do exactly what the Constitution requires  to enforce the laws duly and constitutionally enacted by the Congress If we were to do less we would ourselves be guilty of the same kind of transgressions that I have pledged we would combat on the part of the judiciary Under the Constitution the executive cannot unilaterally alter the clear enactments of Congress any more than the courts can When it disagrees with a law the executive branch can urge and support changes by the Congress In the case of laws that are clearly and indefensibly unconstitutional the executive can refuse to enforce them and urge invalidation by the courts When reasonable defenses are available we will defend a statute that does not intrude upon the powers of the executive branch That is our responsibility under the Constitution irrespective of our views on substantive policy In the case of ambiguous laws the executive can in good faith urge and pursue those interpretations that seem most consistent with the intentions of the Congress the policies of the Administration and the other laws of the land The executive can do all of these things but it can constitutionally do no more No one should doubt that this Administrations adherence to the constitutional principle of separation of powers will exact from us the same degree of obedience and moderation that we will urge upon the courts

"ATTORNEY GENERAL OUTLINES CAMPAIGN TO REIN IN COURTS; Excerpts from speech, page A22.",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/30/us/attorney-general-outlines-campaign-rein-courts-excerpts-speech-page-a22.html,Attorney General William French Smith accused the Federal courts today of constitutionally dubious and unwise intrusions upon the legislative domain and vowed to oppose such subjective judicial policymaking He said the Administration would seek greater judicial restraint in such areas as abortion rights school desegregation sexual and racial quotas in the workplace environmental protection and the constitutional rights of aliens and prisoners The groundswell of conservatism evidenced by the 1980 election makes this an especially appropriate time to urge upon the courts more principled bases that would diminish judicial activism Mr Smith said in a speech to the Federal Legal Council a group composed of top lawyers in various Federal departments and agencies The speech delivered in Reston Va and released here underlined the extent to which Mr Smith has committed the Justice Department to move the law of the land in the direction of President Reagans politics Active Role Planned Simply put consistent with the Constitution and the laws of the United States the Department of Justice intends to play an active role in effecting the principles upon which Ronald Reagan campaigned Mr Smith said Basic changes in public sentiment can still portend changing judicial philosophy he said He also quoted the humorist Finley Peter Dunnes observation 80 years ago that the Supreme Court follows the election returns Mr Smith stressed that the Administrations actions so far were only a beginning He cited legislative proposals to fight crime and illegal immigration the Administrations opposition to outmoded and exotic approaches to antitrust law and counterproductive busing and quotas and its appointment of judges who understand the meaning of judicial restraint Errors of the Past Mr Smith said his department was working to identify those key areas in which the courts might be convinced to desist from actual policymaking so that errors of the past might be corrected and past trends might at least be halted He spoke in generalities however and did not say whether the Administration would ask the Supreme Court to overrule its 1973 decision declaring a constitutional right to have an abortion or identify any other judicial precedents that he would like overturned Solicitor General Rex E Lee the Justice Departments top litigator said in an interview today that we have not singled out any specific cases to be overturned He said the primary effort would be to oppose further extension of judicial policymaking rather than to urge the courts to overrule past Supreme Court decisions that the Administration disagreed with The Attorney General also did not take a position on the push by conservatives in Congress to enact laws stripping the Supreme Court and the lower Federal courts of jurisdiction to decide cases involving abortion and school prayer and to order desegregation through busing Persuasive Approach The approach Mr Smith suggested would involve efforts to persuade the courts to take positions that the Administration has no power to enforce through executive action The Attorney General criticized the Federal courts particularly for these moves  Assuming greater power of review over governmental action on environmental protection and other issues by deciding cases that they could avoid under several doctrines that have customarily been used to avoid premature or unnecessary judicial intervention in politically sensitive matters  Undertaking extravagant efforts to restructure entire school systems in desegregation cases to take over entire prison systems and public housing projects and to force business and Government to achieve numerical results based upon race or gender in employment practices in ways that have forced major reallocations of governmental resources  Interpreting the Fourteenth Amendments guarantee of equal protection under the law in ways that have often trespassed upon responsibilities our constitutional system entrusted to legislatures by multiplication of implied constitutional rights and invalidation of laws that discriminate against aliens Decisions Questioned Mr Smith questioned in particular Supreme Court decisions declaring the right to marry the right to procreate the right of interstate travel and the right of sexual privacy that among other things may have spawned a right  with certain limitations  to have an abortion None of the rights that the Court has declared to be fundamental he said are mentioned in the Constitution The Justice Department under President Reagan has been accused from the left of bending legal principles to suit political objectives in several cases involving civil rights environmental protection and other issues It has also been attacked by some conservatives who say it lets legal niceties stand in the way of what they view as Mr Reagans political mandate Alluding to such criticisms Mr Smith said that while the department would interpret ambiguous laws in ways consistent with the policies of the Administration it would also uphold its constitutional duty to enforce acts of Congress it disagreed with except for laws that are clearly and indefensibly unconstitutional
Briefing,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/31/us/briefing-073695.html,T WO of the nations most conservative Senators Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Orrin G Hatch of Utah are locked in an unusual conflict over the abortion issue that has irritated the staffs of both Republicans The two Senators strongly oppose abortion but are seeking wholly different means to outlaw it Behind this some conservatives say is a simmering dispute over which of the two men will actually lead the antiabortion fight in the Senate Mr Helms is irritated at Mr Hatchs opposition to a bill that specifies that the life of each human being starts at conception thus giving fetuses rights under the Constitution Mr Hatch has said that he has serious constitutional reservations about the bill He prefers instead a constitutional amendment authorizing Congress and individual states to regulate abortions For the past few months Administration aides as well as others on both sides of the issue have assumed that the conception bill which was sponsored by Senator John P East of North Carolina a protege of Senator Helms had run aground because of the opposition by Mr Hatch and other conservatives In fact Mr Hatch as chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution is scheduled to start hearings on his own measure Suddenly Mr Helms has taken the highly unusual procedural move of placing a new abortion bill in fact the same one sponsored by Mr East on the Senate calendar therefore circumventing the committee process According to Senate conservatives the move is designed to place a little pressure on the leadership to move on the abortion question and perhaps more important to steal a little thunder from Mr Hatch whose aides were described as a little bit peeved M OMENTS after the Senates approval of the sale of Awacs planes and other air combat equipment to Saudi Arabia Prince Bandar bin Sultan lifted the phone in a thirdfloor room near the Senate chamber and called his uncle Crown Prince Fahd who is in Geneva for the current meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Prince Bandar a 32yearold pilot who speaks easily of Al and Dick for Secretary of State Alexander M Haig Jr and the national security adviser Richard V Allen played a key role in the Awacs lobbying effort here Prince Bandars triumphal news to his uncle was rather subdued and lowkeyed said Fred Dutton the lawyerlobbyist who represents the Saudis who was in the room with Prince Bandar They have a very low profile temperament A S if the Federal Bureau of Investigation didnt have enough to worry about along comes the problem of the Golden Eagle Not the bird the bar For years the bar and restaurant at 14th and I Streets has been a haven for agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration whose offices are in the same building It was not actually the hamburgers that the agents favored but the mood of conviviality that seemed to flow each day after work Along comes the FBI In recent weeks the Administration has been pursuing plans to place the Drug Enforcement Agency under FBI control and bureau agents have started moving into the drug agencys building The FBI officials concerned about the image of narcotics agents made it clear that spending lunch hours and nights at the Golden Eagle was hardly the same as well watching Todays FBI the new weekly television show Sadly and reluctantly numerous agents began passing up the Golden Eagle and the bars owner alarmed at the loss in business installed of all people topless dancers Abruptly business picked up and in the darkness one may even see a drug enforcement agent or two Waiting for Todays FBI of course I N Washington briefly John Hume leader of the predominantly Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party in Northern Ireland said an opportunity loomed now to break the deadlock in Ulster He cited the end of the hunger strike by Irish Republican Army prisoners the meetings next month of the British and Irish Prime Ministers and perhaps most significant a growing feeling within the British establishment itself that radical changes were necessary to end strife in the province Mr Hume said he foresaw perhaps a federation of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic guaranteeing rights to all religious groups If he is despondent about his province Mr Hume fails to show it The status quo just cant continue he said in a rising voice Two thousand dead 20000 maimed 5000 bombs It just cant go on Francis X Clines Bernard Weinraub
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND RULINGS OF FEDERAL COURTS; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/31/us/the-attorney-general-and-rulings-of-federal-courts-news-analysis.html,Attorney General William French Smiths attack on decisions by the Supreme Court and lower Federal courts in a speech yesterday was the most direct and wideranging by an incumbent Attorney General in recent memory It was a dramatic statement of one of the Administrations recurring themes That for too long liberal unelected Federal judges have trespassed upon responsibilities our constitutional system entrusted to legislatures at the Federal and state levels and that it is time to reverse this unhealthy flow of power as Mr Smith put it As such the speech prompted cries of outrage from such liberal groups as Common Cause the public affairs lobby and from such liberal professors as Laurence H Tribe of Harvard Law School who departed from character to brand the Attorney Generals speech as extraordinarily platitudinous and somewhat Neanderthal Administrations Plans Unclear Mr Smiths talk to the Federal Legal Council composed of the Administrations top lawyers left unclear however how far the Administration planned to carry its crusade against liberal court decisions Mr Smith acknowledged that the Federal courts were an independent branch of Government All that he proposed yesterday was to choose more conservative judges to fill vacancies to go into court to resist expansion of constitutional rights which the Supreme Court has defined in recent decades and to argue for correcting what he called errors of the past on a range of constitutional issues But Mr Smiths criticism of the Federal courts may add to an already potent push by forces on the right in Congress to strip judges of the power to enforce constitutional rulings that Congress and President Reagan do not like These include rulings on the constitutional right to have an abortion on statesponsored prayer in schools and on desegregation through courtordered busing This possibility brought from Archibald Cox the president of Common Cause and former Watergate Special Prosecutor and Solicitor General an expression of concern that Mr Smiths broadside attack upon the independence of our judiciary will give Congressional critics a rhetorical boost in their radical and unprincipled attempts to legislatively overturn Supreme Court decisions A similar statement was made by American Bar Association President David R Brink who deplored what he called attacks on the independence of the courts in protecting the rights of all our citizens against the changing policies of a transient majority Jurisdictional Drive Not Adopted But Mr Smith stopped conspicuously short yesterday of endorsing the technique of enacting laws to strip the courts of their jurisdiction in certain constitutional areas For months the Administration has avoided comment on this approach which many conservatives as well as liberals consider a threat to the system of governmental checks and balances that has evolved over two centuries The Attorney General knows however that the kind of jawboning he employed yesterday and which he proposes for the future cannot force the Federal courts to yield to the political groundswell of conservatism as he said they should do The Justice Departments legal arguments carry more weight with the Supreme Court and lower Federal courts than those of other litigants Cotton Dust Decision a Rebuff But the Administration received an unceremonious rebuff earlier this year for example when it urged the Supreme Court to order reconsideration of a regulation on worker exposure to cotton dust It made the request in light of the Administrations approach of weighing costs against benefits in enforcing such health and safety standards The Justices ruled that Congress had intended that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration protect workers from exposure to toxic substances to the greatest extent feasible without regard to a balance between costs and benefits This was a major setback for the Administrations regulatory approach The Justice Department exercises its greatest influence over the course of justice in America by deciding what kind of lawsuits to file in enforcing Federal laws and constitutional provisions Mr Smith repeated yesterday for example that his Justice Department wll not bring suits seeking school desegregation through busing or racial or sexual quotas to cure job discrimination But critics today focussed on the force of the Attorney Generals rhetorical attack on the Federal courts his suggestion that they should henceforth follow the election returns more closely and his declaration that the Department of Justice intends to play an active role in effecting the principles upon which Ronald Reagan campaigned Not since President Roosevelt tried to pack the Supreme Court in 1937 has there been such a blatant political attack on the independence of the Federal judiciary John Shattuck head of the American Civil Liberties Unions Washington office said today Mr Smiths speech took a political approach to the law more forthrightly and from farther to the right on that spectrum than any Attorney General has done in decades Liberals Reaction Is Strong The reaction of the liberals was correspondingly strong Harvards Mr Tribe for example said that what the Attorney General really proposes to do is turn back the clock to before the Bill of Rights to 1790He assailed in particular Mr Smiths suggestion that the Supreme Court had

'They Want to Be Babied Themselves',https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/01/opinion/they-want-to-be-babied-themselves.html,Births to unwed females in the United States went up 50 percent in the 1970s a shocking figure It encompasses realities that are even more so It is one thing for unmarried adult middleclass women to have babies But when the mothers are poor teenagers the consequences can be devastating for two generations The Urban Institute a leading social research center finds in an analysis of 1978 Census data that 29 percent of births to white teenagers and 83 percent of births to black teenagers occurred outside of marriage Likewise in New York City according to a recent report unwed mothers account for 75 percent of nearly 14000 births to teenagers Why Why do so many young girls want babies Doris McKelvy whose Manhattan agency provides sex education counseling and adoption services offers the prevailing professional view Many young girls in the central city live in such neglect and hopelessness that they are desperate for attention and affection They get pregnant often because they want to be babied themselves Yet often joy and excitement rapidly give way to confusion impatience and anger Frequently the child is abused but in a sense that is the least of it When the life chances of the childmothers are so dismal what can they be for the childrens children The nation needs to pay urgent attention and not only because the children of teenagers cost billions in welfare payments Reducing deprivation is a longrange answer Education can help But meanwhile the resources available for sex education and counseling are dwindling And the political resistance to such programs including the essential alternative of abortion is growing In other words as teenage illegitimacy increases remedies decrease To ignore the next generation in that way a society has to be either callous or stupid
"FUN DOLPHIN, SMART WHALE",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/01/books/fun-dolphin-smart-whale.html,EASY TRAVEL TO OTHER PLANETS By Ted Mooney 278 pp New York Farrar Straus  Giroux 1195 THE BOOK OF REVELATIONS By Rob Swigart 278 pp New York E P Dutton 1350 TED MOONEYS first novel Easy Travel to Other Planets opens with a scene in which a dolphin named Peter makes love to a woman If you jump to the conclusion that the book is commercial sleaze intended for those who buy their fiction at the supermarket you are wrong Mr Mooneys intentions are serious But this opening presents a problem As women breathe ventrally dolphins dorsally and the deed takes place in the water it occurred to me that both partners would have trouble inhaling Mr Mooneys description is vague Peter makes faint quacking sounds and she herself begins to murmur He is concentrating utterly on the effort of keeping his movements to human scale she the fragile one is aware of his restraint Then there are gnomic Joycean headlines always a tipoff of a serious artist Heres how one such passage titled Second Lunar Utterance begins She is lying in the center of an enormous bed crying The bed is so large that she cannot see any of its edges At one of them her father is standing Where is her crib Where is her room Where is her mother She continues to cry Her father continues to stand  He hands her one of her blocks He says something with his mouth Well what else could he say something with He hasnt got a blowhole like Peter What there is of a plot consists of your basic shedonehimwrong love triangle with the damaged party the one in fins Melissa cant decide between Peter the dolphin located in the Virgin Islands and her boyfriend Jeffrey in New York Jeffrey cant decide between Melissa and Clarice whos stuck between him and her husband The dolphin you see is a kind of aquatic Piers Plowman locking hands with which to wield weapons and strike typewriter keys Peter is heir to the sustained oral mythos of his species When bewildered by his human captors who are ostensibly trying to communicate with him verbally he sort of swims in place and contemplates these finny sagas If only we could understand him there might not have to be a nuclear war in Antarctica  historys biggest snowball fight  biggest and last People might not fall down in the streets suffering from information sickness Another way you can tell Mr Mooney is a real litterateur is that one of his human characters is dying of cancer and the others are all wasting away with despair Humans in this novel drive BMWs skydive smoke dope and spend large amounts of time in airports But nothing makes them happy Take Nicole Nicole has a TWA pass and a Cuban boyfriend who threatens her with a pistol shes had five abortions and flies from New York to Los Angeles just to see her gynecologist Sure enough shes pregnant but she cant make herself go through it again Will Diego shoot her Melissa introduces her to Peter and the dolphin diagnoses her condition with his sonar He thinks she should be happy But hes starting to figure these humans out He was coming to sense that many objects could be named in the womans language  but that nothing held them together more and more this confused him Her energetically feeble movements as she swam toward him now sent a shimmer of sadness through his skin There is nothing Peter can do about it and thats the final test of seriousness these days Easy Travel to Other Planets has a sad ending I wont give it away but its a real downer In Rob Swigarts The Book of Revelations dolphins are wiser than people too but not half as profound as elephants and killer whales I mean orcas Killer whale you see is a highly prejudicial term quite as if we called ourselves killer primates Anyhow when Cassie Cassandra St Clair of the Palo Alto think tank called Investigate the Future blimps down to San Diego just before the end of the present century to get some opinions from thinking mammals living in a different kind of tank about the Dead Liberation Front she gets nowhere with the dolphins although they approve of her shape in a bathing suit and dally awhile in amorous play Why should we think about it the beasts wonder You should ask the orca orcas think about things like that So she asks an orca She also asks him about the prediction made by Madame Glabro shes the wellknown psychic cult leader of the DLF  that the world will end in less than a week Cassie  a very left hemisphere person  Language logic thats the stuff for me No psychic talent or no belief anyway  has started having these very righthemisphere visions armies clashing in the dust smoking altars UFOs earthquakes and fires that sort of thing But the orca like most prophets chants riddles We returned to the sea long ago  Many millions of years in your numbers During the time of dreaming when the universe made itself and fixed the cycles set custom We must all maintain the dreaming Then he winks Cassie doesnt know what to make of it at first but her boss back in Palo Alto tries to rush her so we get dialogue like this Ive been up since six and talking to whales and dolphins all day I need some time to think it over And before she can file her report she needs to hear some sagas from an ancient elephant Then the fogs begin Portents omens and signs are everywhere The President spots a UFO The CIA and the Defense Department or somebody pretending to be them are tailing Cassie Madame Glabro gets a Time cover and appears on the Today show The No 1 hit record is a technorock dirge called The Death of the Large Mammals Wayne Millet mysterious founder of the DLF now called the DeathLife Foundation for public relations purposes makes an appearance But our heroine beginning to wonder if she isnt psychic after all stands firm Uhuh No My right hemisphere is not going to help you Mr Millet Like most authors obsessed with coincidence and magic Mr Swigart has no interest in individual human character His idea of creating narrative suspense is to hang portentous rhetorical questions on every other page Will the world end or wont it Thats pretty much what the story amounts to Most readers will find it difficult to care Then there is the matter of style The dust jacket tells us Mr Swigart has been compared to Jonathan Swift an 18thcentury author with a reputation for lucid prose But here is a characteristic sample of Swigartian prose Time now fluid now static once temporary then jumping quantumlike the moment both particle and wave laps at the shore of awareness recedes tunnels again advances in its own terms and awareness follows as on a lead leashed to those fragments of time and event Midnight was one moment paused passed on Moment to moment Ends of sentences May or may not have anything to do with beginnings Syntactically But should we worry about such things even now at the end beginning of time Every writer is all writers are all writers and so on for eons since Homer was a pup Who wasnt a writer either But who chanted sagas Did Homer speak to the orca Could be Or maybe not Dream vision Vision dream

'ABORTION IS A QUESTION OF RIGHT AND LAW',https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/01/opinion/l-abortion-is-a-question-of-right-and-law-074491.html,To the Editor The letter by Profs Mark N Cohen and Roy S Malpass defending abortion as one means of limiting population A Right to Life Unacknowledged by Nature Oct 23 is a striking example of inferential irrelevance Much of what the professors say is true Little of it pertains to the question at issue  unless humans are to be considered ethically indistinguishable from nonhuman animals or unless all human acts are ethically indifferent or acceptable It is unlikely that the writers do not so distinguish that they do not distinguish between the intentional killing of a child and of a kitten or between the contractual exchange of goods and theft or between dispute by litigation and by homicide If they indeed do not distinguish then in the interest of social control of population they should be prepared to defend infanticide and geronticide Perhaps they are The question is not whether social control of population is licit but whether a human life once begun can licitly be terminated except for grave criminal culpability something that is difficult to attribute to an unborn child Unfortunately the writers cite or allude to none of the overwhelming evidence that life does not begin at conception but rather shift the argument to the civil protection of the fetus a matter entirely different Many physicians and biologists have in fact asserted that fetal life is human life surely before the stage of development at which it can now be legally terminated in the United States If the question of abortion is reduced to a question of mammalian reproductive potentiality and control it is no longer a question of right and law But abortion among humans is a question of right and law Professors Cohen and Malpass should be reminded that though they think the legal protection of human life commonly begins at birth it has been applied to fetal life in the societies gentile as well as Jewish from which we inherit much of our ethics our religions our law We need not seek instruction in infanticide or abortion from other societies for such mammalian behavior was practiced by Greeks and Jews as by most other peoples What they taught us what we have learned from them is not that such acts were part of human behavior but that they were immoral and criminal JOHN ILLO Shippensburg Pa Oct 24 1981
Ideas and Trends; A Case Against Family Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/01/weekinreview/ideas-and-trends-a-case-against-family-court.html,If statistics count for anything an increasing number of American women are saying that men not husbands compatability not marriage are the prerequisites for bearing children Unfortunately the numbers also indicate that among teenage women there is often no prerequisite at all Pregnancy is simply the result of ignorance and misinformation The Federal Census Bureau reported last week that births to unwed women doubled in the last decade and that one in every six American babies was born to an unmarried woman Among adult women experts say the increase of babies born to unwed mothers is largely a result of women waiting longer before they marry and a growing acceptance of unwed women who keep children rather than opting for abortion or adoption In 1979 the most recent year for which comprehensive statistics were compiled an estimated 597800 babies were born to unwed mothers 262700 of them to women under 20 years of age Among teenagers 15 to 19 the figure was 253200 Its a rather alarming statistic said Dr Kristin Moore senior research assistant at the Urban Institute More and more teenagers are having sex and having it more frequently but many of them dont know the first thing about birth control A recent survey of sexual activity among metropolitan teenagers indicated that only 18 percent of teenage women who became impregnated intended to do so The survey conducted by researchers at Johns Hopkins University reported that among the 82 percent of women who did not intend to become pregnant 685 percent did not use contraception

ATTORNEY GENERAL URGES 'JUDICIAL RESTRAINT',https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/01/weekinreview/attorney-general-urges-judicial-restraint.html,THE groundswell of conservatism evidenced by the 1980 election makes this an especially appropriate time to urge upon the courts more principled bases that would diminish judicial activism Attorney General William French Smith told a group of Government lawyers last week Mr Smith referred to judicial restraint  in matters such as abortion and school desegregation  for which President Reagan campaigned and Mr Smith said his department will now work He did not specify actions to be taken Excerpts of his speech follow  In recent decades Federal courts have engaged in judicial policymaking The Justice Department will focus upon the doctrines that have led to the courts activism We will attempt to reverse this unhealthy flow of power from state and Federal legislatures to Federal courts and the concomitant flow of power from state and local governments to the Federal level Three areas of judicial policymaking are of particular concern First the erosion of restraint in considerations of justiciability court jurisdiction Second some of the standards by which state and Federal statutes have been declared unconstitutional  and in particular some of the analysis of socalled fundamental rights and suspect classifications And third the extravagant use of mandatory injunctions and remedial decrees The number of rights labeled fundamental by the courts has multiplied They include rights that were held to be only implied by the Constitution such as the right to marry the right to procreate the right of interstate travel and the right of sexual privacy that may have spawned a right with certain limitations to have an abortion The extent to which the Federal courts have inappropriately entered legislative terrain can be seen most clearly and felt in their attempts to fashion equitable remedies for perceived violations Federal courts have attempted to restructure entire school systems in desegregation cases They have asserted similar control over entire prison systems and public housing projects They have restructured the employment criteria to be used by American business and government even to the extent of mandating numerical results based on race and gender No area seems immune from judicial administration  David R Brink president of the American Bar Association said in a statement he deplored attacks on courts for protecting the rights of all our citizens against the changing policies of a transient majority
27 EXPERTS GIVE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR PRESIDENCY'S ILLS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/02/nyregion/27-experts-give-prescriptions-for-presidency-s-ills.html,Twentyseven men most of them distinguished lawyers and historians gathered in Manhattan over the weekend to discuss whether constitutional changes might be needed to let a President govern effectively Although the participants were nearly all Democrats  and although many thought Presidential impotence had been a far graver problem under Jimmy Carter than it seemed to be under Ronald Reagan  they agreed that fundamental changes in world affairs communications the American citizenry and the power of Congress had made it harder for a President to carry out a coherent program In all a sense of gloom for Government permeated the meeting The conference organized by Arthur M Schlesinger Jr the historian met all day Saturday at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York on West 42d Street Its principal speakers were Lloyd N Cutler Counsel to the President in the Carter Administration C Douglas Dillon President John F Kennedys Secretary of the Treasury and George E Reedy one of President Lyndon B Johnsons press secretaries In such company learned anecdotes abounded Burke and Bagehot Sam Rayburn and Dean Acheson John Jay and LBJ all were discussed briefly The Constitution Woodrow Wilson whose ideas on reform were much in evidence once said is not honored by blind worship History Emerson had said earlier has baked our cake Changes Mentioned In the interests of responsible government Mr Cutler and others argued the Constitution might need to be amended to allow the President more freedom to carry out a consistent program of economic and international policies Among the amendments or other changes mentioned  some modeled on parliamentary systems  were allowing the President to dissolve Congress letting Congress call special Presidential elections letting Congressmen also become Cabinet members and letting the President write law within broad Congressional mandates Several speakers recommended that if amending the Constitution were impossible political parties should be strengthened and election schedules tightened Other speakers denied that such legal reforms were needed and criticized their proponents as trying to revive an imperial Presidency and failing to understand the roots of political power and effective leadership Most seemed to agree though that something was amiss at the summit of American Government Mr Cutler for example arguing that even President Reagans recent legislative victories would succumb to stalemate said Its the rare television personality that can last two years much less four A Nationwide Campaign Few who wanted the Constitution amended were hopeful that it could be done to their liking They noted that a nationwide campaign to call the first constitutional convention since 1787 had quietly been picking up the support of many states and that if goodgovernment liberals wanted a convention to deal with matters besides balanced budgets and abortion they would have to prepare themselves The meeting was the first Thomas K Finletter Conference and was supported by the Finletter Fund Mr Finletter who died last year was an international lawyer and diplomat and the author of among other studies Can Representative Government Do the Job In addition to Mr Schlesinger the Albert Schweitzer Professor of the Humanities at City Universitys Graduate School members of the panel included James MacGregor Burns political scientist and historian of the Presidency at Williams College the historian Henry Steele Commager of Amherst College Richard N Goodwin author and former assistant to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson Charles Hamilton professor of political science at Columbia University the economist Carl Kaysen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Representative Henry S Reuss Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee and other prominent scholars editors and officials In an article published last year in the quarterly Foreign Affairs Mr Cutler joined Mr Finletter in praising certain aspects of parliamentary governments like Britains In the article Mr Cutler elaborated his view that because we do not form a government the way parliamentary systems do we have no overall program at all At the meeting Mr Cutler suggested that the power of the President might be augmented by the institution of a single sixyear Presidential term an idea favored by Presidents Dwight D Eisenhower Johnson and Carter and the lineitem veto  an executive check on legislation that is permitted by some states but not by the Federal Constitution Objections to Thesis Objections to Mr Cutlers thesis varied Some said a disciplined party system simply could not be revived and Mr Reedy recalling Northern bossism and Southern segregation declared that he was glad to see the tight party system go Others appeared to say that basic political and social changes were needed more than consitutional tinkering

"Justice, Reaganized",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/03/opinion/justice-reaganized.html,The independent Federal judiciary is one of the glories of American government but that doesnt impress Attorney General William French Smith He wishes to press the election returns on the Federal courts The Department of Justice intends to play an active role in effecting the principles upon which Ronald Reagan campaigned he said in a policy address last week That means turning the courts away from their constitutionally dubious and unwise intrusions onto legislative turf It was a politicizing polarizing speech  at a time when the courts and the Constitution can use support The Attorney General criticizes the Federal courts on several fronts He intends to show a more responsible concern than his predecessors for arguments that limit the role of the courts Its a gratuitous insult to past Justice Departments elevating matters of tactics to the level of ideology Which of his predecessors ever failed to argue for instance that a citizen trying to sue Uncle Sam lacked legal standing or sued too soon or too late Mr Smith also dislikes the way Federal judges have deemed as basic some rights not enumerated in the Constitution True that document does not spell out the right to marry the right to travel between states the right to sexual privacy the limited right to an abortion But such rights are hardly alien to the Constitution The right to interstate travel is in its very marrow must there be an amendment to make it explicit To specify all the rights fundamental to modern life would require expanding the nations basic charter into a telephone book Mr Smith contends further that the Federal courts have ranged far beyond their abilities in asserting control over schools prisons and other institutions Many will join in deploring court entanglement in daytoday matters that local officials ought to handle But what Mr Smith does not address is why judges entered those thickets in the first place usually because public officials crudely violated someones rights to equal and decent treatment What should the courts do in the face of continued obduracy by such officials Mr Smith offers little in the way of effective remedies The Attorney General of the United States is no ordinary litigant in the nations courts He is an officer of the courts sworn to uphold them and work for evenhanded nonpolitical justice One way to do that duty would be to defend the courts against current attempts to strip their authority in cases involving abortion prayer and school desegregation He could tell Congress what his entire department realizes that the present danger is not what the Federal courts do but what some zealots would do to them

But going from flat to high and back again in the evening made my calves and arches ache Daily jaunts in sneakers taught me the subversive joy of unbound feet I would no longer suffer for beauty Ive been seduced by comfort I told my mother Thats no excuse she answered There are rewards for renouncing glamour I see sights on my flatfooted trek from West 84th Street through Central Park down Fifth Avenue and over to Broadway and 40th that are seen only by walkers Last year I was busy and forgot to look at fall this year there is no such danger Fall dazzles me each morning in the park I am overcome by light Trees wear fuzzy yellow halos Bushes burn red Never before have I appreciated this flamboyant season From the end of August to the end of November I used to mourn the passing of summer Now a walker I am enthralled by a cool gust of wind pushing me along a sunny thoroughfare My quick pace slows when I arrive at the Mall  a corridor that extends from the Bethesda Fountain south to 65th Street The walk satisfies an archaic longing for beauty that is orderly and civilized the wide path is lined with statuary and even rows of arching elms On the west side are figures of Samuel Morse the American painter and tinkerer who invented the telegraph Beethoven and Robert Burns On the east side are figures of FitzGreene Halleck an American writer of comic verse who worked for many years as the private secretary to John Jacob Astor and Sir Walter Scott Where the walk opens out Shakespeare and Columbus face each other There is no conflict on this path between art and science and commerce I pick up speed after I cross the 65th Street transverse On the downhill road the suffering runner hobbles toward me I see him almost every day He runs on his ankles as if he has been shot in both feet He wears yellow shorts cut high on his leg and he is barechested even at this time of year Sweat makes his grayish hair lie flat on his scalp His face expresses pain and nothing else Once out of the park I check the clock in front of the Sherry Netherland 26 minutes from 84th Street on the West Side to 59th Street on the East  not bad I circle a derelict who sits on the sidewalk near the Plaza Hotel examining his leg ulcers I hurry anticipating the windows at Bergdorf Goodman I am eager to take another look at the sleek black and bronze metallic torsos swinging in gymnastic poses connected by yards of white plastic umbilical tubing but when I arrive at the corner the display is gone Bergdorfs changes its windows too often At 57th Street I must decide Should I walk down the east side of Fifth or the west Both sides have wooden shafts and scaffolding to protect passersby from construction debris I dont like those enclosed passageways As an act of disdain for the Trump Tower I choose the west side Waiting for the light at 55th I look at a man who left Central Park as I did We have been traveling more or less in tandem for 10 blocks He is of medium height swarthy with a thin mouth he is wearing a welltailored navy blue blazer and carries a black leather satchel The light changes He steps off the curb I step off the curb I keep my eyes on this man I adjust to his pace We make the next light We pass a woman wearing a Tshirt that says Stop Abortion Go Gay The man speeds up I speed up too He misses the light when he bends to tie his shoe so I must return to the northern curb I decide he is a spy carrying state secrets in his bag Perhaps I am the only person who can prevent the transfer of American nuclear secrets to Libya At 47th Street the spy slips into the Jewelry Exchange A diamond dealer whose business is intrigue What a cheap imagination I have At 44th Street I pass another clock 60th to 44th in 14 minutes  not as fast as yesterday I try not to be compulsive about how fast or how far I walk one Sunday I did 14 miles but I fail How humbling it is to discover in me traits I find so dumb in others At 42d Street I swing right and stop at the bread and cheese store I pick out a crusty roll and a Granny Smith apple and tell young Angelo who is deep in conversation with his cousin Frank what cheese I want I cut by Bryant Park and take the back entrance into 1440 Broadway Fiftyfive minutes from door to door including the stop for provisions  not bad Food without guilt I told my friend Denise as I unwrapped my lunch

CATHOLIC BISHOPS FOR AMENDMENT ALLOWING STATES TO BAN ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/06/world/catholic-bishops-for-amendment-allowing-states-to-ban-abortions.html,The National Conference of Catholic Bishops today endorsed a constitutional amendment that would empower Congress and individual states to adopt laws regulating and banning abortion In the past the bishops while favoring an outright ban on abortion have not endorsed specific legislation Their new position supporting the amendment proposed by Senator Orrin G Hatch was presented in testimony in the Senate The bishops said that they believed sweeping antiabortion measures could not pass Congress now and that it was better to back an achievable solution in the words of Archbishop John R Roach president of the bishops conference There is a strong urgency to get something the archbishop said The Hatch amendment has a real possibility of passing Testimony by Cardinal Cooke Terence Cardinal Cooke of New York also testified making a rare appearance on Capitol Hill as a witness The Cardinal who is chairman of the Bishops Conference Committee for Prolife Activity argued that the Supreme Court decision of 1973 upholding the right to abortion had rendered defenseless before the law millions of the unborn and has created a system of selective justice where some members of society decide who will live and who will die The Cardinal said that situation had become a national scandal and that legislative action was necessary Archbishop Roach said that the church had made a change in game plan and was now backing specific legislation because of the cumulative horror of elective abortions He said that the bishops had discussed the amendments available and believed that the Hatch amendment was the one we ought to support As advanced by Senator Hatch a Utah Republican the amendment now backed by the bishops would overturn the Supreme Court decision In an attempt to win over wavering votes however Mr Hatchs amendment does not ban abortion but leaves the matter to legislative action by Congress or individual states Its not going to be easy lets be honest said Senator Hatch who presided over the hearing today as chairman of the Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on the Constitution But we have a pretty darn good chance of getting this amendment through the Senate Ranks Are in Disarray One obstacle facing the Hatch amendment however is that antiabortion forces remain divided over the best road to take One faction favors the socalled human life amendment which would outlaw abortion in virtually all cases except to save the life of the mother But any constitutional amendment must receive twothirds of the vote in each house of Congress plus the approval of threequarters of the states Since this is a difficult task another faction has proposed legislation that would by simple statute declare that life begins at the moment of conception This would have the effect of defining abortion as murder Clearly the signals out there are telling us that the ranks are seriously split on this issue inside and outside the Senate said an aide to the Senate leadership They are really not together at this point to push ahead with a single piece of legislation Moreover while Senator Hatch portrays his bill as a compromise it is still opposed by forces that favor giving each woman a choice on the question of abortion A group called Catholics for a Free Choice for instance held a news conference today asserting that the bishops represent a minority position among American Catholics Opposition Cites Polls Patricia McMahon the executive director of the group said that in public opinion polls a majority of Roman Catholics generally favored legalized abortion We speak on behalf of the mainstream of American Catholics she said Mary Gordon a novelist and critic noted that Cardinal Cooke was at the hearing today Its scary said Miss Gordon for a Catholic girl from New York to stand up to Cardinal Cooke I had to remember St Teresa of Avila who defied bishops over what she thought was right Senator Patrick J Leahy Democrat of Vermont reflected the sizable resistance to the Hatch proposal when he told the hearing that a constitutional amendment should be passed only in the rarest of circumstances Mr Leahy also chided conservatives who oppose abortion while slashing social programs that aid children The right to life he said should also refer to the quality of life after an infant is born Commitment by Baker Under pressure from conservatives Howard H Baker Jr the Senate majority leader has made a firm commitment to allow antiabortion forces to bring legislation to the floor this year after major economic bills are passed But the lack of time and the continued disagreement among abortion foes could put off the debate until next year The Catholic bishops testimony was supported by Dr Adrian Rogers former president of the Southern Baptist convention who asserted The basic requirements of moral decency require the rejection of abortion Dr Rogers conceded that evangelical Christians were Johnnycomelatelies to the abortion battle and added Im more and more optimistic that abortion will not be seen as a narrow Catholic issue Two rabbis at the hearing took opposite viewpoints Rabbi Seymour Siegal of the Jewish Theological Seminary backed the Hatch amendment by arguing that Jewish tradition teaches a bias for life Rabbi Henry Seigman executive director of the American Jewish Congress said that Rabbi Siegals argument begs the question because at times two lives the life of the fetus and the life of the woman come into conflict Jewish tradition the rabbi argued comes down squarely on the side of the mothers life
PATERNITY SUIT FOCUSES ON FEMINISM AND FREEDOM,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/06/nyregion/paternity-suit-focuses-on-feminism-and-freedom.html,Frank Serpico and Karen DeCrow would be an unlikely team in any court of law but the scene in Family Court in Manhattan yesterday was even more improbable Miss DeCrow a prominent feminist and former president of the National Organization for Women is defense counsel in a paternity action brought by Mr Serpicos former lover Should Miss DeCrow prevail Mr Serpico will not be required to provide child support to the unmarried mother of his yearold son Her posture in the case has angered some feminists But Miss DeCrow and her client who contends he was deceived into fathering a child he never wanted say they are simply fighting for the principles with which they have always been identified For Miss DeCrow now a Syracuse lawyer the objective is true equality between the sexes For Mr Serpico the policeman whose disclosures of corruption within the New York City Police Department led to the creation of the Knapp Commission in 1969 the cause is nothing less than freedom of choice freedom of expression and the freedom to listen to my inner self I am the Victim I know the public thinks Theres the father walking away  Mr Serpico declared Thats nonsense I am the victim in this case I am the one whose rights have been abused Last month Mr Serpico won a largely favorable ruling from Judge Nanette Dembitz of Family Court who held that the childs mother should be required to support the child if her funds are adequate Yesterdays hearing was held to determine whether the woman an airline stewardess known in the argot of Family Court only as L Pamela P had sufficient resources for the task Though he still disputes paternity Mr Serpico acknowledges having had sexual intercourse with Miss P in the fall of 1979 He claims however that she fraudulently assured him she was taking birth control pills when she was in fact trying to conceive a child and was then at the most fertile period of her menstrual cycle Pamela P bore a son on March 15 1980 and according to Judge Dembitz Mr Serpicos paternity was established clearly and convincingly by the courtauthorized Human Leukocyte Antigen bloodmatching test The relationship was purely sexual and I had absolutely no emotional involvement with the woman Mr Serpico said I was used as a sperm bank A Range of Arguments In their defense of Mr Serpico Miss DeCrow and her cocounsel in the case Alan H Levine of the New York firm of Clark Wulf  Levine employed doctrines as old as the common law of fraud and as new as the Constitutional right to privacy  arguments that had never previously prevailed in a paternity case They contended it was unconscionable for New York State to require payments from anyone deceived and entrapped into becoming the unwilling biological father of a child And they cited several other instances  the improper denial of visitation rights artificial insemination without spousal consent knowing entry into a void marriage or conception because of negligence of doctors or pharmacists  in which courts have ruled that  support will not be imposed on a parent His lawyers argued further that any support order would deny Mr Serpico his constitutional right to choose whether or not to become a parent  a right established in the last 10 years by United States Supreme Court in cases authorizing the availability of contraceptives and abortion That right the lawyers contended applied to men as well as to women Stephen M Harnick counsel for L Pamela P dismissed these arguments as totally absurd He cited sources as disparate as the Family Court Act and the commentaries of Sir William Blackstone who wrote more than 200 years ago that parents necessarily enter into a voluntary obligation to endeavor as far as in them lies that the life which they have bestowed shall be supported and preserved Punishment and Protection Mr Harnick a lawyer with Wachtell Manheim  Grouf argued that the paternity statutes are designed to punish putative fathers for their sins  and deter promiscuity as well as to protect the welfare of the illegitimate child But on Oct 1 Judge Dembitz held for Mr Serpico Petitioners wrong precludes her transfer to him of her financial burden for the child she alone chose to bear she wrote It was Miss DeCrow said a victory for feminists as well as fathers Logical Feminist Position Just as the Supreme Court has said that women have the right to choose whether or not to be parents men should also have that right said Miss DeCrow who advocated the same position in her 1974 book Sexist Justice Men should not automatically have to pay for a child they dont wantshe said Its the only logical feminist position to take Judge Dembitz contended however that Mr Serpico could still be required to provide some support should the mother be unable to meet the childs fair and reasonable needs According to Miss DeCrow the mother is middle class the kind of person who could be living on the Upper West Side Miss Ps lawyer Mr Harnick said however that Miss P has a very meager income and very few assets Mr Harnick said his client would appeal Judge Dembitzs decisions regardless of the outcome of the child support question Her factual findings reflect very badly on the mother he said We deny there was any deception This was an ongoing relationship and not a onenight stand Feminist Controversy In the meantime the opinion continues to generate controversy among some feminist lawyers including Marjory D Fields cochairman of the Governors Task Force On Domestic Violence The assumption of the risk is on a fertile person engaging in intercourse she said If he were that opposed to having children he should have been sterilized Miss Fields asserts that the issue of deceit is irrelevant where the welfare of a child is concerned and is degrading to women as well This case is almost a classic antiwoman presentation that women seduce and entrap men with their feminine wiles she said Both Miss Fields and Phyllis Gelman of the National Center on Women and Law contended that Judge Dembitzs opinion sanctioned precisely the kind of government intrusion into private relationships that women have sought through the courts to avoid Ruling in California Their reasoning was echoed by an appellate court in California last year in a decision that relied upon the same privacy precedents cited by Mr Serpicos lawyers to hold misrepresention irrelevant in a paternity case As a matter of public policy the practice of birth control if any engaged in by two partners in a consensual sexual relationship is best left to the individuals involved free from any government interference the court held For the last seven years Mr Serpico has lived on a farm he owned in Holland He spent the time he says writing studying animal and child behavior and observing nature  tasks he calls his lifes work Having grown disillusioned with material possessions and the concept of private property however he recently returned to the United States where he hopes to travel and lecture Mr Serpico says his opposition to parenthood is philosophical I would gladly accept full responsibility for this child or any other child if I was given the opportunity to allow the child free expression he said In this society children dont have any rights Theyre not consulted about what they want to eat or what school they want to go to or what they want to study As for his son he has never seen him outside of the present court hearings and is unsure what relationship if any they will have in the future If he wants to see me independently Ill treat him just like any other human being he said I dont believe you should leave a wad of dough to some kid because hes your son

Stage View; DURANG'S 'SISTER' IS MALICIOUS FUN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/08/theater/stage-view-durang-s-sister-is-malicious-fun.html,Christopher Durang does not yet seem to me to be a playwright who can establish a comic level and stick with it until his work is done Nonetheless its got to be said that his Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You which has now extended its run at Playwrights Horizons until New Years is a startlingly funny piece of work What I find most curious about it is that it is startlingly funny for precisely so long as it clings stubbornly and passionately to the record inventing almost nothing Sister Mary Ignatius runs a rigorously informative fifth grade at a parochial school called Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow The school proves to be well named and yes Mr Durang manages eventually to get a laugh out of that There is hellfire burning fiercely in this confident nuns breast and once in a while she seems more nearly to relish the flames than to fear them But she is not exactly a moral terrorist taking sadistic pleasure in using her pointer as though it were potentially a whip She is ever so simply and ever so benevolently cowing her charges for their very own good She would rather bestow cookies on them for getting the Sixth Commandment right than scatter anathemas about too freely of course she has the anathemas ready just in case In reality she is not a willful ogre but a literalist a wildly strict logician You cant fault her conclusions if you can buy her premises And so as she knowingly flips over a chart devoted to the Sun Moon and Earth  about which she has told her pupils and us absolutely nothing her eyes brim with glittering delight as she reveals a map of Heaven Hell and Purgatory Purgatory I would think is her baby being a place of substantial punishment with a delayed promise of hope at the end of it She is quite specific about the delay any one of us can expect to be there supposing ourselves lucky enough to get there and not somewhere worse from a rockbottom minimum of 300 years to a stretch running into the billions Purgatory is also where unbaptized children now go They used to go into a kind of cage called Limbo before Pope John and the Vatican Council but thats all been changed She does recognize change this philosopher she may rue it but she knows that it happens She also forces herself to a certain grim candor asked Do nuns go to the bathroom she replies following a malignant pause with a defiant Yes After an initial bit of shadowboxing she will discuss Sodom and some other things too Now every pronouncement that keeps the laughter rolling out front  well maybe not the 300year minimum for Purgatory but nearly every pronouncement  is straight out of what used to be called the old Baltimore Catechism and anyone who ever went near a parochial school will at once recognize its phrasing Playwright Durang has of course tossed in some gagging of his own My mother was a terrible cook the nun reminisces She used to boil chopped meat but his principal task and his most successful accomplishment has been to place stock answers to religious conundrums in such close carefully edited juxtaposition to one another that the sheer relentlessness of their terrible consistency becomes comic A serious sin will send you straight to Hell unless you confess it before you die if you are killed by a truck on the way to confession no dice And his ear for legalistic boobytraps is wonderfully supported by actress Elizabeth Franzs aggressive zany yet oddly honest management of Sister Ignatius Keeping the portrait steadily shy of cheap caricature Miss Franz still finds herself airspace to take off into now and again flapping away like a demented blackbird before roosting imperiously once more At rest she is in earnest unquestioningly so that is where her comedy comes from  from intense belief that is merely decorated by extravagance There is even a touching phrase late in the proceedings when she dazedly murmurs I was popular having just learned that she wasnt Of course she believed in her popularity doling out cookies to young Mark Stefan before taking him on her lap and tensely cuddling him And werent all of her answers quick cogent final triumphant Mr Durang has made effective farce out of fact and Miss Franz has given it plausibly oversize performance My own difficulty with the long oneact play comes as the playwright begins to invent for himself out of the blue Four of Sisters former students arrive to present a little pageant in her honor they are dressed as Mary Joseph and a camel named Misty two humps For a time we seem to be backing into something cute rather than caustic certainly the little songs and jests here are tepid alongside the jumblesale theology weve been listening to In due time theres a kicker The former students whom the nun does not really remember from 1959 throw off their robes and humps to declare their present identities one is an alcoholic one a homosexual one has had a child out of wedlock one has had nothing but abortions They are everything Sister Ignatius fears and despises and their leader thunders at her Its all your fault At which point that leader Polly Draper whips out a handgun with the warning Last night I killed my psychiatrist now Im going to kill you A struggle ensues for the gun and for the shape and tone of the play Its not the melodramatic nonsense that hurts so much Miss Franz has given us such a multilayered satirical figure that we can watch Sister Ignatius grappling for the weapon and getting it with bemused assent This is only physical illustration of logical principles shes enunciated all along What really hurts tipping the play well over onto its side is the sudden dismissal of satire of parody of humor altogether Our frame of reference cracks and we dont know how to take the noble sonorities Im not in a grade now Im in life that suddenly replace it The voices of the invading foursome drop to a hushed solemn key a tremulous selfpity is added to the unexpected sententiousness and Sisters onetime pupils become approximately as literal as Sister herself has always been Having outlined the homosexuals choices if he wishes to return to a state of grace the nun screeches Now why arent you following your options are you insane The reply Youre the one thats insane comes with a thud not only because it is schoolyardfeeble but because it is so unnecessary we know what we think about Sister by this time Further the shift from a comic perspective to deadly seriousness tends to make our own questions more serious as well If as Miss Draper charges its all Sisters fault then why has Miss Draper killed her psychiatrist And so on The lurching of gears shifts us into another kind of play and another frame of mind where we have less fun without learning much Still the body of the conceit remains maliciously entertaining and Miss Franz is perfection uncanonized The Actors Nightmare which serves as a curtainraiser on the double bill at Playwrights Horizons bears a decided stylistic resemblance to Mr Durangs earlier A History of the American Film Its guiding notion is perfectly possible its development merely random The notion an actor here Jeff Brooks who somehow looks like an extension of his own necktie dreams that he must go onstage in a leading role without knowing a line of the play scratch any actor and hell tell you about that dream The development alas clings to the obvious Once hes been rushed into a costume and propelled on stage what role does the dreamer find himself dressed for Hamlet He has however strayed into a performance of Private Lives and when someone tries to tell him that he is supposed to be playing Coward he supposes they are calling him a coward Finally given an opportunity to do a bit of Hamlet he begins the To be or not to be soliloquy only to discover that he cannot remember its second line which has got to be the weariest joke in all theatrical lore Noel Coward is quoted Extraordinary how potent cheap music is and then paraphrased Dont scribble Sibyl Some women should be hung regularly like tapestries without being improved upon Snitches and snatches of A Man for All Seasons and Endgame crop up but these referencejokes tend to blur into one another before anything as substantial as a payoff can be arranged Mr Durang clearly knows his background materials he just doesnt seem to know what fun has already been poked at them Promptbook wanderlust then But it keeps us in out of the rain I guess while Sister Ignatius is warming up

THE FAR-REACHING 'CONSCIENCE' OF HASTINGS CENTER,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/08/nyregion/the-far-reaching-conscience-of-hastings-center.html,ONHUDSON LAST year the United States Senate asked the Hastings Center for help in revising its code of ethics the model code provided by the center is now under Senate consideration With the growth of cults and the trials of Patti Hearst and others in mind the centers staff is studying the process of coercive persuasion or brainwashing and whether victims of severe psychological deprivation should be held morally accountable It is also exploring whether guidelines can be established to contain healthcare costs in the face of technological advances in medicine by using renal dialysis and artifical joint replacement techniques as case studies These issues are but a few of the concerns of the Hastings Center a place where according to its director Dr Daniel Callahan We do nothing but deal with difficult and controversial issues Our role is not to tell anyone what to do but rather to put the issues before them  to raise consciousness Formally known as the Institute of Society Ethics and the Life Sciences the 12yearold Hastings Center is considered by many observers to be the worlds foremost institution for the consideration of modern ethical problems As the first institution devoted to research and education in this field the Hastings Center  here on the former 21acre estate of Billie Burke the wife of Florenz Ziegfeld  has grown and flourished It employs a fulltime staff of 25 and draws international research fellows and consultatants from many disciplines who contribute to ongoing projects There are also a number of visiting scholars and groups of student interns who attend the center during the year and participate in its numerous workshops In addition 15000 associate members read the centers two monthly publications the Hastings Center Report and a new publication A Review of Human Subjects Research The center receives most of its 14 million annual budget from foundations and government agencies While it sometimes creates its own projects the case more often is that others ask for assistance Three hundred universities and professional schools have got help from the Hastings Center in the development of teaching programs in ethics The New Jersey State Attorney General concerned about the implications of the Karen Ann Quinlan case  in which a young woman became comatose and was being kept alive by lifesupport systems sought the centers advice in establishing a definition of death and the Department of the Army has been helped by the center to develop a training program in ethics for young officers The center began in 1969 as a file drawer in Dr Callahans home in Hastings filled with material he had collected while writing a book Abortion Law Choice and Morality Seeking views from a variety of disciplines Dr Callahan a Harvardtrained philosopher realized that numerous problems arising from advances in medicine could benefit from an interdisciplinary approach and that an organization devoted to serious research in ethics could shed light on some crucial modern problems A discussion with a neighboring Hastings resident Dr Willard Gaylin led to the formation of the center a network of doctors philosophers and political scientists devoted to a study of the moral implications of advances in medicine and biology In the 12 years since than the goals of the center have remained the same to carry out nonpartisan research on pressing ethical issues to develop educational programs and literature and to assist universities legislators and professional organizations in coping with moral problems However the center has expanded its original focus on ethical problems arising from medical and biological discoveries to include an interest in social and behavioral sciences and the professions It now places a stronger emphasis on issues affecting public policy including occupational health questions and the rationing of scarce resources Dr Gaylin cofounder and president of the center explained Were interested in issues that involve hard tragic choices  where there is no right answer Dr Gaylin a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and the author of nine books recently moderated a series on educational television entitled Hard Choices Problems in Medical Ethics a sixpart program shown on public television stations He described the work of the Hastings Center as a sophisticated form of technology assessment and added We are not a firefighting organization interested in changing what is clearly bad Our charge is to examine dilemmas As recently as 1975 the Hastings Center applied for a grant from the National Institute of Health to study the effects of genetic engineering in which scientists experiment with recombinant DNA in restructuring genetic codes The center was told thats pie in the sky stuff Dr Callahan recalled We argued that we should be given a chance to study DNA before it became a hot political battle but to no avail Now Dr Callahan says in a forthcoming special report on the activities of the Hastings Center is there anyone left who does not know that termination of treatment of the dying is a difficult moral problem or that recombinant DNA research poses profound ethical issues or that the just allocation of health issues is a vexing policy matter or that the moral education of professional students is not easy A lot of the science fiction issues that we approached have come true Dr Callahan said However they are not necessarily the most interesting or important concerns The issues we are addressing now may not make the front page but they are issues that affect a lot of lives
THE MOOD OF AMERICANS TODAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/08/books/the-mood-of-americans-today.html,THE INNER AMERICAN A SelfPortrait From 1957 to 1976 By Joseph Veroff Elizabeth Douvan and Richard A Kulka 637 pp New York Basic Books 36 MENTAL HEALTH IN AMERICA Patterns of HelpSeeking from 1957 to 1976 By Joseph Veroff Richard A Kulka and Elizabeth Douvan 352 pp New York Basic Books 30 By KENNETH KENISTON THE victory of Ronald Reagan and the concurrent defeat of dozens of liberal candidates and causes suggest to many that the American public has shifted into a deeply conservative mood It is commonly said that Americans reacting against the cultural and political liberalism of the 1960s are turning back toward more traditional roles institutions and ideologies seeking a restoration of the good old days before rising divorce rates working women the me generation and the cult of intimacy But two recent and extremely significant books indicate that the present American mood is based on more complex factors than the conservativereaction hypothesis would have it These studies written by three social scientists at the University of Michigans Institute of Social Research document a steady relaxation of traditional definitions of work marriage parenthood and self in the American public a personal liberalization that runs counter to the apparent growth of political conservatism The findings in turn raise new questions about how to understand the contemporary American state of mind Both The Inner American and Mental Health in America come from almost identical national surveys conducted in 1957 and 1976 The Inner American describes Americans attitudes toward themselves and their lives while its companion volume is a more specialized interpretation of how and why Americans seek professional help The 1957 survey involving a random sample of over 2000 Americans was part of a study of how Americans define wellbeing and how they deal with personal stress Respondents were questioned for 90 minutes about their behavior and attitudes concerning work family selfdefinition satisfactions dissatisfactions and personal crises In 1976 the same questions plus a few new ones were asked of another carefully matched sample of about the same size These studies with their analysis of change over two decades are mandatory reading for anyone seriously interested in what is happening to Americans The books importance is partly the result of the almost unprecedented repetition of a lengthy detailed and carefully designed survey at an interval of about 20 years But equally impressive is the sophistication of the data analysis which painstakingly distinguishes changes that result from a demographically transformed population from those that reflect deeper trends Although written with exemplary clarity both volumes make great demands upon the reader for they provide a full account of the complexity of the facts of the statistical techniques used and of the possibility of other interpretations of the results  Kenneth Keniston Mellon Professor of Human Development at MIT is currently working on a study of youth and high technology The best summary of these studies must start with the authors own descriptions of the 1976 population in phrases like increased concern about an uncertain future  reduced integration into the social structure  an increased search for intimacy  a general increase in taking a psychological orientation to experience The authors carefully analyze support and qualify each of these descriptions They find for instance the phenomenon of increased concern about an uncertain future to be especially prevalent among the young who reported feeling considerably more anxiety than did their 1957 counterparts Parents worry more about their children and adults in general worry more about their jobs Once the effects of an increasingly young educated population are factored out it is clear that Americans are less optimistic about the future than they were in 1957 People are no longer willing to postpone happiness until an indefinite future they define their wellbeing in terms of the present The broadest conclusion of these studies is that Americans are moving from a socially integrated paradigm for structuring wellbeing to a more personal or individuated paradigm  We see the 1957 population taking much more comfort in culture and the 1976 population gathering much more strength in its own personal adaptations to the world For example both marriage and parenthood are regarded less positively than before conversely people more easily accept  or remain neutral toward  those who divorce andor remain single or childless A new investment in selfexpression has replaced traditional definitions of marital roles a change reflected in the growing concern for individuation in work Especially among younger women sharply increased dissatisfaction with being a fulltime housewife goes hand in hand with a more positive conception of paid work as an avenue toward personal fulfillment Both men and women increasingly define fulfillment in relation to intimate personal relations rather than satisfactory performance of traditional roles In 1957 being a good parent was particularly for men more often defined by such a phrase as being a good provider In 1976 both success and failure as a parent are more often defined in terms of closeness to or distance from children Similarly Americans who are under stress  especially the young  today less often seek help in prayer which linked them to traditional religious institutions and more often talk over their problems with close friends or professional helpers In both books the authors underline the increased reliance on psychology to explain experience a pattern manifest in a growing willingness both to admit the need for personal help and to seek it  from friends acquaintances and mentalhealth professionals Americans are generally more willing to admit problems anxieties and inadequacies in their personal lives In 1976 married respondents reported greater satisfaction with their marriages than they did in 1957  a pattern that may reflect the more frequent tendency for dissatisfied couples to divorce But happily married couples in 1976 are also more likely to admit conflict or resentment in their marriages The era of psychological man hailed as a desideratum by mentalhealth enthusiasts in 1957 appears to be upon us for better or worse The Inner American also underlines the generally high levels of wellbeing in our society Summarizing the authors note We seem to be a happy society although we are somewhat worried about the future  We are still an optimistic people  We are fairly confident about our own efficacy  We are a familycentered society Family roles  compared to work or leisure activities  are clearly more central to selfdefinition  We are surprisingly committed to and satisfied with our work Compared to 1957 Americans in 1976 saw themselves as more efficacious less in need of being liked by others Clearly we are not witnessing the collapse of Americans ideas about themselves as individuals or for that matter the disappearance of institutions like the family The changes in personal orientation interest the authors most and their work in this area decisively confirms the impression given by other more superficial and less carefully analyzed surveys Two related trends emerge first what might be called liberalization of mores that is the increased acceptance of deviation from traditional role requirements and a growing flexibility in the redefinition of old roles in personal terms and second what might be called an immediatization of concerns or a growing focus on the private the idiosyncratic the here and now and the intimately interpersonal as areas in which the greatest possibility for satisfactions and dissatisfactions are perceived to lie How are these changes to be understood Though the authors are reluctant to venture sweeping interpretations they refuse to join the bandwagon to indict the current population for their narcissism  Instead they explain the shift away from social integration toward more personal forms of selfdefinition as an adaptive response to the increasing complexity variety and uncertainty of social roles and institutions Yet this explanation even if correct as far as it goes does not help us to understand how people who welcome the liberalization of mores in their private life  in fact many of the changes documented by the Michigan researchers can be read as a fulfillment of the cultural agenda of the 1960s  turn against liberalism as voters This apparent contradiction requires an examination of issues left untouched by these studies of inner Americans namely attitudes toward society and public policy Over the past two decades study after study has found that Americans confidence in government business unions the press the church and virtually every other major institution in our society has deteriorated Optimism about the collective future has lessened as has belief in the efficacy of hard work The majority of Americans now believe that government serves the interests of big business rather than of all the people that birth and connections matter more than effort and ability in getting ahead Acknowledging this waning faith in the traditional public world is critical to an understanding of both the Institute of Social Researchs findings about inner Americans and the apparent conservative trend of American politics When the big world of major social institutions is considered untrustworthy when people begin to lose faith in the power of hard work and selfsacrifice to make a better future then the private response is to focus more intently on the little worlds of family friends and work all of which are redefined in terms of personal fulfillment If government big business unions and bureaucracies are seen as ineffective untrustworthy and possibly corrupt support for social programs and the taxes required to pay for them necessarily dwindles even as Americans in their private behavior turn toward more idiosyncratic solutions to the problems of living The quest for closeness the psychologization of experience the focus on the immediate are all in a sense compensations for the declining confidence in the old public anchors for traditional private behavior If Americans are less socially integrated than before it is not simply because of the greater complexity of society in addition it is because they perceive society  in the sense of traditional social institutions and the beliefs that gave them coherence  as less worthy of being integrated with Oddly enough one aspect of the 60s has also triumphed here A lack of confidence in the honesty and efficacy of public institutions that once characterized a few radicals on American campuses has now been diffused thoughout most of the American public This new conservatism if indeed it can be called conservatism at all is of a particular sort To be sure Americans do not want to be told that they must bus their children obey a 55mileperhour speed limit or pay high taxes for programs in whose efficacy they have lost faith But neither do they want to be told that they must read the Bible regularly that they cannot have abortions or that they must remain in unhappy marriages against their wishes Americans today may have little faith in organized government but they have even less trust in that traditional conservative icon big business The conservatism of the Moral Majority and other rightist groups that call for a return to traditional definitions of family work and self is thus not at the heart of the new American mood Such groups speak for a dwindling minority who with truly reactionary desperation reaffirm older role definitions precisely to try to arrest the changes so clearly documented by the Michigan researchers Rather what is at the heart of the new political mood is a reversion to the traditional American interpretation of laissezfaire The selfsufficient individual wants public institutions off his back If government is inefficient or corrupt as most Americans have come to believe then the less of it the better No small part of President Reagans skill lies precisely in his ability to appeal to this renewed laissezfaire attitude all the while avoiding excessively close ties to an ultraright that would reimpose on private behavior social constraints that most Americans have long since abandoned It is often said that the battles of the 60s were lost But The Inner American and Mental Health in America together with other studies that document deep shifts in political attitudes suggest a different interpretation Ironically large portions of both the cultural agenda and radical political analysis of the 1960s today represent majority views But cultural liberalization and political disillusionment have not engendered a radical determination to improve society through concerted collective action On the contrary most Americans have fallen back on that older American fantasy of the lone cowboy seeking personal fulfillment in an empty desert Never mind that we all know there are 220 million Americans crowded into our desert and four billion more human beings around the edge In the end we vote for what we wish were true and not for what we know to be
RELATIONSHIPS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/09/style/relationships.html,B ecause the abortion question is decided between a woman and her doctor an estimated one million men a year are left on the emotional periphery of this most difficult problem Not only are many powerless to voice their opinions in the decisionmaking process but they are also typically neglected by abortionclinic counseling services and prohibited from being with their partners during the abortion procedure or in the recovery room As long as a year after the event one study found some men continue to have troubling thoughts or dreams about the infant they might have fathered Arthur Shostak professor of sociology at Drexel University in Philadelphia and the veteran of an unpleasant abortion aftermath himself has spent the last four years trying to learn what happens to the neglected partners in aborted pregnancies From the 100 men he has surveyed 17 to 34 years old a picture emerges of a hurt angry individual filled with conflict and unable to discuss his feelings with anyone Forty of the men spoke to no one except their partner about any aspect of the entire situation Dr Shostak reported although most expressed the opinion that they would have coped better had they been able to discuss the problem more openly Dr Shostak conceded that his sample was too small to be representative of all men who face an abortion decision and his subjects were not selected according to principles of scientific research The 100 surveyed were recruited on four Northeastern college campuses and at three abortion clinics in the Philadelphia area However he said abortion clinic personnel have told him that the characterists of the men were fairly typical 90 were single 77 were white and 23 black TK68 were students and 59 were aged 20 to 24 Ten had frequently accompanied their partners to counseling services at the clinic however 37 went only once or twice and the rest never received even the limited attention afforded partners I have had female abortion counselors in three major cities explain to me that these men have not been especially welcomed Dr Shostak said While the female client is commonly advised that counseling can be provided should her male partner so desire no written invitation is sent to him with the female nor is exclusive time made for his counseling even if he is seated outside in a clinic waiting room In the rare cases where the occupants of a clinic waiting room males and females alike are offered a group information session Dr Shostak continued the presence of sisters girlfriends and mothers of the patients impedes any opening up by the males For nearly half the men in Dr Shostaks study the experience had weakened or destroyed their love relationship Sixteen said that they and their partners had drifted apart after the abortion and five reported breakups with considerable mutual hostility Twentythree said they had switched from having a sexual relationship to one that was platonic Dr Shostak said However 38 couples felt that the experience had helped bring them closer together Dr Shostak believes that one reason men are excluded from decision making and counseling is that they are seen as potentially overbearing advisers His data however do not support this notion More than 90 percent of the veterans expressed no interest in gaining veto power over the decision making of the expectant mother Dr Shostak said Rather their real need was not so much for power as it was for personhood To date however what appears to be the only formal attempt to offer counseling to males facing an abortion decision in San Francisco failed after one year for lack of money Dr Shostak said Prospects seem poor for expanding existing abortion counseling services soon Provision of the special training necessary to help female counselors gain the confidence and skills appropriate to working with men is a cost item few abortioncenter directors will welcome he said especially as many believe their female staff is already overburdened with their female caseload alone Dr Shostak said he wanted to promote a new concept of joint responsibility and sharing in the abortion experience which he would like to call cobortion I see it as part of the larger question of heterosexual intimacy he said I want to show people how healthy it is for men and women to grapple with issues together Dr Shostak said that while righttolife activists focus on the fetus and feminists on the woman cobortion refers to the couple The word assumes free choice in the abortion decision and goes beyond he said Dava Sobel
NEW VATICAN CODE IS CALLED FLEXIBLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/09/world/new-vatican-code-is-called-flexible.html,The new code of canon law drafted by the Roman Catholic Church to replace one that was published in 1917 represents a clarification of what has been in place for some time according to an American archbishop who participated in its preparation In many ways there is more flexibility in it and a number of determinations are to be made at a local level said Archbishop Joseph L Bernardin of Cincinnati who represented the United States Bishops Conference in the 74member commission of bishops that approved a final draft of the new code on Oct 28 However there also are notable changes in the code some of which are said to redefine the procedure and grounds for granting marriage annulments to reduce the number of offenses to be punished by automatic excommunication and to give local church officials more autonomy and lay Catholics an increased role in local church affairs Approval of the draft follows 18 years of revision and debate The revision was begun by Pope John XXIII in an effort to put on paper many practices and viewpoints that had come into general acceptance in the church since 1917 particularly changes that occurred after the Second Vatican Council of 196265 Pope John Paul II who now has sole authority to change it is expected to issue the code next spring In Effect After a Year So that local churches may have time to study the new code it is not due to go into effect for a year after it is promulgated But some simpler sections such as liturgical regulations can be considered church law during that year The 1917 code which is held to be binding on all baptized Catholics of the Roman rite over the age of seven was the first in the nearly 2000year history of the church Before it was issued the laws of the church defining and regulating Catholic faith or life were found in various collections of council documents and Vatican and papal rulings but were never put together The new code is to consist of seven books of about 1700 canons or articles 714 fewer than the existing one has Many of the canons will essentially ratify changes that have already been approved such as the use of the vernacular in liturgical ceremonies said Msgr John A Alesandro chancellor of the Rockville Centre diocese on Long Island a canonlaw expert who assisted Archbishop Bernardin One More Step for Annulments In the section on annulments the new code adds one more step to the process now used by the church in the United States and Australia and brings it into line with practice elsewhere That step would require that each annulment granted by a diocesan marriage tribunal be fully examined by a regional review board before being referred to the bishop and then to the National Conference of Bishops Both Archbishop Bernardin and Monsignor Alesandro said they believed the new code would not cause any change in the number of annulments granted in the United States The new canons codify several psychological grounds for annulment that have been developed and approved over the years by the Sacred Roman Rota the Vaticans highest court but are not listed in the 1917 code Homosexuality is one The draft code also expands the concept of lack of due discretion to include a person who has a behavioral disorder or psychosis making him unaware of the conditions of the Catholic marriage contract Monsignor Alesandro said the new code would reduce the offenses punished by automatic excommunication from 37 to 6 To be excommunicated the offender has to have prior knowledge of the penalty Also a return to Catholicism would be allowed only after the excommunication is lifted by a church official and the offender is absolved in confession The six offenses for which excommunication is automatically prescribed are obtaining or performing an abortion profanation of the consecrated communion host or wine a physical attack on the Pope absolution of an accomplice in which a priest sins with another person and then forgives the persons sin violation by a priest of the secrecy of confession and the illegitimate consecration of a bishop without a mandate from the Pope

IN THE NATION; CREEPING TO THE RIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/10/opinion/in-the-nation-creeping-to-the-right.html,President Reagans foreign policy cant even keep the peace between the State Department and the White House His economic program is producing recession the highest unemployment since 1975 and war between David Stockman and the Treasury Secretaries Haig and Weinberger contradict each other on NATO nuclear doctrine then claim they didnt But lets not lose sight of Attorney General William French Smith an undramatic sort who just may be leading the Administration on a creep to the right in domestic social policy First Mr Smith announced that he would try to pressure Federal courts into greater judicial restraint then he persuaded Mr Reagan to backslide from what had appeared to be his newfound willingness to support a strong bill extending the Voting Rights Act The latter step was particularly depressing since the President apparently was talked out of saying hed accept virtually any bill Congress passed That would have made it more likely that something like the 10year extension already passed by the House could have been pushed through the more conservative Senate even with J Strom Thurmond of South Carolina as Judiciary Committee chairman Instead under the Attorney Generals prodding Mr Reagan proposed that the final bill require that an intent to discriminate be proved in cases where voting rights violations had been charged The House bill would require more reasonably only a showing of a discriminatory result The House bill moreover includes a tightly drawn bailout provision acceptable to civil rights groups It would permit jurisdictions covered by the act owing to their histories of voting rights discrimination to be freed of their requirements only after 10 years of compliance and under certain welldefined conditions  for example that the jurisdiction had engaged in constructive efforts to end intimidation and harassment of voters and to increase opportunities for minority participation in the political process Mr Reagan said he wanted the Houses bailout provision  passed with the 10year extension by 389 to 24  made easier That will strengthen Mr Thurmonds hand and insure a major battle when the extension bill reaches the Senate floor next year In fairness the President retreated from some of his past doubts about the Act supported the House bills important extension of a requirement for bilingual ballots in jurisdictions with large numbers of nonEnglishspeakers and rejected Mr Smiths more extreme recommendations Nevertheless its hard to see how his stated reservations advance his stated purpose not to allow any Americans vote to be denied diluted or defiled As for the courts what did FDR do when he tried to pack the Supreme Court that the Attorney General is not now trying to do only somewhat more subtly The groundswell of conservatism evidenced by the 1980 election he told the Federal Legal Council makes this an especially appropriate time to urge upon the courts more principled bases that would diminish judicial activism Translation since as the Attorney General reminded the Council the courts follow the election returns nows the time to pressure them into ruling the Reagan way Mr Smith even specified some of the issues on which he hoped to influence the courts to greater restraint  environmental regulation school desegregation prisoners rights affirmative action and 14thAmendment cases concerning equal protection of the laws He did not note that naming Sandra Day OConnor to the Supreme Court was a classic example of affirmative action since no one pretends she was the most qualified person available and that it probably established a sexual quota for the high court The President and the Attorney General of course are entitled to nominate judges of political views compatible with theirs assuming that Senate confirmation can be obtained Clearly however Mr Smith intends to go beyond the mere appointment of conservative judges to active persuasion of the courts toward Reagan Administration views His speech in itself was a form of pressure on them The Attorney General did not say whether he would support radicalright bills to strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction in abortion school desegregation and prayer in the schools cases But he must know that his strictures on what he called constitutionally dubious and unwise intrusions of the courts on legislative turf will be used in support of the courtstripping bills  which most legal authorities regard as a backdoor method of amending the Constitution by mere Congressional majorities Theres something offensive moreover in invoking the powers of the executive branch to intrude upon the independence of the courts particularly in the name of judicial restraint What about executive restraint And anyway what kind of judicial restraint would it be if the courts were pressured into ruling in accordance with the political views of a transient Administration
PERSONAL HEALTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/11/garden/personal-health-088218.html,BOTH in myth and medicine the womb when not engaged in childbearing has been seen as the source of many female woes ranging from emotional disorders to cancer Thus it is hardly surprising that the advent of relatively safe surgical and anesthetic techniques in the mid20th century brought with it a great increase in the rate of hysterectomy surgical removal of the uterus or womb usually after a woman has completed childbearing Based on the current rate more than half the women in this country will undergo a hysterectomy by age 65 In the 1970s hysterectomy as the most common operation performed in the United States nearly always by male surgeons became a cause celebre among feminists healthcare economists and consumer groups who viewed much of the surgery as a means of lining the doctors pocket rather than protecting the patients health They pointed out that the hysterectomy rate varies widely it is twice as high in the South as in the Northeast it is higher if doctors are paid a fee for doing the operation than if surgery is done under a prepaid health plan it is higher if only one doctor decides on surgery than if a consultants opinion must also be sought Studies of this kind have suggested that about a third of hysterectomies are unnecessary and involve the removal of a healthy uterus Amid such controversy a woman whose uterus is being considered for removal may rightly wonder whether the operation is really needed Her thinking is likely to be further confused by a host of prevalent myths for example that hysterectomy causes mental illness or ends a womans sex life and overthebackfence horror tales of the experiences of neighbors and friends Although some women undergo needless surgery others may avoid a hysterectomy that is clearly to their benefit Since the vast majority of hysterectomies are elective nonemergency operations the prospective patient usually has an opportunity to weigh the advantages and disadvantages and make a decision based on the reasons for surgery and what it entails the circumstances of her life and the dictates of her body What may be a minor annoyance for one woman could be a major disability for another In some cases hysterectomy is clearly a lifesaving or healthpreserving procedure In others it can add significantly to the quality of a womans life Here are the facts What Is a Hysterectomy There is much misunderstanding as to what tissues are removed and with what effect Hysterectomy including those called total or complete involves removal of the uterus and cervix that portion of the uterus that extends into the vaginal cavity If the operation is done on a woman who is still menstruating her periods will stop and she will be unable to conceive and bear a child But her ovaries will continue to produce hormones until menopause which may occur a few years earlier than it would have had the uterus not been removed Sometimes the ovaries and Fallopian tubes are removed along with the uterus in an operation called hysterectomy with salpingooophorectomy In a premenopausal woman it results in surgical menopause both her periods and ovarian hormone production cease abruptly She is usually given hormone treatments to alleviate the symptoms of menopause Depending on the condition being treated the operation may be done from inside the vagina leaving no visible scar or through an abdominal incision usually a horizontal cut made just above the pubic hairline The abdominal approach which enables the surgeon to examine the health of nearby organs is the method used when the uterus is greatly enlarged or cancer is involved As with all surgery hysterectomy has hazards The death rate is one to two per 1000 patients and as many as half the patients experience one or another operative complication among them reaction to anesthesia hemorrhage requiring transfusion abdominal or urinarytract infection abdominal adhesions injury to the bladder rectum or pelvic blood vessels and lifethreatening blood clots The surgery commonly involves a week to 10 days in the hospital and three to five weeks of recovery at home before the patient can fully resume her usual activities However strenuous activity is usually curtailed for several months and some women experience prolonged fatigue and loss of energy for up to a year after surgery When Should It Be Done Doctors agree that hysterectomy is needed for the following conditions cancer or precancer of the uterus tubes or ovary incapacitating irreversible damage from infection pelvic inflammatory disease large benign tumors fibroids that cause pressure or bleed excessively uterine bleeding that does not respond to dilation and curettage or to hormone therapy severe endometriosis misplaced growth of uterine tissue a uterus severely damaged by childbirth or abortion and prolapse of the uterus in which it drops into or through the vagina and causes pain or pressure There is a gray area in which medical opinions differ This usually involves a woman near or past menopause who has extreme abnormal bleeding or pain but no apparent uterine abnormality Some regard hysterectomy as the preferred alternative to frequent examinations repeated dilation and curettage or prolonged hormone treatment Finally there is an area of great conflict removal of an otherwise normal uterus as a means of contraception or to prevent the later development of medical problems including cancer Tubal ligation and other methods of female sterilization are far safer than hysterectomy though it is widely acknowledged by gynecologists that in many Roman Catholic hospitals hysterectomy is performed to skirt the churchs prohibition on voluntary sterilization Most experts say the surgery cannot be justified as a cancer preventive except possibly in patients past childbearing age who are known to face a high risk of developing uterine cancer For a woman past age 40 or 45 who is undergoing an abdominal hysterectomy for other reasons the surgeon may also recommend removal of the ovaries since 1 percent of women over 40 develop ovarian cancer a disease that is hard to detect and cure LongTerm Consequences Controversy has raged for years over the emotional effects of hysterectomy with some experts reporting prolonged depression in more than a third of the cases and others saying that 90 percent are happier after the procedure To a large extent a womans reaction may be influenced by her expectations as well as by her emotional health and life circumstances before surgery If a hysterectomy is done on a woman who would have liked to become pregnant depression is a natural reaction Similarly if a woman expects inappropriately that a hysterectomy will resolve marital conflicts she is likely to be disappointed One study found that twothirds of postoperative depressions occurred in patients who had emotional problems prior to surgery The hysterectomy triggered a recurrence but so might have any other traumatic event A woman who equates her womb with femininity or sexual responsiveness or whose spouse holds such notions is likely to react badly When a hysterectomy is performed to get rid of lifeinhibiting symptoms such as painful intercourse frequent and potentially embarrassing bleeding or loss of bladder control from a prolapsed uterus the patient is likely to feel much better afterward Emotional considerations aside a hysterectomy should not impair a womans enjoyment of or response to sexual activity although the quality of sexual response may change in those for whom cervical and uterine movement enhances orgasm In one widely quoted study by Dr DH Richards of Oxford England 36 percent of 200 women who had had hysterectomies were treated for postoperative depression and among premenopausal patients 55 percent required such treatment Dr Richards subsequently described a posthysterectomy syndrome of depression headache dizziness insomnia and extreme tiredness occurring in up to 70 percent of patients However in another study Dr Bruce C Richards a Colorado physician asked 340 women most of whom had had hysterectomies for reasons related to the quality of their lives how they felt Eighty percent returned the questionnaire with the following results 91 percent were pleased 85 percent said they would encourage a friend to have the surgery 78 percent said they felt better less inconvenience more energy better sex life less pain and only 4 percent said they felt worse weight gain worse sex life depression Of course it is not known whether the 20 percent of patients who failed to send back the questionnaire would have had similar responses Last January furthermore a British research team described 60 premenopausal patients who were tested before and up to three years after their surgery No evidence was found of depression or sexual difficulties related to the hysterectomy In fact most showed improved mood and vigor and no change in sexual activity as compared with their situations before surgery The few who experienced postoperative depression were depressed at the outset The following books are useful for further reading Understanding Hysterectomy A Womans Guide by Dr FG Giustini and Dr FJ Keefer Walker paperback 1979 795 All About Hysterectomy

Joseph P Galda a member of the conservative Young Americans for Freedom and of Consumer Alert enrolled as a Rutgers University freshman here he was appalled to learn that mandatory fees include 250 a semester to support the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group Among its other positions the nonprofit advocacy group  whose establishment in 1972 was inspired by Ralph Nader the consumer advocate  opposes the expansion of nuclear power and favors abortion rights for women and the proposed Equal Rights Amendment Mr Galda opposes the group on these and other issues Now a senior who plans to attend law school next year Mr Galda is continuing a fight he began as a freshman to change the university policy which he says requires him to support political and social causes with which he disagrees A fourday campus referendum on whether the fee should be retained will begin Monday while the constitutionality of the fee will be tested in the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia next year Counsel for the university have argued in court that the New Jersey Legislature originally endorsed the groups establishment in the state as being in the public interest and in furtherance of the educational mandate of Rutgers Fee Approved by Students Such groups each incorporated independently since Mr Nader started the studentadvocacy movement in 1972 are active in 26 states but not all of them are backed by mandatory fees collected for them by the school as part of the semester bill for matriculation and must depend on voluntary contributions Edward Lloyd executive director of the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group described the group as a private lobbying organization that actively pursued its interests in social and political issues but did not support political candidates Rutgers collects the fee at 11 colleges and schools in New Brunswick Newark and Camden The fee has been approved at each by a majority of students voting with a minimum of 25 percent of the student body favoring it Students on statewide and campus Public Interest Research Group boards decide which projects to pursue but opponents say the yearround nonstudent Interest Research Group staff actually guides the decisions and carries out the projects At 17 colleges in New York State the groups fee is a mandatory part of the student activity fee while it is separately collected at Rutgers At the various campuses of Rutgers and the City University of New York whose governing boards make policy regarding the organization the fees are refundable to students who do not want to contribute They are not refundable at campuses of the State University of New York whose student associations determine whether and to what extent Public Interest Research Groups may draw from student activity funds Foundation Sues Rutgers As a freshman Mr Galda first complained to Consumer Alert an organization that opposes excessive government regulation of business and supports freedom of choice for consumers Barbara Keating its president who was the Conservative Party candidate for the Senate from New York in 1974 referred him to the MidAtlantic Legal Foundation in Philadelphia The foundation is one of six law offices across the country set up since 1975 under the umbrella of the National Legal Center for the Public Interest in Washington James R Richards vice president of the center said the networks purpose was to provide a balance against extremist environmentalist organizations such as the Sierra Club and consumeroriented groups such as the Nader organizations In 1979 MidAtlantic sued Rutgers on behalf of Mr Galda and two other students charging that it had unconstitutionally infringed on student free speech and expression by requiring all to contribute Last June Judge Stanley S Brotman of Federal District Court ruled in Camden that Rutgers students were not in fact being compelled to support ideological positions they oppose because they could demand a refund of the fee The Public Interest Research Group intervened on the side of Rutgers Judges Ruling Is Appealed Judge Brotman conceded only that perhaps it would be preferable if the fee were voluntary rather than mandatory MidAtlantic appealed to the Circuit Court In a brief filed Oct 13 Myrna P Field its president said that since refunds were not made until the end of each semester the fee is in the coffers of PIRG for essentially the entire four scholastic years even if the individual student conscientiously applies for a timely refund on eight separate occasions She said refunding also had the chilling effect of requiring dissenters to identify themselves The funding policy gives one political philosophy an unjustified advantage the imprimatur of governmental approval she said On no occasion has the Supreme Court allowed an entity to collect compulsory fees for political or ideological purposes without the knowing consent of the contributor Because of the controversy over the fee the student congress at the Camden campus ordered a new referendum on the fee last April Ordinarily a referendum is held every three years and the next would have been this fall The group lost the April referendum but said it did not campaign because of the time change It petitioned the college administration for and obtained a substitute referendum for Nov 16 to 19 Foundation to Pursue Lawsuit Regardless of the outcome of the referendum here MidAtlantic will pursue its suit We would like the New Jersey case to set a precedent for other PIRGs around the country Mrs Keating said in a telephone interview from Consumer Alert headquarters in Modesto Calif Some college administrations are awaiting the outcome of this one before taking further action on a future policy on PIRG The New Jersey Public Interest Research Group persuaded Rutgers officials that membership in the group would benefit students educationally by offering them an opportunity to learn about social and political issues and to participate in seeking legislative or other action on the issues Frederick L Whitmer a Morristown attorney noted in his brief for Rutgers that the groups establishment in the state had been endorsed by the New Jersey Legislature as being in the public interest and in furtherance of the educational mandate of Rutgers Students may obtain course credit for working on group projects in such fields as consumer and environmental issues urban revitalization racial and sexual discrimination occupational health and safety tax reform education and energy policy The Rutgers policy Judge Brotman said advances the two fundamental values underlying the First Amendment it facilitates individual students interests in association and expression and it serves societys interest in open and informed discussion of public issues Mr Galda said it provides onesided discussion and accords PIRG an advantage in getting their views across that other campus groups dont have He said that the College Republicans organization he heads raises its own funds and that the Public Interest Resarch Group should too
PHYSICIANS DEPLORE THE ABORTING OF ONE TWIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/12/us/physicians-deplore-the-aborting-of-one-twin.html,An operation in which a fetus suffering a genetic disorder was aborted seven months before its twin was born naturally has aroused protests from doctors in the United States and Canada In letters to The New England Journal of Medicine physicians raised questions about the legal and moral aspects of the procedure This poses more questions than it answers wrote Dr Frederick Hecht of the Southwest Biomedical Research Institute in Tempe Ariz The operation was performed at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City and reported in The Journal in June The mother had decided she could not care for a twin with Downs Syndrome which many times results in severe retardation I am appalled by this gross misuse of medical knowledge by physicians wrote Dr NS Hagen of Libertyville Ill To destroy a physically affected life because of inconvenience is sufficiently repugnant but to risk the life of the mother and to risk the life of the normal child brings the practice of medicine to its nadir Dr Hecht suggested the mother had another choice continuing the pregnancy and permitting the retarded child to be adopted The doctors who performed the procedure Thomas D Kerenyi and Usha Chitkara responded that abortion of fetuses found to have genetic abnormalities is an accepted practice They said parents of fetuses with Downs syndrome invariably choose termination of pregnancy We reiterate the doctors said that our procedure was attempted for the sake of salvaging the life of the normal twin for parents in an extreme predicament who desperately wanted a normal child but found themselves personally unable to cope with a lifelong responsibility for a retarded child and who were unwilling to shift the burden to society at large
BAR LEADER FEARS CRISIS OVER CURBS ON COURTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/12/us/bar-leader-fears-crisis-over-curbs-on-courts.html,The president of the American Bar Association warned tonight that attacks being mounted in Congress against the Federal courts may lead to a possible constitutional crisis that could prove the most serious since our great Civil War David R Brink president of the bar group denounced legislative proposals to strip the Supreme Court and lower Federal courts of power to decide cases involving abortion and statesponsored school prayer and to prohibit the courts from ordering busing as a means of desegregating schools These proposals challenge our very form of government by threatening elimination of the third branch of Federal Government the judicial Mr Brink said His speech delivered tonight in Bridgeport Conn was released in advance by the associations office in Washington Award to Ribicoff Mr Brink spoke at a dinner marking the presentation of the first Raymond E Baldwin Public Service Award by the University of Bridgeport School of Law Former Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut received the award named for a former Connecticut Chief Justice Senator and Governor Mr Brinks warning that we confront a possible constitutional crisis illustrated the rising level of concern among many lawyers and constitutional scholars as forces on the right increase their pressure for a direct attack by Congress on the power of the Federal courts Senator Jesse A Helms Republican of North Carolina and other conservatives have accused the courts of usurping the powers of elected legislators at the state and Federal levels They have assailed in particular the Supreme Courts rulings striking down antiabortion laws prohibiting statesponsored prayer in schools and ordering busing as a means of desegregating schools Strategy of Conservatives Mr Helms and his allies lack the twothirds majority that would be needed in each House of Congress to propose constitutional amendments overruling Supreme Court decisions in these three areas However they hope to persuade a simple majority of each House to enact legislation stripping the Federal courts of jurisdiction over such matters Lobbyists for the bar association the nations largest organization of lawyers have been joined by the American Civil Liberties Union Common Cause and civil rights groups in opposing such legislation They fear that one or more of these measures may be passed by the Senate as early as next month The Congressional attack on the courts was given new impetus late last month when Attorney General William French Smith denounced the Federal courts for constitutionally dubious and unwise intrusions on the legislative domain Mr Smith stopped short of endorsing legislation to curb the courts Mr Brink said he was not taking a position on the sensitive moral and social issues of abortion school prayer and busing But he said the technique of stripping the Federal courts of power to enforce controversial decisions on constitutional issues could threaten our Constitution our separation of powers and our very system of government Mr Brink acknowledged that scholarly opinion was divided on the constitutionality of the proposed legislation He said his personal view was that most or all of the bills were unconstitutional as well as dangerous policy

A CATHOLIC REVOLUTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/14/opinion/a-catholic-revolution.html,Something is stirring in the Roman Catholic Church in the United States that portends an explosion between church and state that will make the abortion issue the schoolaid controversy and the taxexempt status of churches look like a childs sparkler on the Fourth of July It is in my judgment the most significant revolution within the American Catholic Church since Lord Baltimores contingent of Catholics disembarked on Marylands shores in 1634 Stated simply the Church in the United States is becoming a peace church That is to say it has moved drmatically and swiftly from the company of mainline Protestant and Evangelical churches into the quiet meeting place of the Society of Friends This revolution is being waged painfully in the hearts and minds of Catholic thinkers and leaders Thank God the American bishops are shouldering the responsibility of leading this revolution at times to the chagrined and vocal opposition of their flocks They are emerging more and more as worthy successor of Thomas a Becket Their words and actions are not in any sense pious rhetoric One might date the revolution from Sept 9 1979 when John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia in the name of the majority of the bishops before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee stated the clear unequivocal position of the Catholic Church in the United States concerning disarmament and nuclear war His testimony can be summarized briefly 1 Our obligation to control the threat of nuclear destructiveness is more fundamental than the requirement to limit the possession of certain weapons 2 The use of any strategic nuclear weapons whatsoever against any targets even in response to Soviet use of them is morally unacceptable 3 Any threat to use the strategic nuclear arsenal is condemned Even deterring the Soviet Union by threat of nuclear retaliation for aggression is out of bounds morally because it is immoral even to intend to do what is intrinsically immoral 4 The Church lends its moral authority to the quest for bilateral and legally sanctioned limits on weapons 5 The Church goes one step further and requires at least of its own members of the right to use or the threat to use those strategic nuclear weapons still allowed under the armscontrol agreement The implication  perhaps a better word is application  of this teaching undoubtedly will set the teaching Church and some of its members on a collision course in the area of this Catholic moral imperative Moreover it will put the Catholic Churchs teaching and practice in direct conflict with a Government that says and acts to the contrary Since Cardinal Krols testimony dozens of American Catholic bishops have enunciate these same principles in their speeches pastoral letters and in interviews and articles in diocesan newspapers The reactions in their flocks have been mixed some vehemently oppose their stand others just as ardently support it At least two bishops have spoken out boldly and courageously emphasizing that unilateral disarmament is the only Catholic position to take There may be more but the two whose statements I have read are Archbishop Raymond T Hunthausen of Seattle who was supported by the suffragan bishops of the Pacific Northwest and Bishop LeRoy Matthiesen of Amarillo Texas who was supported by the other nine Catholic bishops of Texas Archbishop John R Quinn of San Francisco on Oct 4 issued a pastoral letter that said the just war theory no longer applies because of the essential difference beween nuclear and conventional war A prominent Catholic who is a justice on the supreme court of one of our states said to me recently I am persuaded unilateral disarmament must begin I hope the Church can change the climate of opinion to make this possible The Catholic bishops will hold their annual meeting in Washington next week It remains to be seen what action they will take Will they issue a statement on unilateral disarmament or wait until 1982 when they already plan to publish a lengthy pastoral letter on war and peace What will be the reaction of Catholic leaders military officers and Government officials if and when the bishops say formally and officially that unilateral disarmament is the primary moral imperative which they have already done individually and unofficially Thats what I mean when I say there is a Catholic revolution  Msgr Vincent A Yzermans a priest of the Diocese of St Cloud Minn is former information director for the American Catholic bishops and editor of several national Catholic publications
A MOVIE ON THE PRESS STIRS A DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/15/movies/a-movie-on-the-press-stirs-a-debate.html, Jonathan Friendly is the press reporter for The Times By JONATHAN FRIENDLY Early in the movie Absence of Malice Megan Carter a court reporter for The Miami Standard is confronted at her desk in the newsroom by a fellow named Michael Gallagher Miss Carter Sally Field has just written a front page story naming Gallagher Paul Newman as a key suspect in a redhot criminal investigation He would like he says angrily to tell his story Any reporter worth her press card would jump at the chance to interview a suspect in a criminal inquiry But Miss Carters response is a hasty dash to the lawyers office to find reasons for not giving Gallagher a chance to reply The scene is not particularly central to the movie which concentrates on largescale journalistic improprieties by the reporter and her paper Exactly because it is so small however there is a chance that audiences may take it as a literal truth about the way newspeople work and the movie is filled with small touches  the computer terminals at reporters desks the roaring presses the paperboy on his bike  designed to suggest that it is presenting the reality of newspapering But just like the stories Miss Carter writes the film gets only some of the facts and trying to be true fails to be entirely truthful Even before it opens Thursday in New York and Los Angeles Absence of Malice has stirred up a dispute among some of the journalists who have seen it at screenings They say that each of the major incidents of reportorial or editorial malfeasance is possible particularly in view of such recent incidents as the faked Washington Post story that won a Pulitzer Prize later returned Carol Burnetts successful libel suit against The National Enquirer and The Washington Posts printing and then apologizing for a gossipcolumn item that suggested former President Jimmy Carter had bugged Blair House What they doubt is that any selfrespecting paper would long tolerate much less encourage the kind of naivete of the reporter or the deliberate sensationseeking of her editor Writing in the current issue of the Columbia Journalism Review for example Lucinda Franks a Pulitzer Prizewinning former reporter says the film is a grotesquely distorted view of newspapering What makes the film unbelievable she adds is not that the reporter and her editor are unethical but that they are stupid The movie portrays Miss Carter who is assigned to follow the disappearance of a prominent labor leader The Federal investigator on the case decides that Gallagher the son of a wellknown gangster must know something about the disappearance and could be pressured by publicity into telling So he has his staff create an investigative file on Gallagher and arranges to have Miss Carter read it Although nothing in the file suggests Gallaghers guilt she assumes that the existence of the file means he is a suspect Thus duped the reporter proceeds to violate most of the rules that conscientious journalists follow In the course of the twohour film she consistently fails to look beyond the surface of the facts that are given her She makes no effort to check with Gallagher before writing that he is the key suspect in the inquiry she invades the privacy of a troubled young woman and she betrays a source to Gallagher with whom she then goes to bed and from whom she then confirms another story for her paper Absence of Malice was written by Kurt Leudtke who gave up a 20year career as a reporter and editor in 1979 to try his hand in Hollywood In an interview he insisted that he was not trying to describe the way the press normally works and if audiences take it for that then indeed its unfair in that it doesnt show a number of the very good very healthy things that the press does every day I hope nobody takes it that way It is no more a description of the whole craft than a bad cop movie is a description of all lawenforcement he said I dont walk out of a badcop movie saying what I have been told is that the police are bad people The bad cop movie is a familiar genre to American audiences while bad reporter movies are something of a rarity The Front Page Citizen Kane Ace in the Hole and Sweet Smell of Success were all skeptical of the process and the profession More recent films such as All the Presidents Men or The China Syndrome have been complimentary But as Absence of Malice suggests a less flattering view may become more common The 13 million movie which is being distributed by Columbia Pictures was produced and directed by Sidney Pollack in whose last film The Electric Horseman a ruthless television reporter is outsmarted before she can broadcast any damaging story Mr Leudtke who is 42 has had substantial exposure to the ways of newspapering beginning in 1961 at The Grand Rapids Mich Press and continuing through a stint as a reporter at The Miami Herald where some of the movies newsroom scenes were shot In 1965 he moved to Detroit where he was assistant city editor photo editor and assistant managing editor of The Free Press helping direct coverage of the Detroit riots that won a Pulitzer Prize in 1968 In 1973 he was named executive editor of the newspaper a post he held until the end of 1978 when he left to try his hand as a movie writer The incidents of reportorial or editorial wrongdoing in Absence of Malice Mr Leudtke said have reallife counterparts He said a real Megan Carter would have to write each of the three stories much as she does in the film because she is accurately reporting the facts she possesses Mr Leudtke said that virtually any reporter who had access to investigatory files would write the first story  identifying Gallagher as a key suspect in the presumed murder  as Miss Carter does He said the fact that Gallagher is a suspect in a major investigation is grounds enough for a story obviating the need for any further checking by the reporter Mr Leudtke cited the revelations of the Abscam investigation of Congressmen as a recent example of similar behavior by reporters In that case however the suspects were all public officials who have fewer rights of privacy The reporters did try to investigate their backgrounds and get comment and as the subsequent trials showed the investigative files had substance In the movie the newspapers decision to publish the first story is largely based on a legal issue whether the paper can be successfully sued It invokes a series of Supreme Court decisions that have held that a public figure must prove actual malice by a news organization to sustain a libel suit The newspapers lawyer counsels Miss Carter not to worry about whether her story is true only about whether Gallagher can recover damages We have no knowledge the story is false the lawyer says therefore we are absent malice We have been both reasonable and prudent therefore we are not negligent We may say what we like about Mr Gallagher and he is powerless to do us harm Democracy is served That scene particularly worries some journalists because while it is a reasonably accurate explanation of the law they say it will enourage moviegoers to think the press has used the decisions as a license for being irresponsible which they say emphatically they have not Editors and press lawyers also contest Mr Leudtkes view that the lawyers end up deciding what to publish and what to withhold or that the decision is made solely on the basis of whether they can be successfully sued One consequence of the Supreme Courts libel rulings Mr Leudtke said has been an increase in the cheerful willingness of reporters to allow unnamed sources to attack public figures and more recently to allow public figures to attack each other He said reporters have found not only that they are legally protected but also that its easier to get a story if they allow the sources to remain unidentified Many journalists agree After the discovery last spring that the Pulitzer Prizewinning story in The Washington Post was a composite and that the anonymous people it quoted did not exist editors around the country said they were tightening their rules against stories that relied on unidentified sources Most of them agreed that even wellregarded news organizations had allowed anonymously sourced stories too frequently and that it had contributed to an undermining of press credibility Mr Leudtke said a central point of the movie is that neither Miss Carter nor the public knows the real motivation of the source of her original story about Gallagher That is equally true in real news stories that quote unidentified sources he said adding I think that is very wrong I know a lot of journalists who think it is very wrong Miss Carters second story is prompted by a teacher at a Catholic school who begging for privacy confides that Gallagher a lifelong friend was with her in another city when the labor leader disappeared She remembers the date clearly she says because she was having an abortion Miss Carter rushes back to write apparently uncaring about the potential effect on the teacher whom she identifies in her story Mr Leudtke said that too was accurate He said a reporter who had come to harbor doubts about whether a criminal investigation was on target would certainly publish a story tending to exonerate a suspect particularly when the reporter had been responsible for an earlier story identifying the suspect The simplistic Miss Carter makes no effort to verify the womans story although normal journalistic practice would be to check for documents hotel records airline tickets etc that might confirm the account As in the reallife case of the rumor about bugging Blair House the important thing is not that somebody is willing to say something but whether the something has any basis in fact Throughout the movie the reporter is spurred on by an editor who tells her among other things that it is acceptable to invade the sources privacy because she has to choose between being truthful or hurtful Real editors say that is almost never the choice and would certainly not be the case if a reporter has diligently explored alternative ways of getting the facts In her third story Miss Carter reveals that the Federal investigator is scrutinizing the local prosecutor a fact she learns from a lawenforcement agent with whom she once had an affair She confirms the story from Gallagher with whom she is then sharing a bed Her story while correct as far as it goes misses the crucial point that the new investigation was stirred up by Gallagher as a way to clear himself All of the ethics codes warn journalists to avoid conflictofinterest situations where personal involvement might warp objectivity Mr Leudtke said that it would have been meaningless and showboaty for Miss Carter to disqualify herself from the Gallagher story but editors cite a colleagues maxim to the effect that reporters covering the circus must avoid romantic entanglements with the elephants He said one fact about the press that his movie did not explore but which rather fascinated him was the quite high and quite healthy level of internal criticism But Mr Leudtke said the press almost never reveals its own selfdoubts about journalistic practice refusing to tell tales out of school Now that he feels free to do that telling he is being attacked he said by newspeople who have just been infuriated and said Youre playing into the hands of the current mood of the country The public is going to rise up and strike us down and youve done a very damaging thing  But he said Watergate proved that even when the attack comes from the Oval Office the press will survive And indeed if a movie can do substantial damage to that institution then were all really in trouble But the doubts remain Even the beneficiaries of a gala premiere of the film in Washington today the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press have delicately disavowed the journalistic techniques Absence of Malice shows On the back of the 800 invitations it sent for the opening at the Kennedy Center the committee which provides legal defense services research and publications on a variety of free speech and freedom of information areas  noted this film ought to serve as a dramatic object lesson of the difficult and heavy obligation professional journalists have to be accurate and thorough while pursuing the free press values of the First Amendment
A PRODUCER OF THE PROVOCATIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/15/arts/a-producer-of-the-provocative.html,Herbert Brodkin has been producing television dramas for 30 years from programs for Playhouse 90 Studio One The Motorola TV Hour and The AlcoaGoodyear Playhouse during televisions socalled Golden Age of the 50s to The Defenders series Pueblo The Missiles of October and more recently FDR  The Last Year and Holocaust His nearly 600 shows have dealt with substantive and often provocative subjects Generally they have also garnered critical praise as well as high ratings Mr Brodkins latest production is Skokie starring Danny Kaye Eli Wallach John Rubinstein Lee Strasberg Carl Reiner and Kim Hunter which will be shown on CBS Tuesday evening at 8 It is a twoandahalfhour drama based on the attempt several years ago by a group of American Nazis to parade in a Chicago suburb heavily populated with survivors of World War II concentration camps Despite all his commendable credits Mr Brodkin remains a maverick in the television business a producer who by his own admission is often in trouble with the networks because he says I always say what I think And what he thinks can be summed up in his own version of Murphys Law If a network can destroy a show it will Television now is two things at once Mr Brodkin said Its the worst it has ever been and at the same time it is doing some of the best things its ever done Im speaking of shows like Roots and Playing for Time Hollywood applies its formula but a couple of things always come through if there is a gleam of creative persistence he added But most of what television does in the area of drama is despicable its criminal Many of the programs have a strong tiein to the problems in our society  the encouragement of violence sex drugs and disregard for laws These days quality television is something that has to be fought for Mr Brodkin observed Each network has a group of vice presidents and each vice president is in charge of a different kind of show series long dramas twohour specials moviesoftheweek he said And each one considers himself an expert in what these shows should be So the average producer has become trained to suggest the kind of shows these men have told him they are looking for But every now and then a producer will come along with a script he believes in and hell fight for it hell keep hammering away until the blind people see he said Unfortunately what were talking about here is about one percent of what gets on television The 68yearold producer who runs an independent Manhattanbased company called Titus Productions wistfully recalled what it was like before there were so many network executives to confront In the old days when I wanted to do something Id just do it he said One of every two projects I would dream up would get produced Now Im lucky if I get 10 percent of them on Next year another Brodkin program My Body My Child starring Vanessa Redgrave will be televised on ABC Like Skokie this show is topical and contains what the networks like to call social relevance In it Miss Redgrave portrays a devout Catholic who grapples with the issues of abortion and euthanasia My Body My Child was written by Louisa BurnsBisogno the original title was Lilac Season and was chosen from a contest that ABC has established through the National Playwrights Conference at the ONeill Theater Center in Waterford Conn This will be the fourth consecutive year that Mr Brodkin has produced for television a script picked from the contest Both Skokie and My Body My Child represent a reasonably satisfactory marriage of network and producer In fact Mr Brodkin is quick to praise ABC for sponsoring the playwrights competition which he feels is a laudable effort to get the work of younger writers on the home screen Skokie is more the work of veterans The director is Herbert Wise an Englishman whose credits include I Claudius The Norman Conquests and Rumpole of the Bailey all of which were seen in this country on public television Besides Mr Wise other key contributors were Robert Berger who has been an associate of Mr Brodkin since 1962 and the writer Ernest Kinoy who has Mr Brodkin said worked with me for so many years its frightening Mr Kinoy who wrote the teleplays for The Deadliest Season and several episodes of Roots has been a frequent collaborator of Mr Brodkin since the days of Alcoa Theater in the early 50s The seed of the idea for Skokie actually started at CBS The network came to us a few years back because they wanted to do a show about the Nazis in America Mr Brodkin said At first we shrugged it off There just wasnt anything to pin it to Then in 1978 this incident took place in Skokie and we felt we might have something There were however disagreements with the network on the form the show should take CBS wanted the actual characters portrayed Mr Brodkin preferred to fictionalize them We dont do documentaries he explained and in my mind what are called docudramas dont exist We like to take a real situation then create a drama out of it A compromise of sorts was reached For the most part the real persons involved were written into the script including Skokies Mayor Albert Smith played by Ed Flanders the ACLU representative in Chicago David Hamlin James Sutorius and the head of the AntiDefamation League in Chicago Abbot Rosen Carl Reiner But at the center of the story is the fictional family of Max Feldman played by Mr Kaye who like his wife Miss Hunter is a concentration camp survivor In the film Max Feldman is the catalyst for antiNazi sentiment among many of the residents of Skokie who dont feel they can sit quietly by while fanatics wearing brown shirts and swastikas march through their town John Rubinstein plays a Jewish lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union  based on the actual Jewish lawyer for the ACLU who strongly argues the Nazis case despite his personal contempt for them The entire incident is depicted as it happened Mr Brodkin said although we did have to make some concessions for the sake of drama For instance in reality there were three separate court procedures To try and explain them all would have made for a fairly pedestrian script so we used only excerpts For Mr Brodkin the word Hollywood signifies them as in us versus them Except for a brief spell on the West Coast when he was one of three producers for Playhouse 90 in the late 1950s he has been a steadfast New Yorker He considers it a symbol of his independence at a time when most of the television fraternity has long since resettled on the West Coast I am here because I like it here he explained And I intend to stay here I was in Hollywood recently and I was sufficiently horrified by what I saw People will actually sit there at meetings and in all seriousness tell you what should be done what shows will be a hit what shows will fail  before they are even made For much of his career Mr Brodkin has resisted various kinds of network pressure on the programs he has produced He has not always been successful but he has persevered For instance in the early 60s when he was producing The Defenders the dramatic series praised for addressing serious themes  there was still a blacklist in the television industry held over from the McCarthy era a decade before We were told by the networks who we could use and who we couldnt he recalled I didnt pay attention to those lists so I never discovered that Id hired someone who was blacklisted until he was already working for me When the network would tell me Id have to get rid of him Id tell them If you want him fired you come over here yourself and fire him Of course it never happened In 1959 Mr Brodkin produced Judgment at Nuremberg on Playhouse 90 It starred Claude Rains Paul Lukas and Melvyn Douglas and was directed by George Roy Hill The sponsor of the show was the American Gas Association which objected to the use of the word gas in references to the death chambers at the German concentration camps The sponsor wanted it deleted Mr Brodkin refused The sponsor got its way  but only behind Mr Brodkins back Although the program was televised live CBS delayed its transmission for a few seconds long enough for an engineer to bleep out the word gas each time it was mentioned I was sitting in my office right next to the studio while the show was going on Mr Brodkin recalled and I was watching a direct transmission without the delay It wasnt until it was over that I found out what had happened I was furious It is mostly with fondness however that Mr Brodkin remembers his days with Playhouse 90 the series that is generally considered the highwater mark of live television drama When they took it off the air in 1960 we had reached a peak he said and I often wonder what wouldve happened if wed kept going Now that weve lost live television it seems tragic because it will never happen again What would he suggest to improve the quality of current television fare I once asked Fred Silverman why he didnt just do away with all his programming departments and hire eight producers who could do whatever they wanted Mr Brodkin said I realize it was a naive suggestion in what has become a sophisticated business but wed end up with better shows
"Safety, Legal Abortion Are Not Synonymous",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/15/nyregion/l-safety-legal-abortion-are-not-synonymous-094069.html,Susan Schneiders article Antiabortion Plan Where Is Justice Sept 20 and Polly Rothsteins letter concerning that article Oct 4 require a response to serve the cause of justice Illegal abortion was and is a horror legal abortion is no less a horror Women did die from illegal abortion prior to Roe v Wade Jan 22 1973 more women die from legal  socalled safe and sound  abortion now and illegal abortion continues in the United States as it does in every other country that has legalized abortion Planned Parenthood the National Abortion Rights Action League and the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion tell us repeatedly that legality and safety are synonymous with regard to abortion That is simply untrue Even in the first trimester a woman undergoing abortion risks hemorrhage uterine perforation infection Rh sensitization and acute or chronic inflammatory conditions and is adversely prepared for possible future pregnancy with greatly increased chances of miscarriage permature birth ectopic pregnancy and sterility The Wynn Report is an important collection of scientific papers documenting physical and mental complications of induced abortion including firsttrimester procedures Its full title is Some Consequences of Induced Abortion to Children Born Subsequently by Margaret and Arthur Wynn 1972 Foundation for Education and Research in Child Bearing London Another important document is a 1978 Department of Health Education and Welfare study entitled A Propsective Study of the Effects of Induced Abortion on Subsequent Reproductive Functions The Wynns are proabortion physicians and the other study was prepared by a government agency therefore one could logically conclude that neither report was prepared from a prolife point of view yet each clearly demonstrates the manifold danger of legal abortion before as well as after the 12th week of pregnancy RighttoLifers care as much about the pregnant woman as we do her unborn child She has a right to be told about alternatives to abortion and about existing agencies that are ready and willing to help her She has a right to be protected from the exploitation of the 500 millionayear abortion industry According to Dr Bernard Nathanson a founding member of the abortion rights league and now a supporter of the National Right to Life Committee Human Life Amendment the abortion industry ranks as one of the top 10 industries in the United States Women are being used and abused as fodder for a multimillion dollar business The proposed human life amendment would protect pregnant women from being subjected to surgery that is not medically necessary ie abortion It would insure that 15 million babies will not be legally killed annually by abortion Every abortion kills a preborn baby The choice the proabortionists advocate is death Prolifers choose life Were all prochoice  either for life or for death The right of a woman to choose death for her unborn child is not rooted in the Constitution The Supreme Court gave women that right No woman should have the right to choose death for another human being When the Supreme Court gave women the right to abortion on demand for the full nine months of pregnancy it gave women a license to kill No woman should have a license to kill Liberty and license are not synonymous Prolifers seek responsible liberty and recognize the fact that every freedom entails a corresponding obligation Once a woman becomes pregnant her only choice is whether to have a live child or a dead one  to have her baby killed or allow her baby to be born alive It is not only the right of society and of that societys government to protect all innocent human life it is the obligation of society and the very purpose of that governments existence We must not solve problem pregnancies by killing unborn babies any more than we must solve poverty by killing the poor or disease by killing the infirm We must seek humane solutions for human problems we must respond with love compassion and  yes sacrifice When we prolifers lobbied to eliminate Medicaid financing of abortions from our New York State budget we made it clear to our legislators that we were willing to use that money and more if necessary to support and sustain human life rather than destroy it Concerning the health needs of women the proposed human life amendment clearly states that there is no ban on medical procedures required to prevent the death of the mother When the unborn child will once again be recognized as a legal person the mother will still retain the right to selfdefense The proposed amendment would insist however that all possible medical procedures be taken to save both lives Nevertheless a woman with cancer for example would receive the best medical treatment for her condition  whether that be chemotherapy radiation or hysterectomy Will women be prosecuted for miscarriage This is one of the scare tactics of the stoptheamendment proabortionists Miscarriages are involuntary acts of nature Even when nontherapeutic abortion was illegal in the United States women were never prosecuted for miscarriage Will the proposed amendment ban birth control The amendment in and of itself would have a very limited effect upon birthcontrol drugs and devices First all birthcontrol drugs and devices that are contraceptive rather than abortive in their actions would not be affected in any way These include the condom diaphragm spermicidal foam and some forms of the pill Second as a practical matter the proposed amendment without supportive legislation would only protect human beings known to be in existence Those birthcontrol drugs or devices whose action is in whole or in part abortifacient would not be directly affected by the passage of the amendment if their action occurs prior to positive evidence of pregnancy These could include forms of the pill such as the lowdose estrogen combination type the mini  a progesterone pill  and DES as well as the intrauterine contraceptive device Abortion is not simply a religious issue or a private personal decision It is a civil rights issue It is a matter of public morality affecting the common good All criminal law is the legislation of public morality and a moral wrong can never be a civil right PATRICIA W HATCHER Chairman Westchester Right to Life Committee  The Times welcomes letters from readers Letters for publication should include the writers name address and telephone

MAIL CALL ON CAPITOL HILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/15/magazine/mail-call-on-capitol-hill.html,Frequently exhorted to write your Senator an astonishing number of Americans respond with an average of three million pieces of mail a month A few hours past midnight every workday a United States Postal Service truck lumbers up Capitol Hill and heads for the Dirksen Senate Office Building to make the first of a dozen daily deliveries At about 330 AM a small mountain of mail is dropped at the loadingdock entrance to the United States Senate Post Office to await the arrival an hour later of the clerks who will sort and bundle it for delivery in carts that will roll through underground passages beneath and between the two Senate office buildings and up and down still empty corridors By 630 AM piles of mail will have been deposited in each of the 100 senators offices Although only totals are logged at the Senate Post Office postmaster Carolyn Worley observes that while the heaviest mail comes from the Northeast Florida and California no senator gets less than 700 or 800 pieces a week Recently appointed to the post after serving as assistant postmaster for four years Miss Worley the first woman to officially manage the Senates mail supervises a staff of 52 fulltime employees Her Democratic predecessor is now her assistant While not always a complete reflection of public opinion letters are generally welcomed by senators as indicators of what concerns their constituents But as I have observed first hand as the wife of the senior senator from New York dealing with the sheer mass of the correspondence presents legislators with one of their most pressing and difficult administrative problems Daniel Patrick Moynihans experience is a case in point Historically New Yorks senators have received the most mail but recently that received by the two members from California now the most populous state has become comparable in volume Senators from states large and small experience a dramatic increase in volume whenever matters of national concern such as the Federal budget dominate the news In only 10 days of April after the Reagan Administration announced it would seek cuts in the Social Security program Senator Moynihan received 37071 letters mostly against the proposal an amount almost equal to that of the previous month Every Senate office had a similar increase Some freshman senators then only a few months in office and still shaking down their office routines were hard put to cope with the volume After President Reagan proposed even further budget cuts in September there was a turn in the tide of support so far as New Yorkers were concerned with many even some affected by the spending cuts writing Senator Moynihan in favor of the proposals Four times a day a Senate postal messenger delivers a bundle averaging 12 pounds to Judi OMalley Nowottnick who supervises Senator Moynihans mail operation In a quick presort personal correspondence and printed matter is culled what remains averages out to 8000 constituent letters a week Regional offices in New York City Oneonta and Buffalo receive an additional 600 letters a week and there is a trickle of correspondence from constituents living abroad Much of the mail can be dealt with routinely Requests for Government publications or information for school projects are forwarded to the departments involved hundreds  occasionally thousands  of printed or form postcards on pending legislation are recorded by subject for future reference the strictly informative such as routine Coast Guard notices to members of Congress of changes in operating facilities are acknowledged and filed Roughly 100 letters each week requesting help with specific problems are forwarded directly to case workers in the Senators New York City office with each of them generating two or more additional letters before the problem is resolved In the four and a half years he has been in the Senate Pat Moynihans office has processed almost 19000 such cases And each week he receives about 85 invitations to speak at or attend civic community charitable or political functions only a few of which he can accept But the bulk of the mail is made up of handwritten letters from concerned citizens on foreign and national issues There are very few anonymous letters and surprisingly little moralizing The range of selfexpression is wide but almost all the letters are impressive for their conviction and as evidence of a wellinformed public It is impossible to draw a profile of the average letterwriting New Yorker The nations third largest dairy state the state with the countrys largest city and its most vocal electorate New York defies generalities as do its 176 million citizens Despite the disparate interests of his constituents however a comparison of Senator Moynihans mail for the first four months of three successive Congresses reveals two common themes a concern for personal freedom and a yearning for security The letters range from the idealistic  a former Peace Corpsman volunteering for a United Nations contingency force in Southwest Africa also known as Namibia citizens pleading for a world food reserve  to the moving and erudite  thoughtful essays on world affairs by an almost blind 96yearold resident of a nursing home pleas for legislation that would outlaw the use of leghold traps on wildlife a feasibility study of windmill use in the St Lawrence River valley by a physicist who operates a sheep farm in the area There are also letters from the ungenerous and the unliberal arguing against the boat people from Southeast Asia and for censorship and boycotts Truly heartbreaking letters come from old people anxious about having enough money to eke out survival in their declining years After a lifetime of work many possess little but their dignity and share the view of a man from Sidney NY who says Id rather die than go on welfare There is a consensus on Social Security People long a part of the work force feel it would be a breach of contract if the Government cut benefits or changed age requirements Many claim they were encouraged to retire early to make room for youngsters coming into the job market Which was indeed the rationale of the 1961 amendment to the Social Security law that provided for early retirement at age 62 These correspondents now fear they will be penalized for having cooperated with the Government Many people are angry like the Buffalo man who wrote I am damned sick and tired of being a patsy for every ill that befalls our country I grew up in the Depression era fought overseas during World War II spent over 30 years paying into Social Security and now when I am ready to retire the politicians want to cut me back No way should this happen On the abortion issue both sides claim personal freedom is at stake and passionately state their fundamentally different viewpoints A New York City woman recently wrote The greatest possession any being has is the physical body in which the spirit is housed and we must each of us  be honored as the sole protector of that physical shell No state or person can be given the right to legislate it for us A couple from Syracuse stated the opposing view A mothertobe has no more right to kill her unborn child than she would have to kill a child who was already born for whatever the reason Most letters on abortion contain long arguments that the other side contradicts its own position An upstate veterinarian wrote It seems incongruous that the same Congress which is concerned that every fertilized human ovum be carried to term no matter the environment into which it will be born will after the slightest amount of discussion appropriate huge amounts of money to develop  instruments of destruction which can snuff out the lives of millions of people within seconds The following argument made by a Long Island couple is a frequently repeated one Why is it that the voices that cry out the loudest against capital punishment are the same voices that plead for a womans unfettered right to kill her unborn child In 1977 and 1979 Senator Moynihans mail ran 2 to 1 against abortion but this changed in 1981 with the introduction of S158 by Senator Jesse A Helms Known as the human life amendment because it attempts to define when life begins S158 is also implicitly against some common forms of birth control Many New Yorkers who do not favor the right to abortion are in favor of birth control and oppose Government interference in what they consider a private matter At first the mail had been running 15 to 1 against S158 but recently it leaped to 30 to 1 against possibly as a result of campaigns launched by those in favor of planned parenthood It would however be a mistake to interpret the mail as a complete reflection of the publics view on a particular issue Gun control is such an example Immediately after the murder of John Lennon last December there was a great wave of highly emotional letters from thousands of younger citizens who had never before expressed an opinion on gun control The writers clearly felt a deep personal loss most were angry and demanded Federal legislation to control handguns But theirs was only a single wave of interest prompted by the tragic death of a beloved idol and Senator Moynihan no longer hears from Lennon fans about gun control Following the assassination attempt on President Reagan last March Pat Moynihan received 1514 letters favoring gun control and 52 opposing it All the letters seemed spontaneous and not part of organized mail campaigns Some issues of great interest to a senator may be all but ignored by his constituents Nuclear proliferation which Senator Moynihan feels is the most important issue of our time is a case in point In 1977 New Yorkers wrote more letters on the need to save the Alaskan timber wolf than about nuclear arms And although ratification of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks was pending during 1979 and he had been speaking on the subject for two years and had published a long article on the history of the negotiations Senator Moynihans office received a total of only 252 letters on the subject This was not because people were ignoring international events During this same period his office received about 5000 pieces of mail on the normalization of relations with China Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island has had similar experiences and over a longer period of time Along with former Senator Jacob K Javits of New York Senator Pell played a major role in passing the legislation that created the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities Since then he has maintained a keen interest in the endowments but throughout the 16 years of the endowments existence he has heard from only a handful of Rhode Islanders on the subject And during all four of his terms in the Senate Senator Pell who was cochairman of the Helsinki accords on European Security and Cooperation has had very little mail from his constituents on international human rights a matter of lifelong interest to him Except for a small flurry of letters on El Salvador the only foreignpolicy issue to generate much mail from New Yorkers this year has been the sale of Awacs to Saudi Arabia Between Aug 15 and Oct 28 the day of the Senate vote Senator Moynihan received a total of 4774 letters  963 in favor and 3811 opposed to the sale Of the favorable letters about 15 percent was corporate  ie representatives from national companies making a commercial and diplomatic argument supporting the President Corporate letters on any issue are usually sent to the entire Senate Another 37 percent was from individuals who apparently cared little about Saudi Arabia but expressed strong antiIsrael sentiments We cannot let Israel dictate American foreign policy and Begin has the US in his pocket A few correspondents expressed anxieties about oil supplies the rest gave no specific reason for their support A comparison of the Awacs mail to that on a similar Middle East issue the 1978 vote on the sale of F15 planes to Saudi Arabia shows a dramatic difference in support Although Senator Moynihan received 4969 letters  almost the same number as on Awacs only 1 in 51 approved the F15 sale as compared to the 1 in 4 that approved the sale of the Awacs Generally New Yorkers have focused on domestic issues in 1981 because of President Reagans concentration on economic issues While they agree in principle with efforts to balance the budget many people are expressing the fear that the Administrations projected budget cuts threaten their personal economic security The most articulate protests have been against cuts in studentloan programs the greatest number against cuts in community services and community health programs Whatever the subject letters demand attention and as promptly as possible But there is a real danger that a senators office may be swamped by a deluge of mail for the overcrowded warrens where Senate staff members labor are already awash in seas of paper  drafts of legislation interoffice memos briefs reports speeches While it is not possible for each Senator to maintain a battery of experts on the wide range of subjects that interest his constituents the 514 professionals of the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress who regularly aid members of Congress and committee staffs are available to meet most needs The research service estimates that at any one time about 25 of its staff members are involved in answering the 53000 constituent inquiries referred to them each year Even with this assistance a senators mail can easily become an unmitigated nightmare Ten years experience in the Senate with volume mail memory tapes recall systems microfilm files and computer letters has earned Judi OMalley Nowottnick at the age of 31 a reputation as one of the best professionals on Capitol Hill Before joining the Democratic Senator Moynihans staff when he came to the Senate in 1977 Mrs Nowottnick had worked for the Republican Senator Robert Taft Jr of Ohio Such switching about is fairly common on Capitol Hill where there is little partisan feeling among the experts who run the hightech machines of a modern mail operation In some of the less populous states this attitude is shared by the senators themselves  Howard W Cannon of Nevada a fourthterm Democrat maintains a joint mail setup with his junior Republican colleague Paul Laxalt Judi Nowottnick and her staff of 20 more than onethird of the Senators entire office staff managed to control the unprecedented spring deluge of budget mail without having to take on additional help When the volume threatened to double again and the office was inundated by hundreds of paper plates sent to protest cuts in the schoollunch program Mrs Nowottnick had to hire an additional person to help screen the mail At lunch time of his first day the new man quit saying he found it too depressing to read letters from hungry old people worried about Social Security Mrs Nowottnick notes that bad weather has a lot to do with increasing the number of letters people write and that there is always a predictable generally supportive surge in mail immediately following a television appearance by any President Thus after President Reagans speech on the economy in February the greater portion of the mail applauded his proposals but within 10 days the protest mail began to come in Although he would like to see all of his mail it is impossible for Senator Moynihan to read more than a fraction of it He relies heavily on the representative selections Mrs Nowottnick brings to his attention each week along with a detailed statistical breakdown of all the mail by subject A politicalscience major as a college undergraduate Mrs Nowottnick has sometimes spotted letters that have ended up by influencing the Senators policies A notable example involves a letter received in 1977 from Erik Johnsen then a senior research associate at the Technical Assistance Center at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh Although they had never met Mr Johnsen sent the Senator an analysis he had done of the financial relationship between the State of New York and the Federal Government It was the first breakdown to show that Federal outlays for foreign aid interest on the national debt and similar expenditures  some 14 billion in all  were being credited to the State of New York when deposited in New York City banks With the recognition that this procedure grossly distorted the actual returns to the state the argument for reappraising New Yorks share of the Federal outlays was greatly strengthened Spurred by Mr Johnsens revelation Senator Moynihan has published a yearly report since 1977 detailing the stateFederal financial relationship Unless a letter requires an individual response drafted by the Senator or a legislative assistant Mrs Nowottnick selects a standard reply generally composed by the legislative assistant working on the particular committee involved At first these replies were produced in the office on automatic typewriters but in mid1978 the operation became computerized Because of the priority he gives to his mail and the variety of his constituents interests Senator Moynihan has used as many as 1910 different form letters during the last three years About fourfifths of the Senators make use of the computercorrespondence system available to the Senate by contract with a private company The operators type the response code date name and address on terminals that are connected by telephone lines to the central computer Batches of 300 or more letters can be signed by autopen and automatically folded and mailed from the Senate print shop As official mail these letters go out with a frank  ie an authorized printed signature of the senator instead of a postage stamp The use of the frank on campaign literature is unlawful Because of the volume of mail Senator Moynihan receives and the space required for the machines to deal with it his mail operation has had to be located in the basement of the Russell Building where his office is on the fourth floor One windowless room hums with the sound of machines while in the adjoining room the only sound is that of paper being shuffled All incoming correspondence is transferred to microfilm which is filed on the Hill while the original letters are sent to a Senate storage facility in suburban Maryland for safekeeping until a few months after a Senator leaves office All correspondence is always instantly retrievable however as letters are coded and crossfiled by date subject matter and name and when needed copies can be printed out within seconds One of the computer terminals in Mrs Nowottnicks office deals exclusively with mailing lists coded by subject matter Letters informing his constituents of action on legislation of particular interest to them are mailed out by Senator Moynihan when the occasion dictates it A regular feature is a full legislative report at the end of each Congress Unlike many senators who served in prior elective Federal or state office Pat Moynihan who was a professor of government immediately prior to his election came to the Senate without a mailing list of constituents indexed by their concerns The 600000 names now on his list are those of people who have written to him on one subject or another By law these lists cannot be used for campaign or fundraising purposes This master mailing list is supplemented by breakout lists on particular subjects such as taxes As a member of the Finance Committee Senator Moynihan has spent a considerable amount of time on tax legislation Following the passage of the tax bill last summer all those on his tax mailing list received a letter informing them of the items included in the bill Each Senator receives a paper allotment based on the size of his constituency Most members use this to send out newsletters to their constituents apprizing them of important developments affecting them and to report on the Senators activities on their behalf Until recently Barry Goldwater the Arizona Republican had been a notable exception But earlier this year after almost 19 years in the Senate he sent out his first newsletter and has indicated that he would continue to do so on an irregular basis Senator Moynihan had also been a holdout but he too has taken up the practice and now sends out a moreorless monthly personally written newsletter As required by law of any mailing of more than 500 pieces newsletters must be registered with the Secretary of the Senate and filed with the Office of Public Record Mrs Nowottnick is deservedly proud of the way her mailroom staff deals with Senator Moynihans extraordinary mail load She and her staff are seldom fazed by volume or content but sometimes odd enclosures baffle them temporarily They dealt with the hundreds of tea bags sent as part of a taxation without representation protest by throwing them away because they did not know what the bags might contain but found a use for the blocks of wood that were dumped in the office after housing starts fell because of high interest rates when a staff member with a fireplace suggested they would make excellent kindling Within the last month several national associations presented the staff with an as yet unsolved storage problem by sending Senator Moynihan more than 400 old keys attached to postcards that contain the message Unlock the economy Whatever the protests and complaints the often emotional and always highly personal letters from constituents command respect from the Senator and his staff even when they are vituperous such as You turkey why are you against cutting Social Security or the veiled putdown from a New York retiree living in Miami With kindest regards and best wishes I hope that at the next election you will become an extinct species If Senator Moynihans constituent mail is added to that of the other 99 senators the 435 representatives and the thousands of state legislators across the country what quickly becomes selfevident is an involved citizenry The candid expression of opinion by Americans is unmatched in other Western democracies In England for example a longterm member of Parliament a member of the shadow cabinet receives only about 150 letters a week And in Sweden one of the bestknown and most respected members of the Riksdag the Swedish Parliament gets only about 10 letters a week from individuals and seldom more than 25 from business firms The continuous outpouring of constituent mail in the United States seems to contradict the conventional wisdom that the American public is apathetic While they may lack enthusiasm for political campaigns  voter participation during the 1980 Presidential election was 539 percent down from a 55 percent to 60 percent average during the last 20 years  their correspondence with legislators indicates that the public is concerned and wellinformed on issues of import Far from being apathetic millions of Americans are exercising a littlenoticed democratic privilege to a remarkable degree Writing a letter usually requires a greater commitment than pulling a lever yet the electorate seems prepared to make that effort time and again in a continuing exchange of mutual benefit

ACTION ON ANTIBUSING BILL PRESSED IN CONGRESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/16/us/action-on-antibusing-bill-pressed-in-congress.html,Efforts are gathering steam in Congress to pass legislation that would virtually ban busing as a way of desegregating public schools The Senate Judiciary Committee may vote this week on a bill by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah aimed at preventing courts from ordering busing even where proof of discrimination is found The bill would also allow Federal courts to review existing court orders which could wipe out many of the desegregation programs that have been operating for years Opponents of the Hatch bill count no more than six votes against it on the 17member committee and there is agreement on both sides of the issue that a consensus is likely to come on busing as a Senate staff aide put it In the House a petition to force a floor vote on a Constitutional amendment to prohibit busing now contains more than 200 of the 218 signatures necessary While few lawmakers will take the political risk these days of advocating busing a small band of liberals opposes the antibusing bills on the grounds that they would be unconstitutional and would set a bad precedent for stripping courts of jurisdiction in controversial areas Senate Liberals Vow Filibuster Senate liberals have vowed to filibuster any antibusing bills and with time running short in the current session they hope to delay any definitive action until next year David Landau an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union called the Hatch bill the most radical proposal on desegregation ever to come down the road If it is adopted he warned America will return to the days before Brown v Board of Education the Supreme Court case that outlawed segregation in public schools in 1954 Antibusing bills are only part of an active effort by conservative lawmakers to press action on many socalled social issues including abortion and organized prayer in schools Senator Howard H Baker Jr the majority leader has been trying to keep these issues off the Senate floor while President Reagans economic program was still being considered But an aide to the Tennessee Republican said of Senate conservatives The pressure is getting too great Pressure From Conservatives This pressure is coming in part from conservative activists who feel deeply about the issues and say they have waited long enough Its evident said Paul Weyrich the head of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress that we are going to have to grapple with budget cuts and economic issues for several years not for part of one session That can no longer be used as an excuse The time is right to move on these issues The parliamentary maneuvering took a new turn late last month when Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina succeeded in placing three bills dealing with the main social issues on the Senate calendar This means that the bills can be called up at any time without going through the normal committee process Senator Baker has now promised to permit a free standing debate on the social issues later this year or perhaps early next year But even some staunch conservatives fear that such a debate could paralyze the Senate I Dread the Difficulty I have mixed feelings admitted Senator William L Armstrong Republican of Colorado This whole batch of social issues are terribly important but the debate and ultimate passage will be agonizing and difficult On one hand I understand the urgency for moving ahead but on the other I dread the difficulty of it On the abortion issue Senator Hatch is now pressing for a constitutional amendment that would overturn the Supreme Court decision permitting abortion and that would allow Congress and the states to pass specific laws on the subject However there are deep divisions among the prolife advocates on what direction to take and Senator Helms says that no antiabortion legislation will go forward until there is a higher degree of unity Prayer in schools has also been placed on the back burner and does not seem to command the emotional reactions of the other two issues Conservatives favor legislation that would override a Supreme Court banning organized prayer in schools As a result antibusing legislation has emerged as the No 1 priority of conservative forces according to Senator Helms In addition to the Hatch bill Senator Helms and Senator J Bennett Johnston Democrat of Louisiana are promoting a more modest bill that would simply prohibit courts from ordering children to attend any school but the one in their neighborhood Bill Was Offered as a Rider When this measure was offered as a rider to an appropriations bill for the Justice Department it was subjected to a threemonth filibuster led by Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut The Weicker filibuster was finally broken the amendment was accepted and the bill was then laid aside But it could be brought up at any time and provide an alternative to the Hatch bill The fate of the social issues could well be determined by President Reagan who continues to support the cause with rhetoric but not with political muscle
BISHOPS DEBATE STRATEGY ON ABORTION BATTLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/17/us/bishops-debate-strategy-on-abortion-battle.html,An unexpected debate over strategies to combat legalized abortion erupted at todays opening session of the annual meeting of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops At issue was the decision by the Administrative Committee of the Conference to throw the support of the entire group of bishops behind a proposal by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah that would give Congress and state legislatures the power to determine abortion laws Since the backing of the bishops for the amendment was announced on Nov 5 before the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution by Terence Cardinal Cooke of New York and Archbishop John R Roach president of the bishops conference the decision has faced growing opposition from righttolife advocates who believe the Hatch proposal weakens the antiabortion stand Strategy of Proponents Proponents of the decision have defended the amendment on the grounds that it was a politically expedient strategy and only the first step in a broader effort to ban abortion altogether At the first full meeting of the bishops since the Administrative Committee acted on its behalf in September dissatisfaction was voiced over the decision indicating considerable unrest among the bishops over the best means to achieve their common goal of overturning the Supreme Court decision of 1973 upholding the right to abortion Most of those familiar with the situation say they believe that unanimity among the bishops on a course of action is a key to the success of any attack on abortion and that the emergence of dissension could pose a major problem However it was just such dissension that became apparent today as a number of speakers rose to question Cardinal Cookes report on the policy decision to the conference Defending the Administrative Committee action Cardinal Cooke chairman of the bishops Prolife Committee called the Hatch amendment morally sound and argued that it was the most effective step we could take at this time Cardinal Cooke continued As years go by with the constant promotion of an abortion mentality something has to be done If we do not move we might have to wait a long long time before another move could be made Weakening Stand Discerned Other bishops contended that support for the Hatch proposal had contradicted previous opposition by the conference to a states rights approach to the issue and charged that the move shifted the discussion away from the past insistence by the bishops that an antiabortion amendment be based on the principle that the fetus is a person endowed with constitutional human rights Humberto Cardinal Medeiros of Boston noting that it is very painful for me to take this stand was among those who asserted that backing for the Hatch amendment was not consistent with the position voiced by us in 1974 in testimony before the Senate that seemingly rejected the states rights option I feel that with my flock in the Archdiocese of Boston Cardinal Medeiros continued I wont be able to tell them why weve changed I wont be able to tell them why weve changed he added In my conscience at this point I dont see how I could endorse the present bill Another complaint was that the entire hierarchy should have been more involved in reaching a policy decision Rather than receiving the information on a matter of great concern to all of us from a telegram said Bishop Thomas Welsh of Arlington Va referring to the means used to relay the decision six weeks ago there must have been some way to poll us
"SENATE CONFIRMS KOOP, 68-24",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/17/us/senate-confirms-koop-68-24.html,The Senate today confirmed Dr C Everett Koop a pediatric surgeon who is a prominent foe of abortion to be United States Surgeon General and director of the Public Health Service The vote after less than an hour of debate was 68 to 24 Dr Koops opposition to abortion was scarcely mentioned But Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts who led the opposition charged that Dr Koop had cruel outdated and patronizing stereotypes of women and was so out of touch on womens roles that his nomination should be defeated Dr Koop 65 years old former surgeon in chief at Childrens Hospital in Philadelphia where he once succesfully separated Siamese twins has been Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health since President Reagan disclosed his intention to nominate him months ago Hailed as WorldRenowned Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee who managed the nomination in the Senate and Senator Mark O Hatfield Republican of Oregon called Dr Koop worldrenowned There has been no evidence not even an allegation that Dr Koop has ever treated a woman colleague unfairly Mr Hatch said Further testimony was provided to the opposite Dr Koop has been supportive of women professionals Much of the opposition centered first on Dr Koops opposition to abortion and then his public health credentials Senator Charles McC Mathias Jr Republican of Maryland charged that Dr Koop has no specialized training or experience in public health Mr Hatch and Mr Hatfield said that Dr Koop had extensive public health experience in Africa Mexico the Dominican Republic Poland and other European Asian and underdeveloped countries Mr Hatch said the state health officers of Alabama and Pennsylvania had testified that Dr Koop had significant public health experience
FOREMAN FIGHTS FROM THE PULPIT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/17/sports/foreman-fights-from-the-pulpit.html,Once George Foreman stood in a boxing ring in the nation of Zaire and saw countless faces stretching to the horizon Now he stands in a makeshift chapel in the scrubpine woods of Houston and he can count the missing as easily as the present The ones who sat here theyre gone he says in the chanting rhythm of the Southern preacher The ones who stood over there theyre gone Thats all right Once he was the heavyweight champion of the world with a following of millions yet he kept silent because in those days I had nothing to say Now that he has undergone what he terms a searing spiritual rebirth  after dying in his dressing room  he has a message he wants to share with the world Last Wednesday night only 21 persons attended the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in a tiny house not far from the airport And the roundfaced preacher admitted This is a good night Gone is the somber champion whose cheekbones and stare were equally stony George Foreman is a moonfaced softie who bounces up and down while preaching with almost no trace of the slugger who won 42 of 47 fights by knockouts  and who challenged the world outside the ring as well He was kind of broodish says James Wingo who remained loyal to Foreman after a recent split in the congregation In the old days George liked to throw parties but hed have these bodyguards to keep him away from people Hed listen to you but hed be ready to get on you if you said something wrong I didnt know he had changed until I went to see him He was cleanheaded talking about the Lord Instead of being broodish he was real gentle It scared me Foreman says people are often scared by conversion by change But he prefers himself today to the winedrinking scuffler he was as a teenager Boxing was a way out of streetfighting and he became a public paragon waving the American flag at the 1968 Olympics being marketed as an antidote to the Black Muslim convert and draft resister Muhammad Ali But Foreman acknowledges that he was empty inside as he roared undefeated to the heavyweight title and the match with Ali in Zaire in 1974 I always believed in God but not in Jesus he said I didnt want to take any chances with any kind of God I investigated Islam Buddhism Christianity I got to Zaire and I said My God should come from here and I got so scared I hid my Bible under a bed I didnt want to offend anybody His Career Went Downhill He lost that fight to Ali If Ali wants to think he beat me thats all right I just got tired and by 1977 he was hearing rumors that he had no stamina because most of his fights had ended early He says he toyed with Jimmy Young on a steamy March night in Puerto Rico and at the end of the 12 rounds Young was declared the winner I didnt care he says I just wanted to get back to my dressing room I was tired I knew I could beat him In the dressing room I felt my life slipping away I was in a dark place the saddest darkest tunnel you can imagine I could smell death I heard God asking me Why are you afraid to die I said I would give my money to charity if God would let me live But I heard God say I dont want money I want you  Foreman says the doctors later told him he had suffered from hallucinations and heat prostration and dehydration He says he died and was born again At first he says I thought I could be a fighting evangelist giving glory to God in the ring But the more I thought about it I could not fight anymore Im not putting down boxing But I could not do it He returned to the Fifth Ward in Houston where he had once cruised in his 56000 RollsRoyce trying to impress his street buddies He had no training as a preacher no background in any church His first sermon was a direct imitation of a teenage preacher Dexter Wilson who now plays guitar in Foremans tiny congregation Formed His Own Church For a time Foreman was allied with two white preachers who had a thriving congregation He says he gave more than 160000 to that church but later broke away because he claims women were being urged to seek abortions Then he formed his own church We had so many people they were standing in the back he said the other night I was going to raise money for a modern building until I remembered the words from a song just a plain and simple chapel where humble people go to pray I realized you dont need a big building to have a church Why ask a poor old widow on food stamps to give 10 percent of her money to a church People need food not some fancy building But its funny Some people think a church should have money We lost a lot of people because I wouldnt pass around the plate I just put it on the side and let people give donations if they wanted We lost more people when I said you didnt have to marry somebody with the same beliefs as you I see people in this church with no husband or wife I said Marry somebody for yourself Well pray your husband or wife comes to church but you come first That got people mad and a lot more left The remaining members say they are not attracted by George Foreman former champion but by the humble preacher They have seen him turn down sevenfigure offers to make comebacks Still only 32 Foreman shakes his head when he hears about Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali planning comebacks in December He says It must be money because you dont go back to boxing because youre lonely When I was in the ring that was the loneliest place in the world for me Ali made so much money and now hes going to embarrass everybody who applauded him Its terrible I can hardly understand Ali when he talks I think hes pretty unhappy with his life but he doesnt know how to change He came to visit me one time and I prayed for him Im glad I lost to him in Zaire because maybe Id be making a comeback and hed be preaching Im happier this way Well Off Financially Although he says he lost millions of dollars to advisers and bad investments and high living Foreman says he escaped the Joe Louis thing the tax problems At times he has been described as penniless and working at odd jobs to support himself but Foreman said last week I have enough money invested to make me independently wealthy the rest of my life I work because I believe in working The former champion lives with his 8yearold daughter from his first marriage Michi a serious child who reads the Bible while her father is preaching He says he supports three other children by three women who were not his wives The other night Foreman told his congregation I believe in marriage and Ill get married again I believe but he confided to a reporter that he had been married for two months now to a woman from California He expressed doubts the marriage would last because its hard to stay married to a preacher Recently Foreman has been getting offers to make speeches to civic groups about how dreams come true in America He says he thinks he will tone down his religious message in those paid appearances but adds My faith is always part of me He has been running a mile or two every day he says dropping from 275 pounds to around 250 which is what I used to weigh when I wasnt training for a fight He says he thinks he could push hmself physically for a comeback but adds When I try to make a fist my fingers just turn into a wave I cant take off my shirt and go into a ring and hit somebody The only time I could fight would be if somebody tried to mug me Ive had boxing This is better

SENATE RESTRICTS SUITS ON PRAYERS IN THE SCHOOLS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/17/us/senate-restricts-suits-on-prayers-in-the-schools.html,The Senate voted today to endorse programs of voluntary prayer in public schools Opponents of the legislation immediately announced that they would stage a filibuster against them Specifically the Senate voted to bar the Justice Department from using Federal funds to prevent the implementation of programs of voluntary prayer and meditation in the public schools The legislation was an amendment to an appropriations bill for the department Most cases challenging school prayer programs in various states have been brought by individuals and the Justice Department has had almost no role in this area of litigation Thus if it becomes law the legislation adopted today would have little practical impact but it clearly indicated the widespread sentiment in Congress in favor of allowing some sort of group prayer in public schools Both sides agreed that the measure would have significant symbolic value and could encourage in the public schools the sort of organized worship that has been outlawed by the Supreme Court since 1962 as an unconstitutional establishment of religion Such worship includes mandatory prayers and Bible reading The Court has not forbidden voluntary silent prayers or meditation in classrooms In matters of religion the Justices have held firmly to the neutrality of the First Amendment Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof Since the Courts decisions there have been numerous unsuccessful attempts to reinstate prayer on a voluntary basis Emotions boiled over in the tense debate and at one point Senator Ernest F Hollings Democrat of South Carolina referred to Senator Howard M Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio as the Senator from Bnai Brith Senator Metzenbaum is Jewish and Bnai Brith is a Jewish service organization Senator Hollings quickly apologized after objections were raised but Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr the Connecticut Republican who leads the forces opposing the bill said the remark might have been a good thing It makes us all understand why religion should not be debated on this floor Senator Weicker asserted The key vote today came on a motion by Senator Weicker who proposed that the Justice Department be barred solely from moving against programs that the Court has ruled to be constitutional But since the Court has ruled that most organized prayer programs are unconstitutional the Weicker amendment would have had the effect of leaving the current legal situation unchanged Weicker May Lead Fiibuster After the Weicker amendment lost 51 to 34 the Connecticut Republican denounced the legislation as an outrageous unconstitutional action and said he would lead a filibuster against it The language eventually approved part of the 86 billion appropriations bill for the State Justice and Commerce Departments has also passed the House If Mr Weickers filibuster succeeds and the appropriations bill is blocked those departments would have to be financed by a continuing resolution Like the rest of the Government those departments run out of money on Friday In leading the fight against Mr Weickers amendment Senator Hollings asserted that the Supreme Court had misinterpreted the Constitution when it banned organized worship in schools Rather than allow freedom of religion shouted the South Carolina Democrat theyve forbid any religion whatsoever Prayer Never Courts Business Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina said that if the Weicker amendment passed the Federal courts would get the message to keep on doing what they are doing  meddling in something that was never their business in the first place In rebuttal Senator Weicker said that without his amendment all wed be doing is inviting the states and local governments to produce all sorts of unconstitutional prayer programs Asked why his amendment lost Mr Weicker said after the vote that extreme points of view single points of view are getting elected and are now in the majority in the Senate Liberals and moderates do not have the votes to win anything in the Senate he added but can only delay fights until after the 1982 election and hope that more moderate voices are returned by the voters Todays debate is part of a growing effort by conservative lawmakers to press for action on the socalled social issues  abortion and school busing as well as school prayer Senator Howard H Baker Jr the majority leader has tried to sidetrack these questions while Congress was still debating President Reagans economic program Senator Metzenbaum argued today that the Senate should not be wasting time on social issues while the economy is upside down But Senator Helms and his allies have already attached an antibusing rider on the authorization bill for the Justice Department A filibuster by Senator Weicker delayed that legislation for months
PRELATE APPEALS FOR ARMS CURBS AND AID TO POOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/18/us/prelate-appeals-for-arms-curbs-and-aid-to-poor.html,Archibishop John R Roach president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops urged the bishops today to spearhead a campaign for social justice that advocated a halt to the arms race a ban on abortion and more aid for the poor The call is expected to signal a new round of activisim on a number of issues Excerpts from speech page B4 by the leaders of the nations 50 million Roman Catholics In his address to the annual meeting of the bishops Archibshop Roach outlined a threepoint agenda that has emerged among members of the hierarchy in recent months partly as a result of the Reagan Administrations budget cuts in social programs and growing opposition in the church to nuclear arms The church must raise its voice clearly about justice because choices now before us as a nation can erode the conditions which support human dignity Archbishop Roach declared Today those of us who visibly represent a religious vision must be clear about our task Rational Standards Cited In setting forth the agenda Archbishop Roach upheld the churchs right to seek political goals and defended the right of Moral Majority or any religious organization to address the public issues of the day But religious organizations should be subjected to the same standards of rational rigorous presentation of their views as any other participant in the public debate he said The Archbishops views reflect a wider reappraisal of the relationship between religion and politics that has been generated largely by the rise of political activism among such fundamentalist groups as Moral Majority Forceful Appeal Is Made While Catholic bishops have generally refrained from criticizing the legitimacy of the activities of these groups they have at the same time laid down political objectives with moral overtones that often are at variance with the goals of the fundamentalists For example most fundamentalist activists have favored both an arms buildup and cuts in social programs while the bishops have increasingly protested both of these objectives Archbishop Roach used forceful words in his appeal for social justice and received a standing ovation at the conclusion of the adress Asserting that Catholics involvement in politics must be based on the dignity of the human person and that social justice represented an integral part of the churchs ministry the Archbishop affirmed the principle of separation of church and state but added We should not accept or allow the separation of church and state to be used to separate the church from society On the arms race Archbishop Roach added his voice to the growing outcry in the church against nuclear arms The church needs to say no clearly and decisively to the use of nuclear arms he said Urging the bishops to base their policies and pastoral guidance on this conviction he said It is not useful to blur the line of moral argument about the use of nuclear weapons at a time when the secular debate is openly discussing the use of limited nuclear weapons and winnable nuclear wars The Archbishop linked proposals for increased military spending to the worsening plight of the poor The proposed expenditure of 15 trillion for defense over the next five years stands in stark contrast to budget cuts which threaten the food the health care and the education of the poor he said Declaring that private agencies of the nation cannot fill the gap created by recent cuts he said We will do our part but our own social teaching calls upon the state to do its part Hatch Proposal Endorsed While Archbishop Roachs general call for an end to abortion was applauded his endorsement of a proposed constitutional amendment now in Congress came amid controversy over the merits of backing that approach Several bishops have expressed serious reservations about the amendment proposed by Senator Orrin G Hatch which would empower Congress and states to adopt laws regulating abortion on the ground that it would compromise the principle of seeking an absolute prohibition of abortion As advanced by Senator Hatch a Utah Republican the proposed amendment would overturn a Supreme Court decision in 1973 upholding the right to abortion To the dismay of those favoring an outright ban on abortion the administrative committee of the Conference of Bishops recently voted to support the Hatch proposal But supporters of the proposed amendment regard it as a political step in the right direction Terming the horror of legalized permissive abortion tragically real Archbishop Roach called the Hatch proposal a realistic constitutional remedy which holds out hope for undoing the damage done by the abortion decision

EXCERPTS FROM THE ADDRESS BY ARCHBISHOP ROACH,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/18/us/excerpts-from-the-address-by-archbishop-roach.html,Following are excerpts from an address today by Archbishop John Roach of Minneapolis president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops at the groups meeting here A focal point in the debate about religion and politics has been the role played by Moral Majority Some have argued that Moral Majoritys role is an example of why religion and politics should be kept absolutely separate and religious organizations should be silent on political questions I reject this contention while defending the right of Moral Majority or any religious organization to address the public issues of the day The right of religious organizations of varying views to speak must be defended by all who understand the meaning of religious liberty and the social role of religion But religious organizations should be subjected to the same standards of rational rigorous presentation of their views as any other participant in the public debate These same standards of discourse are the ones by which our position should be judged Neither the rigor of reasonable argument nor the controversy which surrounds the role of religion and politics should make us timid about stating and defending public positions and key issues Allow me to indicate the direction of a consistent moral vision rooted in Catholic social thought On a global scale the most dangerous moral issue in the public order today is the nuclear arms race The church in the United States has a special responsibility to address this question a responsibility underscored by Pope John Paul in his remarks at the White House in 1979 Moral Urgency About Arms Race It is an unhappy fact that strategic arms control discussions are presently stalemated even as the technological and strategic dynamics of the arms race proceeds It is perhaps the convergence of these two themes which has moved a number of American bishops to address the arms race recently in terms that are both prophetic and profoundly important Certainly the sense of moral urgency about the arms race is what stands behind the establishment of our Committee on War and PeaceWithout prejudging the complex work of that committee as it sets our future direction on the arms race it is useful to say clearly what we already know from Catholic teaching The church needs to say no clearly and decisively to the use of nuclear arms It is not useful to blur the line of moral argument about the use of nuclear weapons at a time when the secular debate is openly discussing the use of limited nuclear weapons and winnable nuclear wars Second the abortion issue The horrors of nuclear war though hardly fantasies are possibilities at present But the horror of legalized permissive abortion is tragically real Time to Say Enough Nearly nine years after the Supreme Court decision of 1973 initiated this carnage who can doubt that it is time to say Enough Human dignity and human rights are mocked by this scandal The concept of just law is mocked by the evasions used to create and continue it There is thank God some reason for encouragement at present Our elected representatives increasingly recognize the need to correct the situation As you know Senate hearings are now taking place on proposals for this purpose Our conference has recently given its support to one of these a realistic constitutional remedy which holds out hope for undoing the damage done by the abortion decision Law of course is not the total solution to the evil of abortion We remain committed to the proclamation of the Gospel message concerning sanctity of human life and to the practical steps and programs required to eradicate the conditions which cause some to turn to abortion as a solution to personal or social problems But we also recognize the need for remedy in law in order to undo the harm done under the guise of law Without this the sanctity of human life can only be a hollow phrase Third the poor among us The proposed expenditure of 15 trillion dollars for defense over the next five years stands in stark contrast to budget cuts which threaten the food the health care and the education of the poor In the past it was presumed in the United States that we could spend whatever we decided for defense and still be a compassionate society That assumption is today denied in fact what is spent for guns directly reduces what is available for the quality of care and life for the least among us We know from experience the impossible choices the poor face in our society  not between guns and butter but between bread and rent between money for heating oil and the need to pay for health care for children We know also that private agencies of the nation cannot fill the gap created by recent cuts We will do our part but our own social teaching calls upon the state to do its part Religion and politics always come back to the person to the way society respects or fails to respect a person The church must raise its voice clearly about justice because choices now before us as a nation can erode the conditions which support human dignity Today those of us who visibly represent a religious vision must be clear about our task We must carry forward the debate about religion and politics because both have a central contribution to make to preserving all that is valuable in the life of each person and the lives of all the people who constitute this society
WOMEN'S VOTES ARE A REAGAN WOE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/19/us/women-s-votes-are-a-reagan-woe.html,President Reagan has a women problem and it seems to be spreading to other Republicans Thats the message Republicans are taking from recent poll findings Mr Reagans difficulties in getting through politically to women threaten the partys goals of gaining seats in the House next year and of becoming the dominant political party in the country for the long term political professionals say Two parts of this political equation have been obvious for months Polls have shown that women are significantly less likely than men to approve of Mr Reagans handling of the Presidency and they are much more likely than men to call themselves Democrats But there had been a critical unknown at least until this months elections Did those general attitudes translate into votes The answer in governors races in New Jersey and especially in Virginia was that women were voting Democratic more solidly than men Political Committees Concerned Whatever the local variables those returns spurred concern here and reinforced the worries of the two most important political committees whose candidates have been planning to run as Reagan allies in 1982 the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee which is run incidentally by a woman Nancy Sinnott The Senate committee is warning incumbents to make their own records on womens issues so they can be distinguished from Mr Reagan The House group is making this issue a major element in a national poll it is undertaking The fact that women are less taken with Mr Reagan than are men is beyond dispute For example the September New York TimesCBS News Poll showed that while 61 percent of men approved his handling of the Presidency just 46 percent of women did A year ago when the TimesCBS News Election Day exit poll showed Mr Reagan defeating Mr Carter 55 to 36 percent his margin among women was only two percentage points 47 to 45 Mr Reagan is not suffering alone His party while gaining men is going nowhere with women By September the number of men saying they were Republican was marginally higher 46 to 42 percent Women have usually been a bit more inclined than men to identify themselves as Democrats but the difference has become stark in September women were decisively Democratic 53 to 35 percent Independents who said they leaned to a party in this TimesCBS News Poll were counted with allout adherents Problems of Identity Party identification affects votes most of all when candidates are relatively unknown according to Robert M Teeter president of Market Opinion Research a leading Republican polling company That means trouble for Republicans in the House elections 1982s principal battleground political professionals believe There is agreement on the fact of the problem and its menacing implication for the Republicans But there is no consensus on its causes and therefore on what Republicans might do to cure or salve the irritant or how Democrats can exploit it A senior Presidential adviser said the problem began last year with the fear of Mr Reagan as a candidate who might be reckless about war and peace a worry that in 1980 was expressed 50 percent more often by women than by men The way to attack the problem now he said is that Reagan is going to have to develop a compassion issue So far he said the issues of his Presidency have played more to mens concerns Economic leadership he said appeals to men while women dont understand interest rates as well as men Need to Appoint Women Compassion may be the touchstone agreed Mary Louise Smith the only woman ever to serve as Republican national chairman But she also said that Mr Reagan needed more women in high positions to get that theme through A blunter argument came from another Republican woman Kathy Wilson chairman of the National Womens Political Caucus She said that Mr Reagans opposition to such feminist causes as abortion and the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution was costing her party votes If Reagan doesnt wake up to women she said I think the Republican Partys time in the sun is going to be brief One feminist politicians fear is anothers hope Ann F Lewis political director of the Democratic National Committee saw the Presidents weakness with women as a major Democratic asset She said that the cause was policy particularly economic policy Women are economically vulnerable she said Women are more dependent on Social Security than men are and his Social Security policy scared them The budget cuts hurt women in particular too What Polls Show on Issues Of this collection of suggested causes from feminist issues to compassion to Social Security to Mr Reagan as a potential warmaker the TimesCBS News Polls provided confirmation only for the continuing impact of the warpeace issue The polls dont disprove the other explanations but they diminish them If the problem were Mr Reagans alone it might well wear off by 1984 if he avoids war Initiatives like todays call for barring mediumrange missiles in Europe might help in domestic politics whatever their international impact But other Republicans cant wait They have to run in 1982 Vincent Breglio executive director of the Senate campaign committee thinks that senatorial candidates especially incumbents can immunize themselves from catching Mr Reagans problem just by talking on those issues themselves But for the House the lower visibility of Congressional campaigns may make that difficult In the past either as Governor of California or as a 1980 Presidential candidate Mr Reagan did not appear to drag other Republicans down But the attention focused on him as President is immeasurably more intense So now he seems to be painful proof of an assertion that his top political aide Lyn Nofziger often makes This President has coattails
BISHOPS SUPPORT PLAN BY HATCH TO CURB ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/19/us/bishops-support-plan-by-hatch-to-curb-abortions.html,The Roman Catholic bishops of the United States closed ranks today and affirmed support for a constitutional amendment proposed by Senator Orrin G Hatch of Utah that would authorize Congress and individual states to regulate abortion The action followed two days of lobbying to mollify several bishops who objected to the Hatch approach on the ground that it fell too far short of the bishops goal of a total ban on abortion In September the administrative committee of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops endorsed the Utah Republicans proposal on behalf of the entire conference marking the first time that the bishops have formally thrown their support behind a specific political strategy on the issue But at the annual meeting of the conference this week several bishops dissented from the administrative committees stand after it was explained to the group by Terence Cardinal Cooke of New York chairman of the bishops Pro Life Committee Talks with the dissenting bishops produced a nearly unanimous vote in favor of a resolution backing the original administrative committee action The lone holdout was Bishop Joseph Sullivan of Baton Rogue La who had earlier complained that the Hatch strategy could lead to the deaths of fetuses that happened to be in the wrong state at the wrong time In another development the bishops amplified opposition to the nuclear arms race that was introduced Tuesday in an address by Archbishop John R Roach president of the conference Archbishop Joseph L Bernardin of Cincinnati led the way by reporting from the bishops Committee on War and Peace that it was drafting a pastoral letter on the subject He called for a sweeping examination of the subject that would pay heed to pacifist teachings among others and seek to formulate a positive theology of peace Response to the report was mostly favorable although some bishops expressed reservations about the growing resolve among the hierarchy to press for disarmament Bishop Edward W ORourke of Peoria Ill warned the bishops against being stampeded toward total condemnation of nuclear arms and willingness to endorse unilateral disarmament By contrast most bishops enthusiastically approved the committees aims as well as Archbishop Roachs stand against the arms race We are not military or political strategists said Bishop Leroy Mathieseen of Amarillo Tex who recently caused a controversy by opposing the neutron bomb which is scheduled to be assembled in his diocese We are Catholic bishops dedicated to the Prince of Peace Bishop Mathiessen said adding that condemnation of nuclear madness must be accompanied by a drive for social justice  Senate to Delay Abortion Bill WASHINGTON Nov 18 AP  Senate conservatives have agreed not to push for a vote this year on a bill designed to reverse a decision by the Supreme Court in 1973 that upheld the right to abortion Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina is the chief sponsor of the abortion bill which would define life as beginning at conception and give an unborn child constitutional rights He has maneuvered the bill to the Senate calendar making it possible to force an abortion debate by years end Senator Hatch chairman of a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee has been holding hearings on a competing bill a proposed constitutional amendment that would permit Congress and the states to share jurisdiction over abortion The Senator said in an interview that it would be better to wait for next year adding that he expected the Senate to work on abortion legislation in February or March Other sources said Senator Helms would probably force a vote in January
CATHOLIC BISHOPS CRITICIZE AID TO EL SALVADOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/20/us/catholic-bishops-criticize-aid-to-el-salvador.html,Calling for political instead of military solutions in troubled Central American nations the National Conference of Catholic Bishops today renewed its appeal for an end to all United States military assistance to El Salvador and urged the Reagan Administration to maintain economic aid to Nicaragua We support political measures in El Salvador even as we continue to oppose US military assistance to El Salvador the resolution said The resolution also pressed for political means of ending tensions in Guatemala and expressed alarm at violations of human rights throughout the region Describing the statement as moderate Bishop Mark Hurley of Santa Rosa Calif said there was a great necessity for the bishops to address the crisis in Central America Political Answers Preferred We do not believe in a military solution Bishop Hurley said We believe in a political solution The appeal followed a protest against armaments that developed in the four days of meetings concluded today Though it arose in the form of opposition to nuclear arms the bishops concern broadened to embrace a number of issues of war and peace and health care and poverty related to the basic concept of the dignity of human life Archbishop John R Roach the conference president said that the combined impact of deliberations made the meeting the most momentous in his 10 years in the hierarchy He said that the bishops had gone beyond just voicing general concerns to a position of advocacy for the poor and a commitment to study the practical issues of war and peace Moved Beyond Abortion Issue It was Archbishop Roachs presidential address earlier in the week that helped set the tone of the discussions by challenging the bishops to seek a halt to the arms race a ban on abortion and increased aid for the poor The greatest source of friction grew out of differing strategies for fighting abortion Before the meetings the administrative committee had endorsed a proposal by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah to give Congress and the state legislatures the power to make abortion policy But several bishops balked at the administrative committees decision arguing that it compromised the goal of total prohibition of abortion Though most dissenting bishops were persuaded to go along with a vote of support for the Hatch amendment differences remain These differences combined with a rejection of the Hatch approach by many antiabortion activists left the debate in disarray Meanwhile Senator Hatch citing the friction said Wednesday that he would postpone action on the amendment until next year Abortion Strategies Divisive Archbishop Roach conceded that the division is there over the best means of reversing the Supreme Courts 1973 decision on abortion It is a reality and our job together with other peole is to try to rally people in the prolife movement as much as we can Archbishop Roach said He called the postponement by Senator Hatch an index of the fact that there is work to be done He repeated the belief of many bishops that the Hatch amendment is the best alternative on the ground that it was the most politically achievable If it failed he said well try to find another vehicle The document on Central America underscored the hierarchys deepening concern for a part of the world where many priests religious and laypeople are risking their lives in struggles for social justice On El Salvador the bishops both decried all outside military assistance and urged the United States to grant political asylum to El Salvadoran refugees Referring to Nicaragua the bishops emphasized the need for the Sandinista government to protect human and religious rights and cautioned against a United States foreign policy that would be designed to isolate Nicaragua
Prescription for Dr. Koop,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/21/opinion/prescription-for-dr-koop.html,Dr C Everett Koop is a pediatric surgeon of fine reputation and a man of many opinions An opponent of abortion he has characterized amniocentesis as a searchanddestroy mission and chided mainline Protestant denominations that support abortion for their superficial theology  lack of morality  and depravity He is also wary of feminism once telling a high school class that it was too bad they were graduating in a time when women are told they must be liberated  and fight for their rights What he is not is a physician with significant experience in the field of public health And for that reason he is the first nominee for Surgeon General of the United States ever opposed by the American Public Health Association That opposition however was not enough to prevent his confirmation With an end to the controversy however its hard to know exactly what Dr Koop will do in his new post The Surgeon General is the nations leading spokesman on public health issues but decisionmaking functions were transferred in 1966 to the office of the Assistant Secretary for Health And Dr Koop has promised not to use his position as a pulpit for antiabortion views There are some constructive ways he can use his pulpit We hope that he will speak out on health issues about which he has already shown concern problems of the disabled and the aging he will oversee the planned White House Conference on Aging And given his statement that the evidence  in reference to lung cancer is absolutely unassailable we also hope that Dr Koop will continue his predecessors campaign against cigarette smoking
THE CATHOLIC HIERARCHY'S DEVISIVE NEW ACTIVISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/21/opinion/l-the-catholic-hierarchy-s-devisive-new-activism-101734.html,To the Editor Msgr Vincent A Yzermans OpEd article of Nov 14 A Catholic Revolution highlights the everwidening gap between the individual Catholic and his cloistered and detached church leadership In the face of the most massive military buildup in the history of the world by the Soviet Union these bishops demand unilateral disarmament They condemn even the threat of the use of nuclear force and imply that this will become official doctrine of the United States Catholic Church and exclusion from the church might face those who fail to comply with their utopian ideals There are two points here to which we must address ourselves The first is the effects of such a move on our part visavis those against whom we have undertaken our military policy in the first place The answer is obvious to all but a few naive individuals who for one reason or another have chosen to ignore both the political philosophy of the Soviet Union and the activities of the Soviet military within the last 30 years This we can summarily dismiss as moot since the likelihood of any rational and responsible Government acquiescing in such a strategy rapidly approaches zero The second and more pressing question for Catholics is the effects of Monsignor Yzermans own particular activism and the implications of what he as an individual and those like him do and say When reading his rhetorical question What will be the reaction of various Catholic leaders military officials and Government officials when and if the bishops say formally and officially that unilateral disarmament is the primary moral objective  one is immediately struck by the mans delusion that it would have any effect at all But then I am a Catholic and know that a chuckle at any religion is a right perhaps a virtue Others are not however and the strain that John F Kennedys Catholicism placed upon his candidacy for the Presidency should be enough to preclude this type of melodrama Monsignor Yzermans simile reducing the controversy surrounding abortion and other issues between church and state to a childs sparkler on the Fourth of July when compared to this new area of controversy grossly understates the case but in ways and with respect to persons that I doubt the monsignor understands The fire I fear would be quenched for he and those he supports would have crossed the fine line as it is almost always a fine line in religious matters between realistic analysis and idealistic advocacy The subsequent loss of credibility should disarmament be deemed the official primary moral imperative would be devastating among all but the most devout Catholics This is not to say that I wish them behind the closed doors of cathedrals hushed away in enforced inaction They like all men of good will serve the rest of humanity with a vocal conscience I only ask that they do not mindlessly advocate the imposition of inaction on the rest of us Reasonable analysis should bear fruit to reasonable solutions It does not follow however that the threat of nuclear incineration being an unreasonable situation should give rise to unreasonable solutions THOMAS J TROY Seaford NY Nov 14 1981
PAPANDREOU TO REVEAL POLICIES TODAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/22/world/papandreou-to-reveal-policies-today.html,Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will present his Socialist Governments program to Parliament on Sunday in a speech that could clarify Greeces position on key foreign policy issues such as a possible withdrawal from NATO and the European Common Market and the future of American bases here Since coming to power with the sweeping victory of his Panhellenic Socialist Movement on Oct 18 Mr Papandreou has deliberately maintained an ambiguous stand on his Governments intentions regarding the partys election promises on those issues The program should give a clearer view on the basic question of whether Mr Papandreou intends to maintain Greeces traditional ties with the West or swing to thirdworld nonalignment as he favored when his party known as Pasok was in opposition Tomorrows policy speech will prove that Pasok is not abandoning any of its declared positions in the economy foreign policy and other sectors the official Government spokesman Dimitrios Maroudas said today in a briefing for the Greek press Vote of Confidence Scheduled Political sources believe that the Prime Minister will remain vague on certain key foreign policy matters to retain flexibility in forthcoming negotiations with his European and American partners After two days debate the Governments program will be put to a vote of confidence Tuesday night The Socialists are not expected to have any trouble with the program since they have a clear majority in Parliament with 170 seats compared to 112 for the conservative opposition the New Democracy Party 13 for the Communists and 5 for the independents Mr Papandreou has come under attack by the former ruling New Democracy Party for not taking a clear stand on issues such as NATO and the Common Market Specifically New Democracy would like to receive reassurances that the Government does not intend to leave the Western camp but is merely preparing strong positions for negotiations Program Remains a Secret The proMoscow Communist Party has generally backed the Government but it did accuse the Socialists of backing down on their original positions on NATO the Common Market and the American bases Mr Papandreou has maintained secrecy around his Governments program and there have been virtually no leaks on his foreign policy positions In his speech the Prime Minister is expected to be more explicit on his domestic program In their first month in power the Socialists have sought to keep their promise of being a government of change by issuing administrative orders and announcing legislation aimed at significantly altering this traditionally conservative country Included in the new Governments list of legislation to be introduced in Parliament which convened on Wednesday are bills to legalize abortion introduce civil marriage abolish capital punishment establish a 40hour workweek and lower the voting age from 21 to 18 Leftist Resistance Recognized The political changes already put into effect would hardly have been possible during the rule of the antiCommunist conservative regimes that governed Greece from the end of World War II until the Socialist victory Soon after taking office on Oct 21 the Socialists granted official recognition to the leftist resistance that opposed the Nazi occupation of Greece It then abolished all anniversary celebrations marking rightist ordeals or victories during the Greek civil war from 1944 to 1949 The Papandreou Government has also announced that it aims to permit the return within the next two years of some 30000 Greek refugees who fled to Eastern Europe after the defeat of the Communists in the civil war By contrast fewer than 22000 refugees were allowed back since 1974 by conservative governments which argued that mass repatriaton would provoke economic dislocation and personal political vendettas from rightists Police Given Right to Unionize Ioannis Skoularikis the Public Order Minister has said that in his first three weeks of considering refugee cases he approved the return of 174 people and would soon accept 600 more The Government has announced that it had decided to grant the police the right to unionize Other changes made by administrative order have involved the staterun television and radio networks which have traditionally been instruments of government propaganda Though the new Government has heavily staffed them with Socialists news broadcasts now report the activities of all political parties Two of three censorship boards have been abolished and the works of previously blacklisted artists are being broadcast A oncebanned film on the 1974 trial of members of the former junta which criticized the postwar political order is a screen success Files to Be Abolished The Government plans to abolish security police files on citizens and to introduce legislation loosening restrictions on the activities of labor unions and civil servants In the field of education the Government has abolished special examinations for advancement from the third to the fourth year of secondary school ruling that acceptable grades are sufficient It also plans to do away with the highly competitive exams to universities The Government has also declared that the establishment of equal rights for women is a top priority The previous Government headed by Prime Minister George Rallis introduced a bill to abolish the marriage dowry and the husbands position as head of the family but Parliament did not consider the bill before the election The Socialists say they will go much further in the bill they plan to introduce by recognizing such demands as an equal share of wealth acquired during marriage even if developed only as a result of the husbands profession Church Opposition Expected The Greek Orthodox Church is expected to put up strong opposition to the Governments plans for introducing civil marriage One of the aims of the change Government officials say is to end the problems faced by thousands of Greeks married to foreigners in civil ceremonies abroad whose marriages are considered invalid here Officials say the Government eventually wants to expropriate much of the churchs property mainly to distribute it to agricultural cooperatives and to solve housing problems for lowerincome groups Most of the programs initiated so far are costfree and do not involve the vast outlays expected later The Government says it will find money for its programs through a crackdown on tax evasion which it says amounts to about 28 billion a year The opposition says the figure is exaggerated and that the Government will have to resort to heavy taxation to get the revenue needed

FOLKSY CHARACTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/22/books/folksy-characters.html,TRAILERPARK By Russell Banks 242 pp Boston Houghton Mifflin Co 1195 By IVAN GOLD IN this his sixth book of fiction Russell Banks explores the lives of the people who live in the Granite State Trailerpark situated a mile and a half north of the mill town of Catamount NH pop 5000 on scenic Skitter Lake 90 miles north of Boston and 50 miles south of the White Mountains This is Banks country and in 13 interwoven stories some as brief as six pages some novella length he limns it well The park itself consists of 12 pastelcolored trailers most of which at any given time are occupied none of which are going anywhere The Granite State Realty Development Corporation developed the site installing a leach field and septic tanks only when pressured to do so replacing trailers destroyed by fire to its present extent but finds it expedient to go no further The inhabitants are a motley crew widowers and widows drunks and divorcees a bisexual bachelor a retired military man a black brother and sister a hip drug dealer Some have grown up in the area and never left others have gone away and returned and some like the two blacks Terry and Carol Constant and the young pusher Bruce Severance dont seem to belong there at all But no one rightly belongs in a state of transience frozen into permanence Its true of trailerparks the author observes that the people who live there are generally alone at the center of their lives Perhaps no one is more so than Flora Pease in The Guinea Pig Lady the first and longest of the stories She floats around in a state of benign dottiness until one day she begins to raise guinea pigs and threatens to inundate the park with the animals and their stink and their wastes Proof against all argument she finally solves the problem herself by anonymously burning her trailer to the ground As a story The Guinea Pig Lady might have been more succinctly told but Mr Banks uses the ramble to fill the reader in on the other inhabitants and to provide some history of the region and the town One of the characters who tries without success to  Ivan Gold is the author of Sick Friends a novel and Nickel Miseries short stories He lives in Boston reason with the guinea pig lady is Capt Dewey Knox United States Army retired Ineffectual a meddler Knox seems fated to bumble in and out of other peoples stories so that it comes as something of a shock to discover toward the end of the book that he has one of his own The Right Way describes events that befell Dewey Knox 50 years before when he watched his father succumb to the effects of bootleg liquor and lose an armwrestling contest The sequence affects the boy profoundly reinforces his rigidity and perhaps in some way prefigures his military career and the buffoon he will become But having read this story when it first appeared in the Boston Globe magazine I found it less effective as part of the tapestry of Trailerpark than it was standing on its own The Right Way is one of several stories that unfold without noticeable authorial intrusion Another is Black Man and White Woman in Dark Green Rowboat  which rings some interesting ironic changes on Hemingways Hills Like White Elephants in this case the man is black and its the woman who wants the abortion Dis Bwoy Him Gwan in which the hippie gets himself killed as a result of trying to sell to his West Indian connection the marijuana that grows wild around the trailer camp is an eerie menacing tale that Banks allows to tell itself But many of the stories are burdened by a vague folksy narrator who constantly pokes a finger at you so that the temptation for me was to keep glancing over my shoulder It may surprise you that orchids actually appear in these latitudes but they do Sometimes you dream that you are walking across a meadow under a cloudless blue sky Now heres where you start to get to the point of the story This imprecise crackerbarrel tone and the equally arbitrary departures from it are accompanied by sometimes illuminating more often disorienting leaps in time For example The Fisherman the last long story in the book tells what went on when the bibulous muchmarried loner Merle Ring won 50000 in the state lottery the old man apparently couldnt care less but the proximity of so much ready cash had a devastating effect on the residents of the trailerpark This story contains some marvelously rendered scenes of fishing through the ice from a bobhouse a hut outfitted for the purpose chilly evocations of a New Hampshire winter but the events here described turn out to have occurred sometime in the past and I found the resurrection of Bruce Severance the previously murdered hippie particularly disconcerting The most memorable character in the book  and if you or I can come away from a work of fiction with a character who will still inhabit your head a month or so down the road that aint insignificant  does not live at the trailerpark at all With his paunch Vandyke beard rosy complexion wise real estate investments and artistic temperament Dr Wickshaw has been town physician in Catamount for over 25 years He is responsible for luring the black nurse Carol Constant to Gods Country the name of the best story in the book and is as lecherous now as he was 20 years earlier when he cost a boy his life in the story The Child Screams and Looks Back at You by misdiagnosing spinal meningitis as the flu in his hurry to create an opportunity to make a grab for the childs mother at the door Read Trailerpark as you would a novel  from the beginning straight through to the end suggests the dust jacket a bit too helpfully Im not sure in this case that it matters  or is even wise
POINT MAN FOR THE RIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/22/weekinreview/point-man-for-the-right.html,Take many of the controversial social issues that have been simmering all year on Capitol Hill and the odds are that Senator Orrin G Hatch a Republican from Utah whos nearing the end of his first term is somehow involved Hatch is moving on all fronts said a Senate staff assistant The doctrinaire rightwing side of him is determined to do something on all these issues Someone has to carry the flag and hes willing to do it Since January when his party took control of the Senate Mr Hatch has presided over two panels that handle a large portion of the more controversial items on Congresss domestic agenda  the Education and Labor Committee and the constitution subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee Due in large part to disagreements among conservatives many of the social issues will apparently be left to simmer a while longer Last week at the urging of Mr Hatch and another prominent conservative Republican Jesse Helms of North Carolina fullfledged debate on proposed amendments restricting a womans right to an abortion was delayed until next year The rush to take up antibusing and prayerintheschool measures appeared to have eased as well Whenever those issues surface though Mr Hatch an aggressive ambitious man who as much as anything resembles a minister making his rounds  is certain to be in the middle of the fray carrying the flag Thats been his style since he arrived in Washington after his surprising upset in 1976 over the incumbent Democratic Senator Frank E Moss In a sense Mr Hatch was an outrider for the laterarriving wave of conservatives from the Far West who now dominate the Senate Some of his first legislative campaigns were against such liberal touchstones as labor law reform and fair housing legislation But since assuming his two chairmanships Mr Hatch seems to have made a determined effort to soften his image Hardly an ally of organized labor he met with union leaders and listened patiently to their complaints A foe of the Equal Rights Amendment he held hearings on employment discrimination against women While extolling the virtues of free enterprise he nonetheless supported Federal funding for the Jobs Corps and education for the handicapped Unskilled minority youths are the biggest problem America has he says adding There are certain programs we just have to help people with But to many of his liberal critics Mr Hatch hasnt changed his spots To them he remains a doctrinaire ideologue who only becomes increasingly threatening as he burnishes his political skills Hes obviously using his committee to bring to the floor all these pat conservative projects said Senator Lowell F Weicker Jr a Republican from Connecticut He has these philosophical Mt Everests he has to climb The conservatives are unloading all these things theyve been sitting on for years and you cant blame them Legislative Kneecapping Adds Ralph Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights The Senator always tries to give the impression that he is approaching everything in a reasonable way but that doesnt detract from the crippling nature of the amendments hes offered on many civil rights issues The major issues with which the Utah Republican is now deeply involved include the following  Abortion Senator Hatch has conducted hearings on a constitutional amendment of his design which would overturn the Supreme Court decision permitting abortion and allow the states and Congress to adopt detailed restrictions Last week the National Conference of Catholic Bishops reiterated its support for the Hatch approach which some conservatives say isnt tough enough  Busing The Judiciary Committee within a few days may consider a Hatch bill that would prevent Federal judges from ordering the busing of school children as a remedy for racial discrimination and permit the reopening of cases decided in the past Im against forced busing as a matter of principle the Senator said It causes white flight it hurts blacks and minorities and it deteriorates school systems David Landau an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union accuses Senator Hatch of displaying a total disregard for the role of the Federal courts Moreover the attorney adds the Hatch busing bill represents the most concerted attack on civil rights since Brown v Board of Education the 1954 decision that outlawed school segregation  Affirmative Action In the senators view affirmative action demeans minorities and amounts to a new form of slavery He admits that his proposed constitutional amendment to outlaw affirmative action will not pass but he is supporting efforts by the Reagan Administration to limit enforcement of affirmative action guidelines throughout the Federal Government Liberals say that instead of using his powerful position to expand individual rights Mr Hatch is cutting back on those rights  Voting Rights Mr Hatch plans to hold hearings in January on the Voting Rights Act and he favors an amendment that would ban racial discrimination only if intentional bias can be proved Civil rights forces say such an amendment would cripple the act The senator is also the prime sponsor of a bill to restrict access to Government data under the Freedom of Information Act and of still another constitutional amendment that would mandate a balanced Federal budget Some Democrats looking ahead to next years elections when Mr Hatch must defend his seat say that his widening reputation as a professional conservative might

think we can resolve them by being afraid of them
Ideas and Trends; Flank Attack On Prayer Ban,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/22/weekinreview/ideas-and-trends-flank-attack-on-prayer-ban.html,The barriers that keep organized religion out of public schools came under a fresh if somewhat oblique assault last week on Capitol Hill Acting on an appropriations bill the Senate voted to bar the Justice Department from using Federal funds to prevent the implementation of voluntary prayer and meditation in the public schools The Supreme Court outlawed mandatory prayer and Bible readings in public schools in 1962 as an unconstitutional establishment of religion There have been many attempts to reinstate prayer on a voluntary basis but they have generally failed to pass constitutional scrutiny Since the Justice Department has had little to do with cases challenging school prayer the legislation would probably have little practical effect But it was a symbolic victory for conservative legislators whose strategies on social issues have included proposals to strip the Supreme Court and other Federal courts of jurisdiction in cases involving busing abortion and school prayer Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr the Connecticut Republican said it was an outrageous unconstitutional action and that extreme points of view single points of view  are now in the majority in the Senate But Senator Ernest F Hollings Democrat of South Carolina argued that the Justices had misinterpreted the Constitution Rather than allow freedom of religion he said they forbid any religion whatsoever Sen Hollings who referred to Senator Howard M Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio as the Senator from Bnai Brith later apologized saying the remark was made in a moment of levity
HISTORIAN LINKS FREUD AND WIFE'S SISTER AS LOVERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/22/us/historian-links-freud-and-wife-s-sister-as-lovers.html,Sigmund Freud and his wifes sister Minna Bernays were probably lovers a historian has asserted after restudying some of Freuds writings and retracing a trip to Italy that the two made in 1900 The historian Peter J Swales contended that there were further indications she may have become pregnant and had an abortion and that their relationship had an effect on Freuds work which is now being reexamined in light of newly emerging personal correspondence and other documents Mr Swales a selftaught independent Freud scholar and researcher made the assertions in a lecture Wednesday night at the clinical psychology program of New York University Psychologists psychiatrists and analysts in the audience called the case compelling but some said they wanted more time to study the material Others called the facts inconclusive and contended that Freud may at most have fantasized a sexual relationship with the younger sister of his wife Martha Finds No Hint of Intimacy Another scholar Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson who was recently dismissed as projects director of the Sigmund Freud Archives and who has been at odds with Mr Swales said that unpublished letters he had seen from Freud to Miss Bernays betrayed no hint of sexual intimacy Freuds close relationship with his sisterinlaw who never married and who lived with the Freud family for almost 50 years has long been a subject of speculation by scholars Freuds sympathetic official biographer Ernst Jones ruled out any love affair But Carl Jung Freuds leading disciple before their angry break is said to have told an interviewer that Miss Bernays once confided that she had had a sexual relationship with Freud In his lecture Mr Swales a 33yearold Britishborn New Yorker who helped compile a book on Freuds early experiments with cocaine noted that in the summer of 1900 Freud traveled with his wife and sisterinlaw from Vienna to Trafoi and Merano in Italy His wife returned home and Freud and Miss Bernays traveled to Lake Maggiore and then back to Merano where according to Mr Joness 1953 biography Miss Bernays was to pass some time in the hope of recovering from her tuberculosis Curiously said Mr Swales Miss Bernays was never before reported to have had tuberculosis although a brother and her fiance died of it Nor was the spa at Merano believed to be effective for tuberculosis Mr Swales who said he followed their footsteps to Merano and other stops in 1978 said he found records confirming Miss Bernayss presence at a leading Merano spa for two weeks in September and then at another nearby hotel for more than four months It was at this time Mr Swales theorized that Miss Bernays may have undergone an abortion Sees Clue in Book by Freud He postulated her pregnancy he said on reexamination of an analysis Freud included in his book The Psychopathology of Everyday Life which Mr Swaless Germanspeaking wife Julia had retranslated into what Mr Swales describes as a more literally faithful version than had previously been available In the episode Freud related how he had unraveled the hidden meaning of a companions mental block against remembering a certain line from Virgils Aeneid Freud showed that the blockage stemmed from the Latin word aliquis someone  with associations of liquefying blood and ultimately fear that the companions purported Italian mistress might have missed her menstrual period and become pregnant and might require an abortion Mr Swales contended that clues liberally sprinkled throughout the text and evident to Freud scholars established convincingly that the young companion was a fiction and that the subject was Freud himself Elsewhere in same book Mr Swales cited a passage in which Freud wrote of drawing 300 kronen then about 62 from the bank which I wanted to send to a relative absent for purposes of cure Freud also wrote There is no doubt that I regretted this expenditure And in another booklet On Dreams published shortly after the Italian trip Mr Swales noted Freud analyzed one of his own dreams of eroticism guilt and regret He recalled taking cab drives with the relative in question and yearning I wish I might for once experience love that cost me nothing Regretting the expenditure again Freud wrote Yet I can honestly say that when I decided to spend this sum of money I did not hesitate for a moment Freud Kept a Secret Why Freud declined to say I should be obliged to betray many things which had better remain my secret Freuds Italian trip and purported affair with Miss Bernays coincided with one of his most productive work periods Mr Swales asserted Leo Goldberger professor of clinical psychology at New York University who is director of its Research Center for Mental Health and editor of the journal Psychoanalysis and Contemporary Thought introduced the talk and later said he was impressed by the compellingness of the evidence However he said he wanted to do very very careful detailed study to see that nothing was taken out of context An analyst Milton Klein called the reconstruction nothing short of brilliant But he said This is not the Freud that I know and he suggested that Freud may only have fantasized an affair Frank R Hartman a Manhattan psychiatrist said the talk cast a new light on Freuds Psychopathology work and offered an astonishing glimpse of Freuds creativity
THE BISHOPS TAKE A RISK; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/23/us/the-bishops-take-a-risk-news-analysis.html,Many bishops and others present at last weeks meeting of the Roman Catholic hierarchy of the United States say they believe it was a remarkable turning point in the American churchs stance on a cluster of social issues In the meeting the bishops took a new and riskier course of action A trio of themes enunciated by Archbishop John R Roach in his address as president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops are central to the new agenda They include fullfledged opposition to nuclear weapons specific legal tactics for attacking abortion and determination to fight for the poor affected by Reagan Administration budget cuts The outcome of the meeting in Washington left many participants mildly astonished Never before had the bishops stood so firmly against the use of nuclear arms several prelates not only marveled over this shift but began referring to their institution as the peace church A Consistent Theology of Life This cause together with rising concern over the plight of the poor and the continuing commitment to combat abortion gave the meeting urgency and significance What unites these issues is the deepening conviction of church leaders that the theology of human dignity and the protection of life once focused mainly on the abortion issue must be extended to such areas as war and peace political oppression and poverty Some would say that the bishops have moved beyond the opinions of a large number of the 50 million American Catholics particularly in their advocacy of disarmament and more aid for the poor If this is so one could expect increased dissension in the church Already varying groups within the church are criticizing the bishops Liberals while happy with the stands on poverty and nuclear arms are uneasy about the decision to support legislative measures against legalized abortion Conservatives pleased with the bishops overall objectives on abortion are dismayed by their sentiments on weapons and welfare For our position on the right to life we were dubbed rightwing said Bishop Mark Hurley of Santa Ana Calif in a discussion of the various responses and now for our position on the arms race well probably be called left wingers But we have been thoroughly consistent on the right to life from womb to tomb While all the social action items provoke debate in the church no issue has been so emotionally discussed as the goal of finding a means of limiting abortions The bishops official adoption of a strategy has introduced new strains in the churchs structure Controversy swirled around the decision by the administrative committee of the bishops conference to endorse the proposal of Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah giving Congress and the states the right to make abortion policy It was the first such backing for a specific political approach The decision did not sit well with bishops who heard of it after the fact in a telegram sent to nonmembers of the committee The objectors said there should have been wider consultation before the decision Others said the Hatch amendment was a wholly inadequate means of seeking a total ban Critics Call It a Compromise But defenders of the decision said that hasty action was called for because time was running short in a Congress that was felt likely to favor restrictive legislation Advocates also argued that the Hatch proposal was a realistic first step But many bishops including Humberto Cardinal Medeiros of Boston criticized the Hatch strategy as an unacceptable compromise In the past the bishops steadfastly refused to back any abortion amendment that failed to term the fetus a person with constitutional rights The Hatch amendment contained no such wording To back down for practical purposes was in the view of many Catholics unworthy of the church From the dissent it was evident that the matter had been poorly managed As segments of the antiabortion movement intensified their opposition to the Hatch proposal Senator Hatch said that he would postpone a vote until next year Thus ironically the bishops action set off the dissent that further postponed attainment of the goal In addition to deepening divisions among Catholics the bishops position on the Hatch amendment added to ecumenical problems It put the church at odds with the coalition of Protestants and Jews who favor legalized abortion As bills against abortion have been introduced in Congress the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights made up of a range of religious bodies has stepped up a campaign for leaving abortion to the decision of the individual conscience Episcopalians Presbyterians Reform Jews and United Methodists are among partners in the coalition By contrast most of these religious bodies applauded the bishops strong endorsement of aid for the poor and limitation of nuclear arms
A TWO POLITICIAN FAMILY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/24/style/a-two-politician-family.html,When Marilyn Stoughton Lewis wife of the Secretary of Transportation Drew Lewis was offered the post of deputy protocol officer in the early days of the Reagan Administration she was unable to decide whether to take it It would have been such fun to work with Lee Annenberg she said a note of regret creeping into her husky voice as she referred to Leonore Annenberg who is Chief of Protocol for the State Department I even accepted the job But a budget vote was coming up in the House and there are 203 members and it takes all 102 Republicans to pass any bill I decided I had been elected to fill a job and I just couldnt put my wishes first The House she was referring to is the Pennsylvania House of Representatives where she is serving her second term as one of 10 members who are women She spends considerable time on the road traveling between the Lewises Watergate apartment here Harrisburg the state capital and their 150acre farm in the Pennsylvania Dutch countryside at Schwenksville where they both grew up I had never had a career before so this is a new experience for me said Mrs Lewis who described her entry into politics as totally unplanned Whole Family Pitched In When her husband a businessman ran unsuccessfully for the Pennsylvania governorship in 1974 the entire family which includes three grown children campaigned I traveled along doing all the handshaking but no speechmaking she said I never dreamed of becoming a politician myself but in 1978 the legislator in our district retired and I had moaned and groaned for so long about people getting involved in politics that the next thing I knew I was running Winning easily in what was a traditionally Republican rural district she was helped she said by her familys long involvement in community and church work and the fact that I was Drews wife She and her husband characterize themselves as fiscal conservatives and are in philosophical agreement on most issues But we do differ at times on the particulars she said Mr Lewis citing her vote as the only Republican to reject the Republicanproposed budget thus defeating it said Marilyn consults with me occasionally but she ends up doing what she wants to do Shes been an extremely independent legislator If I had been in her position I would have voted with the Republicans Mr and Mrs Lewis are pilots She began taking lessons in 1975 to combat a phobia about heights and a tremendous fear of flying and she said she is still a whiteknuckles flier when it comes to commercial trips She used to fly daily for fun in the familys Cessna 172 but in July 1980 while landing on a grass strip on their farm she miscalculated the wind caught the nose wheel in telephone wires and landed upside down between her neighbors house and the swimming pool I totaled the plane and it got us more publicity than when Drew ran for governor she said adding that she went up again immediately Its like a bad dive she said You just have to go up again Mrs Lewis at age 50 exudes an easy confidence She is she said a little older and wiser than her 49yearold husband From the moment I met him in the ninth grade I knew I was going to marry him she said He wore corduroy knickers with twoway pockets and was the captain of the baseball team He was the type who was always president of his class and the big catch During their freshman year at college  he was at Haverford she at Harcum Junior College and they were both 18  they eloped to Elkton Md It was the day before Drews math exam and he flunked she said but when he graduated four years later he was in the top 10 percent of his class so see what I did for him Mrs Lewis never completed college and says she has no regrets I felt I got my education through Drew she said I was the one who typed and read all his papers and I fed everyone who came to our place to study The feminist movement she says has been particularly helpful to the women in the 35to55 age bracket who have so much potential  they have been an untapped resource She continued I am a strong supporter of equal rights but I am not out in front leading the charges I am not a supporter of ERA I dont want to see any change in the Constitution Her Views on Abortion As for the abortion issue she says If you ask me personally I think it is my own choice between me and my doctor so I guess I am prochoice But when you ask me as a legislator and you are dealing with taxpayers money I am not for abortion on demand I do support funding for abortions in the case of rape or incest or when the health of the mother is endangered The Pennsylvania Legislature meets three days a week from September through June with committee sessions called on an adhoc basis When sessions run late Mrs Lewis stays in a motel otherwise she drives to their farm an hour and a half away Its a crazy life she said Im driving up in the morning for the opening session and trying to figure out whether I can possibly get back here midweek for a White House dinner Its always a matter of jockeying clothes and schedules Drew never joins me there He feels his job is in Washington So I do most of the traveling back and forth
"IN JERSEY SCHOOL, U.S. AND SOVIET LIFE ENTWINE",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/25/nyregion/in-jersey-school-us-and-soviet-life-entwine.html,Preaching peace among nations Raisa Smirnova and Ludmila Kondrakhina met the eighth graders of Glenfield School today By the end of the afternoon the two middleaged women from the Soviet Union had the abashed teenagers clasping hands swaying and singing American antiwar songs from the 1960s Both women are fairly highranking members of the Communist Party and are visiting the United States for the first time under the auspices of the Womens International League for Peace and Freedom They had wanted to see a public school Mrs Kondrakhina was once a school principal  and so they found themselves in Philip Sterns classroom facing a social studies class in participatory democracy The children who had been preparing for the visit for a week asked some ticklish political questions Mrs Smirnova editor of Women of the World Magazine thought it was unusual of children this age to ask such things implying that they had been coached But the women answered deftly Einstein in Translation How do you feel about the talks about the nuclear bombs possibly pointed to Europe one student asked Mrs Kondrakhina said she would quote a great son of the United States Albert Einstein With Mrs Smirnova as translator she said It is not possible for me to imagine what kind of weapons we should use in the third world war but I know if the third world war starts the fourth world war will be a war of bows and arrows We shouldnt let the next world war to start said Mrs Smirnova So far as the neutron bomb is concerned it is madness to invent it We grownups are doing the best we can We have a strong movement in our country against this bomb Tracy Sturdivant who is 13 years old raised her hand stood and then asked What is your opinion about abortion As her classmates tittered Tracy sank in her chair and put her hands over her face Mrs Kondrakhina gave a matteroffact answer It is our point of view if you are pregnant for the first time you shouldnt do that you might never have children If you want to be alone its up to you But its permitted Abortion is free in our country Who is your favorite author the Russian women asked Judy Blume many of the children shouted referring to the author of books for adolescents that deal boldly with such controversial subjects as teenage sex Your favorite games Monopoly said a few students citing the board game in which players buy and sell property with play money in a very capitalist manner Mrs Smirnova laughed then said It is very popular in our country as well A discussion about Russian songs culminated with the two women breaking into a melodic soprano version of a song with a lyric that translates into let there always be sun let there always be peace Then they asked the students to sing one of their favorite songs This request immediately split the ranks into the disco lovers and the rock and roll fans The teachers worked out a compromise  a song that no one liked  and the eighth graders reluctantly began singing Ive Been Working on the Railroad When it was over Mrs Smirnova asked This is a song of trade unions She then made another request Would the teenagers sing Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream a song she had heard at the international leagues conference at Bryn Mawr College the week before The generation gap yawned for this was a song of the Vietnam War era But Mr Stern who is 26 years old and a few other younger faculty members led the way As they sang Mrs Smirnova walked about the room entwining the students hands The next request was to see some teenage dancing Everett Everett the students called out turning to Everett Jackson 13 who had a large transistor radio Disco music began to pulse as Everett stepped to the front of the room and clasped Anne Gayle a fellow student close to him With his right leg pressed to the inside of Annes left leg he began to gyrate to the music and the teachers looked away slightly embarrassed The Soviet women smiled and asked What is this dance called Disco the students answered enthusiastically Some more political questions followed What do the Soviet people think of capitalism How do you feel about Solidarity and the current situation in Poland If your President said you needed to use nuclear power what would you think of it The women turned nearly every question of this sort into a plea for peaceful coexistence emphasizing the value of cultural exchange The people who are narrowminded are not able to do anything for their people said Mrs Smirnova
STRATEGY STUDIED FOR FISCAL IMPASSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/25/us/strategy-studied-for-fiscal-impasse.html,White House officials met today with Republican leaders from the House and Senate to try to map a strategy to break the fiscal stalemate between President Reagan and Congress While they met the Government returned to normal after a halfday furlough Monday of nonessential employes ordered by Mr Reagan after he vetoed as budgetbusting a stopgap resolution needed to keep the Government solvent Later in the day Congress sent him and Mr Reagan approved a resolution providing a threeweek extension of current spending The anger of some of the Republican leaders over a confrontation with the White House appeared to have abated in the wake of that agreement The extension will expire Dec 15 shortly before Congresss scheduled Christmas recess A Nightmarish Experience Out of this nightmarish experience weve had weve agreed that well have to avoid a repetition if were going to have any credibility Senator Mark O Hatfield Republican of Oregon chairman of the Appropriations committee said after todays meeting Mr Hart was among those at the hourlong session called by the Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr Republican of Tennessee Others present were Representative Robert H Michel of Illinois the House Republican leader and several committee chairmen as well as David A Stockman director of the Office of Management and Budget and James A Baker 3d the White House chief of staff The participants created three subcommittees to deal with the next stopgap financing measure which is needed because Congress has approved only one of 13 individual appropriations to operate the Government in this fiscal year which began Oct 1 The first stopgap resolution expired last Friday The stopgap measure is formally a continuing resolution socalled because it authorizes the Government to spend money in the absence of formal appropriation bills The device has been used for many years Recently Congress has used it to change various spending levels and even included language in such devices to bar the use of Federal funds for abortions Spending for most Federal agencies was controlled by continuing resolutions in the fiscal year 1981 Foreign aid spending has been entirely controlled by continuing resolutions for three years One subcommittee will seek to reach an agreement on a common set of economic figures a task that has eluded the White House the House and the Senate each of which has used its own data base Another subcommittee will deal with packaging including possible inducements needed to gain the support of moderate Republicans in the House who have sometimes sided with the Democrats The third will deal with overall strategy including the length of the proposed new stopgap bill Termed an Encroachment But underlying differences between the White House and the Congress could continue to jeopardize any such agreement In the view of some Republicans the White House is trying to assert control over the fiscal process and they believe that is an encroachment on Congresss constitutional prerogatives Im troubled by this confrontation said Representative Jack Edwards a conservative Republican from Alabama Theyre trying to delve into our responsibility They come perilously close I think to setting out in detail what were charged with doing The White House and Congress had different views on how much fiscal discretion to give the President as illustrated by the differing Senate and House versions of the stopgap measure that was vetoed by the President Of Powers and Definitions The Senate version supported by the White House would have enabled the President to make cuts in social programs provided that no program was cut by more than 5 percent The House bill on the other hand would have mandated a 2 percent acrosstheboard cut depriving the President of any discretion The President and Congress also work from a different budget On Capitol Hill budget refers to a resolution approved by the Congress that sets spending ceilings and revenue floors The measure vetoed by the President was well under the tentative spending ceilings set by Congress in its budget resolution for the fiscal year 1982 passed in July To the White House however budget means the spending recommended by the President who sent up his budget last January and made further cuts in September The vetoed measure exceeded the Presidents revised budget Many members of Congress bristled at the Presidents charge that Congress had dragged its feet on the individual appropriations bills thereby necessitating the stopgap measure In fact the Democraticcontrolled House has passed 12 of the 13 bills The exception was for foreign aid and it was withheld from floor consideration because it was considered difficult to persuade members to vote funds for other nations while cutting domestic programs A Signal Was Awaited In the Republicancontrolled Senate however the leadership had kept the appropriations bills off the floor at the behest of the White House awaiting a Presidential signal from the fiscal negotiations that took place in September and October The Republican leadership recommended almost unanimously that the President sign the stopgap measure sent to him Sunday night The lone exception was Senator Harrison Schmitt Republican of New Mexico Senator Paul Laxalt Republican of Nevada the Presidents closest friend in the Senate a conferee who had signed the conference report urged the President not to veto the bill Senator Hatfield noted that Mr Reagan had demonstrated the power of the veto and now was relying on the preChristmas expiration date of the extension to compel acceptance on White House terms of another stopgap measure so Congress could recess for the holidays The power of the veto has been proven and now were coming to the power of Christmas Mr Laxalt said I dont really want to equate the Lord and the President he added
POLITICS AND COMPETITION WORRY TOBACCO FORCES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/26/us/politics-and-competition-worry-tobacco-forces.html,They were not quite ready to draw the curing barns into a circle but the tobacco growers among the 70000 visitors to the recent Southern FlueCured Tobacco Festival and Tobacco Farmer Show here were clearly worried Although fluecured leaf which is used mainly in cigarettes enjoyed a vintage season and the highest prices ever the Federal tobacco program a complex system of quotas allotments price supports and loans barely survived the stiffest Congressional challenge in its history The program consisting of strict Government controls on who may grow most of the nations tobacco and how much of it can be sold has long been one of Congresss sacred cows This year in addition to the usual arguments about the health effects of the product and the cost of Federal price supports critics argued that tobacco should not escape the Reagan Administrations budgetcutting and deregulation efforts Backlash Against Helms Seen Supporters however attributed much of the opposition to political backlash against one of tobaccos biggest defenders Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina Mr Helmss tough stands against abortion school busing to achieve desegregation and spending levels for food stamps and other social programs have angered many moderates and liberals in Congress In addition to the critics market pressures too have been closing in on tobacco farmers Many grades of lower stock domestic leaf are being undersold on the international market by tobacco from such countries as Brazil Zimbabwe South Korea and Thailand But any price ceiling the growers say would mean serious cuts in their profits without a concomitant easing of interest rates and escalating costs for fuel equipment and leasing rights If were not going to make any changes in the program Id just as soon we kill it said Forrest Ball who raises 80 acres of tobacco in Wake County NC Were running down a deadend road But like Mr Ball few tobacco advocates who circulated among the 199 seed equipment agricultural chemical and other exhibits in the prodigious Farmers Warehouse seemed confident that they knew how to preserve the program while making it more equitable at home and more competitive abroad Loopholes in Most Plans Ive got some ideas Mr Ball said but I can see loopholes in every one I come up with There is however at least one area in which all segments of the tobacco industry agree that changes could be made allotment leasing When the Federal tobacco program was established in the 1930s it included quotas and acreage allotments limiting the amount of tobacco that could be grown and sold thus helping to insure stable supply and prices Mr Ball owns an allotment because members of his family were raising tobacco on their land when the allotments were distributed in 1938 His allotment accounts for about onethird of the acreage he plants the rest is leased from neighbors who own growing rights but no longer plant tobacco Such leasing costs growers from 25 to 50 cents a pound of tobacco driving up support prices and growers profits which are now 500 to 1000 an acre Rents Are Too High Rents are too high said Larry Johnson another Wake County farmer who rents eight or 10 farms and grows 55 acres of tobacco Allotments Mr Johnson said should go to farmers who are growing tobacco Most tobacco producers at the festival made it clear they opposed ownership of growing rights by power companies shopping centers country clubs and other nonfarm corporations and individuals They were reluctant however to strip nonproducing farm families many of whom had worked the land for years of their allotments and the income derived from leases Growers and their representatives also discussed urging the Government to drop price supports for eight grades of lower stock leaf using money from excise taxes on cigarettes to run the tobacco program and becoming totally independent of Federal Government involvement Yet whatever the specifics and the uncertainties of their proposals many growers are more conciliatory than they have been in the past They concede that something has to be done and fast lest they lose control of their industry in Congress We were lucky that we were able to get by without somebody calling our shots for us this year said Billy Yeargin a North Carolinabased tobacco consultant The farmer recognizes the need to make the necessary changes in the program to strengthen it Withstanding Many Attacks A strong lobby and the support of the states Congressional delegation has helped the industry to withstand most attacks on its product based on its health effects Lately tobaccos defenders have cited as evidence of the crops indispensability a 1979 study paid for by the tobacco industry which found that tobacco generated 576 billion toward the nations gross national product including more than 6 billion in excise taxes As for fiscal responsibility the tobacco forces still proudly note that except for approximately 22 million in annual administrative costs the Federal Government contributes no financing to their program What money the Government does provide is represented in loans made by the Department of Agricultures Commodity Credit Corporation This year the private FlueCured Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corporation serving growers in Virginia the Carolinas Georgia Florida and Alabama will borrow 200 million at 41 12 percent interest to finance purchase of 104 million pounds of leaf acquired to maintain price supports The Secretary of Agriculture John R Block is to announce the 1982 quotas by Dec 1 Growers Resentful and Confused The near dismemberment of the tobacco program left many growers at the threeday Greenville conclave resentful and confused Standing before an exhibit that proclaimed There Is NO Tobacco Subsidy Kendall Hill a grower from Kinston NC asked angrily Why are people in New York California and Washington when they collect so much money out of tobacco  why do they want to change something that costs them so little Arent they getting a hell of a return on their investment Mr Johnson had one answer I think the reason they raised so much stink over the tobacco program was Helms raising so much stink about food stamps Mr Ball added bitterly It bothered me that he was playing politics with our livelihood Senator Helms chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee is expected to hold hearings both in Washington and in producing regions early next year to solicit growers comments before fine tuning the program according to a committee spokesman Joseph Terrell In North Carolina where tobacco is raised on 43183 farms that last year produced a total of 13 billion growers will be watching that fine tuning with keen interest

vigor and is signaling that he intends to remain what he was before the assassination attempt a robust traveling teacherPope asserting his moral authority around the world Last Sunday he made a days visit to Umbria in central Italy his first trip beyond his summer residence near Rome since the shooting A trip to England is on the schedule for May Switzerland is next and Spain will follow in the fall The Polish Government has been told that the Pope expects an invitation to return to his native country for a celebration at the shrine of the Black Madonna of Czestochowa in August During the months of the Popes convalescence many Vatican officials were convinced that the shots in St Peters Square on May 13 had irrevocably changed his papacy and that the Polish traveling Pope would have to settle down Such a transformation would be welcomed by some of them as an opportunity for the Pope to become more involved with the problems of running the church more concerned with doctrine and discipline Mixed Assessments of Papacy As John Paul begins his fourth year in office the judgments on his papacy are mixed There have been omissions and failures as well as successes according to those who observed him closely The following assessments are based on informal conversations over a period of several weeks with Vatican officials priests and foreign diplomats specializing in Vatican affairs As a matter of policy church officials will speak on internal questions only on the understanding that they not be identified Some of the criticism may seem petty but it is strongly felt in the Curia the church government The critics say the Pope is a poor administrator and has neglected the paper work that is piling up on the desks of his secretaries He has been too popular too much of a showman they say He travels far too much and spends too much time preparing for his trips Two weeks ago with his trip to England still six months away the Pope conferred for several days with three secretaries on strategy for that journey an exasperated priest reported Favors Informal Messages John Paul is doing his teaching much more through travel and speeches to pilgrims than in encyclicals and formal messages the priests say some approvingly and some critically He has become a voice for human dignity and human rights like no one before one Vatican official said adding that satellite transmission and portable television cameras have given him an unprecedented audience of millions of people for every appearance The Pope it is felt has been more effective as a statesmanstrategist on the international political scene than as a restorer and defender of doctrine and discipline within the church His main impact has been in Eastern Europe and the third world where embattled churches operate in a hostile environment with repressive regimes a foreign diplomat specializing in Vatican affairs said He added that the Pope had been far less effective in Western Europe and the United States where Roman Catholic churches in pluralistic societies have developed internal problems of discipline and doctrine where some in the clergy have strayed from the path of orthodoxy and where materialism is spreading at the expense of the spiritual values that the Pope would like to revive Poland and Italy are the two main contrasting examples A Setback in Italy In Italy the Pope and the church suffered a humiliation last May when the voters rejected by a margin of 2 to 1 a proposal to repeal the countrys liberal abortion law The Pope had openly campaigned for repeal and had asked the Italian bishops to do the same Since the issue was an Italian law that had been passed by Parliament many Italians regarded the Popes action as foreign intervention in domestic affairs Liberal priests and some members of the dominant Christian Democratic Party accuse the Pope of having dragged both the church and the party into an unnecessary defeat They say he had been warned by Italian clergymen that this fight could not be won but he did not listen and preferred the advice of the most conservative Italian church groups and of the lay activists of the RighttoLife Movement Poland on the other hand is regarded as the Popes foremost success Credited With Gdansk Summer There could have been no Gdansk summer if there had not been a Polish Pope a Western ambassador said referring to the movement that gave rise to Solidarity the independent Polish union He gave birth to the child he nursed it and protected it and still does The Pope first drew attention to his strong national feeling on that evening of Oct 16 1978 when the littleknown name of the new Pontiff  Karol Wojtyla  was announced to a stunned then delighted crowd in St Peters Square Standing on the balcony for the first time he identified himself as a man from a faraway country faraway and yet close because of our communion in the traditions of the church Since that moment Poland has taken much of his time and energy It has a central place in the strategic thinking of the church His Polish experience influences his thinking on matters of doctrine questions regarding the clergy and even social issues and liberation theology in Latin America A journalist among the Polish pilgrims to Rome gives the Pope credit for having saved their country from Soviet military intervention And authoritative Catholic diplomats confirm that on several occasions the Pope intervened personally through unpublicized meetings with Soviet officials warning them with all the persuasiveness of his person and his office that a Soviet military move would bring incalculable disaster to all Complaints of Isolation Some priests privately complain that the Pope has become isolated cut off from the Curia officials by a clique of young Polish priests surrounding him People have found that you obtain an audience or get a document read by the Pope only if you go through Father Stanislaw Dziwisz an official said But he added that the assassination attempt and the Popes convalescence have changed this to the extent that Agostino Cardinal Casaroli the Secretary of State conferred with the Pope every day and thus opened a more regular channel of command Vatican officials say that the Popes Polish assistants act as something akin to an operational headquarters that constantly monitors events in Poland and enables John Paul to synchronize his moves A threatening move by the Russians is followed instantly by a papal appeal When Lech Walesa the Solidarity leader has trouble with hardliners in his organization there is an exhortation to moderation in next Sundays homily At least once in such a situation the Pope referred to Mr Walesa by name When he makes his appearances in St Peters every Sunday and Wednesday there is always a Polish delegation among the pilgrims It is never larger than any other single national group but the others come periodically while the Poles are always there They come in buses through Hungary and they have their own pilgrims home which is always full We Must Reunite Europe Beyond the issue of Poland and linked to it one of the Popes major concepts has been the religious and cultural unification of all of Europe and the breaking down of what used to be called the Iron Curtain The strategy which aims at ending the isolation of Poland emerged for the first time in the Popes first public remarks when he spoke of Poland as being close because of our communion in the church During his visit to Poland in June 1979 he announced the concept more clearly and said for the first time We must reunite Europe through Christianity Early this month a group of Roman Catholic scholars from Western and Eastern Europe including 92 Poles met for five days at the Vatican to discuss the common religious roots of Europe The Pope addressed the meeting and said that to avoid future tragedies it was urgent to pull together all the religious artistic and philosophical currents that European culture shared As the first Slavic Pope in the history of the church his heart cries out for such unity he told the scholars The first Polish Pope is also the first to come from a country under Communist rule Looking to the East In the same spirit and for the same purpose the Pope has made reconciliation with the Eastern Orthdox churches one of his main concerns while leaving ecumenical efforts with the Western Protestant churches on the back burner in the words of a priest This Pope knows that the churches in Russia are full and he wants to reach the Christians there the priest said He wants to break down the isolation of the Slavs not only the Poles The Pope traveled to Turkey in November 1979 He said mass with Dimitrios I the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch and the two men pledged to give a new impetus to communion between their churches At the same time in a predominantly Moslem country John Paul underlined the common values of Christianity and Islam He was looking both northeast to Moscow and southeast to the Middle East One of his dearest wishes is to travel to the Holy Land In 1979 he and his aides were reported to be studying the possibility that the Pontiff might go to Bethlehem to say Christmas mass there The idea was reluctantly dropped Emphasis on Peacemaking Pontiff is from the Latin word meaning bridgebuilder a Vatican official recently noted adding that John Paul wants to revive the church tradition of building bridges and making peace He will see anybody from any government or organization if they come to see him as a peacemaker a highranking Vatican official said But many priests feel that the Popes relentless preoccupation with Poland has taken his attention away from other pressing international problems In a recent audience the Pope acknowledged sadly that he had failed to make an impact on the situation in Northern Ireland He recalled that he had pleaded for an end to the bloodshed when he went there in October 1979 Now there is more bloodshed than ever he said The Rev Gianni Baget Bozzo an Italian priest and writer accused the Pope in a recent article of being relatively silent on the nuclear arms race and indifferent to the plight of the undeveloped poor countries while committing himself excessively in Poland and using his authority to try to prevent secular governments from adopting less restrictive laws on abortion Who Is This Polish Pope Solidarity is not a religious movement yet the Pope is its guide guarantor and ally Father Baget Bozzo wrote Then he asked Who is this Polish Pope Under which ecclesiastic terms can this singular role of his be interpreted A few months ago Father Baget Bozzo was ordered by his bishop Giuseppe Cardinal Siri to stop writing He has ignored the order The Popes handling of social and political issues in Latin America notably Brazil and in the Philippines closely followed the Polish model John Paul took a twopronged approach He told the workers of Brazil and the Philippines that they had the right to organize and demand an end to social injustice and political repression He thus added to the pressure on the Brazilian and Philippine regimes to liberalize But he also preached moderation and above all nonviolence to the farmers and the workers thus reducing the threat to the regimes And he told his clergy that they should stand for social justice but at the same time stay out of practical politics Called Withdrawn and Enigmatic He proposed the same deal as in Poland a Vatican source said He tells the authorities to go ahead and make reforms and at the same time he reassures them by promising that the church will use all its influence to keep things peaceful John Paul whom millions of people around the world know as an outgoing charismatic figure able to make instant contact with the most diverse audiences is seen by many Vatican prelates as a withdrawn enigmatic man who hides his feelings and does not say much His warmth vanishes in oneonone meetings he is often ill at ease he listens and lets his visitors speak and in the end they leave without knowing whether he agreed with what they told him a Vatican priest said of the Curia prelates who are summoned before the Pope For most Vatican prelates he added the Pope is still a man from from a far country
Sports of The Times; A Biship's View of Football,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/28/sports/sports-of-the-times-a-biship-s-view-of-football.html,WHEN 14yearold Terrence Robinson died of head injuries from football last September Bishop Walter F Sullivan was stunned to learn the boy had been playing for a parish team I thought we had eliminated that two years ago Bishop Sullivan said recently Now Bishop Sullivan has told the entire Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond Va that he does not consider football to have any redeeming value for young people including high school students Bishop Sullivan who says he played football as a child and who enjoys competing in tennis contends that football teaches violence toward opponents It sponsors hatred between schools between parishes he says It does not represent any Christian values that I can see He has of course stirred up rabid opposition particularly at the northern fringe of the Sunbelt where football often seems to be a religion in and of itself Bishop Sullivan has received a friendly call from Gerry Faust the Notre Dame coach who gently defended football but he has been harshly criticized by many parents within his diocese Bishop Sullivan is aware of the hold of football around the country He found a reminder in the National Catholic Reporter one of the best religious journals in the country which discovered that Servite High in Californias Orange County links Faith Family and Football as a desirable trinity for its students But Bishop Sullivan says he is committed to trying to limit football within his diocese which covers the state of Virginia Two years ago Bishop Sullivan ordered all parish schools to end sponsorship of football teams in compliance with a state law that forbids organized football in grade school I did it for legal reasons but I also was concerned about the amount of injuries in football Bishop Sullivan says I have seen statistics showing about 50000 injuries per year in football Ive talked to doctors who say the elementaryschool years are vital for growth and that football can hinder growth I was also concerned about the violence in football the idea of mowing down the opposition Im not saying coaches were teaching children to deliberately injure other players but the terrible need to win has made football no longer a sport People say football helps boys get rid of their aggressions but thats not good enough for me Following the Bishops decree two years ago the schools technically dropped football But parents and parish groups promptly resumed the rivalries An active cleric who was an early opponent of the Vietnam War a critic of stripmining that has ravaged western Virginia and a sympathetic figure to female activists in the church Bishop Sullivan did not learn about the circumvention of his orders until last September He had baptized Terrence Robinson had followed his progress through grade school and was dismayed by his death In the Oct 5 issue of his diocesan newspaper The Catholic Virginian Bishop Sullivan wrote a pastoral letter entitled Respect Life and Limb Toward the end of the letter he wrote I regret not having taken a stronger stand in outlawing football under Catholic auspices for gradeschool youngsters I ask the full cooperation of our pastors school principals and parents in supporting my position that football on a grade school level either through the school the parish or an athletic association must be outlawed I ask the Catholic high schools to consider seriously the same concern and take action to eliminate football from their athletic program  May this years Respect Life commitment be a lasting tribute to Terrence Robinson The Bishop ordered the parish teams to shut down after this season and he asked diocesan high schools to review their policy on football One parish tried to keep its children from meeting with the Bishop but the boys informed their parents they were old enough to listen to their pastoral leader even if they disagreed with his position The board of one diocesan high school Norfolk Catholic voted 201 to keep the football program Sister Theresa Kreibick the principal and a board member said she was glad football would continue but also said she was glad Bishop Sullivan had challenged us John OHara the coach of the Norfolk Catholic team said In any sport you try to work over the weaker spots in your opponent We dont teach anybody to hurt anybody else We teach proper techniques but we also teach sportsmanship OHara said that he did not believe there was a hatred engendered by football The only thing I object to is when I see a coach grabbing the face mask of a player yelling and cursing at them getting right up in a young mans face OHara said Thats no way to teach anything Several weeks after his pastoral letter Bishop Sullivan says Its as if we cant exist without football Its a sacred cow in American society In basketball in soccer in a lot of sports you have physical contact but the main objective is not to hurt the other guy I hear people saying Footballs not so bad But thats not a good enough argument for me People say Why dont you get on automobiles More people die from automobiles than football But thats no answer to me I just dont think football fits We talk at great length about being against abortion but there are other daybyday attitudes that need investigation too I dont think football is a sport is fun is something you enjoy I feel the hostility between schools between people who dont even know each other Is that what were teaching our young people That doesnt fit into my values
THE RIDDLE OF ARMAND HAMMER,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/29/magazine/the-riddle-of-armand-hammer.html,Edward Jay Epstein is a freelance writer His most recent book The Diamond Invention an examination of the international diamond cartel will be published by Simon and Shuster this spring By Edward Jay Epstein In Moscow on May 27 l922 Vladimir Lenin the ailing leader of the Russian Revolution sent an urgent and secret message to Joseph Stalin the newly appointed General Secretary of the Communist Party instructing him and the Politburo to give their particular support to a young American and his trading venture Lenin explained This is a small path to the American business world and this path should be made use of in every way The American was a 24yearold graduate of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University In Los Angeles on Aug 31 l981 more than a thousand leading businessmen and politicians gathered at the Century Plaza Hotel for the presentation of the annual Armand Hammer Businessman of the Year Award Bob Hope introduced Armand Hammer now 83 as the epitome of success of American capitalism He lauded him as an industrialist an art collector a diplomat and a philanthropist all titles to which Hammer can lay indisputable claim He is the head of Occidental Petroleum the largest independent oil company in the world and itself the owner of giant subsidiary companies in such vital areas as food production and chemicals Dr Hammer as he prefers to be called in deference to the medical degree he has never used also happens to be the owner of the Hammer and Knoedler Galleries among the leading art dealers in America and he is the chairman of the Armand Hammer Foundation which donates millions of dollars every year to charitable causes But the most remarkable thing about Armand Hammer is that he created this personal empire largely by negotiating extraordinary deals with nations that have usually been hostile to the United States  and even more hostile to American capitalists The son of one of the founders of the American Communist Labor Party Hammer became a multimillionaire capitalist thanks in large measure to his relations with the leaders of the Soviet Union He has maintained cordial relations with Soviet leaders for more than half a century providing Moscow with a vital link to Western industry and technology Six years ago Soviet leader Leonid I Brezhnev gave Hammer a luxurious Moscow apartment and Kremlin officials have proposed that he be named United States ambassador to the Soviet Union Such recommendations have made some members of the Reagan Administration uneasy Says one member of the Presidents inner circle who asked not to be identified by name We simply dont know which side of the fence Hammer is on Hammer also happens to be Jewish by background if not belief yet Libyan strongman Col Muammar elQaddafi has made him a major beneficiary of Libyas oil wealth In the early l970s Hammer negotiated an accommodation with Qaddafi that had the eventual effect of contributing to the growth and power of OPEC and which radically changed the oil business around the world Even though both Mobil and Exxon announced decisions to suspend production in Libya earlier this month Occidental the main channel of Libyan oil declared its intention to continue production as usual And although Hammer is a Democrat he pleaded guilty and received a suspended sentence for providing secret and illegal campaign funds to thenPresident Richard M Nixon in l972 It is not a simple matter to understand the convictions and motivations that underlie these apparent contradictions Hammers skills as an international wheelerdealer on the other hand are much less difficult to document For example on April 26 1981  the day after President Ronald Reagan reopened the door to trade with the Soviet Union by ending the embargo imposed in l979 as a retaliation for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan  Armand Hammer entered the Soviet Union aboard OXY 1 his private Boeing 727 one of the very few private aircraft permitted to fly in Soviet airspace He had already dictated a letter to Ronald Reagan commending the President on his courageous decision and suggesting that renewed EastWest trade was in the interest of the United States Not incidently perhaps it was also in Hammers interest His company was committed to ship a million tons of concentrated phosphoric acid to the Soviet Union annually for the next 20 years This would provide Soviet agriculture with the liquid fertilizers that it desperately needs to improve crop yields The deal which Hammer reckoned to be worth no less than 20 billion had been nearly wrecked by the American embargo Dr Hammer was now flying to Moscow to get it moving again The OXY 1 has been specially designed for such intercontinental flights Additional fuel tanks give the jet a nonstop range of up to 5000 miles and sophisticated telecommunications equipment allow Hammer to telephone almost anywhere in the world while en route The 100footlong cabin has been reconfigured into a personal salon equipped with such small luxuries as a Betamax video recorder and a videotape library of Chaplin films There is even a guest room further foward On this flight Hammer invited along as his guest David Murdoch a Los Angeles financier who owned the largest interest in Iowa Beef Processors the biggest and most advanced beefpacker in the world Murdoch was also an avid collector of Arabian horses At a dinner in Los Angeles earlier this year he had casually mentioned to Hammer that the Russians had bred one of the finest lines of Arabian horses in the world including the stallion Pesniar To Murdochs amazement Hammer then offered to arrange for him to buy this prized stallion in the Soviet Union Through Hammers connections Murdoch would fly from Moscow to the Tersk Breeding Farm at Piatigorsk near the Black Sea to make an offer for the horse When the OXY 1 landed that evening at Sheremetyevo Airport outside Moscow it taxied directly to the new terminal building where two Soviet protocol officers were waiting Unlike other American visitors Armand Hammer was not required to go through the usual customs and passport controls Instead he and his guests were whisked into a VIP lounge where they could relax while their luggage was loaded into waiting Chaika limousines Hammer was then driven directly to his apartment which is within walking distance of the Kremlin and where his Russian maid greeted him The apartment is decorated with masterpieces of Russian art which Hammer has specified in his will are to be given to the Soviet Union upon his death During the next few days Hammer had a series of meetings and dinners with Soviet ministers and trade officials Aside from the multibilliondollar phosphoric acid deal his company is involved in a multitude of other enterprises in the Soviet Union ranging from selling petrochemicals to building an international trade center In between meetings Hammer asked his personal assistant James Pugash to begin gathering information on the stock price of Murdochs beefpacking company It was only then that his assistant realized that Hammers interest in Murdoch went beyond helping him buy a Russian horse By the time Hammer returned home to Los Angeles the following week he had already broached the possibility to Murdoch of Occidental Petroleum buying Iowa Beef Several weeks later Hammer purchased Iowa Beef for more than 800 million in Occidental stock When he returned to Moscow a month later he not only arranged to buy the stallion Pesniar for Murdoch Occidental and a third buyer for 1 million but he also offered Deputy Prime Minister Leonid Kostandov a plan to help solve the Soviet Unions chronic meat shortage With Iowa Beef he could replicate its highly advanced meat packing factories in the Soviet Union and sell directly to the Soviet Government large quantities of American boxed beef Hammer it seemed had provided everyone concerned with what he wanted David Murdoch got his Russianbred horse Occidental however retained partial ownership in the animal which Murdoch says is worth at least 15 million in this country for breeding purposes and hundreds of millions of dollars in stock Iowa Beefs other shareholders received a lucrative premium for their stock Occidental Petroleum acquired Americas largest meatpacker and the Soviet Union had a new source of beef In both style and substance it was the kind of maneuvering for which Hammer has become famous When he took over Occidental Petroleum 25 years ago it was little more than a corporate shell with three employees and a net worth of only 34000 He was then nearly 60 and he had had no experience in the oil business Less than 10 years later Occidental had a market value in excess of 100000000 By the beginning of 1981 with sales of over 12 billion the corporation ranked in the Fortune 500 as the 20th largest industrial company in the United States And with added revenues from Iowa Beef Occidental should be in the top 15 before the current year is out How did Hammer do it Earlier this year I traveled more than 10000 miles with Dr Hammer in North America and Europe During this period he flew over 100000 miles in the OXY 1 and met with an international Whos Who of presidents princes and dictators In Ottawa he went to the gala that Premier Trudeau gave in honor of President Reagan In Peking Hammer had a private audience with Chinas strongman Deputy Prime Minister Deng Xaioping in the Great Hall Afterwards at a lavish banquet he gave for over 100 Chinese officials he discussed his plan for developing Chinese oil and coal resources In Brasilia he met with President Joao Baptista Figueiredo and talked about the possibility of building a natural gas pipeline from Occidentals fields in Bolivia to Brazil In London he presented a book illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci and renamed the Codex Hammer to the Royal Academy of Arts for an exhibition In Washington he went to numerous receptions for visiting world leaders and lunched with at least 15 Senators Throughout this global odyssey it quickly became clear how in all his dealings commerce diplomacy politics philanthropy friendship and his own selfinterest interweave in complex patterns A vivid illustration is his recent personal peace initiative in Afghanistan The idea which he claims had been suggested to him by Edward Gierek then the head of the Communist Party of Poland was for the Soviet Union to begin a phased withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan in return for which Pakistan and the United States would agree to stop aiding the antiSoviet rebels in Afghanistan In Moscow Hammer arranged a private meeting with Brezhnev Brezhnev explained according to Hammers recollection that it was utter nonsense that the Soviet Union had any strategic designs on the Persian Gulf region and that he would order the withdrawal of some Soviet units in Afghanistan as soon as the arms traffic across the Pakistan border to Afghan rebels was ended Hammer taking Brezhnev at his word next flew to Karachi to meet with General Mohammad Zia ulHaq the President of Pakistan who had been up to this moment the main supporter of the rebels in Afghanistan During these meetings he suggested that Occidental Petroleum could redrill shallow offshore oil fields in the hope of striking a bonanza and also build a new oil refinery in Pakistan Gen Zia showed considerable interest in the idea but he was reluctant to commit himself on Afghanistan Hammer was not prepared to give up He went to Senator Charles Percy the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a personal friend to Secretary of State Alexander Haig to Lord Carrington the British Foreign Secretary and finally to Kurt Waldheim the Secretary General of the United Nations While he was proceeding with this approach he received word that President Reagan was about to end the Soviet embargo for entirely unrelated reasons Only then did Hammer stop pressing his peace initiative And in that light it perhaps becomes clear where his highest priorities lie In person Armand Hammer is a modest and affable man who far more closely resembles a country doctor than a corporate magnate He peers at the world through thick Magoolike glasses and is slightly hard of hearing He lives in a comfortable but not ostentatious home in Westwood in Los Angeles His third wife Frances is his constant companion traveling with him in the OXY 1 Hammer is not without a sense of humor about himself For instance when he heard that Marlon Brando had modeled the role of an unscrupulous oil millionaire in the film The Formula on him and that he was paid a quarter of a million dollars a day Hammer quipped For that kind of money I would have played the part myself In my presence at least Dr Hammer was almost always patient polite and generous in dealing with his associates and other businessmen But Occidental executives often see the iron hand of The Doctor as he is called in the office For example for a number of years Hammer insisted that each of the directors of his corporation give him their signed but undated letters of resignation With these in his pocket Hammer could dismiss anyone at a moments notice He explains that his motivation was simply to assure that none of his directors had any conflict of interest Occidental has had three different presidents in the last three years Hammers oneman control of Occidental has he explained allowed him to make instant and advantageous decisions in the competitive world of oil concessions It has also permitted him to resort to some unconventional tactics For example to get an oil concession in the Persian Gulf from an Emirate Sheik he personally delivered to him 1671000 in cash in a suitcase in a London hotel room Another 200000 was deposited in a Swiss bank Hammer says that the payment was a legitimate part of the contractual arrangement with the Sheikdom of UmmalQaywayn The Sheik named Sultan al MuAlla was the son of the ruler and authorized to receive the payment on the part of the nation In Venezuela Hammer gave the President of that nation a valuable bronze statue of Simon Bolivar from the Hammer Galleries He later characterized the gift as just a token In Libya Hammer arranged for Occidental to pay for the college tuition and expenses of Libyans whose parents held influential positions in the Government Hammer explains that these students were chosen by the Libyan Government and that these unusual arrangements engender local good will A Source Memorandum prepared by a special committee of the Occidental board discloses many unorthodox arrangements that Hammer has made to gain advantage for Occidental in the rivalry for oil properties They range from paying a Nigerian Consul General 295000 through an intermediary in Liechtenstein to transferring some 3 million to a Bahamian shell corporation called Noark International which allegedly used the funds to bribe Venezuelan officials Hammer characterized these charges by his own committee as unproven allegations He points out that an oil company is often obliged to pay intermediaries in underdeveloped countries and it cannot then prevent them from using these fees to bribe government officials To maintain his international network of influence Dr Hammer also depends heavily on his Washington connection He claims to have known every President since Herbert Hoover To assure himself access to the White House and Congress he retains a powerful corps of men in Washington and other cities almost all of whom formerly served as Government officials This contingent includes William F McSweeny a former highlevel aide in the Johnson Administration Jerrold L Schecter the former spokesman for the National Security Council in the Carter Administration Rear Adm Tazewell T Shepard Jr a former aide in the Kennedy Administration Gorden Reece formerly public relations adviser to Margaret Thatcher and Jack King a former spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Still Hammer and his public affairs staff have found his access to the Reagan Administration progressively stifled Hammer continues to write letters to the President So far however the responses have been cool He particularly blames Richard V Allen the Presidents National Security Adviser for blocking him Allen acknowledges that he has made efforts to limit Hammers access to the President explaining that he is concerned about the funny company that Hammer keeps It is understandable that Hammers longtime association with Soviet leaders raises some questions about the nature of his international activities Does Hammer merely take advantage of his contacts with the the Russians to advance his business interests Or does Hammer take advantage of his business contacts to serve Moscows interests That may not be possible to know But to find clues one must go back to a series of events that occured just after the Russian Revolution Hammer claims that his Soviet connection grew out of his philanthrophic intentions and a series of innocent accidents He recounts that after he graduated from medical school in 1921 he heard about a typhus epidemic sweeping the Soviet Union Since he was interested in bacteriology and he had a sixmonth hiatus before his internship was scheduled to begin he decided to go to Russia to study and assist in the control of the epidemic When he saw the extent of the famine he offered to buy wheat for the Soviet Government He says that Lenin hearing of his offer invited him to the Kremlin and told him We do not need doctors we need businessmen Communism is not working and we must change to a New Economic Policy Then according to Hammer Lenin offered him a concession for mining asbestos in the Urals and another for organizing Soviet foreign trade  the first foreign concessions ever in the Soviet Union The story behind Hammers concessions however involves considerably more intrigue than that according to recently declassified State Department and Army intelligence files at the National Archives Those files suggest that the Soviet arrangement actually began with Hammers father Julius Hammer an immigrant from Russia who was a dedicated supporter of Lenin and the Communist Party Indeed according to one account Julius named Armand after the armandhammer symbol of the Socialist Labor Party Julius Hammer also a doctor by training had built a prosperous business in New York selling shampoos medicinal alcohols and pharmaceutical drugs Julius Hammer also became a financial supporter of radical causes and it was in this capacity that he established his connections with the Soviet Union After Lenin seized power in 1917 Washington not only refused to recognize his Government it did not relent until 1933 but it also effectively cut off Moscows access to all its gold and currency reserves in the United States The net effect was that the Soviet Government could not buy the supplies it desperately needed to retain power To remedy the situation Lenin appointed a GermanRussian engineer named Ludwig CAK Martens as his ambassador to the United States with the mission of organizing shipments of supplies to the Soviet Union Since Martens could not get control of the Russian funds immediately he turned to Julius Hammer for interim financing Hammer paid the rent and other expenses of Martenss unofficial Soviet Bureau in New York Hammer was officially appointed commercial attache of the Soviet Bureau and also was given an exclusive license for Russian trade with the United States By 1918 the Soviet Union was financing the Soviet Bureau by smuggling diamonds into New York Julius Hammer was responsible for converting these diamonds into cash to finance the purchase of Soviet supplies according to the autobiography of one of Julius Hammers fellow party members Armand Hammer denies this In any case the Hammer family soon moved from their modest home in the Bronx to luxurious quarters in the Hotel Ansonia in Manhattan and Julius Hammer noticeably improved his style of living Julius Hammer organized and held equity in a corporation originally called the Allied Drug and Chemical Company and which later evolved into the Allied American Corporation This company provided the Soviet Bureau with a convenient channel for shipping medical and other supplies to Baltic ports from where they were reshipped into Russia According to someone employed by the Hammer family who acted as an informant for the Justice Department the corporation was 50 percent owned by Martens presumably on behalf of the Soviet Government On the basis of such information the Department of Justice and other Federal intelligence agencies kept the entire operation under close surveillance even attempting to infiltrate it Finally in 1921 the Government deported Martens and closed his bureau At about the same time Julius Hammer was arrested tried convicted and sentenced to three years in prison for performing an illegal abortion that resulted in the death of the wife of a Russian diplomat Armand Hammer believed and still believes that his father was railroaded on trumpedup charges because of his political activities He denies the allegations that his fathers corporation was owned by the Soviet Government or Martens And he also insists that he bought all the shares in the corporation himself before he left for the Soviet Union in the summer of 1921 With Julius Hammer in prison and Martens back in the Soviet Union Armand Hammer had little choice but to take over the business He acknowledges that he intended to collect some of the debts that the Russian Government owed his family business and on his passport application he listed his reason for travel as commercial business and pleasure In Moscow Hammer met with Martens who had been appointed to the Supreme Economic Council to discuss the resumption of shipments through his corporation Martens brought Hammer to see Boris Reinstein who was then in charge of organizing the Department of International Propaganda Reinstein who was working on a new political initiative to attract foreign capital to the Soviet Union accompanied Hammer to Lenins office in the Kremlin When asked about Reinsteins interest in him Hammer said that he merely brought Reinstein along to see Lenin as a translator But it is known that Lenin spoke fluent English And Lenins papers indicate that Reinstein played a crucial role in getting Hammer his concessions Lenin realized that the Soviet Union desperately needed Western technology and he saw concessions as a temporary expedient towards this end He wrote in a secret message to the Communist Party Concessions these do not mean peace with capitalism but war on a new plane To carry out his new economic policy Lenin now needed a capitalist who would accept a Soviet concession and advertise it in the United States Hammer seemed a likely candidate In October 1921 Lenin wrote Martens instructing him to give Hammer a contract for some kind of concession even if a fictitious one of asbestos or any other Ural valuables or whatever you will What we want to show and have in print  is that the Americans have gone in for concessions This is important politically He further instructed Martens to get maximum publicity for the concession Several months later after the concession was officially granted  and publicized in the United States Lenin wrote his secret missive to Stalin and the Politburo explaining that the Hammer enterprise was a path to American business that was to be used in every way Lenin who was paralyzed by a nearly fatal stroke the day after sending the communique never clarified the idea further Hammers concessions included not only the asbestos mine but also the extraordinary right to act as agent for Soviet trade with the United States To develop this latter concession Hammer traveled throughout the United States attempting to persuade American companies to invest capital and transfer technology to the Soviet Union He was joined in this enterprise by his father who was paroled from Sing Sing prison in 1923 and also by his brother Harry Hammer By 1925 he succeeded in recruiting no fewer than 38 corporations that supplied Russia with everything from machinery to agricultural equipment Hammer also became the agent for the Ford Motor Companys Fordson tractors in the Soviet Union and even arranged for Russian engineers to come to the United States to study Fords techniques of mass production Aside from business trips to the United States Hammer resided in the Soviet Union for the better part of a decade He moved into a palatial home called Brown House in the center of Moscow and married a Russian singer named Olga Vadina who was one of the leading entertainers in the capital In 1928 she bore him a son Julian At about this same time he was joined in Moscow by his father And both his older brother Harry and his younger brother Victor also stayed with him from time to time Many members of his family have continued to work for him ever since Hammers Allied American Corporation was no ordinary company in Moscow When Lenins New Economic Policy ended about 1925 and virtually every other foreign concession was nationalized without compensation Allied American received a lucrative Soviet pencilmanufacturing concession This raised questions about the Soviet role in Hammers business Hammer insists he was the sole owner of Allied American and he asserts I made all the decisions and the Soviet Government had nothing to do with the running of the business According to documents submitted in a tax suit by Allied American Corporation however it was acknowledged that the Soviet Government through its Commissariat of Foreign Trade did in fact select and appoint two directors of Allied American with powers equal to other directors in carrying out the contract and that it had the absolute right to establish the price of its exports Moreover the agreement provided for a division of profits between the Soviet Government and the Allied American Corporation These documents suggest that the Soviet Government had considerably more influence in the operations of Allied American than Hammer recollects British Intelligence also became intrigued with the operation of Allied American after a raid on Soviet House in London in 1927 A State Department intelligence report later noted Dr Julius Hammer was prohibited entry into the United Kingdom as a political agent and as the controlling personage of the Allied American Corporation which was used as a cover for the transmission of Soviet funds to American revolutionary organizations Whatever the case Hammer received extraordinary treatment from Moscow in many ways He was permitted by the Soviet Government to take millions of dollars worth of czarist art out of the country when he returned to the United States in 1932 Apparently many of these objects came out of Soviet museums and warehouses Robert C Williams a historian at Washington University and the author of the book Russian Art and American Money tracked down a number of the pieces and found that they still had museum labels and numbers on them When asked about this Hammer explained to me that although the core of the treasure was art he had personally acquired and hung in his Moscow house the Soviet Government had also allowed him to buy surplus museum art for which he had to pay a 15 percent export tax However he obtained and exported this art Hammer sold it in the United States both through department stores and his Hammer Galleries And for more than a decade Hammer continued importing art from the Soviet Union He estimated that the art treasures brought him a profit of over 11 million in the midst of the Depression The final disposition of the proceeds from this multimilliondollar sale remains elusive But it is known that he invested part of it in a beer barrel factory that imported all its wood from the Soviet Union through a contract with Amtorg the Soviet trading company that had succeeded Hammers company Hammers return to New York from Moscow affected his personal as well as his business life He separated from his wife Olga who moved to Hollywood to reconstruct her singing career and took with her their young son He eventually married Angela Zevely a socially prominent woman from Red Bank NJ Hammer also changed from the beerbarrel business to the whisky business buying a major share of a company that was eventually called United Distillers of America Inc Then in the mid1940s he settled down to the gentlemanly pursuit of breeding prizewinning Black Angus bulls on Shadow Isle his wifes farm in New Jersey His second marriage proved far from idyllic however and in 1953 he filed suit for divorce charging his wife with mental cruelty Mrs Hammer offered a few critical comments of her own She said that her husband had a cold and calculating brain and that it causes him no pain to see the sufferings of others In many conversationsmy husband would boast about the way he handled people and organizations who sought in any way to block him in his desires In 1955 Hammer decided to start life anew Selling his herd of Black Angus cattle and his whisky business he moved to Los Angeles where he married for a third time to Frances Tolman The following year Hammer along with his new wife and a few friends arranged to take over a nearly defunct oil company selling for 18 cents a share That company was Occidental Petroleum In l961 Armand Hammer returned to Russia as an unofficial trade emissary Hammer found the United States Embassy in Moscow less than helpful Junior aides treated his mission as nothing more than a political lark They were more than a little startled when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev himself requested a meeting with Hammer in the Kremlin Khrushchev had avoided almost any highlevel contacts with American officials since he had canceled the summit meeting with President Dwight D Eisenhower in 1960 When Hammer arrived at his office Khrushchev dismissed the translators and both men talked in Russian The Russian leader made a strong case for United States credits arguing that Soviet orders for American goods could relieve unempoyment in the United States If you give us credit  you will keep your plants busy Hammers recalls Khrushchev telling him Khrushchev also told Hammer that the Soviet Union needed billions of dollars worth of phosphorusbased fertilizers for its agriculture Hammer saw the possibility of using his fledgling oil company as a vehicle for organizing a multibilliondollar trade in fertilizers with the Soviet Union When Hammer returned to the United States he began buying up the components necessary for a fertilizer business He bought Interore International Ore and Fertilizer Corporation then the largest fertilizer trading company in the United States Best Fertilizer a producer of ammonia and the Jefferson Lake Sulphur Company Next he acquired vast tracts of phosphate deposits in north Florida By 1963 Occidental Petroleum had become primarily a fertilizer company with oil and gas accounting for less than 10 percent of its income But the success of the phosphate deal would ultimately depend on the Soviet Union receiving American bank credits to enable it to buy the fertilizers and these were not forthcoming from the Kennedy Administration When the Cuban missile crisis further complicated United StatesSoviet relations Hammer turned to Britain for the necessary financial credits But when Khrushchev fell from power in 1964 the fertilizer deal had to be put temporarily at least into abeyance Not long afterward Dr Hammer found another opportunity that would prove even more lucrative The notoriously corrupt Libyan government of King Idris was seeking independent oil companies to bid for oil concessions that were adjacent to the concessions held by the oil giants Hammer bid on the concessions  and won them The flow of Libyan oil that Occidental began extracting soon r
ached almost 500000 barrels a day and turned Occidental into a multibilliondollar company When Col Qaddafi overthrew the Idris monarchy in 1969 he immediately confronted the 21 oil companies in Libya and told them he wanted to increase his nations share of the oil to 51 percent Up to this point all the oil companies had acted in unison in refusing to permit any nation to raise its share above 49 percent This time however Qaddafi applied pressure against Occidental which depended almost entirely on Libya for its supply of oil Dr Hammer says he approached Kenneth Jamieson the chief executive of Exxon and offered to stand fast against Qaddafi if and only if Exxon would provide it with 500000 barrels of oil a day at close to cost According to Hammer it was only when Jamieson refused this demand that he flew to Tripoli and came to terms with Qaddafi The common front was now irreparably breached and other oil companies in Libya had little choice but to accede to Qaddafis demands By breaking ranks with the oil giants in Libya Hammer had effectively changed the rules of the game for oil companies in the Middle East Oil companies could now be played off against one another Under these new conditions the rise of OPEC was greatly accelerated The Central Intelligence Agency counterintelligence staff became concerned with these negotiations when routine interceptions of the secret communications between Moscow and the Soviet Embassy in Tripoli suddenly showed a quantum leap in volume that coincided with turns in the oil negotiations While American cryptoanalysts at the National Security Agency could count the messages being transmitted they could not crack the code itself and therefore the content of this spurt in volume remained conjectural Hammer himself denies that the Soviet Union had intervened on his behalf in the negotiations recalling that to the best of his knowledge this was purely a Libyan affair Whatever the case as a result of these negotiations Occidental became the major beneficiary of Libyan oil Hammers company built its own pipeline to the Mediterranean and bought a refinery tankers and a distribution system in Europe With the enormous cash flow from Libya Hammer began to buy other properties around the world In Peru following the l968 takeover by a revolutionary junta Hammer again fished in troubled waters accepting a concession in the Amazon Basin He further assisted the new Government by depositing 25 million of Occidental funds in Peruvian banks Then in the British North Sea Hammer bought major shares in the Piper and Claymore fields which eventually proved to be rich in oil And in the United States he bought Island Creek Coal the countrys fourth largest coal producer and made arrangements to barter coal for chemicals with Rumania Italy and other countries In 1968 Hammer also bought Hooker Chemical Company the corporation that 11 years later was to become embroiled in multimilliondollar lawsuits as a result of its dumping of toxic wastes into the Love Canal in upstate New York In April 1973 after 12 years of efforts Hammer finally reached a definitive 20 billion agreement with the Russians for his fertilizers In return the Soviet Union would supply Occidental with a million metric tons of ammonia potash and urea per year which it would sell through its Hooker Chemical subsidiary And with its Libyan oil money Occidental no longer needed American bank credits to finance the deal Even though the United States Department of Mines objected that the massive transfer of Florida phosphates to the Soviet Union would deplete American reserves President Nixon wrote a letter to William Casey then the head of the ExportImport Bank in which he strongly recommended granting the Soviet Union a lowinterest loan of 180 million to build the plants and pipelines it needed for the Hammer enterprise Nixon declared that the loan would be in the national interest and it was therefore approved by Casey Hammer had indeed personally briefed Nixon on the status of his deal adding according to the White House tapes I am glad to tell you that I am a member of the 100000 Club  referring to his illegal cash contribution to the Nixon campaign Soon afterward Hammer announced a bewildering array of other EastWest deals These included a 4 billion pipeline through Siberia that would supply Japan with Russian gas the sale to Moscow of enough metalfinishing machines to build an industry the construction of hotels and inns in Eastern Europe the minting of coins for the Olympics and arrangements to barter coal to Rumania What Lenin had described a half century earlier as a small path to American business had now expanded into a superhighway Leonid Brezhnev has publicly recognized Hammers role in facilitating EastWest trade Standing next to Hammer on an NBC television program filmed in Moscow in l974 the Soviet leader said Armand Hammer has expended considerable effort I help him he helps me It is mutual We do not discuss secrets just business Hammers business has indeed been of great value to the Soviet Union as it has been to Libya and its dictator Muammar elQaddafi In return Hammer has reaped handsome rewards Has the United States benefitted as well That question is more difficult to answer conclusively Today there is a heated debate within the Reagan Administration on the merits of EastWest trade Trade is part of the dialogue between the United States and Russia and it is crucial that we keep this dialogue going Hammer says The Soviet leadership is gradually coming to see trade rather than confrontation with the West as the way to improve economic conditions If we are going to have peace we should encourage the Soviet leadership in this direction And Hammer adds In any event if the United States refuses to sell the Soviet Union the products it needs other countries will Hammers critics might recall Lenins dictum that when it comes time to hang the capitalists the capitalists themselves will compete to sell the rope Former American Ambassador to Moscow Malcolm Toon says Im uneasy about Hammers close relations with the Soviet leadership Im not suggesting any sinister KGB connection  Hammer is probably far too valuable as an organizer of Soviet trade for him to be used by the Soviets for any other purpose Or his critics might simply point out how convenient it is that Hammers convictions on world peace and international relations always neatly coincide with his selfinterest Fair or not such criticism is to be expected,,
COURTLY CHAMPION OF AMERICA'S ELDERLY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/29/magazine/courtly-champion-of-america-s-elderly.html,John Egerton is a Nashvillebased journalist and author By John Egerton f ever a constituency could be expected to belong to a public official the 25 million Americans age 65 and over should belong to Ronald Reagan At 70 he is one of them the oldest person ever to be elected to the White House Millions of senior citizens share the general tenets of his conservative Republican philosophy He is an attractive and glamorous man a personification of usefulness and productivity in later years an inspiration to others his age But Mr Reagan is not without competition for the loyalties of the elderly  and indirectly for their votes One of his most outspoken challengers is a short combative and indefatigable elder statesman from Florida 81yearold Representative Claude D Pepper of Miami A New Deal Democrat and an unwavering liberal from the day he first gained a seat in the United States Senate in 1936 Pepper is now the oldest member of either house of Congress He is also chairman of the House Select Committee on Aging and is widely regarded as the leading Congressional authority on  and advocate of  Federal assistance to the elderly When the third decennial White House Conference on Aging begins its fourday meeting in Washington tomorrow the 2200 voting delegates will be primed for a clash between the Reagan and Pepper philosophies if not a confrontation between the two men themselves Pepper will not only be a featured speaker but also plans to attend every session of the conference which has been authorized by Congress to develop recommendations on issues concerning the elderly But at this writing it is not yet certain if President Reagan will address the conference as President Eisenhower did the first one early in January 1961  when Medicare proposals were developed  and President Nixon did in 1971  when a collection of bills mostly dealing with nutrition were spawned Some delegates have charged as has Pepper that the Administration through the Republican National Committee had been attempting to sabotage the conference stacking the deck by increasing the voting membership by 200 as a means of blunting criticism against Presidential budget cuts affecting the elderly But these charges have been vehemently denied by Richard S Schweiker the Secretary of Health and Human Services whose department has responsibility for carrying out conference activities The Republican National Committee has however acknowledged that it recently conducted telephone interviews of almost half the delegates during which their views on the Presidents policies and other issues were sought Although Ronald Reagan and Claude Pepper have never formally met their sharply contrasting reputations have preceded them to the conference on aging in the form of highblown prefight oratory A highly placed Reagan aide has called Pepper the perfect embodiment of the Democratic philosophy of big spending that has almost destroyed this nations economy Pepper in turn has excoriated the Presidents economic policies as a multibilliondollar tax transfer to the rich a blueprint for disaster that will bring shame to our nation and misery to millions of older Americans The White House Conference on Aging is not the only forum in which the Reagan and Pepper philosophies will be joined in battle in the months ahead Pepper has his Select Committee on Aging as a permanent base which he uses skillfully Earlier this month his committee held a conference curtain raiser on pension fraud and Pepper made a guest appearance before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee as did the venerable 81yearold actress Helen Hayes to support additional healthcare proposals Speaker Thomas P ONeill has provided Pepper with another forum by designating him to represent House Democrats on the 15member bipartisan Social Security review commission proposed by President Reagan And if the Democrats retain control of the House in next years elections Pepper will be in line to become chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee and thus will control what legislation goes or doesnt go to the floor of the House for a vote From opposite ends of the American political spectrum the President and the Congressman from Florida have become prominent and powerful public figures whose actions are vitally important to all senior citizens The President has yet to publicly acknowledge his adversary Pepper says I have no ill will against the President but his has been the most reactionary voice in public life for the past 15 years He is an affable man with foolish dangerous ideas When the two positions we represent come into conflict as they inevitably will it will be an interesting fight and I look forward to it In fact Ill relish it Peppers longtime colleague from Miami Democratic Representative Dante B Fascell says he cant see Claude losing this battle Hes been around for a long time and he understands the dynamics of politics the fine points of positioning and timing Claude doesnt fall into traps  he might spring a few but he wont get caught in any If the President insists on a major overhaul of the Social Security system I think hell have to back down If I were a betting man Id put my money on Pepper Two weeks after President Reagans inauguration the Select Committee on Aging which can hold hearings but cannot report legislation directly to the floor presented a briefing for members of the House of Representatives on the status of the elderly in America Citing statistics from a variety of Government sources chairman Pepper asserted that 157 percent of the elderly  nearly 4 million people  have incomes below the poverty line pegged at 394100 for single elderly individuals that 60 percent would be in those circumstances were it not for Social Security and that in 1980 more than twothirds of all senior citizens had incomes of less than 6000 Medicare Pepper told his colleagues is estimated to pay only about 38 percent of the health bills of the elderly and only the poorest of the poor are eligible for Medicaid with similar limitations applying to various supplemental benefits Yet said Pepper There are many voices sounding the call for retreat  Social Security they say  must be slashed  in order to make it possible to cut the taxes of many  who hardly need tax reduction as much as the elderly need the benefits they are receiving Far from cutting benefit programs Pepper advocated a comprehensive legislative package to improve the state of the elderly in America Among its features would be increased minimum benefits for people who have worked all their lives under Social Security but who do not get benefits that would put them above the poverty line increased private pension coverage to compensate for needs not covered by Social Security and expanded coverage under Medicare Although he has not spelled out where the money to provide these benefits would come from Pepper has suggested that most if not all of the longterm financial problems of Social Security would be solved if a large portion of the medical expenses now drawn from Social Security funds were to come instead from general tax revenues He also believes that substantial additional funds would be available if more people were encouraged voluntarily to postpone retirement thus reducing the number of elderly drawing from the system while increasing the number still putting money into it When Peppers committee invited David A Stockman director of the Office of Management and Budget to testify in April on what impact the budget cuts for fiscal year 1982 would have on the elderly the budget director presented figures indicating that the total of Federal tax dollars in support programs for the elderly would actually rise from 144 billion in fiscal 1980 to 191 billion in fiscal 1982 Stockman went on to summarize the Administrations proposed economies including elimination of the minimum monthly benefit under Social Security and a phaseout of certain survivor and death benefits In his typical courtly manner Pepper complimented the distinguished and able and honorable Stockman on how well he had presented his statistics As a matter of fact Pepper added if the elderly people had been listening to you they would think you would be conferring a blessing on them by making these cuts Then the octogenarian committee chairman asked Are you able to assure us Mr Stockman  that these cuts comply with the assurance the President gave to the people that his program for budget cutting would not adversely affect the truly needy of the country I think in the main I can give you that assurance was Stockmans reply Pepper was unconvinced In July his committee issued a report claiming that the Administrations proposals would result in Social Security benefit reductions of 1065 billion in fiscal 1982 and estimated that over the next few decades expenditures would be cut by 23 percent Discussing the matter recently Pepper said They want to make a raid on the Social Security trust funds to finance their own programs and balance the Federal budget Im going to fight like the devil to prevent that Congress may need to make some adjustments in benefits and funding as it has done 14 times since the Social Security Act was passed But the trust funds are not going bankrupt as the Administration claims and were not going to take away from the American people the little bit of security they have paid for all their working lives When the Social Security Act was first passed by Congress in 1936 payroll workers were taxed 20 a year  1 percent of the first 2000 of their earnings  to finance the system As the number of recipients has grown and benefits have been expanded the cost has risen steadily In 1982 payroll workers will pay 67 percent on the first 32400 of their earnings for a maximum Social Security tax of 217080 with their employers paying a matching percentage selfemployed persons will pay 935 percent on the first 32400 of their earnings for a maximum tax of 302940 Additional increases over the next several years to be recalculated every year according to a complex formula that includes the cost of living index have already been mandated by Congress Despite rising contributions however the three trust funds into which Social Security taxes are paid  the retirement disability and health funds  have faced a problem of diminishing reserves in recent years Opinions differ widely on the causes and possible solutions to the problem Most experts appear to agree that some relatively simple stopgap measures such as borrowing from one of the trust funds to shore up another will provide temporary relief But the longterm problem is a demographic one Whereas 32 workers now pay into the system for every beneficiary in another 40 years or so the gradually aging population will have cut that ratio to 21 and the trust funds will inevitably be exhausted some say as soon as the year 2025 There are at bottom only two possible solutions to this longterm problem increased revenue from higher Social Security taxes or reductions in the number of recipients or the amount of benefits or both Last spring the Reagan Administration proposed 13 different reductions in benefits or recipients for an estimated saving of more than 88 billion over the next five years But only three of these proposals have passed into law  cutting monthly minimum college expense benefits for survivors burial expenses and the 122amonth minimum benefit paid to some three million retired persons And even before this last measure took effect strong public opposition has caused Congress to initiate steps to undo it Some Democrats  notably JJ Pickle of Texas chairman of the House Subcomittee on Social Security  have proposed raising the retirement age of beneficiaries and lowering the automatic costofliving increases they receive annually as compromise measures to correct the longterm deficit prospect But the Democratic leadership contends that such compromises are not necessary with Claude Pepper adding that changes of this magnitude would amount to  a breach of faith to the elderly In the White House Pepper is seen as a serious impediment to Administration hopes of achieving a balanced budget An executive department aide speaks for many of his colleagues when he says of Pepper Hes got a committee thats stacked with people who wont face the hard choices this country is up against  Everybody admires him enormously for his courage and vitality but if his view prevails on the funding of entitlement programs for the elderly the longterm implications are frightening Theres no way this country can afford such enormous expenditures Such comments cause Pepper to smile I refuse to believe that a country as rich and powerful as ours cant afford to guarantee the basic comfort and security of its older citizens I know we can do it he says and I intend to be long and loud about it In 14 years as a Senator and 19 as a member of the House  sandwiched around a 12year law practice  Claude Pepper has almost always spoken his mind His Washington career has encompassed the Administrations of nine Presidents He was a bellwether for Franklin Roosevelt a headache for Harry Truman a nemesis of Richard Nixon and a valuable ally of John Kennedy Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter He had been branded a warmonger a peacenik a Communist an advocate of civil rights He has had private audiences with popes and princes and private interviews with such historic figures as Stalin and Churchill during the years he was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Now he is embarked on a crusade in behalf of a class of citizens to which he himself belongs Ageism is as odious as racism and sexism he says and with the stamina of a man half his age he scurries about like an octogenarian Paul Revere calling people of advanced years to their own defense and demanding that the rest of the population recognize their rights and their worth All his life Pepper has been a partisan a Saturday Evening Post writer said of him in 1946 He has always been tagged as a liberal too and that in itself is somewhat anomalous considering his background Claude Denson Pepper the oldest of four children in a family of yeomen farmers was born near Dudleyville Ala in the first year of this century Both of his grandfathers had fought for the Confederacy Amid the poverty of their time and place his parents could be thought of as middleclass they were smallplot landowners mainline Baptists loyal Democrats After a brief succession of jobs as a hat blocker a schoolteacher and a steelworker Claude Pepper entered the University of Alabama in 1918 and graduated three years later He went from Alabama to Harvard Law School after which he taught for a year at the University of Arkansas Law School J William Fulbright later a fellow Senator was one of his students In 1925 he borrowed 300 to finance a move to Perry Fla and a start in a law practice By 1928 he had become a member of the Florida Legislature but lost his bid for reelection in 1929 Moving to Tallahassee he continued his pursuit of higher office That same year he saw a beautiful girl in a yellow dress coming out of the Governors office and arranged an introduction to Irene Mildred Webster of St Petersburg Six years later he married her Pepper ran in 1934 against a popular but inactive United States Senator Park Trammell and lost by just 4000 votes Two years later after the death of Floridas other senator Duncan U Fletcher Pepper was nominated by his party to finish Fletchers term If you want to know about Claude Pepper says Jack Ossofsky executive director of the National Council on Aging go back and read his maiden speech in the Senate in 1937 He could give that speech today and it would still be relevant In that first speech the young Senator responded with vigorous and expansive rebuttal to the assertion by a colleague that national economic recovery had been achieved and the time had come to cut costly New Deal programs in order to erase the national debt and balance the Federal budget The new Senator from Florida and President Roosevelt quickly established a strong liking for each other If I knew anything Pepper recalls I knew the South needed help and Roosevelt was our only chance to get it Having arrived in Washington favoring oldage pensions and Federal aid to education it was a natural progression for Pepper to become an early advocate of Social Security minimum wage and hour laws and national health insurance He became an outspoken defender of Roosevelts New Deal programs and in 1938 his candidacy for a full term in the Senate was of sufficient national interest for him to be pictured on the cover of Time magazine above a caption that read A Florida fighting cock will be a White House weathervane He won handily and two years later so did Roosevelt for the third time In 1940 Pepper proposed a national military draft and angry isolationists reviling him as a traitor and a warmonger hanged him in effigy on the Capitol grounds A year later he almost singlehandedly persuaded the Senate to support lendlease aid to the European allies columnist Walter Lippmann secretly helped him draft the bill But somehow his advocacy of social programs and military preparedness while it provoked controversy among conservatives and isolationists was not enough to get him into deep trouble at home He was reelected in 1944 albeit by a mere 10000 votes After the war Pepper went to Europe where he met with Churchill Eisenhower and Stalin He praised the Soviet leader and because it had had been an ally advocated aid along the lines of the Marshall Plan to the wartorn Soviet Union He once advocated destroying all atom bombs as the surest way to prevent nuclear war He was an early backer of Henry Wallace for President but when the leftwing former Secretary of Agriculture went the third party route Pepper who has always done his fighting within the party quickly left him He became a pleader for Dwight Eisenhowers candidacy as a Democrat and briefly an announced candidate himself before coming around to support Harry Trumans nomination in 1948 There was more opposition to the unionregulating TaftHartley bill support for antipoll tax measures advocacy of laws guaranteeing fair employment practices It was all finally too much for Peppers enemies Led by the Du Pont empires Florida boss Edward Ball and assisted by such groups and individuals as the American Medical Association the United States Chamber of Commerce Joseph P Kennedy and Floridas Senator Spessard Holland the antiPepper forces sought and found a candidate to run against him Their man was a tall handsome young Representative and Pepper protege named George A Smathers Robert Sherrill in his book Gothic Politics in the Deep South called the PepperSmathers race the most elaborate crusade of political annihilation ever conducted in Southern politics Smathers won the bruising primary battle by 67000 votes He served three terms in the Senate and since 1969 has been a lawyer and lobbyist in Washington His remembrance of the 1950 campaign  and of Claude Pepper  has mellowed with time I never said a lot of the stuff about Claude that was attributed to me I thought Claude was way off track I felt he was soft on Stalin  he was wrong on a lot of things that gave comfort to the Communists I said it then and I still say it But that was a long time ago and now happily were friendly when we see each other Hes a remarkable man Theres nobody who can better speak for the aged than Claude Hes the right man in the right place at the right time He can carry the fight on Social Security and Id be happy to see him do it I think he and President Reagan will have a meeting of the minds Pepper remembers the race against Smathers as a vicious campaign a smear campaign of innuendo and guilt by association Richard Nixon started the trend in 1946 the year he and Smathers were elected to the House Later that low style of smear tactics personified McCarthyism but Joe McCarthy didnt invent it  Nixon did and Smathers refined it With a sizable campaign debt and little income Pepper resumed the practice of law He opened an office in Tallahassee then another in Washington and a third in Miami where he eventually took up residence In spite of his leftwing reputation he attracted wellheeled clients  Westinghouse Bethlehem Steel Time magazine In 1958 he ran for the Senate again but failed by 53000 votes Through it all Pepper remained a loyal and active Democrat working for Adlai E Stevenson John F Kennedy and later for Lyndon B Johnson Hubert H Humphrey George S McGovern and Jimmy Carter In the meantime the 1960 census gave Dade County and Miami an additional House seat and Pepper won it in a crowded field in 1962 The district is a mostly Democratic melange of retirees whitecollar and bluecollar workers Hispanics blacks and relocated New Yorkers It includes parts of Miami Beach the Cuban and Haitian refugee communities and the troubled black ghetto of Liberty City Pepper has always stayed in close touch with his constituents and they have rewarded him with nine easy reelection victories Even in 1972 when Richard Nixon carried Dade County with 59 percent of the vote Pepper got 63 percent against his own Republican opponent and in 1980 he beat a CubanAmerican Republican by a 3to1 margin His prospects for victory again in 1982 appear excellent no opponent has yet materialized nor apparently has he been targeted by any conservative or rightwing groups The story of the rise and fall and rise again of Claude Pepper covers so many years that it has a quality of timelessness Few people now seem to remember how controversial he once was Democrats and Republicans alike praise his gracious manner his wit and wisdom his staying power his political skill He is the quintessence of a good public servant says Representative Pickle Hell always be Lord Chesterfield to us Millicent Fenwick of New Jersey a member of Mr Peppers committee on aging is one Republican who lauds him as a dear kindly gallant gentleman whose concern for the elderly is absolutely genuine Some feel he goes too far in his zeal she says but none doubt his sincerity or his influence Any debate on the future of Social Security in this country has to include him Others may be more expert on actuarial tables and taxes but someone has to speak for the heart Claude speaks for the heart In a similar vein Maggie Kuhn leader of the Gray Panthers an aggressive advocacy group for the elderly says Pepper is not a special pleader for the elderly but an advocate of social justice for the whole society He sees and serves the larger constituency Two freshman House members young enough to be Peppers grandchildren compliment him from opposite sides of the aisle Republican John LeBoutillier of New York at 28 the youngest member now in Congress says the Administration really blew it last spring when they suggested cuts in Social Security  They gave Pepper the ammunition to beat them with and he has made the most of it Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon age 32 was working in legal and social programs for the elderly when he first met Pepper The opportunity to serve with him was a major reason I decided to run for Congress Wyden says Hes a bulldog for the elderly a passionately committed defender New York Democrat Mario Biaggi a House colleague of Peppers since 1968 praises him as a man of integrity and principle In the earlier years of his career anything less than vocal and vigorous defense of white supremacy was political suicide for a Southern politician yet he opposed racism In Peppers own recollection of his earlier positions on civil rights issues he recalls one in particular that he regrets In 1938 I filibustered for 11 hours against a bill to make lynching a Federal offense It was the last time I ever opposed a civil rights measure Nevertheless 20 years later in a futile attempt to unseat segregationist Senator Spessard Holland Pepper struggled uncomfortably to avoid being branded as an integrationist It was not until he returned to Congress in 1962 that he was able to stake out an unequivocal position on racial issues Since his early years in the Senate Pepper has practiced a style of liberalism that skillfully blends pragmatic and idealistic concerns He has supported funding proposals for the pure sciences and was instrumental in the creation of the Governments cancerresearch programs he has given strong support to Cuban refugees and has regularly denounced the Castro regime he has sought middle ground on the issues of gun control and abortion he has voted consistently for the military budgets proposed by the House Armed Services Committee in the firm belief that the nation can afford guns and butter In general he is an advocate of Government activism as the surest and fairest way to peace and prosperity In recent years he has introduced legislation to abolish mandatory retirement to help fight crime in housing projects for the elderly to cut Amtrak fares for senior citizens to make nutritious meals available to the elderly His committee on aging has kept up a steady schedule of widely publicized hearings His newspaper column  Ask Congressman Pepper  is circulated to more than 700 papers all over the country We all look to him says William R Hutton executive director of the National Council of Senior Citizens Hes the focal point of the older Americans interests in Congress Since his wife died he has lived completely for his job Hes the nearest thing this country has to a national congressman Mildred Peppers death of cancer in 1979 ended what his Florida Congressional colleague Dante Fascell says was a true love match The couple who were childless had been virtually inseparable for 42 years After a period of adjustment to his wifes death Pepper who stayed on in the modest Washington apartment he and his wife had occupied for 10 years resumed his full schedule He typically works ninehour days on Capitol Hill attends numerous evening functions and returns to Miami almost every weekend to be available to his constituents And increasingly he is immersed in the last crusade on his agenda the welfare of the nations elderly citizens Pepper expects his job to keep him busy indefinitely I hate to think Ill have to quit someday he says My goal is to see this century out  and get the next one off to a good start Claude Peppers gray eyes scanned the headlines of his morning paper as he breakfasted in his Miami condominium overlooking Biscayne Bay during a recent weekend visit to his consituency He tosses down his napkin and chuckles Mr Reagan says the economy is in recession he announced Well well I wonder who told him Mr Stockman I guess The humor is shortlived How in the world he could be 70 years old and have so little feeling for the elderly Ill never know He seems to have no compassion He disdains the poor At the White House aides of the President are equally as puzzled as one of them put it that after 50 years of Government profligacy the Claude Peppers of this world still want more Their idea of serving is simply to spend more money Thats not a solution to this countrys problems  its the primary cause of them It seems fitting that two public servants of advanced age should have so much to do with the setting of Government policy toward the elderly They are certainly equal to the challenge both mentally and physically Mr Reagans health has been one of his great strengths Mr Pepper though he is 11 years older seems equally fit For exercise he plays 18 holes of golf every week or two pedals a stationary bicycle in his apartment on rainy weekends and walks farther and faster than any member of his staff On the first Saturday in October doctors at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington inserted a pacemaker under Peppers skin It was he says a preventive maintenance measure to keep my heart strong Two days later he was back on the floor of the House to support a bill extending the life of the Voting Rights Act Then he was off to Florida for a busy week of speeches and public appearances I asked the doctor how long the battery in this thing would last he remarked later patting his chest He said it was good for about 10 years I told him Id just take three of them with me now and come back for more later if I need them

BIRTH CONTROL ADS MAKE DEBUT ON FRENCH TV,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/29/world/birth-control-ads-make-debut-on-french-tv.html,French television has a new hit  a Governmentsponsored commercial advocating contraception Appearing daily through Dec 9 the commercial is part of the first public information campaign on contraception since birth control was legalized in France in 1967 The campaign and the idea for the commercial originated with the new Minister for Womens Rights Yvette Roudy The 30second television spot was made by Agnes Varda a prominent French actress director and feminist with the theme Today every woman should be able to choose In contrast to the battle in the National Assembly and the press when contraception was legalized 14 years ago the new campaign has drawn enormous support and negligible opposition Even the Roman Catholic Church long an implacable opponent of artificial birth control has expressed little public opposition to the initiative The French medical profession which also opposed public information on birth control for many years has backed the campaign A Simple Message Everyone seems to think its an excellent idea Mrs Roudy said at a news conference last week Essentially its the simplicity of our message  that information about conception is a legitimate right The commercial offers no technical advice It consists of brief scenes In one a mother surrounded by four children says I need children around but frankly another one would be too much In another a young mother is shown with a baby in a stroller Im going to have another she says but er I think Ill wait a while A voiceover says that there are 1413 information and family planning centers in France and that their locations and services are posted in city halls and post offices all over the country The means to plan your life exist it says Learn about them You have a right to this information Contraception is a public right Only 755 centers offer consultations physical examinations and contraceptives The rest provide information only The previous Government estimated that France needed 8500 more birth control centers and Mrs Roudy does not dispute the figure Birth Control Use Drops Only 30 percent of French women between the ages of 15 and 50 use any form of birth control according to a Government survey made in 1978 It found that 235 percent used birth control pills and that about 7 percent used interuterine devices Since 1978 Mrs Roudy said the totals in both groups have dropped According to a 1979 study of 2600 students 20 years old and under only 19 percent were using the pill down from 33 percent in 1976 The idea of a publicity campaign was agreed upon in June only weeks after the Socialist victory and the formation of the new Government Mrs Roudy said After that she lined up support for the campaign Of the 42 Government ministers we solicited she said 24 asked to participate Mrs Roudy said she particularly valued the cooperation of the Ministers of Education and of Youth and Sports Young girls are the most important targets of this campaign she said At present one abortion in three in France involves a girl under 18 years of age The Minister of Youth and Sports Edwige Avice offered 19 of the departments youth centers as information outlets The Minister for Research agreed to step up investigation into better contraceptive methods De Gaulle Supported Bill The 1967 measure legalizing contraception known as the Neuwirth Law for its author Lucien Neuwirth a recently defeated member of the National Assembly faced heavy opposition in the legislature The bill was supported by President Charles de Gaulle seemingly in contradication with his goal of increasing Frances population The law was never meant to diminish the number of births in France Mr Neuwirth said recently It was intended simply to help women to have children when they wanted to have them and when they were able to have them

WHEN MOTHERHOOD DOESN'T MEAN MARRIAGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/30/style/when-motherhood-doesn-t-mean-marriage.html,Even in the age of the socalled supermother they are extreme examples of the breed seemingly selfsufficient women in their 30s who are choosing to become unwed mothers to combine careers with child rearing in a home where there is no father and no serious talk of marriage Marriage and motherhood are not necessarily connected in these womens minds judging by interviews with 15 of them as well as with doctors who have treated them as patients and researchers who have studied them Nor are the fathers the women choose necessarily told that the intention is to conceive a child Though most of the fathers are men with whom the women have had loving if unstable relationships some are casual friends or acquaintances or even strangers with selection based on their apparent genetic characteristics In rare cases the father is an anonymous donor to a sperm bank Hitting the Panic Button Dr Patricia Conrad an East Side gynecologist who does couseling on highrisk pregnancy for women beyond traditional childbearing years describes her typical unmarried maternity patient as financially secure careeroriented and aged 35 to 42 Thats when when they hit the panic button she said adding that the case of the older single patient who consciously chooses pregnancy was almost unheard of five years ago Today such a woman may visit Dr Conrads office before pregnancy to ascertain if she is physically capable of childbearing Im seeing this all the time now the doctor said all the time What Dr Conrad and others are seeing is reflected in the latest Government figures In 1979 the most recent year for which statistics are available it is estimated that 10600 babies were born to unmarried women aged 35 to 39 an increase of 128 percent in 10 years A further 31300 babies were born to unmarried women aged 30 to 34 an increase of 181 percent Moreover the rate of increase in childbearing by all unmarried women including teenagers was highest among those aged 30 to 34 although the number of births was higher for younger women Waning Fertility Increased Risk In one sense the mothers are part of a larger group of women in their 30s who are heeding the warning of waning fertility and the increased risks after age 35 In another sense they are special said Dr Phima Engelstein an associate professor of psychiatry at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine who headed an indepth pychological study of eight older unmarried mothers These are women who want to be in full control of their babies these babies are theirs alone Dr Engelstein said noting that while segments of the womens movement provide an ideological structure for the unwed mother the decision to become one is not an ideological but a personal act a deeply psychologically grounded act Whatever the psychology underlying a womans decision to rear a child alone it is far easier to do so today because of a mix of societal changes more working women financially able to support a child more support systems for the singleparent family more parents divorcing so that a child growing up without a father at home does not feel so out of place at school In such homes as in those where divorce has occurred the role of the absent father varies Some fathers visit the children and contribute to their support although most mothers say no legal agreements exist More often the father is a voice on the end of the longdistance telephone wire or simply a face in a snapshot Some children may never know their fathers since the mothers do not acknowledge the paternity This was not the case with 2 12yearold Jenna as she flipped through a book of photographs the other day Theres me and theres my grandma and theres my daddy she sang out in the SoHo showroom of JacksonArnold a wholesale designer sportswear business partly owned by her mother Jamie Smith Jackson 33 When Jenna was born Miss Jackson put aside a promising acting career she was nominated for an Emmy award for her role in the television play Go Ask Alice  to work in fashion That way she could be more a part of my life Miss Jackson said while Jenna played with a toy sewing machine The decision to have a child was hers Miss Jackson insisted adding that the father whom she described as 42 single and a prominent doctor who does not want his name mentioned felt conflicted at first Women seem to be more ready for this responsibility she went on Its our bodies and our choice The fathers attitude changed after seeing Jenna whose surname is a hyphenated combination of her parents surnames Now the mother said he visits the child pays nurseryschool tuition and would do anything for her Although Miss Jackson speaks of the father as a man I love and respect she says she has no desire to marry him or to live as part of a family I wanted a child and I didnt want to be married she said Marriage is a political and economic contract that has nothing to do with having a child I dont have terribly many reasons to want to marry which may be true of successful professional women said Dr Freyda Zell 39 a psychologist and the mother of Jehana 6 We certainly dont need men for economic support We know how to make our own decisions I feel Im better off not having to hassle out decisions regarding the kid Id rather make them myself Jehanas father is a craftsman and an exponent of radical politics Dr Zell said she chose him over others she was involved with at the time because of a strong attraction and because of his intelligence and mental health but not because I was looking for a perfect specimen When her pregnancy become apparent she said the man asked if the baby was his I said Look I dont feel its really your business You dont seem to have a stake in anything regarding me so I dont want to answer that question  To this day she has not answered the question now Jehana is asking it I tell her that she has a father of course Dr Zell said but that I dont know his whereabouts and that he just didnt want to live with us and that that was OK Strains on Time and Energy The strains on Dr Zells time and energy are heavy these days First comes Jehana her companion on hikes near their home in Woodstock NY Then there is her job with the Ulster County Mental Health Department her private practice and social life To be honest she conceded I find motherhood extremely difficult Part of the same reasons I didnt marry  lack of freedom constant compromises allowing space for another human being  is affecting how I am as a mother A common theme in interviews with single mothers is a history of abortion This is also true of women in the Engelstein study conducted with two colleagues at Albert Einstein Dr Maxine AntellBuckley and Phyllis UrmanKlein The researchers interpreted the abortions as a way of testing the mechanism to see that it worked Dr Engelstein said adding The women werent quite ready to make the decision Often the decision came at a crossroads in their lives  at the end of a love affair or after a professional disappointment Just before conception they unconsciously prepared their bodies for pregnancy and prepared nests for the babies Some lost weight for example or gave up smoking or bought homes None of the women interviewed sought artificial insemination although doctors say a few are choosing this route Dr Alan DeCherney director of reproductive endocrinology at YaleNew Haven Medical Center said older unmarried women applying to the sperm bank there fell into two groups lesbians and heterosexuals who want to avoid childcustody suits Noting that the artificial insemination of single women is still controversial he said the procedure was being performed at YaleNew Haven and elsewhere on screened applicants who demonstrate the physical emotional and financial ability to be single mothers Sometimes its a eugenic thing he went on but most just have a desire to be mothers to know that thrill in life and yet they see their chances slipping away The thrill was evident in the voice of Barbara Rossi 35 as she recalled the birth of Anna 16 months I was so overjoyed There were days when I just stared at this child I thought Id wake up one morning and shed disappear Today Anna is a visible and highly vocal figure in a highchair at home in Kinnelon NJ Her mother a photographer of Broadway shows said she sublet her Chelsea loft and put my career in the closet for a while to savor the joys of suburban motherhood The man insisted that either I have an abortion or we terminate the relationship Miss Rossi said In hindsight I realize I was always finding men who were emotional cripples and mothering them This was my misplaced maternal instinct Her neighbor Deborah DeMuro said the man she chose to be the father of her child lives in California but often telephones and writes to Sky 3 12 He loves her and theres lots of love between all of us said the mother a former nurseryschool teacher who works in a healthfood store Miss DeMuro spoke of being married for eight years to a man who did not want children and of having two abortions Marriage to Skys father is not a possibility she said since he is a homosexual yet she speaks of them as a family Sometimes I think this may have been the way women lived long ago in tribal times she said A woman would have a baby and raise it on her own with the help of other women The men wouldnt be such a daily part of their lives
FRANCE SHORES UP ITS SOCIAL SECURITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/30/world/france-shores-up-its-social-security.html,The Socialist Government here like the conservative Reagan Administration in Washington is trying to change what it sees as a runaway social security system The two efforts have one result in common they have antagonized both friends and enemies In each country the social security effort has been called the administrations first major political mistake Both social security systems have been in the red for most of the last decade and both are facing huge deficits The Reagan Administration is still wrestling with its problem but the Government of President Francois Mitterrand has just put in force a package of measures designed to bring the French social security program back into surplus by the end of 1982 Both Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy and his Minister of National Solidarity Nicole Questiaux have emphasized that the program is stopgap They have promised a new plan by midsummer of next year The financing of the social security deficit is no more than the first step toward a total reform of all the Governments social policies Mrs Questiaux said last week The French social security system has been in deficit every year since 1974 with the exception of 1980 The projected deficit through 1982 is just under 36 billion francs or about 643 billion Of that 1015 billion will occur this year and 258 billion in 1982 The plan announced by the French Government last week will draw 1685 billion francs or about 3 billion from employees and 156 billion from employers Another billion will be obtained by doubling the tax on auto insurance premiums There will also be a 25 billion Government subsidy Unions and Employers Angry The bulk of the additional employee contributions comes from a 1 percent increase in payments to the Government health plan Employers face a 35 percent increase in the ceiling used to compute their payments to the health plan The plan which does not need legislative approval and is already in effect drew swift criticism from both the unions and the employers association The two largest unions the Communistcontrolled CGT and the Socialistcontrolled CFDT said the 1 percent increase in employee payments would reduce the purchasing power of workers at a time of severe inflation The increase in the ceiling for employer payments is designed to affect laborintensive companies the least The Patronat the employers organization argues that this puts an unfair burden on forwardlooking capitalintensive businesses Employers had already been angered by a Government proposal not yet enacted to lessen their influence in employeremployee boards that run social security programs at the plant level Communist Party leaders in the National Assembly quickly condemned the Governments program as economically bad and warned that it would dampen Frances economic recovery They said it would do nothing to fight unemployment  a sore point with the Socialist Government More than anything else the Socialists have committed themselves to stand or fall on their ability to end unemployment There are several parallels between Frances social security problems and those in the United States But there is also a fundamental difference In America the Social Security system in spite of its expansion in recent years is still fundamentally a retirement and survivor benefits program In France in addition to retirement and survivor benefits the social security system provides complete health care and a generous system of family allowances Begun after World War I when France was short of population the family allowances can virtually double a workers wage if he has enough children It includes reductions in transportation costs supplements for rent and a variety of other benefits Political Sacred Cow There is a certain charming anachronism to the family allowance a French official said There is no population problem now In fact we are busy liberalizing our abortion laws at the same time we are augmenting the family allowances through cost of living increases But he added The family allowance is the most sacred of all our political sacred cows Frances obligatory social security expenditures 451 billion francs in 1979 were up 144 percent to 516 billion last year They are expected to go up another 143 percent this year to 581 billion francs or about 1037 billion From 1960 to 1978 according to French Government statistics social security expenditures grew twice as fast as the gross national product According to Government figures 40 percent of the people who are economically active now support 60 percent who are inactive including a steadily growing proportion of elderly In 1995 French economists say the generation born after World War II will be leaving the work force aggravating a problem that is already serious The American system while more limited has grown enormously In 1970 288 million was paid out Last year that figure rose to about 105 billion This year it will be as much as 1238 billion and next year about 141 billion with a deficit of 115 billion In the United States the rate is the same for both employer and employee On Jan 1 of this year the rate went from 613 percent on income up to 25900 to 665 percent on income up to 29700 On Jan 1 1982 it is scheduled to jump again to 670 percent on income up to 32100 By 1986 it will be 715 percent on income up to 47700
GADFLY SAYS WHAT OTHERS WILL NOT,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/30/us/gadfly-says-what-others-will-not.html,Leave the Constitution alone The big man was on his feet a prowling growling gusher of Parisborn Yaleeducated indignation The Senate was debating a proposal to endorse organized prayer in public schools the sort of prayer outlawed by the Supreme Court 19 years ago and Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr of Connecticut Republican by tradition and iconoclast by instinct was voicing his finely honed sense of outrage To my amazement he thundered any time the word constitutionalism comes up its looked upon as a threat A threat It shouldnt be its what holds us all together When the prayer amendment passed as a rider to the appropriations bill for the State Justice and Commerce Departments Mr Weicker announced a filibuster one of the strangest in the history of the Senate Mr Weicker after all is the floor manager of the bill he will now try to talk to death A Test of Stamina The bill was soon taken off the floor but it will return shortly Starting Monday the Senate leadership intends to push ahead with all outstanding appropriations bills and when the measure for State Justice and Commerce comes back up for consideration Mr Weickers powers of persuasion to say nothing of his stamina will be truly tested Senate conservatives are poised to use guerrilla tactics as Mr Weicker put it to push their agenda of social issues abortion busing school prayer crime And the Connecticut Republican has become the chief of counterinsurgency the leader of a rather ragtag band of Senate liberals that has only one hope obstruction and delay I cant win anything between now and 1982 Mr Weicker said after the prayer amendment had passed adding all I can hope is that they dont win on every issue The conservatives initiatives provoke strong language from a man born to wealth and privilege heir to the Squibb chemical fortune squire of a Greenwich mansion But there has never been anything placid or passive about Lowell Weicker and the way he works and plays His walls are plastered with pictures of a man who craves action swatting a tennis ball diving from a ship romping with his seven children He delights in kicking over traces and pricking balloons and his energetic eccentricities have led to a rapid turnover of his staff A typical pointed comment I must say that for too long we allowed Protestantism to be the official religion in this country and Catholics and Jews suffered Why would we want to go back to that history Role on Watergate Committee At the age of 50 with 11 years in the Senate behind him Mr Weicker seems in no mood to mellow He came to public prominence when he served on the Senate Watergate committee and repeatedly savaged President Nixon the leader of his own party In 1979 he took a brief and futile fling at running for the Republican Presidential nomination and when the conservatives returned to power under Ronald Reagans banner the lawmaker became one of the loudest defenders of social welfare spending on Capitol Hill When Mr Reagan vetoed a stopgap spending measure last week as budget busting Mr Weicker denounced him as dead wrong If he wants more cuts said the Senator a member of the conference that drafted the vetoed bill he should go to the defense budget and get them Nothing ignites Mr Weickers sense of outrage more quickly than rightwing attacks on the Constitution and the Federal courts They cheapen everything he said in a recent interview when they use the Constitution as a garbage receptacle for every one of their philosophical quirks Moderates Judged as Lacking But he is only slightly more tolerant of fellow progressives a group that Mr Weicker often considers smug and lazy Moderates read editorials in The New York Times and The Washington Post and pat themselves on the back he said while the other guys are out there organizing and raising money To fellow lawmakers Lowell Weicker often appears to be looking down on them  literally and figuratively  and saying You dont measure up to my standards His colleagues have called him headline hunter and dilettante and worse The Republican leadership finds him irritating and unreliable and Senator Alan Cranston of California the Democratic whip says Weicker plays a very individual role The Republicans cannot count on his vote and neither can we No one knows where hell be A Political Outsider The Senator does not really disagree with that description He has a lot of personal friends in the Senate he says but when it comes to politics he concedes to being on the outside Of the Republican leadership he says I think they tolerate me very well but they cannot count on me As a result Mr Weickers influence in the Senate is clearly limited He is not an insider who shapes coalitions through personal contacts or gets calls from the White House for advice But in the long tradition of Senate gadflies he is a man who says things that others will not who fights battles that others shrink from His is the power to protest to inhibit to alarm  not to build Mr Weicker also thinks that the voters of Connecticut will tolerate him even when they do not agree with him Connecticut is a very small and sophisticated state he said Its very civil rights and libertiesminded But his opponents smell weakness Already two rivals have decided to contest the Republican primary and Representative Toby Moffett another maverick with strong voter appeal is the favorite for the Democratic nomination Meanwhile Mr Weicker knows he is not going to receive any Mr

BAKER WILL SEEK TO EXTEND VOTING ACT WITHOUT CHANGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/03/us/baker-will-seek-to-extend-voting-act-without-change.html,In a change of strategy Howard H Baker Jr the Senate majority leader said today that he would seek Senate approval this month of a 10year extension of the Voting Rights Act in its present form avoiding the need for long public hearings The Tennessee Republican also said that he would defer until next year any debate on proposals to restrict abortion in part because of division in the ranks of antiabortion forces But he said that in the near future he would permit the Senate to debate two other politically sensitive issues school busing and school prayer In a luncheon interview with editors and reporters of The New York Times Mr Baker described his position on the Voting Rights Act saying As far as I am concerned I would like to see us simply extend the existing language for 10 years and do it this year Key enforcement provisions of the voting law originally enacted in 1965 will expire next August unless Congress extends them House Approved Extension The House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted on Oct 5 to extend the Voting Rights Act indefinitely after defeating a series of amendments aimed at weakening the legislation The House bill is stronger in some respects than the existing law as interpreted by Federal courts President Reagan has said that he could accept either a simple 10year extension of the existing law or a modified version of the House bill Senator Bakers move if successful would spare the Senate a long bitter debate over divisive issues and it would insure extension of the Voting Rights Act though not on the terms sought by civil rights lobbyists A White House lawyer Michael Uhlmann said that the Baker proposal was not a bad idea and not markedly different from Mr Reagans position Senator Baker said today that he supported the core of the House bill the socalled preclearance requirement under which states with a history of discrimination must still get approval from either the Justice Department or a Federal court in Washington for any proposed changes in local election laws However Mr Baker said that he opposed a section of the House bill that would make it easier for blacks Hispanic Americans and members of other minority groups to prove voting rights violations in court Under this section plaintiffs would have to show only that a local government action results in a denial or abridgment of voting rights This would overturn a 1980 Supreme Court decision that set a more difficult standard of proof requiring evidence of intentional discrimination in certain challenges based on constitutional grounds Favored by Civil Rights Groups Civil rights advocates strongly favor the change saying that it is often impossible to prove that a violation of voting rights was intentional The legislative proposal favored by Senator Baker would also omit provisions of the House bill that would establish new guidelines permitting states and counties with a clean record on voting rights to be exempted from the preclearance requirement Mr Bakers approach represents a change in tactics for Senate Republicans who had been preparing for public hearings scheduled to begin Jan 20 before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution In discussions with other Senators Mr Baker said he found general agreement that his approach was the best way to liquidate what might otherwise be a deadlock or a protracted debate over the voting rights legislation Discussion With President He said that he had discussed his proposal with President Reagan and with Attorney General William French Smith and that neither was upset by it He also said that he hoped to obtain the concurrence of Senate Democrats and such civil rights leaders as Benjamin L Hooks executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Ralph G Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said the Baker proposal was unacceptable to his organization a broadbased coalition of 157 civil rights groups including the NAACP It would incorporate the intent test a crippling amendment that would jeopardize the voting rights of millions of Americans Mr Neas said of the Baker proposal Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts who cosponsored a bill to extend the Voting Rights Act also expressed serious reservations about Mr Bakers proposal Mr Kennedy said that any voting rights measure would also have to extend a section of the law requiring bilingual elections in places with high concentrations of voters who did not understand English Hispanic Americans say this section has helped enfranchise millions of Spanishspeaking voters

PLANNED PARENTHOOD GROUPS INVESTIGATED ON USE OF U.S. FUNDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/06/us/planned-parenthood-groups-investigated-on-use-of-us-funds.html,The Federal authorities are conducting a nationwide investigation of groups affiliated with the Planned Parenthood Federation of America to determine whether they illegally used Federal funds to promote abortion as a means of birth control or to finance political lobbying Thirtyfive of the federations 188 affiliates throughout the country have been audited or are being audited by either the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services or by the General Accounting Office an investigative arm of Congress according to officials of Planned Parenthood and the two Federal agencies involved Both reviews started in part at least as a result of complaints from members of Congress The General Accounting Office began its audits at the request of two Republican Senators Orrin G Hatch of Utah and Jeremiah Denton of Alabama both outspoken opponents of abortion So far the agencies have reported no violations Robert AH Wilson a spokesman for the Inspector General said that by and large auditors had found compliance with the law although there were several minor accounting erros not germane to the basic issues of the audit A Harassment Technique Last month Faye Wattleton president of Planned Parenthood complained to Richard S Schweiker the Secretary of Health and Human Services that the unprecedented series of audits represented an abuse of the power and machinery of Government by people philosophically opposed to abortion In a memorandum to local Planned Parenthood officials Miss Wattleton also asserted that the audits had been undertaken as a harassment technique Since they started receiving substantial Federal funds in 1970 Planned Parenthood affiliates like other Federal grantees and contractors have been subject to routine periodic audits But this year the number frequency and intensity of the audits increased according to both the Government and Planned Parenthood Eve W Paul Planned Parenthoods vice president for legal affairs said an average of only five to six audits a year had been performed under the Carter Administration Clara R Brightman director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut said Friday that the scope of the audits was unusual in that the auditors wanted to see not only financial records but also confidential patient records In Connecticut and several other states Planned Parenthood officials protested but made some patient records available after being assured that the patients privacy would be protected Representative John D Dingell Democrat of Michigan chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and Representative Henry A Waxman Democrat of California chairman of the panels Subcommittee on Health have also expressed concern In a letter last week to Mr Schweiker they said that simultaneous investigations by two auditing agencies appeared to be an expensive bit of duplication and that they were troubled by the image of Federal agents flipping through personal medical records at family planning clinics Planned Parenthood and its affiliates together constitute the largest private family planning agency in the country President Reagan has strongly supported the idea of a constitutional amendment to prohibit abortions In an abortion he said in his election campaign last year we are taking a human life Dr C Everett Koop the new Surgeon General and Marjory E Mecklenburg director of the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs have also been prominent foes of abortion Federal laws generally prohibit the use of Federal money for abortions for any activity that promotes or encourages abortion or for lobbying designed to influence Congress Mr Schweiker said that the Inspector Generals office had launched a nationwide review of the Planned Parenthood agencies that receive Federal grants and contracts At least 145 affiliates receive Federal money but the auditors are focusing on a sample of affiliates in each region of the country Mr Schweiker said in a letter to several members of Congress New York and 9 Other Cities In a memorandum last summer Raymond A Beaudet an official of the Department of Health and Human Services directed Federal auditors in New York and nine other big cities to begin priority audits of Planned Parenthood organizations He said the department had received information from Congressmen and other citizens alleging that Planned Parenthood affiliates had used Federal money to encourage abortion and to lobby Congress Mr Wilson of the Inspector Generals office said the audits had been undertaken in a routine manner to insure the proper use of Federal money Some audits involved comprehensive reviews of an affiliates activities In one case Planned Parenthood of Minnesota obtained signed affidavits from sterilization patients to demonstrate to the auditors that the patients had given informed consent for the procedure as required by Federal rules It was unusual I will admit that Edward A Kadela regional audit director of the Department of Health and Human Services said in a telephone interview Its not a general audit technique But we wanted to satisfy ourselves that Federal regulations were complied with The auditors concluded that the Minnesota affiliate had met all Federal requirements Audit in New York City An audit of Planned Parenthood of New York City completed in September said that the agency does not promote abortion as a means of birth control and is conducting business in line with Federal regulations However the department auditors went back to the New York affiliate this week They wanted to know whether Planned Parenthood had used Government money for newspaper advertisements asserting that radical rightwing political forces were promoting a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion Abraham Blucher a Federal auditor who spent four hours reviewing the books of the New York affiliate last Wednesday said he had found that no Federal funds were used for the advertisements Planned Parenthood of New York City has an annual budget of 85 million including 489000 of Federal money according to Alfred F Moran the executive vice president Mr Moran said that the New York affiliate had provided abortions to approximately 10000 of its 40000 patients last year The Planned Parenthood Federation has national offices in New York Its affiliates are separately incorporated Mrs Paul the legal affairs official said the affiliates received 53 million a year in Federal money out of a total budget of 122 million that is also derived from state and private funds Most of the Federal money is awarded under Title X of the Public Health Service Act for making comprehensive voluntary family planning services readily available to all persons desiring such services Persons who oppose abortion and federally subsidized family planning services have said that the Federal money though earmarked for contraceptive services in fact frees money to be used for abortions Mrs Paul disagreed saying that the Federal money had to be used for the purpose stated in the grant application and was not interchangeable with other money
WHAT'S WRONG WITH REAGAN'S FOREIGN POLICY?,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/06/magazine/what-s-wrong-with-reagan-s-foreign-policy.html,Zbigniew Brzezinski President Carters Assistant for National Security Affairs is Herbert Lehman Professor of Government at Columbia University and senior adviser to the Center for Strategic Studies at Georgetown University By Zbigniew Brzezinski If present trends continue American foreign policy is likely to be in a state of general crisis by the spring of 1982 What makes matters potentially even worse is that this could coincide with a serious economic downturn causing the overall global position of the United States to be placed in jeopardy There is urgent need for President Reagan to take serious stock of the unfolding situation so that the needed responses both substantive and procedural can be generated I express this view not in a spirit of political partisanship but out of civic concern Moreover I believe that it is possible for the Administration to take corrective action that would not only avert the threatening crisis but would exploit some of the opportunities that beckon in the months ahead Present trends indicate the possible conjunction by early spring of four potentially dangerous situations with four more general but no less damaging conditions 1 Abortion of the Camp David peace process between Israel and Egypt with Israel refusing to vacate the rest of the Sinai 2 An economicpolitical breakdown in Poland giving the Russians the opening for which they have been waiting 3 Manifest political deterioration in El Salvador with a further swing to the left in Central America 4 A sharp downturn in United StatesChinese relations prompted by the Reagan Administrations decision to include a more advanced type of fighter in its arms sales to Taiwan 5 Widespread European pacifism sharpening transAtlantic divisions and blocking the decision of the Western alliance to modernize its missile forces in the European theater 6 Growing alienation of the third world from a seemingly antagonistic America 7 Increased awareness in the Kremlin that the Reagan commitment to stronger defense emasculated by budgetary constraints is a bluff 8 Continued absence in Washington of an effective decisionmaking process on problems of national security making it difficult for the United States to shape a comprehensive strategy Both Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt are faced with difficult choices Begin knows that his hold on the Egyptians will decline once he has returned the rest of the Sinai Peninsula Yet a pointblank refusal to do so would not only drive Mubarak back into the Arab fold but stamp Begin internationally as the violator of the Camp David accord Mubarak knows that he must exercise maximum patience with the Israelis until he gets the rest of his land back But he cannot afford in the longer run to pursue the late President Anwar elSadats policy of almost complete isolation from the rest of the Arab world Mubaraks position is more vulnerable than Sadats was and he must be sensitive to his predecessors fate Accordingly it is likely that Begin will test Mubaraks commitment to Camp David by unilateral actions designed either to reinforce Egypts isolation and thus enhance to the Israelis the value of the IsraeliEgyptian peace treaty or to place the onus on any breakdown of the Camp David process on Mubarak and thus legitimize Israeli reneging on the rest of the Sinai bargain Such actions might involve either major additions to the system of Israeli settlements on the West Bank or some military intervention in Lebanon against the Syrian missiles for example or a deliberately excessive response to the European flirtation with the recent Saudi Arabian peace plan in order to scuttle any Sinai peacekeeping force At the very least Begin will try  prior to the scheduled return of Sinai in 1982  to extract from Mubarak an agreement to a West Bank autonomy plan that would be so limited as to further outrage the Arab world against Egypt In any case it is unlikely that Begin will simply proceed to execute the Sinai withdrawal  and especially the painful task of evicting recalcitrant Israeli settlers from the Sinai  without some test of Mubaraks fidelity Begins reaction to the Saudi plan provides a clue to his intentions The eightpoint proposal put foward by Crown Prince Fahd indicated eventual Saudi willingness to recognize Israel in return for major Israeli concessions Though vague in its wording the plan by any standard did involve a positive evolution in the Arab attitude Begin however rejected it out of hand This suggests that at the present stage he is unwilling to contemplate any peace treaty with the Arabs that does not provide for continued Israeli control over the West Bank and Gaza Since it is unlikely that the Arabs could ever agree to the Palestinians being left indefinitely under Israeli occupation it would be preferable from Begins point of view to leave the Palestinian issue stalemated It would follow that as he sees it slowing down the Camp David process and keeping half of Sinai could be preferable to risking the kind of American pressure that is likely to surface as soon as the resolution of the Sinai issue has left the Palestinian matter as the major item on the agenda A breakdown of the Camp David agreement would be a disaster for the United States Egypt would not only be driven back into the more recalcitrant Arab fold but domestic instability in Egypt would be likely to worsen Mubarak is closely identified with Sadat and with the assassinated leaders proAmerican orientation his domestic opponents would be bound to exploit the new turn of events against him In any case United States policy in the region would be shown to be totally futile Not only would our relations with the Arab world suffer but the gap between the United States and Western Europe would in all probability widen still further This is why it is urgent that all parties in the region understand clearly that the United States expects full implementation of the Camp David process and will use its leverage with Israel and the moderate Arabs to that end The President should appoint a highlevel negotiator perhaps someone like former Secretary of the Treasury George P Shultz who had been considered by Mr Reagan for the post of Secretary of State in order to demonstrate firm American commitment We should also make clear that for the time being there is no alternative to the Camp David process The Saudi proposal must be respected for what it is  the staking out by the moderate Arabs of a negotiating position a welcome step forward that should not be dismissed But it would be a mistake to create the impression that it offers a substitute After a fiveyear transitional arrangement for the Palestinians has been set up in keeping with Camp David the time will come for wider discussions among all the parties concerned and at that time the Fahd plan will come into play In the meantime it is essential that the momentum of the peace process be maintained and this calls for firmer demonstration of United States leadership than is now forthcoming Just as the Middle East problem tends to be our dilemma the complex situation in Poland presents a major challenge to the Soviet Union However a disintegration of the Polish compromise precipitating perhaps even Soviet intervention could quickly transform the Polish challenge into a major setback for the West Soviet military intervention would not only stimulate acute EastWest tensions and intensify the role of the militarypolice complex in the Soviet political system but in the longer run probably cause a further movement toward neutralism in Western Europe Given the present state of European public opinion it is likely that after a brief burst of antiSoviet excitement many Europeans would conclude that Soviet intervention had been in any case inevitable demonstrating the degree to which Western Europe had to accommodate itself to Soviet might It should be recognized that the Solidarity movement in Poland represents three major manifestations The first is a drive for national emancipation from Soviet domination uniting most Poles in a desire for a compromise that would avert Soviet intervention The second is recognition of a need for systemic change not only of the political but the economic system a complex matter on which it is difficult for many Poles to agree The third aspect is pressure for a change in the character of the socioeconomic elite with the independent union movement containing tens of thousands of young welleducated people eager to replace the badly trained and compromised partyGovernment bureaucracy in managerial and middlelevel positions of responsibility It will thus take a long time for the challenge of Solidarity to work itself out Constructive consolidation of the Polish situation could in the long run mean a much better EastWest relationship and the gradual fading of the European division That is why it is ultimately in everyones interest even that of the Soviet Union that the Polish situation be resolved peacefully For the moment however the Russians may not share that view They may prefer a collapse in Poland which would give them an opportunity to intervene and reestablish an orthodox Soviettype regime Such an opportunity could well arise if the internal economic crisis prompts a collapse of law and order with many people in Poland concluding that freedom means hunger The proper Western response at this stage ought to be a major program of direct credits for food purchases or direct food delivery A longerrange aid program should await major economic reforms in Poland perhaps in conjunction with Polish participation in the International Monetary Fund Unfortunately the Administration appears to be paralyzed on the Polish issue with influential officials in the White House and the Defense Department arguing in effect for the thesis that the worse the better  that a breakdown in Poland prompting Soviet intervention would be a great setback for the Soviet Union Some American officials are even tempted to put roadblocks in the way of the recently submitted Polish application for IMF membership This simpleminded antiCommunist perspective is both tragically wrong and blind to the longrange opportunities for a better EastWest relationship inherent in the Polish evolution Apart from their hazards to American policy and international stability the Middle Eastern and Polish questions contain the potential for stimulating wider AmericanEuropean differences This last is equally true of the unfolding situation in Central America There the essence of the problem is that the disengagement of American power from the region has been accompanied by an internal political upheaval and the threat of external strategic intrusion It is this combination that makes the process of change in several Central American countries so violent unstable and potentially dangerous to us By the coming spring it is quite likely that the Government currently in power in El Salvador will be under increasing pressure and largely on the defensive and that Nicaragua will be overtly an armed Cuban satellite After that it is only a matter of time before Honduras and Guatemala come under pressure Yet the United States cannot credibly speak for human rights on behalf of the Polish workers while remaining unresponsive to the desire for land reform and social progress on the part of the Central American peasantry Readiness for vigilant and if necessary forceful response to the Cuban challenge must be combined by the United States with a sympathetic attitude toward the socialpolitical grievances of the increasingly politically awakened peoples of Central America Only thus can we fashion a historically viable policy likely to be endorsed by other Latin American countries Washington would be making a major mistake therefore to focus entirely on the external threat It is the intensity of internal grievances that generates opportunities for the Cubans and the Russians and our response must thus cope both with the internal and external problems We can best do so not by elevating the conflict into a major test of will with Moscow but by generating a common response with likeminded Latin American states notably Venezuela Colombia and some others If Cuban involvement reaches intolerable levels direct action to seal off the region from Cuba may become necessary but that should not be viewed as a substitute for needed domestic reforms The tragedy is that since January 1980 the United States has conveyed the impression that it is not concerned with the development of constitutional democracy in El Salvador but is preoccupied almost entirely with the Cuban threat Since our rhetoric about the Cubans has not been accompanied by any tangible action the net effect has been to enhance Cuban prestige and reinforce the morale of the leftwing guerrillas The prospect of three geopolitical crises  one in the Middle East another in Central Europe and still another in Central America  becomes all the grimmer if in the meantime the Administration undermines our new relationship with China That relationship is not only significant from the longerrange historical perspective but has a tangibly beneficial impact on the United StatesSoviet balance of power A China that is hostile to the Soviet Union but friendly to the United States drains approximately one quarter of the Soviet defense budget It greatly contributes to enhanced stability in the Korean peninsula and it deflects Vietnamese militancy from its southward push Yet for reasons difficult to explain other than on doctrinal grounds it seems that the Administration is inching toward a decision in favor of providing advanced weaponry to Taiwan Such a decision notably in regard to a new generation of military aircraft would have a most deleterious impact on United StatesChinese relations It could even contribute to greater internal instability in China The program of the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping is based to a considerable degree on a commitment both to closer relations with the United States and to more pragmatic internal modernization His critics are likely to seize on the American decision to place him under attack for failures both of domestic and foreign policy It can hardly be in the American interest to have the current Chinese regime destabilized There is no evidence of any military threat to Taiwan requiring the transfer of more advanced aircraft While the United States explicitly reserved to itself the right to continue providing arms to Taiwan  I reaffirmed this personally to the Chinese on the very day normalization was announced  it was also clearly understood at the time that prevailing circumstances would be taken fully into account There is nothing today to indicate either a heightened threat to Taiwan or a growing airpower imbalance in favor of Communist China Any deterioration in the American strategic position stemming from any of these global concerns would be accompanied by a rising wave of European pacifism This wave unlike some of its predecessors in the 1950s and 60s or even 70s appears to be composed predominantly of young people and that makes it even more salient The Reagan Administration has given impetus to some of the European neutralism by appearing bent on a confrontationist policy visavis the Soviet Union abandoning any serious negotiations on arms control This has permitted the Soviet Union to exploit European sentiments in an extremely skillful fashion even while continuing to sustain the momentum of its own strategic buildup It remains to be seen whether President Reagans belated but adroit recognition of this dilemma in his Nov 18 speech will provide a sufficient remedy In any case the speech is a welcome return to the Carter formula of combining a strategic buildup with a commitment to comprehensive arms control Whatever concrete measures lie ahead our rhetoric of recent months certainly succeeded in convincing Moscow of our hostility while our strategic decisions doubtless reassured the Russians that we do not have the will to carry forward a sustained confrontation Though proclaiming loudly our determination to restore American power the Reagan Administration is likely to end up with a defense budget that at best will maintain the buildup levels of the Carter Administration Congressional cuts could bring the levels somewhat lower The combination will further intensify European pacifism for it will reinforce the image of an America that is both confrontationist and weak  and therefore more dangerous Moreover some of the specific decisions reached by the Reagan Administration are not likely to enhance our own defense capability The decision to build the B1 bomber will eat up billions of dollars to construct a fleet of flying Edsels capable of penetrating Soviet airpace for only several years at best while the decision to deploy the advanced MX missiles only in limited numbers and in existing silos will leave them vulnerable to a Soviet first strike These decisions seemingly more political than strategic in character do not reflect any coherent strategic doctrine and are likely to result in monies badly spent with little if any genuine enhancement of our national defense The prospect of growing difficulties with our allies and increased tensions with Moscow is bad enough It need not be compounded by isolation from the third world Yet that is exactly what is happening and largely for reasons of personality and rhetoric Just as former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Andrew Young former United States delegate to the United Nations did well in making the third world feel that America is sympathetic the present spokesmen seem almost bent on antagonizing the third world perhaps with the exception of authoritarian regimes for which some of them nourish special affection This is pointless and unnecessary The United States need not commit itself to large resource transfers nor to such vague abstractions as the socalled New International Economic Order to demonstrate compassion and care Carter showed convincing empathy and Reagan could too provided he reined in some of his insensitive representatives In the long run the ability of the United States to protect its interests and promote its values depends to a large extent on the degree to which we can fashion a relationship of genuine cooperation with Asians Africans and Latin Americans Finally all of this is complicated by a decisionmaking process in Washington in which neither the President nor the Secretary of State is able to provide effective direction Since World War II American foreign policy has been shaped either by a Presidential type of decisionmaking system with the Assistant for National Security Affairs playing a central role in the Presidents own deep and personal involvement in foreign affairs or by a system in which a somewhat passive President gave his Secretary of State ample opportunity to provide the needed coordination and leadership The former system was characteristic of Presidents Carter Nixon and Kennedy the latter of Presidents Ford Eisenhower and Truman What is remarkable about the present arrangement is that the United States has neither the first nor the second system but an assertive Secretary of State effectively neutralized by the Presidents domestic political advisers The divisions within the Administration appear to be not over substance as was at times the case in the Carter Administration but over personalities and turf On some issues such as Poland or China subtle differences in attitude have surfaced but they are difficult to define precisely They seem to reflect not so much direct contests over alternative policies but more subtle differences in perspective The White House is dominated by essentially antiCommunist isolationists rooted in California while the upper echelons of the State Department are staffed by vigorous antiSoviet internationalists shaped by the Western alliance The gap between the two is surmountable but that can only be accomplished by assertive personal leadership at the top Given the Presidents political style it would appear desirable that Secretary of State Alexander M Haig Jr be given full responsibility in genuinely unambiguous fashion and that he in turn be encouraged to shape a foreign policy on the basis of bipartisan support cultivating the leadership of both parties in Congress A symbolic step in that direction would be to put the Secretary of State in charge of a toplevel interagency committee for crisis management and national strategy As I know from personal experience as the crisis manager of the Carter Administration it is not possible to separate crisis management from continuing involvement in a given policy problem Thus it makes little sense to vest that responsibility in a remote Vice President Either the Presidents nationalsecurity assistant should be the crisis manager or when the President is relatively passive on foreign policy it should be the Secretary of State Moreover crisis management has to be conducted in the context of a broader national strategy Thus in the present situation under this more passive President both responsibilities should be vested in the Secretary of State In brief in the course of the next few months the President should take the necessary steps to 1 Centralize decisionmaking in a manner giving Secretary Haig the needed interbureaucratic viability and respect 2 Reexamine his B1 and MX decisions so that the sustained and more highly funded defense program he promised reflects a coherent defense strategy 3 Commit the United States more credibly to serious armscontrol negotiations with Moscow by indicating explicitly in what fashion the strategic arms limitation treaty signed in June 1979 ought to be amended to meet the Administrations objections 4 Reaffirm credibly and on the highest level American understanding for the third worlds quest for a more equitable distribution of global political and economic wellbeing 5 Reopen the United StatesChinese strategic dialogue with the Chinese reassured that the United States is not pursuing a twoChina policy by the back door through unnecessary arms transfers to Taiwan 6 Reaffirm American commitment to democratic processes in Central America and guarantee them jointly with likeminded Latin American states providing a basis for common action should that become necessary against Cuban exploitation of Central American unrest 7 Develop a shortterm international foodaid program for Poland in order to prevent a destructive explosion between now and next spring 8 Appoint a highlevel negotiator for the next phase of the Camp David process and use all our leverage with Israel and Egypt to prevent that process from being derailed  particularly through a deliberately contrived Israli test of Mubaraks commitment Demonstrated fidelity to the Camp David accord will do the United States much more good than B52 runs over Egyptian sands or vague talk of an AmericanIsraeli strategic connection with neither initiative contributing much to Middle Eastern confidence in our statesmanship Failure to act on a broad front would be particularly tragic It would in all likelihood coincide with greater economic difficulties for the United States potentially creating a general crisis of confidence in Americas staying power In such a context we would be unable to exploit constructively in order to moderate Soviet behavior the growing internal difficulties in the Soviet world ranging from the crisis of succession in Moscow to the Polish contagion not to speak of the unprecedented isolation of the Soviet Union in the third world The next few months will tell whether President Reagan can master the situation by

LIBERALS CONSIDER BACKING MOYNIHAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/06/nyregion/liberals-consider-backing-moynihan.html,New York States Liberal Party which two years ago called Daniel Patrick Moynihan totally devoid of honesty and integrity is preparing to endorse him for reelection next year Party officials say their concern about the radical right is outweighing their strong disapproval of the Senators support for tuition tax credits the issue that prompted the harsh criticism Mr Moynihan was elected to his first term in 1976 on the Democratic and Liberal lines Our people are realists said the Rev Donald S Harrington the partys state chairman We dont want to get someone whos worse Conservative Attack The consideration of a Moynihan endorsement comes in the face of an antiMoynihan campaign begun last month by the National Conservative Political Action Committee Publicly the Liberal leader Raymond B Harding and a Moynihan aide Tim Russert say only that they have been talking Conversations have started Mr Harding said I meet on a regular basis with Mr Harding Mr Russert said Senator Moynihan ran on the Liberal Party line in 1976 and he would like to run on it in 1982 We recognize a common enemy in the new right  Most Liberal Senator Many New York politicians say they think the campaign by the conservative group can be turned to advantage by Mr Moynihan who has been considered vulnerable to attack from the Democratic Partys liberal wing The Senators staff started months ago to call attention to opposition from conservative and antiabortion groups The New York affiliate of the National Conservative Political Action Committee then started the campaign of radio ads attacking Mr Moynihan as the most liberal United States Senator Mr Harrington said that his partys policy committee must be persuaded to support a Moynihan endorsement It was the policy committee that issued the critical statement about Mr Moynihan in 1979 Senator Moynihan has turned his back on the solemn pledges he made to secure the political support of the Liberal Party the statement read in part Having placed his integrity at issue by his record of commitments made and commitments broken he has forfeited his right to the partys support now and in the future It also accused the Senator of being totally devoid of honesty and integrity and said that the tuitiontax credit bill that he sponsored gives public support and blessing to a veritable network of schools that were established in many instances solely for the purpose of avoiding the reaches of the Supreme Court decision outlawing racial segregation in education At the time Mr Moynihan said his support of tuition tax credits had been well known when he sought the Liberal line in 1976 He also said that the policy committee had embarked on a course which unless changed will diminish the influence effectiveness and the credibility of the party Politicians familiar with the talks between the Liberals and Mr Moynihan said it appeared that an accommodation could be reached on the ground that the tax credit issue had stalled in Washington These politicians note that the Reagan Administration now says such credits could be approved only when economically feasible and that Mr Moynihan failed in the Senate Finance Committee when he tried to include the credits in the Administrations tax bill So they say the Senator could stick by his ideological position while the Liberals could while deploring it point out that there is no practical likelihood that his position would become law

"BORK, A FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL NAMED TO KEY APPEALS COURT POST",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/08/us/bork-a-former-solicitor-general-named-to-key-appeals-court-post.html,Robert H Bork a prominent conservative legal scholar and former Solicitor General has been nominated by President Reagan to be a judge on the Federal appeals court here The move announced by the White House today makes Mr Bork the most conspicuous candidate to fill any vacancy that may occur on the Supreme Court Mr Bork a 54yearold former Yale Law School professor briefly became a household name in October 1973 when he carried out President Nixons order to dismiss the Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox in what became known as the Saturday night massacre The Attorney General Elliot L Richardson and Mr Richardsons deputy William D Ruckelshaus preferred to resign rather than dismiss Mr Cox Their resignations left Mr Bork the Solicitor General as the highest ranking official in the Justice Department Prospects for Supreme Court Attorney General William French Smith confirmed in a telephone interview today that Mr Bork was one of several people who certainly would be looked at in the event of another vacancy on the Supreme Court Mr Smith praised Mr Borks outstanding qualifications as nominee for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit a court that is viewed as second only to the Supreme Court in its influence on Federal law Mr Smith also praised Mr Borks views on what the President refers to as judicial restraint Mr Bork has been a trenchant critic of what he has called unsettling and unconstitutional decisions by the modern activist liberal Supreme Court on such issues as abortion school desegregation through busing First Amendment rights to dance in the nude and antitrust law Opposition to Abortion Ruling In testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Separation of Powers in June Mr Bork described the 1973 Supreme Court decision that women had constitutional rights to abortions as an unconstitutional decision a serious and wholly unjustifiable usurpation of state legislative authority But Mr Bork has opposed as unwise and probably unconstitutional recent proposals by some conservatives in Congress to strip the Supreme Court of power to decide cases involving abortion busing and school prayer Mr Bork said in an interview today that the possibility of a future nomination to the Supreme Court was not a factor in his decision to accept the appeals court nomination which had been expected since August He said that the appeals court is a very interesting court that presents a lot of intellectual stimulation Mr Bork was a Yale law professor from 1962 through last June except for 1973 to 1977 when he was Solicitor General the Governments chief lawyer in arguments before the Supreme Court In July he left Yale to become a senior partner in the Washington office of Kirkland  Ellis a major corporate law firm based in Chicago Mr Bork could have expected to make well over 200000 a year in that position according to partners in major Washington law firms Federal appeals court judges are paid 74300 Mr Bork is expected to have little difficulty winning confirmation in the Republicancontrolled Senate Even liberal Senators who abhor Mr Borks conservative political views and judicial philosophy may have difficulty opposing him according to Senate staff members because of his recognized stature as a leading scholar in the antitrust and constitutional law fields Liberal Reputation for Court Mr Bork would replace Judge Carl McGowan who chose senior status and a reduced caseload this summer on the appeals court which has 11 fulltime positions It has traditionally been one of the most liberal courts in the nation a characteristic that has been enhanced by the four judges named to the court by President Carter Attorney General Smith cited the nomination of Mr Bork along with the nominations of two other prominent conservative law professors to other Federal appeals courts in recent months as examples of the Administrations determination to use the power of judicial appointment to further President Reagans views on judicial restraint The others he named were Ralph Winter another Yale law professor who has been nominated to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York and Richard Posner a University of Chicago professor who was confirmed by the Senate last month to serve on the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago In a book review in the current issue of The Public Interest a neoconservative journal Mr Bork wrote that the Supreme Court is adrift and frequently performing not a constitutional but a legislative function But he expressed concern about legislative remedies that threaten the entire concept of judicial supremacy in applying the Constitution and might create a constitutional crisis a confrontation between the democratic and judicial branches of Government
Echoes of Watergate,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/10/opinion/echoes-of-watergate.html,Historical news quiz What do Robert Bork and Maurice Stans have in common One answer is Watergate and now there is another one In the last few days President Reagan has nominated both men for Federal office Mr Bork as an appellate judge in Washington Mr Stans as a director of a Federal investment corporation At this point the parallels abruptly stop Mr Bork is the man who carried out President Nixons command that the Watergate special prosecutor be fired in the famous Saturday Night Massacre of October 1973 He was bitterly assailed at the time Nixons Bork is worse than his bite read one poster but he had a principled rationale He might not agree with a particular Presidential order he said according to one account but nonetheless felt a duty to carry it out Mr Bork moreover is a legal scholar of distinction and principle For instance he opposes the various courtstripping bills that have been introduced in Congress a braver position than any so far taken by his Justice Department sponsors One may differ heatedly with him on specific issues like abortion but those are differences of philosophy not principle Differences of philosophy are what the 1980 election was about Robert Bork is given President Reagans philosophy a natural choice for an important judicial vacancy The same cannot be said about the appointment of Maurice Stans to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation It is a much less important job a parttime twoyear term on a 15member board concerned with foreign economic policy Still the nomination probably makes him the first person with a criminal record from Watergate to be nominated to Federal office It is true that he was acquitted of obstructing justice and other charges related to Robert Vesco the fugitive financier But he also pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor charges of campaign contribution violations in the 1972 Nixon campaign As finance chairman the former Commerce Secretary squeezed a record 60 million out of contributors Circumstances suggest that the White House wanted to hide the nomination It was announced at the most sluggish time on a Friday afternoon embedded among a dozen other appointments and without explanation Camouflage notwithstanding the nomination conveys dismaying signals One is that the President wary of formal Watergate clemency is willing to give a backdoor pardon More troubling it implies White House indifference to the campaign finance law Why inviting these inferences did Mr Reagan make this nomination It requires confirmation hearings perhaps the Senate can find out
BILL TO BAN BUSING DELAYED IN SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/11/us/bill-to-ban-busing-delayed-in-senate.html,Supporters of a move to ban busing for racial integration won another important round in the Senate today but opponents of the measure used parliamentary maneuvers to delay final action By a vote of 64 to 35 the Senators voted to halt a filibuster against an amendment that would prohibit judges in school integration decisions from requiring students to travel father than five miles or longer 15 minutes to school The measure was proposed by Senator J Bennett Johnston Democrat of Louisiana as a rider to a bill authorizing funds for the Justice Department for the fiscal year 1982 The leading foe of the amendment Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut then continued to use up time proposing a series of procedural motions In late afternoon the Senate leadership put the bill aside before the Johnston amendment could be voted on The Senate debate partly fulfills a longstanding promise by Howard H Baker Jr the Senate majority leader to allow Senate conservatives a chance to debate such socalled social issues as busing school prayer and abortion But with time running short in the legislative season any decisive action will almost certainly be postponed until after Congress reconvenes in late January The Senate has scheduled its 1981 adjournment for next week Giving Helms His Day There is no way this is going anywhere said Senator Joseph R Biden of Delaware the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee This is just giving Helms his day on the floor Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina is a leading conservative voice in the social issue debate Mr Weicker said that while the Johnston amendment would probably pass early next year there would be more opportunities to thwart the entire bill It would look to be a good years project before this lemon becomes lemonade he said In addition to the prohibition on future busing cases the Johnston bill would also allow the Justice Department to reopen existing desegregation orders and Mr Johnston said today that his proposal would mean the end of most current busing programs The struggle over the Johnston rider has been going on for six months Today the lawmaker asserted that an overwhelming number of voters opposed busing plans Why he said Very simply the American people know what each of us knows  it doesnt work Uncomfortable Role for Sponsor In an interview Mr Johnston said he was very uncomfortable in taking the lead against busing because he represents a large black constituency But year after year he said Ive seen the quality of education deteriorate Weve reached the point where something must be done Mr Weicker concedes that busing is an unpopular remedy but insists that the Johnston amendment is an unconstitutional attempt by Congress to usurp the authority of the judicial and executive branches Never have I seen in all my years in politics he said today such a naked unparalleled frightening attack upon the Constitution and upon the rights of all Americans Mr Weicker admits that he cannot defeat antibusing legislation but only delay it given the current makeup of Congress Groups such as the American Bar Association and Common Cause the public affairs lobby have stepped up their opposition to the Johnston amendment and other bills that they see as threatening the independence of the judiciary New Filibuster Threatened But in Congress Mr Weicker admits he has made little headway in convincing lawmakers that the issue is constitutional not political And its going to get tougher and tougher as we get closer to the election he said Before Congress recesses Republican leaders might also take up an appropriation bill for the Departments of State Commerce and Justice that has an amendment endorsing the concept of organized school prayer Mr Weicker the bills floor manager has threatened another filibuster if it returns to the floor
HOUSE VOTES CUTS IN SOCIAL SPENDING; TRIMS FOREIGN AID,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/11/us/house-votes-cuts-in-social-spending-trims-foreign-aid.html,Republican moderates reversed themselves today and gave President Reagan a victory in the Democraticcontrolled House on an omnibus spending bill to finance the Government through March 31 The 413 billion bill would reduce spending by 4 billion beyond the Presidents initial budget request last March In the key vote of 222 to 194 all but three Republicans heeded the pleas of the President and their Congressional leaders to go along with further cuts in social programs The three holdouts were Representatives Bill Green of New York Harold C Hollenbeck of New Jersey and Charles F Dougherty of Pennsylvania The bill then was sent to the Republicancontrolled Senate where Republican leaders agreed to oppose any amendments Adoption of two identical pieces of legislation would eliminate the need for a HouseSenate conference Amendments Voted Down Tonight the Senate defeated amendments proposed by Democrats and intended to embarrass the Republicans by placing them on record against various social programs These restorations were rejected 362 million for maternal and child care on a vote of 53 to 41 120 million for state unemployment insurance 65 to 30 and 90 million for programs for the elderly health centers and Head Start 54 to 41 A 100 million increase for youth employment was also defeated 64 to 31 The 4 billion in additional spending cuts all in domestic programs except for a 400 million reduction made today in foreign aid is less than half what Mr Reagan sought last September because of deterioration in the economy For their reversals the Republican moderates obtained some concessions in additional funds for health and education programs and fuel assistance for the poor The omnibus bill also includes a 48 percent raise for 40000 senior civil servants the first raise they have received since 1979 President Has Agreed to Accept Republican leaders said the President had agreed to sign the measure despite the changes made in the House compromiseThey also said he had agreed to sign any individual appropriation bills that stayed under the ceilings set by the omnibus bill Representative Silvio O Conte Republican of Massachusetts said the bill makes the minimal savings that the President has agreed to accept I talked to him personally Mr Conte told the House He will sign this bill In a reemergence of a coalition that prevailed last spring and summer on budget and tax issues 36 conservative Democrats joined the Republicans in wresting control of the chamber from the Democratic leadership To gain their votes the Republicans lopped off 400 million in foreign aid and shortened the expiration date for the bill from Sept 30 to March 31 The conservative Democrats had expressed concern that such a lengthy bill would undermine the authority of the appropriations committees The measure passed today is formally a continuing resolution socalled because it authorizes the Government to spend money in the absence of formal appropriation bills The device has been used for many years Recently Congress has used it to change various spending levels and even included language in such devices to bar the use of Federal funds for abortions Spending for most Federal agencies was controlled by continuing resolutions in the fiscal year 1981 Foreign aid spending has been entirely controlled by continuing resolutions for three years The bill is needed now because only three of 13 individual appropriations for the 1982 fiscal year which began Oct 1 have been signed into law Last month President Reagan vetoed a continuing resolution as budgetbusting and furloughed most nonessential Federal employees for half a day Congress subsequently sent him a resolution providing a threeweek extension of current spending That resolution expires Tuesday Weve broken the logjam and were going to find some action now on the individual appropriation bills Representative Robert H Michel of Illinois the Republican leader said after the vote today Agreements Indicated Indeed later today Congress finished action on an Interior Department appropriations that Mr Michel had said the President would find acceptable And a conference committee also sent to the White House an agreement on a Housing and Urban Development appropriation The House also handed Mr Reagan another more predictable victory by approving the second supposedly binding budget resolution for the fiscal year 1982 The vote was 206 to 200 The budget resolution and omnibus resolution are required to be approved before Congress adjourns for its Christmas recess but Howard H Baker Jr the Senate Republican leader said there was no way that Congress would adjourn without also passing a military appropriations bill That bill has passed both houses and is before a conference committee The Housepassed budget merely updated the 6955 billion resolution adopted last spring It already has been rendered obsolete by economic developments and will have to be recalculated next March in a third budget resolution In the partyline vote 136 Republicans supported the resolution while 150 Democrats opposed it The Gypsy Moths In the Congressional action last month the Republican moderates who dubbed themselves gypsy moths rebuffed the President and their leaders by refusing to make the additional cuts Representative Conte the ranking minority member of the Appropriations committee initially led the fight against further cuts in social programs which he then called Americas investment in humanity But today it was Mr Conte who led the fight for the Republican measure which he helped fashion Mr Conte cited the Presidents determination and the desire of Congress to adjourn next week If the House repeated its former position he warned Congress could remain in session on Christmas Day What we should have learned Mr Conte said is that were dealing with a President who has a sense of will and determination that hasnt been since the Johnson Administration He termed the Democratic alternative a plan for additional cuts of 3 billion an exercise of political fantasy gamesmanship and wishful thinking Run by the President Democratic leaders on the other hand urged the House to maintain its independence and not be cowed by the threat of another Presidential veto Were going to have to stand up along the line or were going to be run by the President said Representative Jamie L Whitten Democrat of Mississippi chairman of the Appropriations committee It was never intended that a legislative body be subject to the dictates of a President The most acrimonious exchange occurred between Representatives Robert S Walker Republican of Pennsylvania and William H Natcher a conservative Democrat from Kentucky who is chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that deals with most social programs Mr Walker noting that the Republican cuts were in domestic programs asked Arent these the exact categories that have risen by 1500 percent in 25 years There have been increases in these programs and they ought to have been increased Mr Natcher replied I want you to go back to the State of Pennsylvania he continued and tell them youre against the children of this country Youre voting against the handicapped youre voting against aid for education youre voting against heart and stroke research Cuts Made Across the Board The Republican plan applied a 4 percent acrosstheboard reduction to all spending areas except the military foreign aid all benefit programs such as food stamps and Medicare general revenue sharing veterans medical care Internal Revenue Service functions and law enforcement activities No individual program could be terminated or reduced by more than 6 percent according to the plan The 400 million reduction in foreign aid brought it to 96 billion President Reagan seeks 11 billion however and Republicans hope to get it by enacting a separate foreign aid appropriation bill that would supersede the omnibus bill The Republican bill struck a compromise on whether to use the 1970 or 1980 census to appropriate Federal highway funds The 1970 census would favor urban areas in the Northeast and Middle West that lost some population in the last decade The bill provides that the 1970 census be used until March 31 which is half the fiscal year and that the 1980 census be used for the remainder of the fiscal year Before the House vote on the continuing resolution a move to grant pay increases to nonstriking air traffic controllers and others who have been keeping the system running was deleted from the bill on a point of order The proposed increases would have been retroactive to Aug 3 when the walkout began
Books of the Times; Books Of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/11/books/books-of-the-times-books-of-the-times.html,By John Leonard MIXED COMPANY Women in the Modern Army By Helen Rogan 333 pages Put nam 1495 CLIFFORD ALEXANDER who was Jimmy Carters Secretary of the Army said this to Helen Rogan West Point just like Harvard is less important than it thinks it is If it was in North Dakota you wouldnt know it was there The trouble suggests Miss Rogan is that the values of West Point  including the superstition that the faster you can run the better you will lead  are also the values of our Army and to some extent the values of the culture on which that Army depends for its images and fantasies of manliness Men go to war where they mystically bond in order to protect the women who stay home feeding the children If the women go to war with the men then the men have no way of proving they are better than the women Miss Rogan born in Edinburgh educated at Cambridge University in England an associate editor at Harpers Magazine is a young woman of cool intelligence and skeptical humor and a very good writer She has gone to war in peacetime at Fort McClellan Ala at West Point at the Pentagon and at Army posts as far flung as Kitzingen in southern Germany  everywhere but North Dakota She has while marching with Alpha Company and reassembling an M16 talked to women who joined the Army and to men who dont know what to think about it She is acquainted equally with the historical facts and particulars of personality Her acquaintances make an excellent book No Strangers to War Women of course have been no strangers to war They have been warriors leaders heroines adventurers poisoners partisans guerrillas and gunrunners terrorists revolutionaries spies nurses raped civilians camp followers Never mind the Amazons who belong to the pulp imagination Think instead of Medea Semiramis Hatshepsut Deborah Judith Zenobia Agrippina Cleopatra Tiamat Boadicea Bridget and Rhiannon and Maeve of the Celts Remember the Eumenides and Erinyes the Valkyries and Scotlands Ladies of the Covenant and the female regiments of King Gezo of Dahomey Contemplate the Pankhursts who broke all those windows and were forcefed on hunger strikes the Israelis the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Weather Underground We arent talking about white gloves and church socials But  again of course  women have been traditionally the last resort the actresses of desperation When nationhood is in jeopardy no one asks questions about upperbody strength In this country for better or worse there has been no threat of invasion in this century We havent needed women except as nurses and secretaries and telephone operators to confront the deadly foe whoever he is How come then that women since 1978 have accounted for 8 percent of our military posture 174000 of them 67000 in the Army There are four million people in the armed forces of the Soviet Union and only 10000 of them are female Well we have a volunteer Army and Miss Rogan rather hopes it will remain so Until the legislated integration of that Army in 1977  until that is the abolition of the Womens Army Corps WAC  those females who volunteered were better educated than the males although both sexes sought in military service the same satisfactions adventure a decent job opportunity the chance to train and get an education escape from a stifling small town and proof of patriotism After 1977 except at West Point the volunteers are looking for a way out of a closed society whatever their sex The Gender Differences Miss Rogan covers racism and homosexuality and abortion and the banned images  Pallas Athene of the abolished WACs She is knowledgeable about gender differences Men on the average are 10 percent bigger heavier and stronger in the hands chest and legs although not in the abdomen women have better hearing are more bouyant in water run the marathon more efficiently and tend to cry rather than to jump out of windows when the world goes wrong She is severe in her analysis of the weighty judgments attached to such differences How many pushups compensate for an inability to be flexible under duress Who decides that men who know how to holler and swear are superior to women who have icy eyes when the heat is on She is writing however about minds more than bodies Military men are threatened by military women Why Women at home are a dream of domesticity Women in the trenches are a provocation Are they to be protected or raped Are men animals or chivalric Who is to be protected from whom An Arctic of the brain takes over at this front there are no virgins War finally is a substitute for sex a drama of property rights Who owns the Madonna Miss Rogan is fair to the variations of her men as well as her women She listens as if to each remarkable seashell If every army is based on a semimystical warrior elite why is Pallas Athene less compelling than the Knights Templars She hears one young woman loving her rifle exclaim Wow This is great I feel like Patty Hearst She hears another explain I grew up in a part of the country where there were no black people I seriously thought homosexuality was a fairy tale like Snow White She has found warriors who happen to be female I retract Miss Rogan has visited North Dakota after all West Point is everywhere And what is the Point of West if women want to die as much as men
THE EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK; Have a Baby! Get $14 a Day!,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/11/opinion/the-editorial-notebook-have-a-baby-get-14-a-day.html,When unmarried teenagers become pregnant as a startling proportion now do they can choose abortion adoption marriage or welfare Some people say it is that last option the Government dole that is encouraging the tremendous upsurge in children having children Two scholars Kristin Moore and Martha Burt of the Urban Institute have examined that argument They conclude that no evidence supports nor does any disprove the hypothesis that welfare encourages teens to become pregnant Its hard to imagine researchers finding anyone who would admit that she had a baby only to qualify for welfare  even if it were true And no other evidence links increases in benefit levels to higher fertility rates of unmarried women Some figures in fact suggest the opposite If welfare were an incentive to teenage pregnancy states with higher welfare payments would have higher birth rates Yet it is states with low welfare benefits  If Welfare Payments Encourage Illegitimacy What About Alabama Alabama Mississippi and Louisiana  that have the highest rates In fact for younger teenagers those least likely to consider the consequences of engaging in sex  welfare is probably more the result of pregnancy than a cause of it Studies show that when teenagers from 14 to 17 have babies their education is interrupted and welfare naturally follows But welfare does play some role The two Urban Institute researchers argue that the availability of welfare may encourage a teenager once pregnant to bear a child when she might otherwise obtain an abortion Welfare may also make it possible to avoid marrying the father or giving up the baby for adoption The attractiveness of the welfare option they suggest depends upon the attractiveness or merely the level of awareness of the others How attractive can the welfare option be In New York City a mother and child would receive 333 a month a 22 energy payment plus about 70 worth of food stamps Thats 14 a day for two people To make it on that would require intelligence creativity and a lot of luck Thus if society is really serious about wanting to do something about the soaring incidence of teenage births  which now cost as much as 10 billion each year in welfare payments  it should stop all the mindless talk about how welfare causes pregnancy and get on with two tasks First make sure that young females  and males  know just how tough the welfare option is and second educate them better for the other options birth control adoption abortion  not to mention the most important jobs ROBERT CURVIN

a bill to change the states current method of propertytax assessments with only one of the 13 members voting to override the veto The leadership of the State Legislature however was able to muster the necessary twothirds margin to enact the controversial measure State Senator Jay P Rolison Jr Republican of Poughkeepsie whose district includes North Salem and Lewisboro voted with the majority Three members of the countys delegation  Assemblyman Nicholas Spano Republican of Yonkers Assemblyman John M Perone Republican of Port Chester and Assemblyman Jon S Fossel Republican of Ossining  did not return to Albany for the special oneday session The leadership was trying to get people to Albany who would vote for the override explained Mr Perone Our nonappearance in Albany is a no vote anyway Assemblyman Perone said that both he and Mr Fossel had previously planned to vacation with their families during the week the session was called There wasnt any need in changing those plans when we knew the leadership had the necessary votes before they even returned to Albany he added My wife was ill Assemblyman Spano said explaining his absence It was my understanding that the leadership had the necessary votes If I felt that my vote would have changed anything I would have been there Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink Democrat of Brooklyn denied suggestions that he had had to twist arms of certain legislators who had voted against the original bill but had voted for the override Nearly all of the legislators who changed their votes were from New York City and Nassau County  the two areas expected to benefit the most from the new reassessment bill Westchester legislators and others outside those areas have bitterly and repeatedly objected to the special exemptions included in the bill for homeowners in New York City and Nassau County who are now underassessed Mr Fink said that he would be willing to consider amendments from the countys delegation or any delegation that believed its districts may need special treatment In the meantime county officials as well as many homeowners have questioned the constitutionality of the legislation and many were standing by to see if legal challenges may be made I feel this bill will be held unconstitutional said Mr Perone The state will be spending taxpayer dollars to defend a bad bill All weve done is diffuse the issue for the upcoming political year Theyre buying time but delaying the inevitable Upstairs Bert Kent and His Orchestra were playing Alexanders Ragtime Band and Yes Sir Thats My Baby Downstairs four other musicians were producing a melange of hums whistles and chiming sounds on 300 brandy snifters champagne goblets bowls tubes and other objects made of glass The four were members of The Glass Orchestra and they had traveled from Toronto to perform at a formal benefit given by and for the Friends of the Neuberger Museum Held last weekend at the museum which is part of the State University of New York at Purchase the event  officially billed as the 1981 Gala Celebration  drew 700 and brought in approximately 45000 for the Friends The Friends who number more than 1000 are the museums membership group Their annual dues which range from 15 to 1000 aid in the financing of acquisitions The museum is also financed by New York State and by various individual corporate and public endowments Additionally they help staff the museum on a volunteer basis act as docents or guides and sponsor a community outreach department that runs various education programs The gala provided the first American showcase for the Glass Orchestra A Canadian group that has been together since 1977 it gave three 20minute performances in the museums downstairs theater gallery Glass bowls goblets tumblers vases jars tubes pipes flutes and chimes were arranged on the floor of the darkened gallery and illuminated by candles Marvin Green Eric Cadesky Miguel Frasconi and Paul Hodge musicians who also play more conventional instruments coaxed from these pieces a variety of sounds and tempos some reminiscent of Indian sitar music others not unlike the more pulsating rhythms of Africa and the Middle East Humming noises both high and lowpitched were produced by rubbing a wet finger around the rim of a container other effects were achieved by blowing glass flutes and pipes and by striking drums  glass bowls filled with shards of still more glass We draw on world music cultures Mr Green said adding that the group intended to create a visual and acoustic environment  a goal in keeping with the Neubergers current exhibit Soundings a survey of visual artists use of sound and music The orchestra will conduct free workshops at the museum Tuesday and Thursday 10 to 1130 AM and noon to 2 PM and a jam session Wednesday 2 PM For reservations call 2535134 According to Linda Lese a chairman of the event another purpose of the celebration was to pay tribute to three past chairmen of the board of the Friends and their wives Leonard and Helen Yaseen Milton and Frieda Rosenthal and Melvin and Elaine Merians Artists who have had solo exhibitions at the museum were also honored at a private dinner given there by Marie S and Roy R Neuberger the institutions founder Among those present were the sculptor George Segal and Christo whose Running Fence a 24 12milelong fabric fence constructed in California in the mid1970s was one of the most controversial art projects of the past decade Elsie Morrison has been working hard revising her 1982 budget But unlike the directors of nearly every other social service program in the county Mrs Morrison is revising her budget upward As executive director of Coordinated Human Services of Westchester the county agency that coordinates and distributes Federal funds to local familyplanning agencies Mrs Morrison recently learned that her agency would receive more money than it had requested The 686760 grant from the Department of Health and Human Services represents a 20 percent increase over last years allocation and the maximum increase allowed by law It was quite a change for me to do an upward revision of my budget Mrs Morrison said last week She added that an evaluation by the state and Federal governments last summer had found the agency in a high degree of compliance with Federal requirements with the numbers of patients served up and the costs down Increased financing was provided under the Public Health Service Act The agency contracts with a number of familyplanning agencies in the county including Planned Parenthood and the Westchester County Department of Health to provide health care education on contraception and counseling for 7335 residents 13 to 60 years old whose income does not exceed 156 percent of the Federal poverty level For many women family planning is their first exposure to the health care system Mrs Morrison said The contract agency screens patients for evidence of hypertension uterine and breast cancer and anemia as part of the familyplanning effort The agency celebrated the increased Federal support at its 10th anniversary luncheon recently in White Plains The celebration was muted however as the keynote speaker Susan Cohen a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute in Washington analyzed future challenges for family planning agencies Warning of a double assault on familyplanning funds by the new federalism and the new right Mrs Cohen said antiabortion proponents were opposing familyplanning efforts which they described as a secular humanistic cancer Led by Republican Senators Orrin G Hatch of Utah and Jeramiah A Denton of Alabama she said the antiabortion lobby has opposed Health Service financing for family planning Federal authorities recently began a nationwide investigation of a sampling of groups affiliated with Planned Parenthood to determine whether they were illegally using Federal funds to promote abortion Francine Stein executive director of Planned Parenthood in Westchester said her agency had been audited last July There was absolutely no indication of any misuse of funds Mrs Stein said She emphasized that Planned Parenthood organizations like any agencies that receive Federal funds are accustomed to periodic audits When the Federal inspectors came to the Coordinated Human Services they looked only at Planned Parenthood one of several agencies under its umbrella Your back has to be a little prickled Mrs Stein said We have been very careful that the Health Services money avoided that difficulty said Ruth Fox chairman of the board of directors of Coordinated Human Services Both our central office and the Planned Parenthood office were audited and cleared
BILL OF RIGHTS DAY TO BE 'REAFFIRMED' AT ST. PAUL'S,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/13/nyregion/bill-of-rights-day-to-be-reaffirmed-at-st-paul-s.html,ST PAULS CHURCH in Mount Vernon declared a national monument last year for its link to the freedomofthepress provisions of the Bill of Rights will come alive again Tuesday with an allday celebration including a reenactment of the libel and treason trial of John Peter Zenger held 248 years ago Honoring the national Bill of Rights Day local schoolchildren and nationally prominent adults will gather at the church and its parish hall to offer musical dramatic and informational reaffirmations as Stanley Schear puts it of constitutional values Mr Schear a Scarsdale baker and member of the New York Civil Liberties Union organized the day and said he had selected the church as the site of the celebration because its where clergymen and editors have gathered for years to pay homage to Zenger whose trial set the stage for the principle of a free press Among the guests will be Fred R Friendly an author and former television news executive whose career has ranged from the See It Now series with Edward R Murrow to nationally recognized seminars on the media and the law I think right now were at the zenith of press rights he said last week but Im a bit troubled by the people who want to limit the power of the Supreme Court Mr Friendly the Edward R Murrow Professor Emeritus at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism and a lecturer at the Columbia Law School and College will draw on the fourth and fifth graders high school students and adults to play roles in a hypothetical media problem He said that the Zenger incident was central to the Constitution because a lot of people were not willing to sign it without a Bill of Rights He will be among several speakers including the Rev Paul Moore Jr the Episcopal Bishop of New York Faye Wattleton president of Planned Parenthood Norman Dorsen president of the American Civil Liberties Union and the actor Howard DaSilva who will join in the mornings dramatic presentations Eric Rothschild and Werner Feig teachers at Scarsdale High School will offer an audiovisual presentation and Mr Feigs constitutional law class will present a mock Abscam trial Justine Trattners fourthgrade class in New Rochelle will offer an original musical play on the Bill of Rights and Ruth Friendlys fifth grade Scarsdale class will present The Zenger Connection which she wrote several years ago with her son Michael Mark a musical member of Cotton Patch Gospel at the Lambs Club Theater in Manhattan You cant be married to Fred and not work journalism into your curriculum said Mrs Friendly who normally gets to the Constitution by the end of the school year This year because of the play I pushed them ahead and gave them all the background They started rehearsing and then discovered that lines in the play came from their history books  it was very exciting The young students will portray the efforts of the British Royal Governor William Cosby to rig an election in 1733 The election notice specified the date but not the time of balloting and government officials required proof of land ownership demanding also that voters swear on the Bible that their information was true A group of 38 Quakers declined to do so because their religion called only for verbal affirmation and they were barred from voting A church on the site of the presentday St Pauls was the voting place Mr Zenger a German printer who was present at the church during the election published an account of the events in his newspaper the New York Journal He was jailed and charged with seditious libel and treason while his wife continued to publish the newspaper At the trial nine months later Mr Zengers lawyer Andrew Hamilton of Philadelphia introduced a new argument He told the jury that what Mr Zenger had printed was true and that truthful criticism of a government was not libel The jury found Mr Zenger not guilty and the verdict became a foundation for freedom of the press as it was established in the first of 10 Amendments to the Constitution the Bill of Rights which was ratified on Dec 15 1789 Mr Schear said he conceived of celebrating Dec 15 at St Pauls when I became concerned about the radical right whose members are doing some real damage on the abortion issue school prayer unseating people in Congress pushing for regressive legislation I thought if people were using Bible talk to undo the Constitution he said perhaps it was appropriate to go back to a church representing the Bill of Rights to reaffirm it I used to consider myself part of the radical left but now Im a reformed radical he said The radical right and the radical left are always acting toward moving the middle to their positions and now I think its time for civil libertarians to become active He described the Bill of Rights as just a piece of paper that gives you the right to fight for your rights He said he became a member of the Civil Liberties Union 12 years ago after members of the New York chapter came up to observe when we were threatened by local officials for organizing a demonstration at the Hudson Institute a research center that he described as a little Pentagon in Westchester County St Pauls Church declared a national historic site in 1978 was turned over to the National Park Service on Nov 1 last year by the Episcopal Diocese of New York Duane Pearson superintendent of the services Manhattan office said that a single caretaker was maintaining the site while the Justice Department studied the terms of its upkeep Its been in their hands since April he said Apparently they are having some sort of churchandstate problem an irony considering that the separation of church and state also was established in the Bill of Rights The problem he believes has less to do with St Paul s than with several other sites being taken over by the Park Service that contain stillactive churches Mr Pearson said that the Park Services intention was to utilize an annual operating budget of 100000 through the daytoday work of a notforprofit corporation consisting of representatives of local historical religious and other organizations long interested in preserving St Pauls We have replaced the furnace in the parish hall contracted for security and fire protection removed dead trees mowed the grass and maintained the buildings in a janitorial way but it is still not staffed for the public he said It has been open for occasional school groups however and for special occasions such as Tuesdays

Sunday Observer By Russell Baker Getting Serious Patrick McDonnell,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/13/magazine/sunday-observer-by-russell-baker-getting-serious-patrick-mcdonnell.html,Conservatives arent as nice as they used to be Being in charge of things has taken a lot of the joy out of them I guess Until they got elected conservatives used to be a lot of fun to spend an evening with Certainly a lot more fun than liberals Liberals are people whose hearts are in the right place and I admire that but its always heavy going socially Sooner or later liberals are going to start poking around to find if your hearts in the right place too If it isnt theyre going to try to relocate it for you Liberals cant seem to have a good time with you until they are satisfied that your views on the HumphreyHawkins bill coincide with theirs Its no good telling them that you dont know what the HumphreyHawkins bill is because theyll stop everything and tell you Have you ever spent a nice sociable evening having the HumphreyHawkins bill explained to you This is why I started several years ago spending the pleasurable hours with conservatives Conservative food conservative drink conservative cigars and conservative conversation were always superior to the liberal variety Best of all conservatives hearts were not in the right place They agreed that all men are created equal of course but recognized that this condition always changes dramatically a few moments after the creation Naturally they deplored the vice of human greed but it didnt prevent them from enjoying pleasures unique to the upper brackets Conservatives took the attitude that though man may be perfectible the perfecting would not be done in the present millennium in the meantime why stew and fuss about mans resistance to being perfected when a canny fellow could spend his time making the most of an unhappy social situation Hence the superior food drink and cigars The superior conversation came out of the conservatives realization that his heart was not really in the right place A man who suspects he is not altogether sure of admission into paradise is always more entertaining than the fellow who knows for certain that the angels are itching to welcome him All this has changed since conservatives became the peoples choice Now conservatives behave the way liberals used to Its getting elected that changed them Getting elected seems to have persuaded them that their hearts are in the right place after all I dont know why this should be unless they really believe in the wisdom of the electorate and think the people recognize a heart in the right place when they see one They didnt believe this all those years when the people were being foolishly gulled into electing liberals In those days they believed you could fool most of the people most of the time Since the people have finally come to their senses however conservatives are not only pleased about having their hearts in the right place but also scornful of people whose hearts arent Those evenings when you could get away from liberals and have a nice time with conservatives are becoming rare Drop by a conservatives house for a soiree nowadays and there are bound to be two or three people there who never blink Theyre like East European border guards who suspect you are trying to smuggle comic books into the Peoples Republic They examine your credentials rip open your ideological baggage You have dropped in expecting the finest cognac in town a cigar slyly obtained from the detestable but nonetheless cigarblessed Havana and an hour of restorative lip about the human comedy and what do you get Where is your heart these days I never have the nerve to answer In the right place I want my heart to be in the right place but it rarely is Liberals have taught me that over the years I dont want to be caught lying to these fierce conservatives Say I dont know where it is these days and they insist on locating it immediately Where do you stand on abortion I have stood on every side of the abortion issue My present position is a profound wish that it would go away I cant tell them that They know what the right position is and if I confess indecision they will surround me and tell me what the right position is They will do the same if they get no satisfaction on school prayer supplyside economics autoexhaust emissions nuclear power water pollution Caribbean dictatorships  Id just as soon spend an evening having the HumphreyHawkins bill explained to me one more time Something terrible has happened to conservatives Theyve become earnest Dont get me wrong I admire earnestness Nobody ever succeeds in public life without being earnest Attila the Hun was earnest Liberals have always been earnest Now that conservatives have finally discovered earnestness it looks as if theres no stopping them Uhoh here comes one now If I dont get out of here fast hell tell me why the Laffer curve is the only possible solution and the HumphreyHawkins bill a creation of Satan And not even a dollop of good cognac to wash it down with
ANTI-ABORTION GROUP BACKS HATCH PROPOSAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/13/us/anti-abortion-group-backs-hatch-proposal.html,The National Right to Life Committee one of the nations largest antiabortion groups today endorsed a constitutional amendment that would empower Congress and individual states to adopt laws regulating and banning abortion The committees board of directors representing member groups in 50 states and the District of Columbia voted 30 to 24 in an emergency meeting to support the amendment sponsored by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah The vote brings the committee into accord with the National Conference of Catholic Bishops which endorsed the Hatch amendment last month The bishops said they believed that more sweeping antiabortion measures could not pass Congress now and that it was better to seek an achievable solution The Right to Life move was seen as a step toward the creation of a unified policy in the antiabortion committee although some members of the group said it did not mark an end to the division between those who support the Hatch amendment and those who favor a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion A Question of Strategy It is a question of the strategy not of the conviction of the people here that we were deciding today said Jack Wilkes president of the committee We will have to wait a week or so to see what kind of consensus we have for our vote today There are states that oppose the Hatch amendment and will continue to oppose the Hatch amendment he said There are people here today who will say that they wont support the amendment ever but its hard to tell this soon The Hatch amendment would overturn the Supreme Court decision of 1973 upholding the right to abortion A constitutional amendment must receive twothirds of the vote in each house of Congress plus the approval of threefourths of the states Senator Hatch addressed the 54 delegates at the daylong closed meeting Delegates emerging from the meeting were not uniformly enthusiastic about supporting the amendment but many said they would go along with the wishes of the majority Despite the vote several members of the executive committee said they would have a hard time supporting the amendment The feelings are running high on all sides said Doug Badger a lobbyist for a Christian antiabortion group and one of the committees most ardent opponents of the Hatch compromise I dont see anyone coming together as a result of this meeting although it might be a little too early to tell Mr Badger said We will need something else I dont know what to give us unity

Harassing Planned Parenthood,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/15/opinion/harassing-planned-parenthood.html,Family planning has not always been such a given in American life Many people easily remember when birth control information was unavailable or painfully difficult to come by Contraception was a subject so hedged with taboos it seemed almost obscene  although the real obscenity was the often tragic consequence of uncontrolled fertility That none of the above is any longer the case is due in large part to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America some of whose affiliates are currently undergoing the kind of scrutiny more commonly given suspicious characters Planned Parenthood affiliates started receiving Federal funds in 1970 and have been subject to routine audits ever since But because several members of Congress  in particular Senators Hatch and Denton  suspect that some funding is being used to publicize and promote abortion the audits have been stepped up to an extraordinary degree So far neither the Department of Health and Human Services nor the General Accounting Office has reported any violations Violence however has been done to the privacy of patients In Connecticut for instance a Planned Parenthood affiliate that has already passed 1979 and 1980 tax audits had to produce not only financial records but confidential patient records as well In Minnesota Planned Parenthood obtained affidavits from sterilization patients to show auditors that they had given informed consent Signing was voluntary but no patient should have had to make public what was nobody elses business In New York City Planned Parenthood which was audited and found in compliance with regulations in September was audited again this month So persistent a series of audits looks like an abuse of power instigated by a handful of Congressmen Faye Wattleton president of Planned Parenthood in a memo to local officials said they were a harassment technique They are also shameful
POPE EMPHASIZES DOCTRINES ON SEX,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/16/world/pope-emphasizes-doctrines-on-sex.html,Pope John Paul II called today for strict enforcement of the traditional doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church on abortion artificial birth control divorce and related issues In a 175page apostolic exhortation summing up the findings of last years Synod of Bishops on the Christian family the Pope condemned the practice of artificial birth control as a manipulation and degradation of human sexuality He said the church condemns as a grave offense against human dignity all attempts by governments to attempt to limit in any way the freedom of couples in deciding about children Likewise he said the church condemned as gravely unjust any policy under which one nation made its economic assistance to another conditional on programs of contraception sterilization and procured abortion Rhythm Method Promoted While upholding the total ban on artificial contraception the Pope said Roman Catholic theology recognized the anthropological and moral difference between contraception and recourse to the rhythm of the cycle It is he added a difference that is much wider than is usually thought Referring to the rhythm method of birth control which involves sexual abstinence during a womans fertile periods he called for a broader more decisive and more systematic effort to make the natural methods of regulating fertility known respected and applied Under a subheading the church stands for life he said there was an antilife mentality in some quarters He took issue with the studies of ecologists and futurologists on population growth which sometimes exaggerate the danger of demographic increase to the quality of life The document which is meant primarily as a guide to members of the clergy was distributed in English and several other languages Rights and Role of Women In a long passage on the rights and role of women the Pope said that by virtue of their equal dignity and responsibility women are fully justified to seek access to public functions He added that to give women this right society must be structured in such a way that wives and mothers are not in practice compelled to work outside the home and that their families can live and prosper in a dignified way even when they themselves devote their full time to their own family The church the Pope wrote cannot admit what are called trial marriages which many people today would like to justify by attributing a certain value to them The church also rejects unions without any publicly recognized institutional bond either civil or religious he said adding that this was a phenomenon that was becoming ever more frequent under the pressure of difficult economic cultural and religious situations Pastors should make themselves acquainted with such situations he said Civil Marriages Increasing He noted that an increasing number of Roman Catholics for ideological or practical reasons preferred to contract a civil marriage only But this is not acceptable to the church and the pastors of the church will regrettably not be able to admit them to the sacraments The church reaffirms her practice of not admitting to eucharist communion divorced persons who have remarried the Pope wrote He also said divorced Catholics who had remarried and would be willing to repent but who were not in a position to dissolve their second marriage  for instance because of the upbringing of children  could not obtain forgiveness and admission to communion unless they take on themselves the duty to live in complete continence that is by abstinence from the acts proper to married couples

"ANTI-ABORTION BILL VOTED, 4-0",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/17/us/anti-abortion-bill-voted-4-0.html,A Senate Judiciary subcommittee gave unanimous approval today to a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow both Congress and the states to ban or regulate abortion The 4to0 vote in the Subcommittee on the Constitution sets the stage for an intense battle over abortion next year first in the full Senate Judiciary Committee and then on the Senate floor It was the second piece of antiabortion legislation approved by a Judiciary subcommittee The first which was supported by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina would define life as beginning at conception thus giving a fetus constitutional rights and making abortion illegal The proposed amendment considered today sponsored by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah the subcommittee chairman declares a right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution and that Congress and the states shall have the concurrent power too restrict and prohibit abortions The amendment would permit a state law to have precedence if it was more restrictive than legislation approved by Congress Seeks Repeal of Court Decision The Hatch amendment seeks to repeal the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized most abortions There are estimated to be 15 million abortions each year in the United States Besides Mr Hatch those senators voting for the amendment were Charles Grassley Republican of Iowa Strom Thurmond Republican of South Carolina chairman of the full Senate Judiciary Committee and Dennis DeConcini Democrat of Arizona Senator Patrick Leahy Democrat of Vermont abstained saying he thought subcommittees should not take final action on legislation until members had time to analyze testimony The vote came less than two hours after the last witness testified The amendment was endorsed by one of the nations largest antiabortion organizations the National Right to Life Committee and by the US Catholic Conference To become law the Hatch amendment needs a twothirds vote of both houses of Congress and ratification by threefourths of the states The bill backed by Mr Helms bill would take a majority vote of both Houses of Congress to become law although critics have said it is unconstitutional Mr Hatch said he expects the amendment to come before the full Judiciary Committee by late January and to be debated on the floor of the Senate by late winter or early spring
FARM LEGISLATION VOTED IN CONGRESS AS '81 SESSION ENDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/17/us/farm-legislation-voted-in-congress-as-81-session-ends.html,The 1981 session of Congress ended all of its official business and adjourned tonight after the House passed by a twovote margin 205 to 203 a bill setting farm price supports for the next four years After two hours of emotional debate on the farm bill most of the legislators present in the House heeded the Democratic whip Thomas Foley of Washington who argued that the measure was the only one that could be accepted by the White House The bill was sent to President Reagan who has indicated he would sign it even though its cost is about 200 million more than the Administration wanted Page B16 Earlier Congress passed and sent to Mr Reagan two bills that allocate 115 billion in foreign aid  the first legislation on that subject approved in three years Oil Takeover Debated In a lastminute maneuver that caught most lawmakers by surprise the House adopted by a vote of 223 to 107 a bill that would delay the Mobil Oil Corporations proposed takeover of the Marathon Oil Company for six months The sponsors argued that the proposed acquisition had caused such great public concern that it should be delayed until it could be studied further The Senate adjourned before considering the bill which will come up when Congress reconvenes Jan 25 The House adopted legislation to restore the minimum monthly benefit of 122 for Social Security recipients and sent it to the White House The bill which the Senate approved Tuesday night also permits the transfer of funds within the system as a way of meeting shortterm financing problems but it fails to deal with longrange issues Page B16 Long Battle Ended Todays action ended a long battle over the minimum benefit which was touched off earlier this year when Congress eliminated it entirely as part of its budgetcutting plan Hallelujah praise the Lord and amen said Representative JJ Pickle the Texas Democrat who heads the Subcommittee on Social Security I take satisfaction in knowing weve restored the minimum benefit That is compassionate and that is the right thing to do As the lawmakers wrangled over the final shreds of legislation many of their welldressed spouses lingered in great annoyance in the corridors of the Capitol waiting to go downtown to the annual White House Christmas party One bill that was not passed in the waning hours of the session was a measure that would make it a crime to identify intelligence agents working in undercover jobs overseas Senator Bill Bradley Democrat of New Jersey argued that it should not be rushed through and started to filibuster That forced the Senate leadership to postpone consideration until next year Both chambers approved legislation that would make it easier for lawmakers to deduct living expenses from their income tax returns On Tuesday House members voted themselves an early Christmas present by doubling the amount of money they are allowed to earn beyond their Congressional salary The waning hours of the 1981 session were marked by unusual partisan bitterness particularly from Democrats who have lost most of the major battles fought since January Senator Robert C Byrd of West Virginia the minority leader accused Republicans of marching like political zombies to the Administrations tune On the House side Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr of Massachusetts said that Republican policies favored big business the mighty and the rich But Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the Senate majority leader said the session would produce stimulation of the economy a reduction in a level of government and the intrusion of government into private affairs and an increase in the military preparedness and readiness of the United States The day also brought forth a preview of some of the issues that Congress will debate when it returns Senators Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts and Charles McC Mathias Republican of Maryland announced that they had at least 61 cosponsors for a bill that would strengthen the Voting Rights Act and make some of its key provisions permanent The bill is identical to one passed earlier by the House Even though it apparently commands majority support in the Senate it must surmount the opposition of Senator Strom Thurmond chairman of the Judiciary Committee who has asserted that the present version of the act bears much too heavily on Southern states Abortion Measure Passed In addition the Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution passed a proposed constitutional amendment that would overturn a Supreme Court decision guaranteeing the right of abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy Page B15 Looking ahead to next year Senator Alan Cranston of California the Democratic whip predicted that Mr Reagan would have a tougher time winning major votes particularly on budget cuts and other economic issues Too many members of Congress he said yielded to the great persuasion of Ronald Reagan against their own doubts but they will not be so easily persuaded next year They see that the programs they supported are not working In the lastminute rush of legislation the House approved an amendment to a banking bill that would make it possible for New York City to build up to 4000 singlefamily houses for lowincome poeple under a program that goes out of existence in March Mayor Koch a former Congressman was in Washington Tuesday to lobby for the bill Page B3 Before the measure passed several lawmakers raised objections to more Congressional help for New York The bills sponsor Representative Charles E Schumer Democrat of Brooklyn said later Being proNew York City is like poison The same bill contained another Schumer amendment that would make it easier for international banking operations to locate in the United States The Congressman predicted that the measure could mean 6000 jobs for the banking industry in New York Foreign Aid Bills Delayed The foreign aid authorization and appropriation bills had been jammed up by political opposition mainly from Republicans Similar opposition had blocked the appropriation of foreign aid for three years causing it to be financed by continuing resolutions But Mr Reagan said the bills were necessary for the conduct of his foreign policy and led the fight to push them through It shows said Representative Jonathan B Bingham a New York Democrat that this Administration recognizes the importance of the United States maintaining a major role in international relations We cant hole up and become isolationist The bill lifts bans on aid to Argentina Chile and Pakistan but preserves the Clark amendment which prohibits aid to insurgent forces battling the Marxist regime in Angola The amendment is named for Senator Dick Clark an Iowa Democrat who proposed it in the mid70s In an important change regarding nuclear weaponry the bill bans aid to countries that receive equipment for processing uranium that transfer or receive weapons or that detonate a device The President is empowered to waive the ban for 30 days but it goes into effect if Congress does not specifically extend the waiver In short Congress wants a strong policy against nuclear proliferation but wants a loophole in cases of national security Israeli Aid Challenged Major recipients of foreign aid include Israel Egypt and the Sudan The funds for Israel were challenged on the House floor today by Representative Paul N McCloskey Jr a California Republican He criticized Israels decision this week to annex occupied portions of the Golan Heights and he warned that there was a big danger of a war in the Middle East that could eventually involve the United States The bill on the lawmakers tax status is intended to clarify existing law For many years lawmakers were allowed to deduct only 3000 worth of living expenses earlier this year that limit was abolished However some lawmakers ran afoul of an income tax rule that prevented them from deducting housing costs if their families lived with them in the capital The action today would remove that problem Senator Cranston defended the move on the ground that lawmakers who earn 60662 had not voted themselves a raise in almost five years The same rationale was used Tuesday in the House when the members voted to allow themselves 18200 in outside income as opposed to the current limit of 9100 In other lastminute legislation both chambers approved an increase in the excise tax on coal to finance benefits for miners afflicted with black lung disease
LEADERS IN CONGRESS FORESEE HARD TIMES FOR REAGAN IN '82,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/18/us/leaders-in-congress-foresee-hard-times-for-reagan-in-82.html,Congressional leaders of both parties indicated today that President Reagan might find it harder to get his programs through the House and Senate next year than he did in the session just ended The Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr of Massachusetts who saw his Democratic alternatives mowed down as Congress ratified Mr Reagans requests this year predicted at a news conference that it would not be quite that easy in 1982 Do I think the President will have problems with getting his programs next year Mr ONeill said The answer is yes Ted Stevens of Alaska the assistant Republican leader in the Senate acknowledged at a separate news conference that it would be harder to keep Republican senators unified in the next session after the extraordinary party loyalty shown in 1981 Harder to Stay Together He predicted that it might be harder to keep them together on noneconomic issues such as abortion school busing for integration and righttowork legislation all of which are anticipated in January Next year Mr Stevens said Republicans will not have to fight to cut the budget because it will already have been sliced below this years spending levels when Mr Reagan submits it to Congress The two leaders yearend reviews came less than 12 hours after Congress ended what Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the Senate Republican leader called an extraordinary session in which Mr Reagan was handed major victories in the final days on farm military and foreign aid bills The President was given virtually everything he asked in the first session by a Republicancontrolled Senate and a House in which majority Democrats could not keep 25 to 30 conservatives called boll weevils from defecting on the economic votes Farm Bill Approved On the last day Congress also gave final approval to a fouryear 11 billion farm bill that includes price supports for milk wheat feed grains peanuts sugar cotton soybeans wool and rice It also approved and sent to the White House two foreign aid bills totaling 115 billion the first such legislation in three years The previous day Congress sent the President a record 200 billion military appropriation bill with funds for the MX missiles the B1 bomber and the Stealth bomber of the future The farm military and foreign aid bills were three of the major victories in Congress claimed by the administration Downhill for the President The others were the first and second budget reductions the tax cut and the continuing resolution that provided funds for Government agencies at levels Mr Reagan had demanded Mr ONeill said that it has been downhill for the President ever since his economic program was enacted The American people were asking to give the President a chance he said Now they know whats in the bill While the President was an excellent salesman in putting over his economic program he has failed to keep a single promise about the product itself Before adjourning Congress also reversed Mr Reagans only major initiative on Social Security rescuing the 122amonth mimimum benefit that would have ended in March for about three million Americans But there will be no new recipients after Jan 1
"TO FINANCIER, NEARLY 90, LOVE FOR CITY IS CONSTANT",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/19/nyregion/to-financier-nearly-90-love-for-city-is-constant.html,As he approaches his 90th birthday Jacob M Kaplan the financier and philanthropist says the years have been filled with satisfactions business coups a close family life and the use of his wealth to improve the city he loves But despite such clearcut rewards he says he finds that the meaning of life is as elusive now as when he was a poor schoolboy growing up near Boston trudging the city streets and peddling bars of soap to buy food for his family Whats it all about he asks Whats the secret Why do we hate instead of loving each other How can we have a good world There are no answers he decided long ago but he still likes to search for lifes meaning in the faces of people he sees each workday as he walks the 38 blocks to his midtown office and home again And while he walks and wonders he also continues his 60yearold love affair with New York Isnt it a fabulous city he asks as he steps out hatless into the 31degree morning air from his Park Avenue residence As a concession to the weather he has folded a woolen scarf over his bow tie a Kaplan trademark and tucks it into his 20yearold coat Keep Moving Setting a 45secondablock pace he weaves expertly through snarled traffic  The trick is to keep moving holding up an imperious hand to halt a stream of taxis at an intersection and then sprinting across Briefly he breaks his stride to greet and exchange a bear hug with Howard J Samuels the onetime gubernatorial candidate who now heads Cities in Schools an urban education project They hold a sidewalk strategy session about procuring more philanthropic dollars to help minority youth He also slows long enough to show off another Kaplan discovery Here is the citys best bargain breakfast he announces turning into the General Motors Building where he frequently has his morning fare in the employee cafeteria for less than a dollar while enjoying a panoramic view of Madison Avenue A substantial segment of the Kaplan wealth made mainly from the Welch Grape Juice Company has been channeled through the J M Kaplan Fund into such civic projects as beautifying city parks creating the Mobilization for Youth program for the Lower East Side community establishing the South Street Seaport and rescuing Carnegie Hall when it was slated for demolition in 1960 The foundation also helped revitalize the 42d Street area and create Westbeth which launched the movement in Manhattan to provide artists with moderateincome housing Celebration at St Regis City officials friends and many others who have benefitted over the years from the Kaplan Fund will gather tomorrow night a bit early for a birthday party planned by his family Mr Kaplan was born Dec 23 1891 Its a day like any other day he says with a shrug but then concedes that he is touched that the family arranged to hold the affair at the St Regis where 56 years ago he and the former Alice Manheim were married She is one of the citys leading art patrons The New School for Social Research will use the occasion to rename its urban studies institute the Jacob M Kaplan Center for New York City Affairs He helped start the institute 17 years ago by providing most of the funds to build a ninestory extension adjoining the school property on West 12th Street There also are hints that Mayor Koch will have a surprise present All of life is a school  when we stop learning we stop living said Mr Kaplan whose formal education ended when he was 16 years old He spent the next 20 years making his first fortune in the molasses trade But his most gratifying business venture came later when he acquired a small grapeprocessing plant that led to the acquisition of the Welch concern in 1945 Thrill of His Life Along the way there were business powerplays for which he offers no apologies He noted that while many American business and industrial giants were known as robber barons because they seized land to build their railroads they also left a legacy of hospitals museums and other good works The thrill of his life he said was getting 2000 grape growers to organize as a cooperative and buy the Welch company Some did not understand or like the idea which he acknowledges was superimposed on a few but the undertaking prospered He used the 10 million paid by the growers to buy the company to set up the Kaplan Fund in 1956 He headed it until 1977 when he asked his daughter Joan K Davidson to take over the presidency The trustees in addition to Mr and Mrs Kaplan include his brother Henry and three other Kaplan children  Elizabeth K Fonseca Mary E Kaplan and Richard D Kaplan In the philanthropic community the Kaplan Fund has a reputation for innovative and sometimes controversial grants It was a leader in efforts in the 1950s to make trade unions more democratic and in recent years it has supported the right of women to choose to have an abortion The foundation listed its assets last year at 45 million and made 19 million in grants The fund and Mr Kaplans office have nearby offices and father and daughter confer frequently Thats quite a tie she says Bet you bought it on Orchard Street Delancey he replies The two do not always agree about the changing city scene Mrs Davidson is a preservationist Mr Kaplan has a passion for towering skyscrapers like the IBM and AT T buildings What do we do about it he says We negotiate
TEEN-AGE PREGNANCIES: PROFILES IN IGNORANCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/20/nyregion/teen-age-pregnancies-profiles-in-ignorance.html,Nicole is 18 years old and five months pregnant She is living with her boyfriends sister in Brooklyn but she and her boyfriend are breaking up and Nicole must find a new place to live She cries much of the time because she has no place to go and does not know what to do Nicoles father disappeared when she was 5 and her mother died when she was 7 She was brought up by her aunt but moved out when they had an argument and her aunt she said tried to choke me to death She has four other aunts all unmarried on welfare and brining up 13 children among them I cant go to them she said softly According to current estimates Nicole is one of about 33000 New York City teenagers who will give birth in the coming year More than a third of all babies born in New York City last year were illegitimate as were more than 75 percent of all births to teenage mothers More than a million American teenagers become pregnant every year Some have abortions a third of the 15 million abortions done annually in this country are performed on teenagers Other girls have babies and their lives will never be the same again Never Crossed My Mind Few expected such a thing could happen to them It just never crossed my mind that Id get pregnant Nicole said shaking her head When I found out I couldnt believe it It just seemed like it was a dream like it wasnt true I think I wound up getting pregnant because I felt I was wanted and cared for I just thought if Im close to somebody Id feel better Nobody in my family ever showed any love to me I want to be able to give my child the love I never had but I dont know if Ill know how Nicole was born out of wedlock when her mother was 18 Her mother one of nine children by four different fathers was illegitimate as well Like her mother and her grandmother before her Nicole has applied for welfare benefits I didnt want to be stuck on welfare like everyone else she said sounding disgusted with herself I wanted to work But she dropped out of school in the 10th grade There are complex reasons why so many young women find themselves having unplanned babies Experts in psychiatry education social welfare who deal with teenage pregnancy cite a wide range of influences from the psychological to the mechanical Young women from chaotic family backgrounds like Nicole may be particularly vulnerable to the desire to please a boyfriend When the boyfriend proves unreliable the need for another love object can become intense Genuine ignorance is a major factor I didnt even know about birth control said Miriam who had her son at 16 and her daughter two years later My mother wouldnt let me take sex education She used to say Oh no what you want to learn about sex for because thats the first thing youre going to do Learned Too Late My belly started growing and I didnt even know where the baby was I learned about everything when it was too late When I think about it sometimes I feel so angry If I would have known it would all have been so different Miriam had wanted to be an Air Force pilot she said but she dropped out of school in the ninth grade and now supports her children on welfare payments of 340 a month in an apartment on Manhattans Lower East Side Misinformation contributes to many pregnancies My friends told me the first time you do it you dont get pregnant said Pat a new mother at 17 I thought you had to do it a lot to get pregnant and I wasnt doing it that often said Callie who is 18 and lives in Harlem with her 20monthold son Fear of the Pill The ageold gap between intentions and reality also comes into play I wasnt sexually active when I met him and I didnt plan it said Brigitte 18 the mother of a 15monthold son I was getting ready to go use birth control but it happened too quickly But many girls know about sex and contraception and get pregnant anyway Some use birth control but not consistently Many reject the pill fearing it will make them fat or give them cancer Most complain about the inconvenience or inadequacy of existing birthcontrol methods The great majority simply assume they will be lucky Getting pregnant is just one of those things you feel will never happen to you said Robin a mother at 15 Fatalism is another factor I guess I figured that if it happened it just happened said Denise a 19yearold who is six months pregnant Pregnant by Choice Some young women insist they are pregnant by choice I wanted to get pregnant said Nadege 17 and two months pregnant I think its fun having a baby feeling grown knowing you can do whatever you want with the baby Although twothirds of all pregnancies among unmarried teenagers are unplanned 96 percent of all unwed mothers choose to keep their babies The lessening of social stigmas once attached to outofwedlock childbirth has made many pregnant young women less likely to view marriage as mandatory Some still marry because they are pregnant but others find marriage a more fearsome commitment than childbirth Im not ready for marriage said Stephanie a 21yearold mother living in the South Bronx with her 18monthold daughter Its bad enough to be young with a baby but young with a baby and a husband too would be worse Marriage is only for people who really know theyre going to do it and make it last If I was to marry my babys father I know it wouldnt work Whatever their fantasies about motherhood many young women discover that the reality can be grim According to a task force report on adolescent pregnancy prepared by the office of the City Council President Carol Bellamy 80 percent of all pregnant teenagers drop out of school Twothirds of young mothers end up on welfare after delivering their babies Some live with their own families with a mother or other relative helping to care for the infant Others struggle to manage alone with or without the aid of the babys father Staying Home Alone I mostly lost contact with all my friends Stephanie said We dont go out anymore Im always in and a lot of girls dont want to be with someone who has a baby When you have a child you aint free So Stephanie stays home alone with her child whom she named Chastity She does not know what the word means but she used to watch Sonny and Cher on television and since that is what they named their daughter Stephanie did the same The early months of motherhood can also bring disillusionment about men who fail to take responsibility for their babies He said he wanted it but he dont take care of it so I dont know why he wanted it Callie said After I had my baby he wasnt doing anything for me so I dont know how he expects me to have feelings for him I feel he should be taking care of it just as well as me but he aint so I got to take care of my son by myself Some girls say they are happy they had a child My baby is filling in a part of my life that was empty said Daphne 18 who has a sevenmonthold infant I feel like a whole person now Now that shes here and Im able to do for someone else instead of always having people do for me my life is more full I feel Ive grown up tremendously I had to But others say they wish they had made a different choice If I had it to do again I wouldnt have no child Stephanie said I dont think young girls should have a baby I know what Im going through and a lot of girls are younger than I am I would tell somebody to wait and think about it before you get yourself in this situation Some girls say Well I can handle it But you dont really know if you can until the baby gets there And then its too late
WOMAN OFF LIST FOR JUDGESHIP,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/24/us/woman-off-list-for-judgeship.html,Deputy Attorney General Edward Schmults confirmed Tuesday that Judith Whittaker 43 years old an associate general counsel for Hallmark Cards in Kansas City has been dropped as a candidate to fill a vacancy on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit in Kansas City But he denied that she had been dropped because of conservative Republicans opposition and said that the Justice Department was looking for another candidate because there was not enough broadbased support for Mrs Whittaker Mrs Whittaker was described in the newsletter New Right published by Richard Viguerie a conservative fundraiser as a strong feminist who favored abortion rights She refused to comment when reached by telephone today But in an interview published in todays issue of The Washington Post she said she had supported the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution but had never taken a position on the issue on abortion
Pennsylvania Governor Kills Measure to Restrict Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/25/us/pennsylvania-governor-kills-measure-to-restrict-abortion.html,Gov Dick Thornburgh has vetoed a comprehensive abortion bill that would have made it more difficult for women to have abortions in Pennsylvania In refusing Wednesday to sign the controversial bill Governor Thornburgh said it could have the effect of imposing an undue and in some cases unconstitutional burden on women seeking abortions He repeated his personal opposition to abortion on demand and said he agreed with many parts of the bill But he said several provisions conflicted with the United States Supreme Courts 1973 ruling that women are entitled to have abortions
GUN-CONTROL ADVOCATES ARE FEELING SURROUNDED,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/weekinreview/gun-control-advocates-are-feeling-surrounded.html,One of the darkest hours for handgun control advocates was the election of Ronald Reagan Suddenly with Mr Reagans inauguration the battle shifted from winning passage of stiffer handgun control legislation to trying to keep the conservative tide in Congress from sweeping away laws already on the books Gun control like abortion and busing is one of those emotional issues that Senate Republican leaders managed to keep off the legislative agenda in 1981 The New Right and its Congressional allies did not press these issues during Mr Reagans first year lest they divert attention from the Presidents economic program But in 1982 they will be demanding action on their priorities  including gun control For his part Mr Reagan a friend and member of the National Rifle Association has remained steadfast in his opposition to handgun control legislation despite the unsuccessful assassination attempt in March He announced plans to abolish the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms the enforcer of Federal firearms laws and endorsed a proposal to weaken the 1968 Gun Control Act Still the gloom pervading the handgun control movement seemed to lift recently when the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on the McClureVolkmer bill to repeal key provisions of the 1968 law  the nations major legislative attempt to control guns passed after the assassinations of the Rev Martin Luther King Jr and Senator Robert F Kennedy They lifted because the hearings proved to be a rerun of an old show Senator Charles E Grassley Republican of Iowa who received 65000 in campaign contributions from progun lobbies in 1980 was the only Senator to show up for the opening session By midday after he had excused himself a committee staff member had to take up the gavel because no Senator was present when Neal Knox an official of the National Rifle Association testified The absence of senators at the session was perhaps more understandable than significant The cast had few new faces the plot had not thickened and the testimony from handpicked witnesses added little to the debate In short the hearing had no bang There was Richard Boulin a former policeman from Monrovia Md telling how his 1977 conviction for illegally selling firearms from his private collection had made his life miserable There were Pat and Billie Hayes who own a gun shop in Basque Farms N M rehashing their 1977 experience with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Such witnesses have been regulars in Congressional hearings on the gun control issue In the past they were presented as lawabiding citizens who had suffered harassment at the hands of Federal agents With the Reagan Administrations announced intention to dismember the bureau and transfer its functions to the Secret Service and the United States Customs service they were brought back to play a new role in supporting the National Rifle Association and other lobbies in their assault on the 1968 law The act which handgun control advocates contend lacks the teeth to justify its name was a compromise bill that even the National Rifle Association backed at the time It requires the licensing of gun dealers and proof of identification by purchasers It also makes it easier to trace guns used in violent crimes and restricts the sale of guns to convicted felons and those with mental disorders According to handgun control organizations that oppose the bill the proposed Firearm Owner Protection Act drafted by Senator James A McClure Republican of Idaho and Representative Harold L Volkmer Democrat of Missouri would undo major provisions of the 1968 law Among other things it would limit Federal control of gun dealers eliminate restrictions on the interstate sale of firearms force the Government to pay attorney fees in firearms cases it loses require that the authorities prove that violators intended to break the law and make it easier for convicted felons to purchase guns With 57 cosponsors in the Senate and 166 in the House it might appear that the McClureVolkmer measures time has come Donald E Fraher legislative director of Handgun Control Inc is not so sure Support May Be Skin Deep I think support for the McClureVolkmer bill is a mile wide and a half inch deep he said It has fewer cosponsors than it did last year I think a lot of Senators and Congressmen signed on for political reasons not knowing what the bill would really do How can any member of Congress be in favor of making it easier for convicted felons to buy a gun when they get out of prison The Reagan Administration has endorsed the McClureVolkmer position even though President Reagans Task Force on Violent Crime recommended the adoption of measures to control the purchase of handguns including a waiting period and a ban on the importation of parts for the socalled Saturday Night Specials In the weeks ahead handgun control groups will try to change the political climate shifting the focus back to strengthening rather than weakening the 1968 law The House and Senate Judiciary subcommittees are planning to hold hearings on a Handgun Crime Control Bill sponsored by Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts and Representative Peter W Rodino Jr Democrat of New Jersey They will be the first Congressional hearings on a handgun control measure in almost six years And Congressional opponents of the White House plan to abolish the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms have already begun hearings to consider arguments that the bureaus enforcement functions should be transferred to the Justice Department instead of the Secret Service Its too early to tell which way things will go Mr Fraher said but I think if we can educate people on just what the McClureVolkmer bill does we have a chance of stopping it at least in its present form
ALMANAC IS ITSELF A RARE OCCURRENCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/nyregion/almanac-is-itself-a-rare-occurrence.html,SHARON WHEN asked Robert OBrien can without hesitating rattle off the names and locations of the highest peaks and the largest lakes in Connecticut He can also tell you how much money the Secretary of the State makes and advise you that Tom Thumb was not a dwarf but a midget and was not discovered in London but in Bridgeport by PT Barnum A passion for listmaking and a fascination with detail inspired Mr OBrien 18 months ago to begin compiling the first Connecticut almanac to appear in this century The 443page paperback book was released this month by Imprint a West Hartford publishing company The Connecticut Almanac according to the publisher is significant also because it one of the few books for which computerized video display terminals were used by an editor in a remote location to write lay out and typeset pages and transmit the completed material to the publishers offices via telephone Mr OBrien 49 years old is the founder and principal owner of Green Spring Inc a sevenyearold editorial organization that has offices in Sharon and New York City and prepares trade and professional reference books for publication His wife Joyce Inga OBrien is the deputy copy chief at Fortune magazine The couple owns a home in Sharon and maintains an apartment in New York During his 25year career as an author and editor Mr OBrien conceived and edited the McGrawHill Encyclopedia of World Drama in 1972 and cofounded Morningside Editorial Associates Inc a decade ago in Pleasantville NY As the editorinchief at Morningside the Roanoke Va native and Amherst College graduate produced The New York Times Crossword Puzzle Dictionary in 1974 and The Illustrated Dictionary of Place Names in 1976 But he had never done an almanac I sat down with the thought Oh this will be fun  he recalled He came to rue those words when he found for example that there was no easily obtainable list of Connecticuts mountains or rivers that included their heights or lengths Another obstacle was the refusal of some of the states 169 towns to respond to the questionnaires he had sent about the number of schools and libraries in the towns or the types of health services or waste removal available there We pleaded with the towns that didnt reply sending them five different followup letters said Mr OBrien As a result all but about 10 towns in the almanac have complete listings An almanac is most often thought to be a book containing a calendar of days weeks and months astronomical and meteorological data and such folkloric fare as how to predict the severity of a winter by examining the coat of a caterpillar In short almanacs have been traditionally considered to be books that every man uses but no man praises according to Mr OBrien With the intent to provide the reader with more than just facts and figures the editor assigned to his associate editor Lynn Prindle of Falls Village or to a pair of freelance writers or to himself two dozen articles on subjects ranging from submarines to gypsy moths and on issues from abortion to gun control Then he scattered the articles among the more traditional almanac data on town populations birth and death rates and daily temperatures Theres no reason he declared why a book just because its a reference book should pull a long face Mr OBrien said he tried to make some figures such as the states estimated per capita income more interesting by comparing them with similar statistics in other states and countries For example the almanac notes that the estimated per capita personal income of Liechtenstein and Saudi Arabia and of California and Wyoming are within 1000 of Connecticuts estimated per capital personal income of 11770 Mr OBrien took particular pleasure he said in entering amusing and offbeat items There is the story of Adonijah Maxam one of four Sharon men who after fighting in Montreal with Ethan Allen in 1775 were taken prisoner by the British and transported in chains to England Mr Maxam was singled out said the editor as an example of the kind of boorish bumpkin that the English felt was typical of the Colonial Yankees I think that one may shock some of our more venerable Sharon citizens said Mr OBrien An article about PT Barnum is more than a brief biographical sketch of the Bethelborn showman It includes anecdotes that demonstrate Mr Barnums contention that theres a sucker born every minute In order to keep the crowds moving through the exhibits in his traveling show according to the almanac Mr Barnum posted signs that read This Way to the Egress Eager to view this presumably strange and exotic exhibit the throngs would push through the door labeled Egress  and find themselves in the street Mr OBriens favorite almanac entry is titled A Chronological Assessment of the Life of Benedict Arnold with Moral Considerations and Annotations and written in the style of Henry Fielding the 18thcentury English novelist noted for political satire Boldfaced type is used to signify Mr Arnolds patriotic deeds italic capital type represents the more unscrupulous activities of the Norwich native and bold italics are assigned to those acts which simply confound the mind for their arrogance and audacity Writing the Arnold piece said Mr OBrien was pure unadulterated fun The editors future projects include The Encyclopedia of Alcoholism which is scheduled for publication next year and a companion volume The Encyclopedia of Drug Abuse He hopes that the Connecticut Almanac will be the first in a series of state almanacs that he would revise and update each year That the book which at 995 is available through Imprint and in some bookstores may be regarded by some people as a correction of Connecticut trivia is inevitable he observed If anything he said the almanac will be a great bet prover
RELATIONSHIPS; AFTERMATH OF GENETIC ANOMALIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/28/style/relationships-aftermath-of-genetic-anomalies.html,The psychiatrist assigned to the genetics counseling program at Presbyterian Hospital was describing some of the anguish that his work entails In a psychiatric clinic people have the basic feeling that there is something wrong with them he said But you tell them we can work it through and you will be feeling better about yourself  In a genetics counseling clinic people who consider themselves quite normal must sometimes be told Yes there is something wrong with you and it is in every cell of your body Such a realization can be devastating he said Every day genetic counseling clinics which are available at most major medical centers there are 20 in the New York metropolitan area see the effects on marriages of the birth of a severely defective child They watch parents agonize over whether to have other children They observe the pressures that arise when a couple must decide whether or not to terminate a pregnancy They hear about the effects on family life of keeping a child with certain disorders at home And they know all about the guilt that haunts parents who institutionalize such a child If a relationship was on a solid basis it may withstand such a crisis Dr Goldstein said But if there are other underlying problems they are often exacerbated Depending on where the couple was emotionally it can become a tension sufficient to break up a marriage Learninng the facts possibilities and the odds through genetic counseling however may reduce tension and anxiety and help the couple evaluate the risk and make the decisions Modern blood biochemical and cytogenetic studies as well as sonar technology and amniocentesis in which a sample of the amniotic fluid is taken and analyzed make it possible to do some predicting Besides parents who want to avoid the recurrence of birth defects genetic counseling clinics see those who have had difficulty conceiving repeated miscarriages a family history of genetic conditions or those who have used some potentially harmful substances during pregnancy In recent years they have been counseling increasing numbers of women over 35 who have an added risk of bearing children with chromosomal abnormalities the most common being Downs syndrome or Mongolism Women with careers are starting families later and they want to know what the chances are before they conceive said Dr Robert C Wallach director of obstetrics and gynecology at Beth Israel Medical Center who works closely with the centers division of medical genetics If she is already pregnant and if the cell studies indicate Downs syndrome then the family can plan a course of action In Downs the absolute diagnosis is made There are no odds Dr Wallach emphasized that in the majority of cases no abnormalities are found However when they are an often painful decision must be made We never recommend that a pregnancy be terminated Dr Wallach said But the vast majority of such couples choose abortion They are facing a nowin situation The child would have a life expectancy of 20 or 21 years They would invest a tremendous amount of emotional energy and not get the satisfaction that most of us feel is their right If the pregnancy is not terminated the parents face the decision about bringing the baby home where perhaps there are other children Those children are going to get it in school every day he said Kids are merciless about those things But the cost of institutionalization can permanently damage the financial stability of the family besides the anguish and guilt involved Religious and cultural factors also enter into the picture There are people who feel that no matter what the outcome they could not abort a pregnancy Dr Wallach explained For those people the counseling is available but seldom used And Dr Goldstein pointed out that In certain cultures the woman is always to blame No matter what the counselor says the belief is that if there is something wrong with a child it is the mothers fault Prenatal diagnosis can reveal other kinds of chromosomal variations according to Dr Hyon Ju Kim chief of medical genetics at Beth Israel Then counseling becomes more equivocal she added Risks cannot be clearlyevaluated Such abnormalities were found in a 38yearold woman who had been referred to the clinic because of her age In the course of counseling the nature of the diagnosis was discussed  and the uncertainties The couple found the decision on whether to terminate the pregnancy extremely difficult Dr Kim said that they were intelligent and understood all the facts but were disturbed by the moral implications of an abortion When they did end the pregnancy they went through a long period of mourning An abnormal child can be born unexpectedly Dr Kim said Two perfectly normal healthy people can produce a child with Tay Sachs disease Their reaction is why us There is denial and anger at oneself and toward the spouse and there is depression Counseling can help such couples come to terms with their reactions Dr Kim said And it helps to inform them that none of us are genetically perfect that they are not so different from the rest of us
SCIENCE WATCH; Silicon Mystery Solved,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/29/science/science-watch-silicon-mystery-solved.html,Chemists have isolated and characterized a new silicon compound a bright orangeyellow crystalline solid known as tetramesityldisilene And in so doing they said that they solved a mystery that has puzzled scientists for more than half a century Silicon closely resembles carbon the element on which all known life is based The two elements act alike in forming molecular chains and rings But carbon atoms readily make multiple bonds among themselves and with other elements yielding the great variety of carbon compounds found in natural and manmade substances But silicon chemistry has found no such doubly bonded compounds A graduate student in chemistry at the University of Wisconsin at Madison has now succeeded where so many others failed Mark J Fink while conducting experiments at the University of Utahs lowtemperature facilities prepared the new silicon compound in which two silicon atoms share a double bond Mr Fink and the two chemistry professors who directed the research Dr Robert West of Wisconsin and Dr Josef Michl of Utah reported the achievement in the Dec 18 issue of the journal Science In the synthesis a colorless silicon material is cooled nearly to absolute zero The material turns blue when irradiated with ultraviolet light then is transformed into an orangeyellow substance as it is warmed The residual crystalline solid is stable and contains siliconsilicon double bonds resembling those of carbon The new compound could be a turning point in silicon chemistry which lies at the heart of the electronics industry Numerous other doublebonded silicon compounds will probably be made the scientists said by using the same techniques Unlovey Doves The affectionate way in which a mated pair of doves bill coo and almost always keep close company has long been held up as the perfect paradigm of a caring association between paired males and females But a longterm study of dove relationships by a Duke University psychologist now indicates that such appearances can be deceiving Dr Carl J Erickson found in many cases that a male dove would seldom let a fertile partner out of his sight but when fertility was ended he would spend hours away from the nest Dr Erickson also noted that males were reluctant to mate with widowed females He suggested that the evolutionary reason for the reluctance was that if the male mated with the widow he would be more likely to raise young fathered by another male and hence produce fewer offspring of his own Other studies also indicated that the closeness of mated doves represented male tactics to insure that the female would not produce young by another male Abortion Consequences Despite its legal and medical acceptance as a means of preventing unwanted births abortion even early in pregnancy is not an innocuous procedure for the mother Sometimes subtle damage done during a first trimester abortion can interfere with future desired pregnancies Complications previously identified include an increased risk of miscarriage and premature delivery bleeding during pregnancy and retained placenta after delivery Now physicians at Vanderbilt University report that women who have had first trimester abortions are more likely to suffer a complication called placenta previa in which the placenta is attached near the entrance to the womb instead of behind the fetus The result is often premature labor and excessive bleeding and a Caesarian delivery may be necessary Placenta previa raises the risk of stillbirth prematurity hemorrhage in the mother and death of the newborn Reporting in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology Dr Jeffrey M Barrett and his colleagues note that those women who had previously had a first trimester abortion faced a 21 percent risk of placenta previa compared to only a 03 percent risk for otherwise comparable women with no history of abortion The authors suggest that suction or curettage of the uterus during abortion may damage the lining of the womb and interfere with proper attachment of the placenta in future pregnancies
"'TEST-TUBE' BABY BORN IN U.S., JOINING SUCCESSES AROUND THE",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/29/science/test-tube-baby-born-in-us-joining-successes-around-the.html,WORLD By WALTER SULLIVAN FOR the first time a testtube baby conceived in a laboratory dish has been born in an American hospital Elizabeth Jordan Carr weighing 5 pounds 12 ounces and described as perfectly healthy was delivered yesterday morning at Norfolk General Hospital in Norfolk Va The birth which came two weeks ahead of schedule brings to at least 15 the number of babies born in this manner The rest were in Britain and Australia although one was born to American parents in England About 100 women have become pregnant through the same procedure five of them in the United States At least five American clinics are treating infertile women in this way but so far with meager success Nevertheless reliability seems to be improving rapidly The time when it becomes standard treatment for several causes of infertility may be drawing near The Dec 5 issue of the British medical journal Lancet suggests editorially that the procedure may become simple and reliable enough to be handled as a daycare and outpatient service The parents of the newborn baby are Judith Carr a 28yearold schoolteacher and her husband Roger Carr 30 of Westminster Mass The technique known medically as in vitro in glass fertilization and called colloquially test tube conception was conducted at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk by Dr Howard Jones and his colleagues who were the first to try it in the United States An egg cell removed from Mrs Carr was fertilized in a laboratory dish with sperm from her husband The resulting embryo was then inserted into her womb for normal gestation and birth The procedure is designed to overcome the inability of some womens Fallopian tubes to transport to the uterus the egg cell released each month from one ovary Fertilization normally occurs en route as sperm and egg meet in the tube As many as half a million American women are believed sterile because of this condition To bypass this impediment an almost mature egg cell is removed surgically and incubated for five or six hours in a special fluid Then sperm from the husband are added and after 12 to 23 hours the egg is examined If fertilization has occurred the resulting embryo is cultured for a number of hours  typically 40 to 50 by which time it has subdivided into four or eight microscopic cells The embryo is then blown into the womb via a tube inserted through the cervix in the hope that it will attach itself to the wall of the womb and develop normally The first successful birth by this procedure that of Louise Brown in England on July 25 1978 was a triumph for Dr Robert Edwards a specialist in female physiology at Cambridge University and Dr Patrick Steptoe an obstetrician who had developed the eggremoval procedure As in yesterdays birth delivery was by Caesarian section The parents John and Lesley Brown are expecting a second child by the same method Dr Steptoe has recently reported that 70 pregnancies have been achieved in Britain although six did not progress beyond the stage of preliminary hormonal changes A few weeks ago a sixth in vitro child was born in his clinic In Australia 20 to 30 pregnancies have been achieved In Norfolk Dr Jones has reported four pregnancies including the one ending in yesterdays birth and another that may produce twins At the Los Angeles CountyUniversity of Southern California Hospital a birth is expected in June after some 30 attempted embryo insertions by Dr Richard Marrs According to Dr Alan H DeCherney of the Yale University Medical School in New Haven 11 embryo inserts had been performed there when the project was suspended last fall for a move to new quarters The Yale physicians followed the procedure that led to the early successes of Drs Steptoe and Edwards monitoring the approach of egg cell maturation by repeatedly analyzing the womans urine for luteinizing hormone Its level typically surges 24 to 28 hours before the egg is ready None of the embryos in New Haven took hold When the project is resumed in February it is planned to follow a procedure favored in Australia The woman is first treated with a substance that induces maturation of more than one egg cell A hormone from the urine of pregnant women human chorionic gonadotropin is then administered to control the time 32 hours later when the eggs are ready for removal Such precise timing makes it possible to have a full medical staff in readiness The egg removal takes only a few minutes A hollow needle is inserted through the abdominal wall and the egg cell sucked from its nest or follicle on the surface of the ovary Timing is critical If the egg becomes fully ripe and is ejected before removal it is lost When taken too early it does not mature If in response to drug treatment more than one egg is produced retrieved fertilized and inserted the chances are greater that at least one will attach itself and mature Several pregnancies have involved twins The group at USC is using hormone control as are physicians at the University of Texas Medical Center in Houston where two groups are trying embryo inserts A third team is doing so at the University of Texas in San Antonio as are groups in London and in Melbourne and Sydney Australia Some American medical centers conducting or planning the procedure are reportedly avoiding publicity Last week it was announced that plans to establish a clinic at the Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo NY had been canceled because a hospital spokesman said of ethical and pragmatic considerations A few days earlier press reports had quoted Bishop Edward D Head of the Roman Catholic diocese of Buffalo as opposing the procedure as depersonalizing The project was to have been directed by Dr Jack Lippes a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the State University of New York in Buffalo He said last week 85 patients had applied for the treatment The procedure is controversial also because only embryos that appear to be developing normally are inserted The rest are discarded a procedure equivalent to abortion in the eyes of some opponents Defenders of the procedure argue that threequarters of naturally conceived embryos are aborted half of them silently when swept out with the first monthly discharge They propose that physicians if it is within their power should enable sterile couples to bear their own children According to the Lancet editorial one normal birth is now being achieved for every 10 to 15 embryo transfers It predicts a substantial improvement in this success rate and points out that the procedure can also be used to overcome sterility where the husbands sperm count is low or the womans reproductive tract is hostile to his sperm Dr Edwards recently reported that at present between onequarter and twofifths of the implanted fetuses die in the womb In one case such a naturally aborted fetus was found to be carrying a triplet of chromosomes instead of the normal pair Such genetic defects most often arise he said from the egg being fertilized by two sperm This it is widely agreed should occur rarely from in vitro fertilization where the number of sperm given access to the egg can be limited Nevertheless Dr Edwards recommended that in all in vitro pregnancies fluid should be withdrawn from the womb to be tested for genetic defects An international registry has been established for pooling information gained from in vitro efforts In the Journal of the American Medical Association of Aug 9 Dr Gary D Hodgen chief of the Pregnancy Research Branch of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development cited some of the difficulties still to be overcome Embryos he pointed out develop more slowly in vitro than in their natural environment As a result the mothers womb reaches the proper stage of receptivity before the embryo is ready for insertion Dr Hodgen told of efforts in his institute using monkeys to find more natural alternatives that also eliminate the lag in embryo growth One simulates a situation found in some sterile women in which the upper part of the Fallopian tube is blocked but the lower part is intact An egg cell is extracted and inserted into the lower part of the tube for normal fertilization Dr Hodgen reported an encouraging 16 percent success rate In another technique the egg after removal and fertilization is placed in a tiny capsule for insertion into the body cavity The capsule permits body fluids there to penetrate and reach the embryo It has been discovered Dr Hodgen said that these fluids promote normal growth of the embryo whereas the chemical environment of the uterus is hostile to the newly fertilized embryo The Australians have reported achieving a pregnancy by inserting an embryo at only the twocell stage If their experience is repeatable the timing problem might be resolved On the other hand if the chemical hostility of the uterus could be neutralized it might be possible to insert an egg cell immediately after extraction and allow it to be fertilized normally

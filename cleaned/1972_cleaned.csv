Colleges Expand Modern Psychiatric Aid,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/01/archives/colleges-expand-modern-psychiatric-aid-colleges-expand-modern.html,The college health service long viewed by students as good only for doling out aspirin patching up athletes and diag nosing the common cold is now emerging as a leading counsel ing and treatment center for student sex and psychiatric problems While the majority of cam pus health centers still main tain a conservative in loco parentis approach to student health dozens of them at large and small schools around the country have begun to provide such modern services as sex counseling contraception abor tion referral venereal disease treatment and help with drug and psychiatric problems The trend has generated sur prisingly little controversy partly because administrators believe that such services are important to the students effec tive functioning and partly be cause parents seem glad to be A number of universitiesfrom the University of Cali fornia at Berkeley to the Uni versity of Nebraska and Prince tonare involved in the trend A new health plan at Yale Uni versity represents what many consider to be the epitome of the revolution in the scope and of services offered to college students Since July 1 Yale students faculty members employes and their families have been served by a prepaid group practice housed in a new 55million health center that offers a veri ices including obstetrics pe diatrics and sex therapy of the Masters and Johnson type In partial explanation of this approach Dr Daniel S Rowe the jackofalltrades pediatri cian who oversees the opera tion said in an interview the other day We feel the uni versity should be a pioneer in delivering new methods of medical care He said that dozens of groups had visited the new center and he received letters daily from other uni versities inquiring about Yales program At Yale as at dozens of other colleges around the coun try much of the innovation in student health care has come in sexrelated areas to meet needs created by changes in student life styles and mores Yales sexrelated services date to 1969the first year of coeducation Dr and Mrs Philip Sarrel a gynecologist and a social worker respec tively who were the innova tors in this area estimate that they have since been visited by 75 per cent of Yales under graduate women Vasectomies Available Yale like many other large universities has for several years been supplying students with the morningafter pill for emergency contraception as well as with a wide variety of more conventional birth con trol aids This fall Yale added vasectomies to its list of avail able options In addition to Dr Sand who works out of the mental hygiene department Yale em ploys one fulltime and four parttime gynecologists and a nursemidwife Yale is Just one of dozens of colleges across the country that have recently hired gynecolo gists at least on a parttime basis Several schools have also opened birth control clinics At the University of Califor nia Berkeley the contraceptive clinic that opened two years ago is visited by 4000 to 6000s students a year The University of Nebraska handles 50 to 60 contraceptive cases each week even with a charge of 15 each New York University is sched uled to open a contraceptive clinic soon Changing Times Cited The University of Michigan set up a separate gynecology clinic last fall which was visted by 900 students in Sep tember And at Boston Uni versity a gynecologist who was hired in October to work six hours a week is already booked UD months in advance In explaining his hiring of a gynecologist Dr Samuel E Leard Bostons director of stu dent health services said It was done in recognition of changing timesif you start having dorms wide open it adds to problems along gyne cological lines Barnards director Dr Harri ette Mogul said her service offered birth control and abor tion referrals because we would rather have the informa tion dispensed here where we are sure of its accuracy than have our students search on their own There has been surprisingly little parental opposition to de cisions like Barnards When similar program at the Uni versity of California Los An geles was described to parents of entering freshman last sum mer the reaction was highly favorable One father re marked Thank God the pill is there for my daughters pro tection The smooth introduction of contraception at the University of Michigan was aided in an unusual way by the student newspaper The Michigan Daily Fearing that publicizing of the fact that contraceptives were being given to minors would stir up opposition among the conservative Board of Regents the newspaper chose not to run a story on the contraceptive clinic Student reaction to these changes in service have been mixed While most are grateful to have something available many complain about the long waits for appointments to see the gynecologist and in some cases about the high cost Duke University charges 25 for a pelvic examination and birth control prescription at UCLA the cost which includes an educational session is 22 Several institutions strapped by a tight Midget for student health found that charging for contraceptive services even though other health services are free was the only way they could be made available At Princeton where the uni versity pays the cost of student visits to three local gynecolo gists one coed remarked Theres a general feeling that the examination is cursory and that the doctors dont really care Theyre just there to dis pense contraceptives Most institutions offer preg nancy testing without charge and a number of colleges offer some sort of abortion counsel ing usually in the form of re ferral to agencies with the necessary contacts At the University of Georgia one coed who turned to the health service when she found herself with an unwanted preg nancy said They really helped me through a terrible tune They really seemed like they cared and you know think they really did At the same time that college health services have upgraded services related to students physical wellbeing they have also done much to expand and improve the care given to emo tional health Nearly all of the three dozen colleges questioned repented they had recently et panded their psychiatric staff Pressures Are Eased The University of Colorado is one of several that now has a campus psychiatrist on call nights and weekends Dr James E Marquardt who administers the Colorado health center said Such aroundtheclock service is necessary because suicide is the second most fre quent cause of death In the college age group Michigan State University maintains seven branches of its counseling service around cam pus so that students with emo tional problems can find help more easily Many institutions also train dormitory counselors to handle uncomplicated prob lems Barnards psychological unit recently went to battle for some students who were anxi ous about a freshman English composition assignment that in volved writing a personalessay that was then attacked by the instructor When we recog nize an unfair university pres sure we try to get it cor rected Dr Mogul explained For the most part drug related problems are handled within the general psychiatry program Although many col leges have drug education pro grams few have organized drug treatment facilities City College of Nevi York was re cently awarded a 50000 grant from the City University to hire two drug counselors and estab lish a drug abuse program Most of these improvements in college health services have come about despite a shortage of funds and even though de livery of health care is not the raison detre of an educational institution At some colleges he changes were prompted by student pressure at others they were initiated by new enlightened administrators who attracted young dedicated staffs For generations college health services have tended to be staffed by older mengen eral practitioners who want partly to retire from preasures of private practice When 37yearold Dr John R Curtis took over at the University of Georgia three years ago the average age of the four doctors on the staff was 65 Most of the two dozen staff members added since are 20 or more years younger Dr Marquardt at Colorado remarked More doctors are finding the college campus stimulating and more younger doctors are now coming to work at college centers Dr Mogul at Barnard noted that doctors were beginning to see the campus health center as  a chance to help young people develop a good doctor patient relationship in what is for many of them their frist experience with a doctor on their own Its an exciting field with potential far doing very good things she added Top Metal Start At Yale where 9000 stu dents and 9000 other members of the college community al ready belong to the new health plan Dr Rowe said Medical ly speaking students are just not very interesting Theyre just too healthy Doc tors tend to view the job more as a babysitting operation than a stimulating medical service However by including pa tients from infancy to old age Dr Rowe believes Yale has found a goad way to attract a top notch medical staff Despite he obvious progress made at many institutions stu dents still find plenty of cause for complaning about the qual ity of care Just as all dormi tory food is automatically la beled garbage students have a hard time finding a good word to say about college health care Although some of their com plaints have the ring of truth many reflect a basic lack of understanding of what medi cine can and should do Stu dents find it hard to accept the fact that there is still noth ing more than symptomatic relief for the flu and common cold As Dr Rowe pointed out At college the student needs mother substitute to tell him when to gargle and stay in bed
My Life and Times By Henry Miller. Illustrated. 208 pp. New York: Playboy Press. $17.95.,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/02/archives/my-life-and-times-by-henry-miller-illustrated-208-pp-new-york.html,I have spent a sedative summer rereading most of Henry Miller Sedative Yes inevitably since its the fate of all revolutionary writers to encompass their own supersession How shocking Tropic of Cancer was when I got hold of a smuggled copy in the late thirties how merely charming it is now redolent of Paris in which the coffee and Gauloises were alike more aromatic than theyve been since the war a genuine vie de Boheme the physical act of love as fresh as if the French had just invented it Miller unbuttoned the fly and tore open the placket with a fiercer gust than Lawrence who was still mothers boy or Joyce who let language get in the way Todays naked generation has learned nearly everything from himeverything that is to say except his bookishness his capacity for recapturing innocence his sense of wonder his sense of words I remember when fiist reading Burroughss Naked Lunch feeling that one particular element in the junkie nightmare representedfor me at leastthe limit in the erotically shocking A man copulates with another mans skull but first he has to drill a hole in it Shocking but perhaps appropriately merely cerebrally shocking Amusing even the sort of example of the shocking one might give in a lecture A lot of the shocks administered by todays youthful news sheets are of this order Were now permitted to shock so lets get on with it what shall we shock with today This is the consequence of Millers opening the door Needless to say it was not what he intended For all that the Tropics and The Rosy Crucifixion try to do in the erotic arena is to convey the simple gross pleasures of straightforward heterosexual coition This had never really been done before in direct language Rabelais makes joke of it Boccaccio uses elegant metaphor Those wearisome Victorian chronicles of prowess possess detail but lack gusto And to be honest if no literary man had tried it before on the Millerian scale and with the Millerian intensity it was because there was the gnaw of scruple Is one telling the truth about copulation if one merely describes its mechanics Miller has never had any doubt that one is and unfortunately he shares this view with the pornographers But Miller himself has never written pornography For pornography depersonalizes creating an abstract paradise Steven Marcus called Pornotopia in which the only emotion is lust and the only event orgasm and the only inhabitants animated phalluses and vulvae In Millers books there are real people with guns in their handbags need for money a habit of writing poetry on the wall while the act proceeds an appetite for big meals afterward and very frequently a temporary resistance to love Is love the right word In French yes with Miller whose origins are German there are sometimes temptations to submit to Goetbean transports which get in the wat of pure amour Miller himself is always present naked but a thinking man who reads and writes books capable of prodigious engorgements but never viewing himself as a synechdochepart for the whole Heavily erotic yes but pornographic never Many women dislike his books especially the militant Donna Giovannas like vengeful Brigid Brophy who goes so far in her essay on Miller as to cast doubt on his basic sexual endowment They are right I think because though Miller respects ladies like Anas Nin he cannot help making woman the sexual instrument come before woman the human entity He is very ingenuous in saying that he has never thought of women as just that he always looked for something else as well His autobiographical books  which means all his booksdeliver a little too much contempt for womenthe classic postcoital tristitia which the boorish or the puritanical transfer to the object of spent desire a vestigial Victorian horror that women should actually like sex quite as much as men if not more Still at 80 he goes on loving women and the number of his wives though not up to patriarchal standards compares well with an average film stars His present wife is Japanese and he is very fond of her as of her Japanese friends some of whom live with her them him To call Miller a glorifier of the phallus and a chronicler of phallic events is not enough There is more to his long autobiography than sex Black Spring is I think one of the finest evocations of low urban life in all American literature I am a patriot says Miller of the Fourteenth Ward Brooklyn where I was raised The rest of the United States doesnt exist for me except as idea or history or literature The patriotism is expressed in an almost myopically close rendering of a world of cancer dropsy cirrhosis of the liver insanity thievery mendacity buggery incest paralysis tapeworms abortions triplets idiots drunkards neerdowells fanatics sailors tailors watchmakers scarlet fever whooping cough meningitis running ears chorea stutterers jailbirds dreamers storytellers bartenders  and finally there was Uncle George and Tante Melia Though he disavows either a literary aim or a learned technique Miller belongs to the logorrheal tradition of Rabelais and Sterne as does Burroughs He becomes a wordy bore only when he finds it necessary to prophesy that great American disease we can call vatism is in him as it is in Dahlberg and even Mailer When Miller starts talking about Love not amour feel like giving him a few francs to go to a brothel But of course there is no need to do this We come sooner rather than later to lechery as juicy as roast pork and Kartoffellelosze If we require elevation from Miller then we can best get it in his Hellenic phase He is curiously German in having found an almost hyperbolic fulfillment in GreeceReal home real climate he notesand the best testimony to its moderating cleansing unclotting influence is to be found in his The Colossus of Maroussi But the war sent him back to America and the destiny of sage of Big Sur Now he appears to be one of Americas gloriesfulfilled with 50 books behind him his 80th birthday last Sunday Boxing Day two of his works filmed stupidly confused with skinflicks and the Playboy tribute of this picture book Miller talking his life instead of writing it he has written it already There are already cynics and admirers who are saying that the book should be called My Life and Hardon Times The erotic motif is imposed on some of the photographs  cheaply and irrelevantly The old man is shown apparently trying to eat the bosom of the Israeli actress Ziva Rodann He plays pingpong with a callipygous nude girl He sits at a table and looks up in a kind of puzzled but gratified wonder as a pair of fine impertinent breasts moon down on him But there are photographs of Miller serious with hat and spectacles on and Lawrence Durrell horsing about with a false moustache and wives and friends and Paris There are also re productions of Millers paintings one of the best things in all his writing is his account in Black Spring of learning how to draw which are endearingly bright and fin de sidele Finally there is Miller talking about himself and giving us all hope A cigarettesmoking gindrinking octogenarian he is a fine advertisement for the longevital virtues of regular sex But the book is a mere plaything or playboy thing in no wise a fitting summation a glossy toy that might lull the reader into not taking Miller as seriously as he ought Miller has spent a long industrious life grinding slow and exceeding fine also coarse He is a world literary figure and it is proper to ask whereapart from the longbanned candorhis achievement lies With whom shall we compare himLawrence Joyce Beckett He is not as important as any of these because he has not created a world that is recognizably his own He has not really created at all He lacks archi tectonic skill a making or shaping drive He has had only one real subjecthimselfand he has not been prepared or endowed with the ability to convert himself into a great fictional myth Called a novelist by some he has the novelists ear and eye but not the novelists power to create great separable artifacts He has done what any man with his endowments and deficiencies is forced to do produce autobiography that begs at the door of fiction Durrell thinks that Millers lifework is the best confessional writing since Rousseau He is probably right but frank selfexposure was only one small part of Rousseaus achievement there were The Social Contract Emile and The New Heloise as well Moreover the things that Miller confesses are somewhat limited He is honest but no subtle thinker we conceive no joy in engaging a personality so lacking in complexity The sensibility is somewhat coarse and there is an ingenuousness which though often charming charms less the more often we meet it I have been rereading Gibbons Autobiography as a foil to Miller and the intellectual excitement of the experience has inevitably shriveled up the phallic and visceral appeal of the Tropics and those productions with the schocilboy names Seams Plexus and Nexus There is humor as well as physical honesty but there is not one ounce of wit George Orwell paid a fine tribute to Miller asking his readers of the thirties to note in Tropic of Cancer what even at that late date could still be done with the English language Orwell saw in Miller what many of us saw thena liberating force a cleanser of the dialect Of the tribe But how much more_cleansing and liberating was Orwell himself who in Down and Out in Paris and London converted into art the sufferings and low life he shared with Miller and then before dying in his early 40s raioduced genuide prophecy Industry and longevity are no substitute for genius
A Church Is Threatened With Prosecution Over Sex Education,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/02/archives/a-church-is-threatened-with-prosecution-over-sex-education.html,BROOKFIELD Wis Jan 1A Unitarian church in this Milwaukee suburb has been threatened with criminal prosecution because of the explicit nature of a sex education course that has not yet started In a letter to the church this week District Attorney Richard McConnell of Waukesha County] said that if the church started the program without first establishing ground rules with this office prosecution could result Mr McConnell said that he was concerned with what may be a violation of the Wisconsin obscenity statutes The Unitarian Church West] announced details of a 40week course for its Sunday school] curriculum three weeks ago The course is scheduled to start In February with a limit of 15 students 12 to 14 years old Boys and girls are to take the course together Birch Society Strong The course has aroused considerable opposition in this middleclass suburb where sex education in the public schools has been fought and where conservative groups including the John Birch Society are strong Petitions opposing the church course have been signed by 514 persons and filed with the Brookfield City Council but the council has not yet decided whether or not it could intervene in the matter Mr McConnell said that he saw no legal barrier in taking action against the church He said that while the Constitulion provides freedom of religious instruction nobody can hide behind it The Rev Robert C A Moore minister of the church said that he doubted if the state could stop the program but that he would meet with Mr McConnell next week The course entitled About Your Sexuality was prepared by the Unitarian Universalist Association Which has its headquarters in Boston and has been used in some other Unitarian churches in the country Mr Moore said he knew of no similar opposition elsewhere Film Shows Intercourse Many of the criticisms of the course are apparently aimed at la film strip that shows couples having intercourse Defending the film strip booklet for the course states that the omission of explicitly sexual visuals serves to enhance the concept of sex as dirty sinful and forbidden The film strip was not part of the course when it was used by the other Unitarian churches The course here also includes explicit film strips on male and female anatomy homosexual behavior and masturbation The course treats homosexuality as a valid form of sexual expression describing it as one viable life pattern It emphasizes that a person can experience homosexual attraction and contact without being considered a true homosexual The course also encourages masturbation as a beneficial way of relieving sexual tensions stating that it protects young people from leaping into a sexual experience with partners whom they do not love just to satisfy their sexual needs Birth Control Discussed In other phases of the course birth control is to be discussed with information on the variety of methods by which conception can be prevented and abortion conception childbirth and venereal disease are to be described Mr Moore said the course was designed to teach sex with frank honesty You have to be as frank and complete as you can be or the kids wont listen Mr Moore said Youve got to show it to lay it out Then when they say Whats wrong with sex before marriage you can say Well this is one reason and the kids will listen The men and women instructors have spent up to 60 hours learning how to teach the course he said Mr Moore said the course was designed to allow children to develop and clarify their own values and attitudes about sex so that sexuality could be integrated into their whole personalities He said that the sex act was only part of this We probably spend more time discussing why girls cant play Little League baseball he said
"Don't Call Them ‘Rev. and Mrs.’ Church's Pastor, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/05/archives/dont-call-them-rev-and-mrs-shes-churchs-pastor-too.html,SCRANTON PaThere are two pastors at the 600member Trinity Congregational Church here They take turns preaching on alternate Sundays share the neighbpring rectory and receive equal salary checks and pension payments They also think alike on most subjects although their approach is often quite different At one time their dissimilarities were a source of concern Now after five months in their first parish John and Barbara Gerlach Mack realize that although man and wife they are also individuals reflecting the plurality of life rather than a united front We have very much the same viewpoint but we have different styles of doing things different areas of expertise and different ways of meeting people said Barbara Mack a 25yearold Hood College graduate who chose religion over teaching after spending summer at a Presbyterian conference center in New Mexico To 29yearold John Mack who grew up in New Canaan Conn in the midst of everything a lot of people work to get to the differences in style and character traits have proved invaluable Persons meeting us would hook up with us very differently he said Barbara lets things happen better than do I have to organize things The Macks who met while both were studying at Union Theological Seminary were graduated last May and took over their United Church of Christ congregation here in August Mr Mack was brought up in the United Church of Christ Mrs Mack was raised as a Presbyterian Both agree that acceptance by the parishioners most of whom are of Welsh background has been wonderful The copastors are involved in every service When one preaches the other conducts prayers and childrens sermons and makes announcements There has been no discernible difference in attendance between the two by the 250 active churchgoers in the congregation  I have a feeling though that some people cant hear me as well as they can hear John Mrs Mack said They feel John has more authority but I really sense that more and more people are with me as we continue One or two say Yon preach better than John Which she does Mr Mack interjected Barbaras sermons are more worked out better organized and better delivered than mine He noted that the stuff that is irksome is the reflex kind of thing A few men still come to me he said They almost walk around Barbara and a few pat her on the head and call her honey or dear but that kind of thing is rare Members of the congregation usually Introduce them as our two ministers and letters are usually addressed to the Rev John and the Rev Barbara Mack Joined Womens Fellowship Each receives a 5000 annual salary plus housing utilities travel and other pastoral benefits Although Mrs Mack is invited more often than her husband to what are generally considered womens activities sometimes I go and sometimes I dont    if I go its as a minister not the ministers wife both have joined the Womens Fellowship John was the first man in history to belong to it Mrs Mack said Its a socially conscious group    it tends to be the conscience of the church and when we go to meetings we go together Our biggest problems have come from the clergy Mrs Mack said Our Christmas cards from the clergy were addressed to the Rev and Mrs She recalled too that after graduation nowhere in the church conference did we get a sense of anyone encouraging the idea of a team We found this vacancy ourselves We had given the church conference our dossiers and heard nothing from them Mr Mack said So we got list of vacancies and investigated op our own We found quite a few interested in us and we turned down five or six The reason we picked this one is that it was urban it was open to a team and they were pretty excited about the idea The couple prefer to be known as John and Barbara A few parishion ers who have indicated that they would rather not use first names or who feel uncomfortable at having their children address clergy in that manner have been told to use whatever form they prefer To date there have been no unfavorable comments about their decision not to wear clearical robes Mrs Mack who favors short skirts and boots during the week wears one of her more sedate dresses at Sunday services Mr Mack wears a business suit I think people want you to wear robes for basically the Wrong reasons Mrs Mack said Somehowthe robe sets you apart One thing I feel very strongly about is that we are ordinary people not someone set apart or having a special handle on the truth Weve had special training thats all Both agree that their course of action was made easier because they preached their candidate sermon during the hot summer months and no one expected us to wear robes then Mr Mack outlined their attitude as seeing ourselves as professionals in a given field We have some talent in the Scriptures some training in helping people but no special mystique he said To me that would be destructive as person One of the biggest personal conflicts weve had as individuals is saying no to certain expectations Of people Mrs Mack said There are people who feel strongly that ministers are supposed to be super leaden and strong people with all the answers No minister does Its very difficult to show weaknets and vulnerability to a congregation When the minister is able to do it I think It is humanizing Attitude of Parents Mrs Mack whose parents live in Topton Pa where her father is a supervisor with Western Electric said she thought they would have been much happier to see her go in for teaching They didnt understand my position but all the same they were very supportive she said I think they still have this feeling that it will wear offthat after proving myself Ill settle down into a more traditional role of wife and mother Mr Mack who attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Princeton before making his decision to go into the ministry knew he didnt want to follow his fathers profession as an investment counselor and work to get money to put myself in a nice position I wanted to be fully engaged he said I wanted the feeling of trying to make sense out of all experience Part of the making sense was the decision arrived at jointly that housework as well as professional duties would be shared When I was first married I was really uptight Mrs Mack recalled I thought that housework was my job gradually decided it wasnt We dont have lists Mr Mack said We just both go at it John usually does the ironing while he watches football Mrs Mack said Ill wash We kind of pick up the slack from the other person At the moment some of the household chores are shared by three young men who are sharing the sevenroom rectory with the Meeks The men who are in the process of finding jobs or going into training programs needed temporary home Id like the church to become more active in the community Mr Mack said specifically citing both care for the aged and youth programs Mrs Mack who has already investigated the possibility of day care in the church I mentioned it to the deacons and I dont think they knew what to say but I have the OK to do an exploratory study would also like to see a clergy consultation service in abortion counseling It hasnt come up for discussion yet We both like working with kids she said We focus on life experiences life death birth We try to make them feel that religion is not some special segment of life that it is trying to understand the meaning of things and what is happening to you in deep way At the moment their principal problem is cutting down their 60 to 70hour work week a schedule they found necessary because the church was not functioning well when we got here and we also have interests in the community Weve been told we must make time for ourselves and we are planning to take off a day a week Mr Mack said He continued almost immediately But we want to start a vision group in the church do a little dreaming about what we might be doing and

"ABORTION, IMPACT ASSAYED IN STUDY",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/06/archives/abortion-impact-assayed-in-study-expert-sees-little-change-in.html,WASHINGTON Jan 5 UPI Legalization of abortions in every state would have little initial impact on population growth but could curb the rising national rate of illegitimate births says an unpublished study prepared for a Presidential panel Dr Christopher Tietze of New York associate director of the Population Council who wrote the study said that he lbased his projections on legal abortions performed in New York City since mid1970 Dr Tietze widely recognized as a statistical authority on birth control wrote that in the first year of nationwide legalized abortions on request under laws similar to those in Alaska Hawaii New York and Washington State an estimated 1630000 women would want abortions But he predicted that the birth rate would decline only about 15 per thousand population a decrease of 300000 to 350000 births nationwide the first year The Government estimates the 1971 birth rate at 174 per thousand population close to a record low Based on his experience in New York City Dr Tietze said legalized abortions would have little effect on the birth rate because possibly as many as 80 per cent of the women seeking abortions would have them performed illegally if necessary to terminate pregnancies Dr Tietzes study is one of several authorized by the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future which is expected to report to President Nixon next spring on the impact that population growth has upon the economy the environment and the Government One of the panels goals is to consider population growth explicity and to formulate policy for the future The initial demographic impact of liberalized abortion laws has been comparatively minor Dr Tietze wrote A similarly modest initial effect may be expected nationwide if restrictive abortion laws were to be struck down by the Supreme Court or replaced by legislation This is true primarily he wrote because the great majority of legal abortions of New York City residents involved pregnancies that without legalization would have been terminated by illegal abortion This pattern Dr Tietze said could be expected to hold true throughout the country

Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/09/archives/approach-to-family-planning.html,To the Editor Can we expect nothing more radical than a pragmatic weighing of abortion against life from Christian ministers like Jesse Lyons of Riverside Church whose letter Dec 23 attacks Robert M Byrn as irresponsible in testing the states abortion law Why have our churches not united in a broad campaign to exhort all families to include at least one child by adoption This approach to family planning widely accepted could work to empty our institutions of unwanted children  those who might have been aborted  as well as the socalled hardtoadopt  children of minority background older children and handicapped ones Let Mr Lyons and the rest of us not wait for medical science [to] put the abortion issue on the shelf while allowing ourselves to be guilty of irresponsible ethical evasion in not exploring honestly and generously the possibilities beyond the whole spectrum of social services SUSANNE WASHBURN New York Dec 27 1971
Growth Per Se: A Spurned Goal,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/09/archives/growth-per-se-a-spurned-goal.html,Fashions changein ideas as in apparel A dozen years ago a Presidential candidate John F Kennedy built a campaign and a young economist Walter E Heller a reputation on the notion of economic growth a panacea that promised wealth and upward mobility to the poor without disturbing the comfort and selfassurance of the rich and those in between The most obvious demographic fact was the postwar population wave then just beginning to swell the nations secondary schools Today the idea of economic growth is in disrepute cut down by the new generations concern about the effects of wasteful consumption eight years of war being the most notable exampleon a limited supply of fuel metals and other natural resources and on the environment The demographic matter of the moment is a sharp reduction in the birth and fertility rates For the first six months of last year the birth rate births per year per 1000 population was 172 lower even than the Depression low of 18 in 1936 By way of comparison the birth rate had held at 25 or above for the full decade from 1947 to 1957 Fertility Rate Plummets A more sophisticated indicator the general fertility rate births per year per 1000 women of the childbearing years 1544 gave even more striking evidence of the changed attitude toward having children From a 50year high of 123 in 1957 the fertiility rate had fallen to 775 by last July The decline was even more startling because the figure for all of 1970 had been 876 The sloganeers had a phrase for it A birth dearth was following the postwar baby boom A number of explanations were offered liberalized abortion laws the economic recession more effective contraception growth in the percentage of young women who remain single an increase in the number of working wives the decline in immigration the growth in education and income levels particularly among blacks changed attitudes among Roman Catholics and a sharp reduction in the number of children considered the ideal family size One study found that women aged 20 to 24 who married before 20 may now expect to have an average of 265 children In 1965 among women of similar age and circumstance the anticipated average was 311 Zero Population Growth Even more there was the matter of changing lifestyles and philosophies The new panacea was zero population growth and it seemed safe to predict that in the 1972 Presidential campaign it would receive a deferential nod if not the active endorsement of at least some of the hopefuls However it was far from clear whether the drop in the fertility rate was a reflection of the new philosophy or the philosophy a result of growing population pressures Demographers warned that the sharp drop in the fertility rate could be a temporary phenomenon reflecting the concurrence of the recession with some stretching out of the years of family completion a result in effect of better family planning Others contend however that one of every five or six births is still unwanted and that more effective family planning might reduce fertility to the replacement level of an average of 211 children per couple or even below The problem however is hardly one of the moment For the population to stop growing couples would have to limit their families to about one child on average That is because of the increase in the number of women now reaching childbearing age Even if couples produced no more children than those needed to replace themselves it would still be the middle of the next century before population leveled off Like economic growth however zero population growth may not prove the solution many think it to be There will be more families if lower fertility rates continue but they will be smaller and richer Emphasis will shift from the gross national produot which should tend to slow in growth to per capita GNP which could rise substantially Disposable income equitable with the consumption of luxutries and services might soar
Religion,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/09/archives/should-it-be-left-to-the-public-schools-sex-education.html,Not many works are produced in Boston and banned elsewhere But the UnitarianUniversalist Association may have come up with just such an item in the form of a controversial new sex education program now being implemented in about 250 of its Sunday schools Designed as a frank honest approach to human sexuality the new curriculum is candid to the point of using slide pictures of live models to Illustrate sexual intercourse but equally radical is the way it relates sexuality to social issues like womens liberation On both counts the program is likely to influence the policies of the growing number of religious groups that are deciding that sex education is too full of moral implications to be left to the public schools alone The Unitarian program entitled About Your Sexuality is aimed at 12to14yearolds and it is taught by teams that include both men and women The teams are equipped with a red and white box full of books discussion guides film strips and recordings of people describing their sexual experiences both good and bad These resources cover everything from birth control techniques and venereal disease to how mass advertising and the media exploit masculinity and femininity stereotypes The program reflects the basic religious tenet of Unitarianism that the individual must decide for himself what values and doctrines are true There is no set order for taking up the nine program units instead teachers begin with whatever questions their particular students are asking Teaching is done in mixed seminars of about a dozen students in which everyone is encouraged to speak freely about his or her thoughts and feelings Instructors are urged to avoid moralism and the materials make no firm recommendations on the morality of matters like premarital sex and abortion On the other hand they take definite liberal line on homosexuality which is described as one viable life pattern among others and masturbation which is seen as having positive and beneficial aspects The curriculum was fieldtested for two years before being implemented last August and no church is permitted to touch the materials until teachers have gone through an intense twoandahalfday training program Nevertheless the curriculum has begun to draw fire mainly because of the realistic audiovisuals Richard McConnell the distriot attorney of Waukesha County Wis recently warned one local church planning to implement the course in February that it may be a violation of the Wisconsin obscenity statutes Unitarian educators though believe they are on safe constitutional ground They argue that anything less forthright would be counterproductive among todays visually sophisticated teenagers and would suggest that there is something dirty about sex While no other religious groups have been quite so bold as the Unitarians the last five years have brought about significant changes in church policies in general toward sex education Vatican Council II 19621965 called for positive and prudent sex education and nearly half of the 156 Roman Catholic dioceses in the country are now said to have formal programs in their paiochial Schools and Confraternity of Christian Doctrine programs Most major Protestant churches including the traditionminded Southern Baptist Convention have beiun implementing their own Sunday School curriculums So has the Reform wing of Judaism Virtually all of these programs reject the doityourself value system of the Unitarians and consciously attempt to communicate a value system We dont want to be dogmatic but Jews have a 4000yearold tradition in this area and we at least want the kids to be aware of it gabbi Jack Spiro of thefl Union of American Hebrew Congregationssaid recently In their audiovisuals most others still use drawings or pictures of works of art like Michelangelos David Catholic sex education efforts have been opposed noisily by traditionalist organizations Catholics United for the Faith for instance has published elaborate critiques of sex education curriculums in parochial schools and has actively helped parents set up Holy Innocents schools to compete with official parochial schools and protect values such as modesty Fundamentalist Protestant opposition has been surprisingly minimal The evangelical weekly Christianity Today for example has taken a prosex education stance partly on the ground that the Bible deals forthrightly with items such as the adultery of David and the virgin birth of Christ Reasons for the new interest in sex education among churches include changing sexual values in society the increasing sophistication of young people and a growing fear among parents that moral values are being lost The war in Vietnam and the growing abortion rate are signs that values like the sanctity of human life are being downgraded says Mrs Valeria Dillona 41yearold Catholic who has written in the area of sex education She asserts that sex education is point where all sorts of value considerations converge  from chastity to respect for the life situation of others  and thus one that offers the church a unique opportunity for moral education The Unitarians have found that teenagers are eager to talk about values and sometimes get so involved in issues like the exploitation of sex by advertisers that they never get around to asking to see the filmstrips that have caused all the fuss One explanation may be that todays teenagers have been to enough Saturday matinees to have seen it all anyway Another may be that they are as worried about their parents social and moral values as viceversa Teenagers want solid values says Mrs Pat Schreiner a 34yearold Stamford Conn housewife and mother who helped develop the Unitarian program They see a lot of things going on among their parents and other adults marriages that they dont like They want something better for themselves EDWARD B FISKE

What Code of Values Can We Teach Our Children Now?,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/16/archives/what-code-of-values-can-we-teach-our-children-now-what-values-for.html,AMERICAN children today are suffering from widespread par ent failure By their words and actions many fathers and mothers make it clear that they are almost paralyzed by uncertainty Old standards of behavior no longer seem to apply Parents find it hard to know what to expect of their off spring Many of them are in conflict as to what their own values are Others think they know but lack the confidence to impose discipline in behalf of their values Worst of all are those parents who doubt whether they have the right to structure a childs attitudes beliefs and conduct Ironically these difficulties have developed during decades when more reliable information has been acquired about children about the formation of character and about the interplay between personality and culture than at any other time in human history For more than 50 years thousands of child psychiatrists pediatricians psy chologists and teachers have been assembling a more  or  less complete picture of child development We know most of what we need to know to rear healthy children although more information is always desirable What is lacking is not information but conviction We need the will to what know The will to act depends upon con fidence in ones own values Much of the confusion about values is unjus tified because there exists a much wider consensus than first appears The consensus is obscured by dis tracting discussions of the generation gap the youth revolt the drug scene the sexual revolution But values are inculcated and personalities largely formed before these issues even arise What follows is necessarily based in part on my wifes and my par ticular experience in raising our youngsters and reflects our personal hierarchy of values Because we have not seen our children pass through the heights and depths of adoles cence many readers may consider us mere novices in the parental game But unless all the literature on child development is wrong what happens to a child during the first dozen years of life critically influences how he responds to the challenge of adoles cence and adulthood Inevitably differences will develop between adolescents and their par ents There is a gap between each generation in a family and there should be Tastes in music and clothes in hairstyles and heroes change Each generation evolves its own But tastes and fads have only a marginal relationship to values It does not matter whether boys wear their hair shoulderlength or crewcut whether they collect Frank Sinatra records or Bob Dylan records What does matter is how they treat other people and how other people treat them WHAT values are relevant for tomorrows world What should we instill in the youngsters who will be adolescents in the late nineteensev enties and adults in the nineteen eighties We can answer these ques tions if we imagine our children as young adults and ask a more per sonal series of questions about them Do they tell the truth to one an other and to themselves Do they do their share of whatever work has to be done or do they shirk Can they articulate and channel their aggres sion Can they show tenderness and compassion toward other people Can they be trusted  with a confidence with a job with money with respon sibility for another persons welfare Given their particular talents are they making use of them Every mother and father knows the answers he and she would like to be able to give to these questions If there is agreement on the goals to be reached then there is not such a pro found disagreement about values How a child de velops into an adult depends in part of course on the riddle of heredity but in greater part it depends upon whether parents care enough about their children to assert and defend the necessary values It also means putting home responsibilities first Rearing our children is by far the most important task most of us will ever undertake To accomplish it successfully re quires placing it above the complications of ones career Fathers as well as mothers have to be homemakers LOVE and discipline are the foundation of all values A successful home is a school for love If children are not loved from infancy through their growing years they can not learn to love other per sons and to become happy affirmative adults But love alone is not enough Children need discipline if they are to develop compe tent selfconfident personali ties A child needs help to reach an accommodation be tween his naturally egocentric impulses and the demands of reality At the most elemen tary level he needs this out side help for his physical safe ty or else he may climb on a windowsill and topple out or pull something heavy down upon himself But he has to have help also to learn to dis tinguish right from wrong the constructive from the destruc tive what he is able to do now from what he will be able to do later In the imposing of discipline some uncertainty and some in ner conflict are natural Only a humorless martinet would fail to have occasional doubts about the right course But doubt is one thing and abdi cation is another Those par ents who do not persevere in rearing their children accord ing to their own convictions are not leaving them free to develop on their own Instead they are letting other children and the media principally television and the movies do the job In the last 20 years tele vision has become a powerful intruder in the traditional processes by which parents and teachers impart values to children It is a dangerous intruder because it portrays excessive violence gives chil dren a silly picture of adult life encourages a deadly pas sivity and creates a fantasy world in which entertainment is the highest value and every problem is neatly solved in 30 minutes The only effective way to cope with this ruthless com petitor for the mind of a growing child is to forbid it altogether My wife and I are in the minority are perhaps even eccentric in keeping our children away from television We made the usual conscien tious efforts to ration its use but control was achieved at a rather steep price in bicker ing Out went the television And in came tranquillity Dur ing daylight hours a child should be outside playing in the fresh air When it is dark or the weather is bad he should be encouraged to use his mind and his hands in some active way Television like films and the theater ought to be an adult medium of entertainment if only be cause it subverts the natural authority of parents On those programs considered suita ble for young viewers chil dren are rarely spanked or disciplined in any way They are portrayed as effectively the equal of adults in intel ligence judgment and expe rience Indeed in situation comedies the frecklefaced son often comes across as brighter than his feckless father Con scientious parents should not allow children under 6 to watch television at all and children of school age should not be allowed more than an hour or two on weekends never on school days Parents not prepared to exclude tele vision from their childrens lives or rigidly limit it have to recognize that in almost everything they try to do in guiding their children they are rowing against the tide the tide of television pro grams and commercials On basic issues of right and wrong the essential values are what they have always been Nothing has invalidated the hardearned moral wisdom that mankind has accumulated since Biblical times To kill to steal to lie or to covet another persons possessions still leads to varying degrees of misery for the victim and the perpetrator The 20th century has not found a way to repeal the Ten Command ments Thou shalt not com mit adultery may sound old fashioned but restated in con temporary terms Do not smash up another persons family life  it still carries a worthwhile message Contemporary American children grow up to confront opportunities for moral risk taking which were unknown until recently The invention of birthcontrol pills and the availability of abortion have weakened the taboos against premarital sex If a safe morningafter pill is devel oped in the coming decade as seems likely any pragmatic sanction against sexual prom iscuity will disappear except for the continuing risk of venereal infection Some modern parents are already so defeatist on sexual issues that they are having their 14  year  old daughters fitted with diaphragms or given prescriptions for the pill But the powerful emo tions surrounding the sexual act cannot be screened out as easily as the sperm It is those emotions which young people have to learn to man age Children of both sexes have to be taught what wise mothers have always told their daughters which is that an intimate and important ex perience is cheapened and coarsened when it is divorced from love If persons use one another like disposable plastic cartons the emotional content of the experience becomes comparably trivial There are those who argue that sex can be completely pleasurable even if one barely knows ones partner or loathes him or her I would suggest that most young people are not so tough or neurotic Whatever they may protest to the con trary their feelings are en gaged in the sexual act and their feelings are bruised when it leads nowhere In sexual relations as in other areas of life Americans have to relearn the satisfac tions of selfdenial and antici pation It would do no harm to 16 and 17yearold boys and girls to know the facts about sex and yet not engage in intercourse A certain amount of frustration and ten sion can be enduredand with good effect Only modern Americans regard frustra tion as ranking higher than cholera in the scale of human afflictions An older wiser at titude regarded selfrestraint as a necessary part of becom ing mature and creative But if our children are to learn how to wait and how to disci pline themselves they will have to acquire these habits long before adolescence The hippies and flower children were inevitable Sick of a world in which auto mobiles and airconditioning were equated with happiness they turned their backs on the simplest material necessities FOR probably fourfifths of American children the afflu ent society is an overpower ing reality that neither they nor their parents have learned to manage The disease of consumerism begins at birth with the letter from the diaper service the telephone call from the baby photographer the unsolicited gift of rubber pants emblazoned with the makers name It continues through the breakfast blitz Kids Send three box tops and 25 cents to  and the television onslaught This is old Captain Whizbang telling you to ask your Mom to buy you the big new Super Crunchies with the lockedin goodness  The toy auto mobile is made of plastic and falls apart much sooner than it takes to collect three box tops The model airplane wont fly either But with the short memories and inde structible optimism of chil dren our youngsters never lose hope and are soon loping down the gimme trail of the true consumer Although these excesses are easily satirized there is noth ing comic about their conse quences No children in the history of the world have been so inundated with junk or have become so accus tomed to the idea that a high level of material goods is es sential This breeds an unat tractive materialism It de stroys a childs time scale and sense of proportion A mate rial object which should be cherished at age 16 because it has been earned by odd jobs on Saturdays or at least eagerly anticipated for a long time is nowadays a broken castoff when a child is half that age I recall visiting the home of a friend who had a son 8 and a daughter 6 As they were being sent off to bed at cocktail time I mentioned casually that after they got into their pajamas I would give them a present A few minutes later with mingled chagrin and dismay I over heard them discussing what my gift would be Ill bet its a transistor ra dio the boy said No I think itll be an in tercom the girl replied The gift was actually a few shiny dimes which I had hap pened to receive at the bank that day They were so far below what the children had expected that they good naturedly treated them as a peculiar adult joke So much for William V Shannon as John D Rockefeller Need less to add these were not the children of a millionaire but of a moderately success ful professional man who earns about 25000 a year I have to add that I grew up in a workingclass family during the Depression of the thirties My own 9yearold son can hardly believe that not only was there no tele vision then but that my fam ily did not own an auto mobile I once told him that in addition to a couple of small toys my Christmas stocking was filled out with a box of marshmallows some Brazil nuts and in the toe an orange An orange he said in that quizzical tone which chil dren use when they are not certain whether an adult is telling them the truth or put ting them on The economic circumstances of my own childhood un doubtedly color my atti tude I realize that it would be pointless to subject my own children to the same deprivations and constraints It would also be impossible as my wife and I discovered at Christmas a few years ago Trying to put into practice our spare the gifts and save the child philosophy we de cided to limit our children to one gift each But their grand parents godparents aunts uncles and close family friends gave them so many gifts that the children never even noticed their parents highminded restraint Yet the effort is worth mak ing Since we cannot ration the generosity of others at Christmas we do hold the line the rest of the yearno gifts when father returns from a trip no casual impulse buy ing at the supermarket or the drugstore The gift that is earned by performing a few chores or that is made at home out of simple materials is preferable because it is within a childs natural range of experience and not bor rowed from a false adult world of money and advertis ing The hippies and flower children of the nineteensix ties were inevitable As mem bers of the first generation to grow up in the TV age they were the rebels against the materialism and hed onism which television ad vertising inculcates Sick of excessive stress on tooth pastes and deodorants they grew up determined never to take a bath Sick of a world in which automobiles and air conditioning were equated with happiness they turned their backs on the simplest material necessities Sick of competition for glossy bau bles they opted out of the workaday world altogether The revolt of the hippies is a more complicated phenomenon than can be analyzed here but certainly the impact of excessive television viewing on immature minds and the mismanagement of family af fluence were major factors ADISTINCTION that is oft en overlooked has to be made between the disdain for ma terialism and the necessity of a work ethic An individual can be indifferent to material rewards as such but still have a positive attitude toward work Work in the best sense is an expression of a persons intellectual powers or artistic sensibility or physical strength or personality There is satis faction in making use of each of these human capacities But as Paul Goodman pointed out in Growing Up Absurd a lot of work in an advanced corporate economy consists of pointless papershuffling Un questionably the economy could be reformed and work made more constructive and humane Yet there has always been drudgery If ones work does not provide any kind of distinctive outlet it may still provide the psychic rewards of being member of a group with its own lan and cohe siveness Since no society has yet been invented in which the overwhelming majority can survive without working and since everything we have learned about human beings suggests that they are hap pier when they are performing some useful function parents have an obligation to their children to instill in them a positive attitude toward work Such an attitude involves ac ceptance of a relationship be tween effort and reward a willingness to share an abil ity to follow and accept dis cipline as well as to lead and give direction and a capacity to postpone immediate gratifi cation for the sake of later accomplishment No child should be stifled or severely coerced but too much em phasis has probably been placed on selfexpression with the result that many children grow up never realizing that there are times when they can be happy only if they sub ordinate themselves These values do not entail slavish ness to the system or dis tortion of natural man to economic ends Ralph Nader is a trenchant critic of the system and Picasso is as free from its economic constraints as a man can be But few men work harder than Nader or Picasso PROBABLY the whole point of rearing a child can be summed up in one word in dividualitythat is helping him to be who he is with all his strengths and nuances of personality and distinctive ness of background Naturally the stronger the parents and the more developed their per sonalities the more they can contribute to their children if they are prepared to devote themselves to this arduous undertaking The more stable the marriage and the more coherent the values of the family the easier it will be for the child to evolve his indi viduality Religion race and economics help make up this family matrix If one has a religious faith it can help solidify a sense of family and help guide a child in his ethical development For these very reasons many couples who are not them selves particularly devout in tensify their churchgoing and church participation when they become parents So long as the gap between professed belief and behavior is not too wide this kind of parental piety is probably beneficial for children because it is an ad ditional stabilizing force in their lives Of course millions of people have no formal re ligion and would rightly re gard it as repulsively hypo critical to adopt one What re ally matters is that fathers and mothers not abdicate their crucial valuesetting re sponsibility Almost any hier archy of ethical values is pre ferable to you make up your own mind or whatever the other kids are doing is all right IT is equally important that parents put forward a positive attitude toward their own racial and ethnic heritage There are some untenable and selfdefeating impulses in the Black Power movement but for Negro children there sure ly is an enormous psychic gain in being taught that black is beautiful A knowl edge of black history and black culture is indispensable for the needed flowering of black selfconfidence Black is beautiful and so are white red brown and yellow No one should be ashamed of his familys past because misplaced shame is selfcrippling The parallel movement to Black Power among white immigrant groups from Eastern and and Southern Europe may seem unnecessarily defensive and assertive but it is to the good Children of Polish or Lithuanian or Croatian or Italian ancestry ought not to be subjected to the cultural stereotypes of an older assimi lationist Americanism But the dark side of ethnic selfesteem is prejudice Con trary to that charming song from South Pacific my ex perience with my own sons and my observations of other children convince me that youngsters are not naturally tolerant They are naturally suspicious and sometimes hos tile to the unfamiliar face or the different skin Youre awfully black the little boy said to the Negro woman sitting next to him in the bus while his mother suf fered excruciating embarrass ment You know Jimmy [a Chi nese classmate] is yellow all over our son reported one day These trivial remarks do not reveal a bigotinthemaking but they persuade me that ra cial tolerance like courtesy or table manners or not slugging ones little brother is a virtue that has to be taught God did not make these youngsters colorblind Many jokes have been made about the pious slogan The family that prays together stays together But behind the slickness there is a truth Young children need to feel themselves part of a particu lar family with its own style of doing things its own stand ards its own expectations Therefore almost anything that a family does together whether it is eating in a res taurant or camping or going on a vacation or going to church is worthwhile because it promotes a family spirit Children may resent at times that they cannot do what every other child on the block is doing but far outbalanc ing that resentment they gain the security of family member ship Many men take their sons hunting and fishing Many families go hiking or bicycling or work together on the fam ily boat In our family my wife does the cooking but on Saturdays I do the baking for the week Our sons are now enthusiastic participants in these kitchen activities trying to knead the dough or shape the brioche The 4  year  old naturally does best working with the cookiecutter In ad dition to the primary pleasure of making things together this cooking and baking breaks down the idea that kitchen ac tivities are drudgery or wo mans work A British friend of mine a gourmet made a habit of tak ing his son with him on his Saturday  morning shopping rounds ending up of course with a visit to an icecream parlor Such a shopping ven ture might seem boring for a little boy but he enjoyed it presumably because his father enjoyed it so much and he wanted to be with his father Now that the boy is 11 he thinks that shopping for pt and cheese and exotic vege tables is not only normal but much the most interesting way to spend Saturday morning Eating together is probably the oldest human ritual Noth ing has done more to diminish the strength of the family than the frozen dinner and the American habit of permitting each member of the family to prepare his own meal more commonly a snack and eat it at a time of his own choosing In our family every meal be gins with the saying of grace and ends with the children ex pressing thanks and asking to be excused On Sunday we eat lunch together in a restau rant and we eat dinner at home by candlelight By drill ing the boys on their table manners  my wife deserves all the credit for carrying through that drudgery and holding them to a high stand ard of deportment we are now able to take them out anywhere and enjoy their company I do not want to imply that this has been a pleasing study in quiet growth On the con trary when we sailed to Eu rope on the France Chris topher our middle son was passing through what Dr Spock calls the terrible twos No amount of moth erly coaxing or fatherly glares prevented Christoper from pelting the waiter with bread After two days of hectic scenes the Shannon family re treated from the ships dining room to the privacy of room service Christopher was not quieter in our cabin just less visible That is all in the past Now in a restaurant only the maitre dhtel surpasses Chris topher in aplomb Any Sunday now he may be ordering the wine Table manners of course are the least of it They are only the outward sign that the civilizing process is underway This process begins with the recognition of restraints They can be best and most truly learned within the hier archy of the family Childhood is a gradual preparation for assuming the independent re sponsibilities of adulthood not a temporary avoidance of any responsibilities If a child is to learn to be an adult he has to begin by respecting the adults he knows his parents and if they are alive his grandparents Respect does not preclude emotional warmth rather it is loves complement as the right hand is to the left By learning to obey his father and mother a child has the freedom within the sure boundaries they set for him to discover his own identity By learning to respect other peo ples rights a child gains the selfconfidence to claim his own

An M.D. Reviews Dr. Welby of TV,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/16/archives/an-md-reviews-dr-welby-of-tv-dr-welby-of-tv.html,THE scene barely believable and yet commonplace has repeat ed itself over and over again in the past six years ever since my hospital installed television sets in every room Im making late rounds or examining an emergency admis sion working at the patients bed side palpating his abdomen check ing his pulseand all the while the patient is staring fixedly at the TV set where when I glance up from my own work a TV doctor is ex amining a TV patient Probably its hard to tell from my own glances the TV patient isnt really paying at tention to her TV doctor but is instead watching the matchboxsized screen in the corner of her TV room And so on ad infinitum No doubt about it There are times when my patients are less interested in their own illnesses than in those of a multitude of Hollywood actors There are times when Im less im portant to themless real almost than the imaginary doctors on tele vision The ultimate in humiliation has been reported to me by a col leaguemaking an evening visit on a hospitalized patient he was asked politely to return when a medical TV program was over Physicians are sensitive people In general we dont mind being told politely to postpone an examination or hospital treatment until something important like a pro football game is over Its not rare to pass by a hos pital room and see all medical transactions suspended while patient and doctor alike watch the last mo ments of a close game On more than one occasion Ive accepted a patients invitation to sit a moment and watch some particularly fine program on television But to be brushed aside in favor of a makebelieve doctor that hurts It hurts particularly because like most physicians I dont usually watch doctor programs on television Theres usually drama enough in our everyday lives and when we want more we dont want it in the same form weve been grappling with all day at the office It was only gradu ally therefore that I became aware that Iand 200000 other practicing physicianswere locked in a mano amono for our patients affections with a man named Marcus Welby Welby played by the veteran Robert Young is the most success ful in a long line of television doctors From Richard Boone in Medic to the surly Vincent Edwards of Ben Casey doctor shows have been pop ular but none have dominated the ratings like Welby For two years running it has consistently been among the nations most popular shows and it shows no sign of run ning down Thus even though Welby is only a shadow doctor a tube practitioner I decided it might be a good idea to find out what makes him tick The show turned out to be interesting not only for what Ameri cans expect of their doctors but for how they see themselves AFTER a total immersion course in Welby I am convinced Ive met my match Welby unlike other past and present television doctors is not a specialist snarling his way through some marble research institute or teeming big  city hospital Hes a canny Santa Monica general practi tioner who lives over the store That is his office is in his home and even though both the office and home are far from dowdy its all rather ham ish David Victor the man who thought up Marcus Welby MD and who is now the shows executive producer fairly chortles when he discusses his GP hero Look I did the Kildare show I know what was happening there when it went off the air whats happening to the other medical shows now You get yourself painted into a corner dealing only with hospital cases If you build up your central hero as a hospitalbased surgeon and then have him do a whole show where he gets involved with a pretty girl with epilepsy its cheating The audience knows in real life it wouldnt happen Doctors who see the show get disgusted But with Welby hes got the whole range of medical problems as his legitimate preserve He moves from his office to the hospital to the community He gets consultation when he should but its his patient Its authentic and audiences respond The show is authentic no doubt of that If youre the kind of doctor who watches medical shows solely for the pleasure of discovering their gaffes Welby will provide precious little satisfaction In a dozen or so episodes I noted a mislabeled lateral chest Xray and a disconcerting EKG monitor in which the tracing marched from right to left instead of left to right Otherwise it is tech nically perfect which is not surpris ing in view of the shows close co operation with and supervision by the American Academy of Family Physicians Welby is realistic too in its emphasis on the fact that most med ical care takes place outside the hos pital The operating room still figures as the focal point for much of the shows high drama but the patient and Welby usually get there only through the seamless web of office visit  family situation house call emergencyhospital Were not a diagnostic exercise Were not centered on disease says producer Victor Were doing hu man drama that has a medical back ground We focus on the patient and the doctor not the illness And so the audience sees an episode on ve nereal disease centered not on youth ful promiscuity or the shock of di agnosing the disease in a middle class highschool girl but on just who that girl wasshy formerly fat newly attractive pushed by her mother into dating patterns she couldnt control Welby forceful but nonjudgmental the ultimate father figure makes the girl acknowledge her illness and more importantly makes her parents see their part in it Time after time Welby works pri marily not to diagnose a disease but to make a patient accept the fact that he has it Like a medical Can dide he imparts his weekly lesson Epileptics can live normal lives lepers can get married deaf children can be taught to learn women are not crip ples after breast surgery The summary is not intended to mock for the lessons are important ones and they are the bedrock of medical practice The series is a testi mony to the increasing sophistication of the American public Its not so much that nice middleclass girls can get the clap and it can be talked about on TV although thats something in itself but that the public no longer needs the farout diag noses and dramatic new operations that used to be a staple of movie and TV medi cine We all remember the movie dialogue in which the doctorhero tells the adoring young wife Were going to have to operate on your hus band I think theres a chance to save him Theres a new operation Ive been working on Its a desperate chance but  Not on Marcus Welby No mysterious operations as yet unavailable to the TV audience No new drugs just flown in from Vienna or Mos cow Just the daily work of medicine When eagleeye Welby notices that a retarded girl reverses some of her let ters he suspects the diagnosis of dyslexia secondary to brain damage has his hunch con firmed by a specialist and re fers the patient to a center for learning disabilities Training may not make her normal he says but it will allow her to reach her fullest potential No miracle here WHAT is striking about the Welby show is the amount of psychiatric insight it pre supposes on the part of its audience Nowhere else in the world could the ordinary mans favorite program de pend so heavily on the am bivalencies of family life  the wife who wants her hus band to get well but not too well the daughter who wants her mother to be independent but not too independent In 48 minutes and 50 seconds of actual running time Victor and his writers have to pre sent a sick person not merely a disease show how the ill ness affects the patient and reverberates in his family circle bring Welby and his young associate Kiley James Brolin into direct confronta tion with both the illness and the family situation and reach a slightly optimistic ending The technique was well ex pressed in a lovely episode last year about a retarded child in a migrant Okie family Kiley discovers that the child is deaf probably not retarded The childs father has rejected the child and refuses to allow him to go to a treatment clinic despite his wifes pleas The mother movingly played by Pamela McMyler persists and in a beautiful scene com municates with her son for the first time The child is wearing spaceage earphones to magnify every sound The mother sings a folk lullaby The father softens begins to cooperate in the long process of teaching the child to speak His own bitterness is ex plained as stemming in part from guilt about his sons con dition in part from the hopes he had had from his own il literate father that someday the family would achieve ed ucation If Welby does present a basically valid view of what general medical practice is all about it is still far from a documentary Its a fantasy says Dr Howard Pierpont a Washington surgeon The way Welby carries on youd think he had nothing to do but take care of one patient a day Indeed this is the commonest criticism of the show by doctors Focusing on one problem patient and his family per episode Wel by and Kiley seem to be run ning a twoman Intensive Care Service in which they not only attend to their pa tients medical problems but take them to ball games serve them elaborate dinners stop by their jobs and attend their weddings The show occasion ally depicts a slightly crowded waiting room or Welby usher ing out one patient before getting to the patient but it never suggests the essence of the job from the physicians side the constant juggling of 5 or 15 or 20 major prob lems per day Nor does one ever get the sense of how major problems actually pre sent themselves not all wrapped up with a title which means the physician will have to devote the next 48 minutes and 50 seconds to them and them alone but as a slightly disquieting phone call or lab report which intrudes itself in the midst of another major problem and then grows more and more intense Poetic license says Da vid Victor We know doctors dont work this singleminded ly on one case in such a brief period of time What we do is condense what actually takes place over a period of weeks or months This is justifiable but the program is so authen tic in other respects that one gets the feeling that 46 million Americans expect their doc tors to drive them to the hos pital adjust the oxygen sit with them through the night and stand by in the operating room for three hours when the surgeon does his magic THE Welby dialogue never rivaling Hemingways sounds particularly stilted to physi cians Little explanations pass from Welby to Kiley as they never would in real life Well have to operate on the hematoma that clot of blood pushing on her spinal cord In a subtle way this under mines the reality of the show for anyone who lives in the world of medicine Yet though few doctors I know watch Welby regularly those who do or who have seen some episodes like the program One young resident mentioned a program in which Kiley faced the problem of how vigorously to treat his dying father Its funny be cause I had just started my internship then and I had a patient with the same prob lemhe was basically a gork and the program was very real I think I learned from it Some doctors resent Wel by because they feel the show raises unrealistic ex pectations in the audience At a recent medical convention I heard one of the guest speakers lump in the Welby show among factors con tributing to the rise of mal practice actions against doc tors People see Marcus Welby and the other shows and then expect miracles of us he said In fact Welby spends a good deal of time telling patients I just dont know whats the matter with you Well have to wait to see how the tests turn out and I may want a consultation Baffled as he may be at times Welby is never hope lessly wrong and this per haps is unrealistic Even Osler missed a few Intensive viewing also re veals a clinical syndrome characteristic enough of the show to be called the Welby Syndrome In this illness a robust indeed frequently at tractive man or woman sud denly doubles over and clutch es his abdomen This Grand Scene lasts only 15 seconds time enough for it to be noticed by the audience alone or depending on the plot to be observed by Welby or Kiley In recent shows pa tients with peptic ulcer and cirrhosis of the liver both illnesses in which lightning like pains are hardly typical have doubled over dramat ically to indicate that they are in fact very sick Medical slang for a com pletely unresponsive patient A variation on this theme is the truly dramatic way in which Welbys patients with rheumatic heart disease be have  one moment theyre bursting with good health the next theyre writhing around semiconscious while the doc tors call for oxygen THE fact is most of Welbys sick patients dont look the way sick patients actually do In real life rarely is someone completely well one second and desperately ill the next Even acute pulmonary edema the serious lung congestion seen in rheumatic and other heart disease takes minutes and sometimes hours to de velop One suspects that whole new generation of hys terical patients may be learn ing its techniques from the Welby show On one occasion a dramatic illness was shown on the pro gram but in a way which was authentic rather than sensa tional In an episode called Aura for a New Tomorrow a young schoolteacher tried to conceal his epilepsy from his girl friend and a student he was tutoring At the climax Welby forced the student to witness his teachers grand mal seizure shown in graphic unpleasantness As a physi cian I was impressed for much public education about epilep sy has avoided the fact of the seizures themselves The es sence of the show was cor rectif one is to accept the epileptic one must accept the epilepsy Compared to the old days when I was doing Kildare weve got the advantage of being able to deal with a lot of topics  VD abortion death epilepsythat couldnt get on television before pro ducer Victor says Welbys a GP  everything naturally comes through his office Were not stuck in a hospital setting where wed have him doing heart surgery one week and brain surgery the next This last was a gentle win ners elbow in the direction of the secondranked medical show Medical Center This stars Dr Joe Gannon a hand some mod young surgeon whose talents and respon sibilities are so extended that in life they would bring him into conflict with hospital rules not to mention the American College of Surgeons In one episode he does open heart surgery on a girl after having removed her appendix the previous year Later in the series we find him supervising the chemotherapy of a girl with Hodgkins disease The program is a bit fasterpaced than Welby and usually authentic within each se quence but the cumulative picture of Gannon is of a triplethreat kind of physician the kind who was outlawed in actual medical centers just about the same time that Dink Stover hung up his helmet at Yale Viewers do not seem to react to Gannon as intensely as they do to Welby Hand some young actors are a dime a dozen on television Father figures are not Robert Youngs the way I want my own doctor to be said one woman I asked about the pro gram Hes never in a hurry and he seems so fatherly Of course I identify him with that [for years Young was the title figure in a TV series called Father Knows Best] Youngs own comeback from alcoholism is well known to readers of TV magazines and it seems to have created ad ditional empathy among view ers I know that hes an al coholic one nurse told me and it makes me feel good to see how wonderfully hes do ing I think it probably makes him more sympathetic to the GPs role too Young appears to agree Hes said Medicine isnt something I think about in the abstract Its painfully meaningful to me and Ive based the character of Welby on three practitioners Ive known Youngs graying nonjudgmental attitude helps the series immensely in its trips to the sexual side of medicine Audiences might squirm if a stylish young Dr Gannon lectured a group of teenage girls about VD but accept it naturally from Welby ALTHOUGH the producer likes to point to signs of or ganic development within the series the most drastic change took place between the first and second episodes In the initial episode Welby suffered a heart attack and forced to get an associate took on Kiley a young doctor who had temporarily run out of money in his neurology resi dency Kiley was naturally no more enthusiastic about work ing a year for a GP than Welby was about having a heart attack and their con flicting personalities and ap proaches to medicine made up much of the impact of the opening show Kiley appeared very mod a bit insensitive a resident who had apparently studied under Ben Casey By the second episode as Judy Klemesrud wrote it was clear that the powersthatbe had decided to do a character transplant on Dr Kiley Today Kiley and Welby get along amicably so amicably that eyebrows are raised by the fact that the unmarried Kiley still lives in Welbys house I mean how many successful 32yearold doctors live with their widowed colleagues Were thinking about that says pro ducer Victor enigmatically Neither Welby nor Kiley has any regular female com panionship in the early days of the series Welby ran a tepid romance with a char acter played by Anne Baxter but she has not been seen much lately Just as Welby gets angry with patients only when its for their own good as op posed to when hes feeling mean and his angina is bother ing him and he wishes hed re tired back in 68 after all so too he never really falls out with Kiley They never quarrel about money for ex ample though thats the com monest problem in all medical partnerships Despite his unconventional living arrangements Marcus Welby seems to be very much a hero to the nations general practitioners The show has won more than 30 awards from medical groups includ ing several specialty societies and Robert Young is constantly asked to address physicians meetings At the convention of the American Academy of Family Physicians in Miami last year he was not only a speaker but clearly the hero of the meeting It turns out not surprisingly that the GPs are just as sensitive about their image as the hardhats and Italo  Americans and all the other workaday groups that got shunted aside in the sixties Marcus Welby is for many GPs a vindication a vastly successful weekly proof that they are just as important and their work just as dramatic as anything that goes on in a Medical Cen ter Not all generalists share this enthusiasm I dont know anything about the show says family physician Leon Berube of rural Mechanics ville Md but I was damn sick of the way my society fawned on that guy Young at our convention It wasnt his fault but they made him seem like some kind of god While Berubes annoyance is under standable it should be noted that the AAFP has been fighting for 30 years to attain a measure of importance and clout in a nation where medi cine is increasingly special ized Within the past 10 years the first residency training programs in the specialty of Family Medicine have been ap proved Few of these have been overwhelmingly success ful but their future will de pend not only upon the al leged current move of medi cal students away from super specialism but also on the subliminal conditioning effect of Marcus Welby on thousands of viewers who are today in their teens Recruitment for a specifio branch of medicine is of great interest to neither Young nor Victor though both have a genuine regard for general practitioners Instead their object has been to inform and to amuse Just as the kind of classic hysterical paralysis so common in Freuds time disappeared as laymen became more knowl edgeable so will Marcus Welby help peel off some of the fears we all have when confronted by the mysteries of illness and death Wel by may commit some boners and may leave some neurot icism in its wake but in the long run it cant help but make things better for American doctors and pa tients WHAT is most interesting about the medical shows is what they indicate about popular taste Although we tend to accept the idea of physicians as media heroes this is a new development in the popular arts Dickenss physicians were either bumblers or noble young men but like other 19thcentury fictional doctors if they were heroes it was not by virtue of their medical skills The doctor as a romantic hero did not exist in 19th  century pop fiction because decent as he might have been there wasnt anything magical about his work patients lived or died regardless of his inter vention It was not until the successive scientific triumphs of the 20th century were added to those of the 19th anesthesia asepsis immuni zation surgery  that the public saw in the physi cian a figure to rival the priest and alchemist of me dieval literature  someone with the power of life and death Doctorheroes are both a cause and effect of societys increased secularism We tend to worry more about our mor tal bodies than our immortal souls and the physician is the guardian of that body Today the doctor not only symbolizes the application of science to our quota of aches and pains but he exists out side the bureaucratic super structure Welby is the quint essential PaladinHas Bag Will Travel but Joe Gan non and The Bold Ones also seem far outside the world of time clocks and bosses and supervisors It is the private detective rather than the city cop who is the mainstay of crime fiction and it is the practicing physician who is the ideal vehicle for medical drama Welby and Gannon fight for their patients bump heads with administrators and lawyers and policemen Other occupations are not pre sented disrespectfully but the message is clearOfficer this man is sick and Im get ting him to the hospital no matter what the is There is further romance in the supposed drama of the doctors lifelong hours night calls sudden emer gencies splitsecond deci sions all of these grafted upon a background of learning wealth and humanitarianism Doctors like journalists or ac tors find it hard to remember that many people consider their jobs to be glamorous Glamour tends to fade from anything which one does daily for a living and I like many of my colleagues try to play down the mystique of medi cine Doctors are human like everyone else we have a job like everyone else But of course this isnt so The TV shows are right theres something special about medicine just as there is about police work or the law or lots of other occupa tions To a doctor medicine really is the only proper pro fession and other physicians no matter how weird their politics or how dull the ad ministrative jobs they may have taken are still comrades atarms There is a move afoot today among young phy sicians to demythologize doctors and medicine to con sider the physician as merely another member of the health  care team and to downgrade the academic ability and achievement now required to practice medi cine These doctors denounce medicine as an lite are uneasy about their own lit ist tendencies giving or ders instead of suggestions to nurses and as in a recent Home Health Handbook com piled by young health workers in Vermont sometimes eschew the MD identification total ly Remembering all the pomp ous ignorant and evil people who have hidden themselves behind an MD degree one sympathizes with this critique The profession has used lit ism unfairly In the past it excluded minorities such as the Jews Irish and Italians from positions of power It wrapped up its disciplinary problems so that the people most harmed by bad doctors were unaware of how they had been hurt It used litism to keep the lay public igno rant of the economics of medi cal care What the viewers of Mar cus Welby seem to grasp and what seems to escape some radical health workers is that litism has its noble as pects All of us do better work when more is expected of us and if we belong to an lite more is expected There

C.B.S. Slipping From Long Daytime TV Lead,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/21/archives/cbs-slipping-from-long-daytime-tv-lead.html,Daytime television is a womans world of exquisitely prolonged suffering greed hate abortions betrayals and young and middleaged love It is a world with a seemingly endless fascination for some 50 million viewers who together make up a market of more than 300million annually for which the three major networks battle tirelessly For 17 years the Columbia Broadcasting System has reigned supreme over that world without serious challenge Until now The challenge from the National Broadcasting Company and the American Broadcasting Company has sparked frantic scramble at all three networks to further improve their ratings posture and has set off another round of the TV industrys favorite indoor parlor gameexecutive musical chairs The threat to CBS was best explained by Oscar Katz the networks vice president of programs on the East Coast and a veteran daytime programer Daytime he said provides the cream that allows us to put on all those nighttime goodies Economy Reeling With TVs economy already reeling from the loss of cigarette advertising and the general economic pinch the loss to CBS which accounted for about 50 per cent of the market of what it had come to consider its private gold reserve was ground enough for panic Nevertheless the network refuses to concede defeat and has taken steps it hopes will stern the slide A major one was the hiring away of its foremost antagonistB Donald Bud Grant the National Broadcasting Companys director of daytime programing on the East Coast During the preparation of this article Mr Grant was NBCs spokesman In less than two weeks he had joined CBS as its new vice president of daytime programing replacing Paul Rauch who had left a month earlier In explanation CBSs Oscar Katz said We hired Bud Grant because we consider him the best available piece of manpower NBC which had good reason to share CBSs high opinion of Mr Grant was understandably nettled at his leaving while Mr Grants comment on the switch was I told you daytime television was highly competitive Executive Changes In response NBC last week hired Clare L Simpson vice president of Young  Rubicams radio and television division as its new vice president of daytime programing Behind the executive changes of course is the decline in CBSs daytime fortunes a decline that can he traced with clinical precision in the stark audience ratings provided by the A C Nielsen Company While CBS still holds a slight seasonal lead all three networks have been necktoneck in recent weeks Even more significantly CBSs lead to date over NBC is only 3 per cent compared with last years 22 percent while It leads ABC by only per cent compared with 43 per cent a year ago How did it happen Each network has its own explanation and each has a certain validity Mr Grant when still at NBC credited the strong NBC thrust to the increasing strength of its five daytime serials and three game shows against CBSs eight longrunning serials which he said finally ran out of steam He particularly cited the strong showing of Days of Our Lives which in recent months replaced CBSs As the World Turns as daytimes toprated serial Another factor he said is the strong showing of Dinah Shore in the 10 AM slot against CBSs reruns of Lucille Ball Mr Grant is convinced that TVs morning and afternoon audiences are significantly different and under his direction NBC programed accordingly On the theory that women who make up the vast majority of daytime viewers still have chores to do in the mornings NBC scheduled game shows opposite CBSs lineup of soaps There also have been industry reports that NBC plans to bring in an allnew series of Peyton Place dramas to replace Bright Promise one of its weaker entries daily at 330 PM That too can be credited to Mr Grant Comments by ABC ABC which doesnt really compete with the two other networks until 1130 AM weekdays has parlayed aggressive counterprograming into a successful challenge to both CBS and NBC Michael Eisner ABCs daytime vice president said confidently that CBSs daytime dominance is over and it will have to learn to live with its mistakes for awhile It takes several years to lose momentum in this area he added and it will take at least that long to regain it Mr Eisner attributes the CBS lag to its permitting its daytime serials to grow old in concept and character Some of their main characters have been around for nearly two decades he explained The older generation may identify with them but not the young housewives our advertisers want to reach To capitalize on what he believed were CBSs failures Mr Eisner counterprogramed with four afternoon game shows three soaps including the highly successful series General Hospital and re peats of Love American Style We thought there might be a new audience for Love American Style and we were right he explained Mr Eisner said his networks plans ultimately call for competition across the board in the daytime hours with the other networks but the plan would be developed systematically Projects already announced are a series of monthly madeforTV movies on tape starting this summer and a monthly series of childrens programs for next season CBS candidly admits that its daytime situation is serious but denies emphatically that it is fatal Were still number one at this point in the season said Mr Katz and venture to say we will still be number one when the season is over To make certain it is CBS hired Mr Grant to develop new daytime programing while both play doctor to the networks eight ailing daytime serials four of which are produced by Procter  Gamble Excessive Interference Its our four  Love Is a Many Splendored Thing Love of Life The Secret Storm and Where the Heart Is  which have slipped the most Mr Katz explained He said there had been excessive interference recently in the production and the writing of the CBSproduced shows and every effort was now being made to give the control back to the producers and writers As an example of the problems he has uncovered Mr Katz said one of the serials had nine storylines going at once I couldnt understand what was happening with the help of a story board he declared How could we expect viewers to understand CBS is also bringing back Irna Phillips as the head writer of As the World Turns the serial she created and wrote from 1956 until three years ago in hope of putting the show back on the winning track The network is also killing the repeats of Gomer Pyle weekdays at 4 PM and bringing in a new comedy panel show starting March 27 titled Amateurs Guide to Love Although CBS plans to stay with the soaps for the time being it is committed to replacing any program that does not deliver Meanwhile industry observers will be interested in seeing if Mr Grant the chief architect of NBCs challenge to the throne is equally effective in saving it for CBS
A Professional Volunteer? It's a Term That Fits Many Dedicated Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/23/archives/a-professional-volunteer-its-a-term-that-fits-many-dedicated-women.html,WASHINGTONWhats to replace the useful term housewife on drivers licenses and passports now that it has become a loathsome word to so many of todays women Professional Volunteer has been suggested for those women who give time to their communities PVs would be hired fired trained instructed and appreciated like any other worker but not paid Ideally theyd be reimbursed for expenses like transportation meals or uniforms and could take some sort of tax deduction for hours given In return theyd be responsible for getting their job done regardless of circumstances Mrs Edward P Morgan of McLean Va says this concept has merit and she speaks as an expert A week of her own volunteer activities sometimes sounds like a full schedule plus overtime Wendy Morgan might be called one of the Beautiful People A member of a socially prominent New York family her parents are Mrs Dan Platt Caulkin and W Douglas Burden and a friend since childhood of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Mrs Morgan is elegant in appearance and way of life But her longtime concern is not her social life but population family planning the environmentin fact everything to do with the quality of life Take a look at her calendar Monday Is her executive day when she attends board and committee meetings of the Planned Parenthood Association of Metropolitan Washington of which she is second vice president and chairman of the Expansion and Policy Committee On Tuesdays she is a grassroots volunteer working in the wards at D C General Hospital to give family planning information to patients who have just delivered a baby or had an abortion During the week she often discusses speaking engagements and other educational activities and appears before groups of young people and students in local colleges Knowing money makes the wheels go around she works regularly on fundraising for Planned Parenthood She has also helped raise funds for Friends of the Earth and aided other wildlife and conservation groups On Fridays she is frequently back at Planned Parenthood on M Street at the premarital clinic counseling girls on the various methods of birth control Highly paid professionals have trouble meeting their regular commitments because of the necessity of travel and so does Mrs Morgan As a member of the national board of Planned Parenthood  World Population she attends meetings four times a year usually in New York Recently she spent almost a week in San Francisco at the national Planned Parenthood board meeting These sessions are extremely satisfying but I dont think Ill ever catch up she sighed pointing to the mail piled on her desk Other stacks of materials were waiting to be filed in a cabinet ingeniously concealed under a mahogany bench And theres no secretary to do it Handwritten letters to Congressmen go out on Mrs Morgans personal stationery sometimes a dozen in a week in behalf of family planning bills and appropriations and of measures to prowild life and to curb pollution Her numerous clippings articles and brochures are filed carefully under such headings as Notes from Board Meetings Sex Education Comprehensive Health Plans Antagonistic Viewpoints and Letters to the Editor And in the midst of all this desk work she answers constantly her own phone How does she keep up with these selfimposed tasks I never go out to ladies luncheons or daytime parties she explained And I have a long afternoon to work because my husband [the ABC news commentator] broadcasts late and rarely gets home for dinner before 730 Her workaday world has other special qualities Her desk is an antique French secretary of the Louis XVI period inlaid with cherubs Her office is a library with brightly striped draperies a white floor and velvet armchairs Its large windows overlook a garden that is her major hobby and a heated swimming pool where she swims daily from March until December The Morgans countrystyle house is also home for two daughters Elaine who is studying in Paris and Sage a freshman at Radcliffe Three dogs are much in residence a black poodle and two Norwich terriers Wendy Morgan speaks in fluent selftaught Spanish to the man of many talents who helps take care of the house and six acres of ground Her greatest luxury she considers to be the heated swimming pool In a way it stands for a new kind of life since more than 10 years ago she had an operation for a chronically dislocating knee A staphylococcic infection developed and the knee became fused from the resulting osteomyelitis She was in recurrent pain for several years Now free of pain but with a stiff leg she no longer thinks of herself as a cripple The tennis and dancing she loved are still possible and she tends her plants in a specially built waisthigh garden Swimming as therapy with strenuous exercise in the pool to keep limber she says has restored her health and physical fitness Her husband also swims for exercise We go out on almost freezing days wrapped in toweling robes she exclaimed Its wonderful Occasionally I have a friend over to swim my one bit of daytime social life Mrs Morgan came from a family long involved in community work Her father W Douglas Burden has spent much of his life as a naturalist developing the first Marineland in Florida and a nature preserve in Vermont now a foundation used by Middlebury College Mrs Cass Canfield her aunt has devoted years first to Planned Parenthood then to establishing the Margaret Sanger Research Institute in New York Mr Canfield has been president of Planned Parenthood  World Population They were already talking constantly in the forties of ecology overpopulation and dangers to the environment Mrs Morgan commented She began her volunteer work during her teens working as a nurses aide at Bellevue Hospital in New York On moving to Washington in the fifties she helped with a variety of benefit projects and charity balls but without finding any real continuity of satisfaction When she began recovering from her serious leg complications she moved completely away from socialite activities About eight years ago she volunteered at Planned Parenthoods central M Street clinic where she served for several years as a receptionist It may be considered a lowly job she commented but I found being a receptionist interesting and important There is a chance to know staff and patients and whats going on I felt at the center of things Im not an organizer she insisted I love my house and garden I like doing errands and going to the market I want time to be with my family and to give occasional dinner parties with interesting guests that my husband and I enjoy As for her work she explained A volunteer has a marvelous freedom to do the lowliest manual job or take a top policymaking role all in the same day It seems to me the greatest privilege is to work hard for something you care about
Coast Archbishop Institutes Some Reforms,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/23/archives/coast-archbishop-institutes-some-reforms.html,LOS ANGELES Jan 22Last month The Tidings the newspaper of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese here displayed two frontpage pictures of Archbishop Timothy Manning leading a pilgrimage of 200 priests and laymen to Mexico City The newspaper also reported that Bishop Juan Arzube of Los Angeles preaching in Spanish gave thanks to Our Lady of Guadeloupe the patroness of Mexico for the faith language and culture the early Mexican missionaries brought to California That pilgrimage illustrates some of the changes that have occurred in the two years since Archbishop Manning replaced Francis Cardinal McIntyre as head of the countrys fourth largest archdiocese During his 22year tenure Cardinal McIntyre was known as The Builder He constructed an average of a school a month for many years to accommodate the great wave of migration that washed over Southern California He was also known as an archconservative who opposed virtually every attempt to reform the role of the clergy or get the church more involved in contemporary social issues In contrast Archbishop Manning has turned his attention to the problems of the poor particularly the MexicanAmericans who account for more than onehalf of the archdioceses 17 million parishioners Problems of Priests He has also focused on the problems of his priests who are increasingly dissatisfied with their traditional disciplines and functions In the last five years the archdiocese has lost about 10 per cent of its 700 priests Last June the local seminary ordained only six new ones compared to an average of 16 in earlier years A recent article in The National Catholic Reporter which usually represents a liberal viewpoint said that Archbishop Manning probably comes as close to the ideal of a saint possible in this Brave New World That assessment is not universally shared Some laymen and priests are saying that the honeymoon is over that Archbishop Manning has made some gesturessuch as the pilgrimagebut few basic changes They note that he served as an auxiliary bishop under Cardinal McIntyre for 20 years and has retained most of his predecessors key staff personnel The Archbishop takes a very traditional stand on such issues as birth control and the celibacy of the priesthood He has refused to make a public statement against the Vietnam war beyond supporting the National Conference of Catholic Bishops which first condemned the war last November Kind of Naive Some of us were filled with a great deal of hope when Manning came in but I suppose that was kind of naive said Thomas Jolicoeur president of the Los Angeles Association of Laymen After all he is an FBIforeignborn Irishand a safe member of the club He wouldnt have been appointed if he werent safe Hes very hung up on the idea of authority Just about everyone agrees that the Archbishop is a good listener He has celebrated mass at about 150 of the archdioceses 300 parishes sometimes in Spanish and tried to meet as many members of his vast flock as possible Even his sharpest critics find him accessible The Archbishop believes that the church will stand or fall on the well  being of the priests and he has made special effort to listen to them For instance he started priests senate that has counseled him on such matters as the creation of a permanent deaconate and a retirement plan for older priests One young priest who differs with the Archbishop on many issues said There is sense of openness about the whole archdiocese today a sense that you can do lots of things on your own provided you stay within certain guidelines Many younger priests are frustrated because the structure is still dominated by the older pastors but there is much less fear Things are handled more openly and humanely In regard to the MexicanAmerican community the Archbishop has created an inter  parochial council composed of 20 parishes in the East Side barrio The councils first project is a voter registration drive financed with 5000 from the Bishops Fund for Human Development The church has also established a center to deal with Chicano immigration problems and expanded its bilingual adult education courses But these innovations have not satisfied everyone A group called Catolicos Por La Raza a militant Chicano organization has charged that Manning throws crumbs to the people and expects them to love him Another area the Archbishop feels strongly about is family life He has established a new bureau that will provide economic medical legal and psychiatric counseling for troubled couples As he explained in a recent interview Take all the crises of the day and they have their origin in family lifethe breakup of homes divorce the questions of abortion and contraception care of the aged The basic virtues a youngster needs respect for authority docility a cleanness of approach to life even the concept of patriotismstand or fall by the family relationship Respect for authority the Archbishop conceded is not a popular notion today There is too much emphasis on the sanctity of the individual conscience I think its overstressed myself he said We forget that conscience is only a hereandnow judgment it does not deter from the rightness or wrongness of a thing Conflict With Teachings Here as elsewhere this is the root of the churchs problem the conflict of individual conscience with established teachings And many Catholics feel that the Archbishop has little power to deal with that conflict Great confusion has developed in the whole field of moral theology observed a former nun Books are being written that take positions quite at variance with the morality we all grew up with In that situation its very hard to provide leadership I really dont know what the bishops can do I dont envy them One result of this confusion is that some Catholics are beginning to feel that the church as an institution is irrelevant to their religious life According to Mr Jolicoeur about half of the founders of the laymens association no longer attend mass regularly A lot of people who still think of themselves very much as Catholics said one woman dont think much about the church

Abortion Clinic Formally Opens As Nearby Church Tolls Protest,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/27/archives/abortion-clinic-formally-opens-as-nearby-church-tolls-protest.html,A new family planning and abortion clinic held an open house yesterday afternoon while directly across Second Avenue at 22d Street a Roman Catholic church tolled its hell every seven seconds for four hours in protest The open house was held to proclaim the formal opening of the Planned Parenthood Center at 380 Second Avenue where in addition to contraceptive counseling abortions will be performed in the morning and vasectomies in the afternoon and patients will be able to pay with credit cards While visitors from charitable and city agencies were shown through the fourthfloor clinic and as the bell from the Church of the Epiphany rang solemnly across the street a dozen women and one man picketed the clinic building with signs saying Abortion is murder The Rev Francis Costello the pastor of the church said that during the last six months while the clinic was being built a number of his parishioners wrote to officials of Beth Israel Hospital  the backup hospital that the City Health Code requires for an abortion clinic  protesting the construction Tolling Explained This facility doesnt belong in this neighborhood the pastor said If it belongs anywhere it belongs at La Guardia Airport for those who come to the city for this kind of operation In this neighborhood most of the people are old The plan to toll the church bell was explained in a parish newsletter last Sunday It also mentioned the open house at which Gordon Chase the citys Administrator of Health Services was the guest of honor The newsletter went on to say that In the interest of community participation the bells would toll during the open house from 3 to 7 PM The pastor had asked the parishioners during the Sunday services to come to the church and meditate and during the afternoon a number of people mostly women did come to the church to pray silently The pickets however were not from Father Costellos church Largest Center A number came from Right to Life chapters in Brooklyn and Rockland County The organization is a predominantly Catholic group opposed to abortions Upstairs in the clinic the visitors were shown through the treatment recovery and counseling rooms In one of which cocktails were served It was explained that this was the newest largest and most comprehensive of the eight centers operated by Planned Parenthood of New York City a nonprofit organization According to Judith Cohen a public information assistant for the agency the Second Avenue facility will be the first Planned Parenthood center to provide vasectomies The fees for this operation as for abortions are geared to income with a top charge of about 150 The center has actually been in operation since Dec 7 Miss Cohen said and in that time weve served 1251 patients Of these she said 272 were women who had abortions Alfred F Moran the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood of New York said at the open house that 12000 patients were expected at the center this year Not Insensitive As to the bells tolling outside Mr Moran said the officers of Planned Parenthood were not insensitive to the churchs feelings But he added we had other factors to consider First there was space Here we have 17000 square feet And rent was a big dictation Were paying 2 per square foot a year We had to find a fireproof building and then under the Health Code an abortion clinic has to be within a 10minute ride of its backup hospital So we were pretty constricted in our choice of site Before we signed the lease Mr Moran said we checked very carefully if there was any conflict with zoning regulations and there was none In honoring Mr Chase the Planned Parenthood officials presented him with a plaque in recognition of wise leadership and strong commitment in planning and directing the provision of safe legal abortions to New York City residents and nonresidents alike on an unprecedented scalean achievement that stands as a model for the rest of the nation As Mr Chase left the clinic the women from Right to Life were still outside passing out leaflets One of them Mrs Margaret Fitton of West Nyack commented to her friend as they walked in the cold Perhaps its good that this place is across the street from a church Maybe some woman will look at the church as she is about to enter the door here and have another thought and do what is right
"Canadian Judge, Acting for Husband and Fetus, Bars an Abortion",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/29/archives/canadian-judge-acting-for-husband-and-fetus-bars-an-abortion.html,OTTAWA Jan 28A judge acting on behalf of a man and the infant plaintiff the unborn child has issued apermanent injunction restraining his wife from having an abortion Lawyers say it is the first such injunction issued in Canada The court order handed down in Ottawa on Wednesday by Justice Abraham H Lieff of the Ontario Supreme Court has stirred anew the controversy over Canadian laws that permit women to obtain abortions for therapeutic reasons determined by a committee of hospital doctors Lawyers in the Department of Justice studied the judgment which A J Currie the departments expert on abortion laws said really is a precedent In the Right Direction David Dehler the lawyer who successfully sought the injunction commented Its a first in Canada He told reporters that from now on even when both parents and a hospital committee approved an abortion a third party could prevent the abortion on behalf of the fetus The next step is to have a guardian appointed for all unborn children in Ontario said Mr Dehler In an editorial calling for an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada The Globe and Mail of Toronto said of the Lieff decision We can only add the fervent hope that it will also be the last While those favoring abortion reform assailed the the decision as disastrous other Canadians defended it Dr Heather Morris a Toronto obstetrician who heads the 10000member Alliance for Life group said Any move that will prevent the destruction of an innocent human being is a move in the right direction The husband and wife whose names were withheld from the public on Justice Lieffs order are Frenchborn residents of community near Ottawa Married in France in 1958 they migrated to Canada in 1963 and have four children aged four to 12 The wife a 37yearold teacher was 16 weeks pregnant when she went to Riverside Hospital in Ottawa about an abortion last month The operation was recommended by Dr Andrew Fuzi who according to her husbands testimony said that a continued pregnancy would risk the mothers life and might result in an abnormal baby At first the husband approved of Dr Fuzis recommendation but then took his wife to her former physician in Montreal who prescribed medicine and rest The husband said that on learning this Dr Fuzi1 was furious and persuaded the wife to consult Dr John Andrews an obstetrician at Riverside Hospital Later the hospital committee on abortions approved the operation The husband told the court that Dr Andrews told him the decision had been based on principles of a philosophic order At this point the husband objected and in the court action said he opposed the abortion which will kill my child
"‘Doctor, do we have a choice?’",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/30/archives/-doctor-do-we-have-a-choice-the-baby-is-a-mongoloid-if-he-is-to.html,IN the grim drama of surgery the pediatric surgeons lot is usually a happy one He operates on critically ill newborn infants and gives them the 70 years life expectancy of which nature would have deprived them The baby is a mongoloid If he is to live surgery will be necessary A surgeon tells how he allows parents to make the lifeordeath decision A common script for practitioners of my specialty Baby is born with a portion of his intestines missing his food and intestinal juices swell his little belly he vomits repeatedly and will die if nothing is done Enter the pediatric surgeon He performs a 45minute operation the intestine is rejoined digestion proceeds unimpeded and a healthy infant goes home with his happy parents Events unfortunately do not always follow this cheerful script Sometimes a baby with this new gift of years has a digestive tract that is superior in potential to that of his brain He is a mongoloid About 1 in 600 births in the United States is a baby with Downs syndrome  mongolism John Langdon Haydon Down who described this form of mental retardation about 100 years ago thought that the Oriental appearance common to children with mongolism proved an ancient link between the Caucasian and Oriental races We dont know much more about why mongoloid children look the way they do than Down did but we tend to reject the simple notion that these severely retarded youngsters are throwbacks to a more primitive race of man Geneticists have found that mongoloids have an extra chromosome inside the cell nucleus They should have 46 like you and me instead they have 47 The chromosomes carry the genes which determine all our characteristics from the color of our eyes to the potential size of our brain Why that 47th chromosome causes a baby to have slanted eyes broad nose a protruding tongue a single crease running the breadth of his palm and an IQ of 30 we dont know yet Most mongoloid infants survive the traumas of birth and proceed into infancy but many are born with lethaldefects such as congenital heart disease and ob3tructed intestines Not very many years ago such babies were not salvageable and physicians and parents alike were relieved when a merciful God prevented the survival of what was then called a mongolian idiot But we have learned how to operate on the intestines and even the hearts of newborns As women get deeper into middle age their chances of bearing a mongoloid child increase Miss H a busy attorney was well into her 30s when she married her law partner Mr G Three years later their efforts to have a baby were finally rewarded by a fourandonehalf pound premature infant unmistakably mongoloid Happiness dissolved into grief shock rage and disbelief How could this happen to us Why did this happen to us ThenAre you sure doctor We were sure An examination of the nuclear material of the babys blood cells showed the extra chromosome The Gs were faced with a difficult choice take home this bitter fruit of their years of dreaming or place him in an institution and banish him from home and mind But at age two days Baby G changed the options He vomited every feeding spitting up a combination of formula and bile He had an intestinal obstruction Surgery was necessary Twentyfive years ago a newborn with a blocked intestinal tract stood less than a 5050 chance of surviving surgery Many surgeons would have considered such surgery in an obviously mongoloid infant not worth the risk and effort With the development of pediatric surgery and the better understanding of the differences between newborns and adults surgery and anesthesia have improved to the point where operations on tiny infants are routine An instance of intestinal surgery on a newborn mongoloid which would have been considered heroic surgery a few years ago was described in a recent newspaper article as a simple operation Baby Gs pediatrician expected me to perform this simple operation The internes and residents were eager to assist the anesthetist was standing by Then Mr G asked Dont we have any choice And indeed I felt they did The choice they made wasno surgery They had no intention of raising a human being whose maximum achievement might be the ability to write his own name Furthermore they did not wish to sentence their child to an institutional existence If I knew the baby would be mongoloid Mrs G said I would have had an abortion This argument allowed the Gs to live with their decision When Mr G called me a year later on the anniversary of their babys death and asked me if thought they had made the right decision I said Yes think you did Another parent who opted for no surgery was a physician who called me a few hours after we had diagnosed intestinal obstruction in his newborn mongoloid son The first thing Dr L asked was What would you do if he were your son I am asked this frequently by parents of terribly deformed or severely retarded infants who need surgical attention in order to survive In many cases if it were my own child I would refuse to allow any measures other than simple procedures to relieve terminal suffering But in the case of other peoples children I feel that as a physician I must reserve more of a sense of objectivity I told Dr L that he and his wife must make the decision but that we would help them arrive at a decision and support them in whatever they decided There are many people who can help parents like the Ls to reach a decisionpediatricians genetic counselors social workers psychologists psychiatrists clergy representatives of institutions for the retarded family or friends with similar problems and of course their own family physician A decision need not be made hastily By feeding the baby intravenously and by keeping his stomach and intestines from becoming distended by the use of a stomach tube attached to a suction pump we can keep him alive and relatively comfortable for at least a few days My colleague Dr N envies Mr G and Dr L Dr N has two mongoloid children both in a private institution costing him 1000 a month Dr N had originally placed the youngsters in a state institution after he and his wife had made an unsuccessful effort to raise them with their two normal children While in the ancient understaffed state building the children were constantly dirty and required hospitalization for one infection after another This was more than the Ns could stand Paying 1000 a month allows them to sleep at night I know many physicians with mongoloid children Almost all have placed them in institutions Couples who are successoriented and have high expectations for their children are likely to institutionalize their mentally deficient offspring rather than keep them at home The argument that mongoloids raised in the home perform better than those raised in an institution is rarely persuasive with such parents On the other hand I operated on the mongoloid child of a farm couple who had several other children working in their fields They were far from welltodo but they were a happy family The parents viewed this mongoloid baby as a child who would stay with them on the farm when the others had gone their ways Such parents as these with lesser expectations are more likely to insist that everything be done for their mongoloid baby and to welcome it into their homes SOME of my surgical colleagues have unyielding philosophical positions that enable them to take a consistent stand with respect to each mongoloid infant they see in consultation These positions enable them to keep their emotional involvement minimal One surgeon feels that the infants mongolism is not relevant to his need for surgery He cites Article II of the Declaration of General and Special Rights of the Mentally Retarded which was adopted by the Assembly of the International League of Societies for the Mentally Handicapped in 1968 The mentally retarded person has a right to proper medical care and physical restoration as will enable him to develop his ability and potential to the fullest possible extent no matter how severe his degree of disability To this surgeon not to operate is a basic violation of the right of a person to live it is murder The problem is equally simple to another colleague He will not operate on any mongoloid infant He feels that the burden inflicted on the family and on society by the emotional and financial costs involved are too great to justify the procedure He is particularly irked by parents who insist that everything he done to save their mongoloid infant and then place the baby in an institution to be supported by the taxpayers I find it impossible to adopt a rigid view one way or the other I have seen families emotionally and financially drained by mongoloid children whose congenital heart defects and extraordinary susceptibility to infection bring them repeatedly to deaths door I have seen marriages destroyed by the inability of the partners to deal with the guilt and mutual recriminations stirred up by a mongoloid child Although most parents allow the necessary surgery many of them would be relieved to have their mongoloid die Some have strong guilt feelings which are not dispelled by our sophisticated knowledge of genes and chromosomes Such parents do not consider a lethal birth defect as a second chance to abort a mongoloid baby but feel their guilt would be increased if they did not grant the infant the cghance of life As a decision with respect to surgery is delayed the baby himself becomes a major spokesman in his own behalf Even individuals firmly committed to an active eugenic policy may weaken when confronted with the pink crying kicking gurgling infant despite its slanty eyes and big tongue The attitudes of the Gs and the Ls were unusual since most of the couples know who have actually seen their mongoloid babies and held them rarely decide to withhold lifesaving surgery Of course once the parents make the decision that the baby should survive my team and I will work on that baby with every tool and skill in our surgical armamentarium to pull him through as we did when the middleaged wife of a wealthy executive gave birth to a mongoloid on whom operated within hours after its birth This couple had looked forward to having a baby for years The nursery was decorated The road to college and success was plainly marked In spite of their disappointment they were willing to accept this infant and asked that everything be done The surgery went well but subsequently heart failure developed in an irreparably defective heart This story had a happy ending One year later the couple adopted a normal little girl rescuing a bright youngster from institutional life It is a dilemma for our society the emotional and fi nancial resources of many families are poured out for helpless retardates while children with real potential are stunted in institutions or a series of foster homes PARENTS of mongoloids have the legal and I believe the moral responsibility of determining if their child with a potentially deadly but surgically correctible defect should live or die The surgeons responsibilities to the parents include being completely honest allowing them to make a decision based on fact with respect to the childs ultimate capabilities and providing sustained emotional support Should the surgeon undertake responsibility for operating on the baby he must despite any philosophical reservations go all out to achieve the same results he would strive for in a normal infant Where surgery is denied he must try to keep the infant from suffering while natural forces sap the babys life away As a surgeon whose natural inclination is to use the scalpel to fight off death standing by and watching a salvageable baby die is the most emotionally exhausting experience I know It is easy at a conference in a theoretical discussion to decide that such infants should be allowed to die It is altogether differ and watch as dehydration and infection wither a tiny being over hours and days This is terrible ordeal for me and the hospital staffmuch more so than for the parents who never set foot in the nursery The science of genetics combined with effective counseling will ultimately lead to a downward spiral of the mongoloid birth rate Geneticists have already made significant progress by using a highly accurate technique called amniocentesis Some of the fluid which continually bathes the fetus in the uterus is drawn off through a needle inserted into the womb Living fetal cells floating in this fluid can be grown in the laboratory and their chromosomes inspected Amniocentesis cannot be performed safely prior to the 13th or 14th week of pregnancy and it takes an additional few weeks to grow the cells for chromosome analysis We would prefer to detect mongolism earlier in pregnancy when abortion is simpler and safer The few geneticists who have had a large experience with amniocentesis however feel that the technique can be of significant benefit right now Women who might choose to have their pregnancies interrupted if they knew they were nurturing a those over the age of 40 whose chances of having an infant with a serious chromosome abnormality is about 1 in 40 and a mongoloid infant in particular is 1 in 100 It would also include those younger women who have already given birth to a mongoloid infant and the rare young woman who though normal herself has a chromosome abnormality which predisposes a high proportion of her offspring to mongolism In the meantime mongoloids are still being born at the rate of about 1 in 600 Perhaps society should assume more of the decisionmaking responsibility for those who require surgery for survival And if the decision is in favor of life society must provide the necessary funds and facilities to meet the continuing medical and psychological needs of these unfortunate children It seems to me that a society which does not provide for its defectives is less than humane In the absence of some sort of uniform social philosophy we physicians who deal with mongoloid children must view each one and its family as unique and try to react with a combination of sound judgment and compassion for the parents and the baby and the society in which they live
Metamorphosis of The Campus Radical,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/30/archives/metamorphosis-of-the-campus-radical-campus-radical.html,IOWA CITY I AM a born habitual New Yorker and nothing surprises me more than to be living in Iowa unless it is that as a former Ivy Leaguer and editor I am now a teacher at the University of Iowa Iowa City is Grant Woods town surrounded by his cornfields and cluttered with the AmericanGothic houses which the Eastern eye takes some months to find appealing On the street you see an occasional bonneted Amish woman in town for a visit to the dentist or an occasional farmer making a deposit at the bank but most of the people who pass and smile are university students There are 20000 here attractive kids many of the girls fair and finefeatured with the Scandinavian look of their farming forebears The boys are of course bearded and longhaired and the fashions of the times overalls boots goldrimmed spectacles granny skirts and shawls give the town the look of a period pieceeveryone made up for a revival of Oklahoma The illusion of yesterday was shattered for me shortly after my arrival here two years ago One midnight I saw crowds of students running through the streets to confront platoons of county police spacemen in their helmets and plastic visors and in the morning I stood looking into the smoking ruin of what had been the Rhetoric Building Now again at the beginning of 1972 the feeling here as on other campuses is of relative serenity Student steam has worked off in a political campaign that saw a favorite candidate elected to the City Council and last years window busters are busy with daycare centers and healthfood cooperatives The silence in town is such that casual observers size up the mood as a new campus apathy and suggest it is a return to the political indifference of the nineteenfiftiesbut it is not that at all MOST students maintain about the same enthusiasm for campus politics as for the fortunes of the chess team Just as always the preoccupation for a majority seems to be pleasure and for a minority scholarship They are obsessive about it grudgingly giving attention to social issues and yet there is evidence of change in the last year or so and of a new homogenized sort of student Linda Kelsey a graduate student in astronomy an Iowan from neighboring North Liberty and a selfconfessed straight says that the traditional straights as well as the radical kids have all but vanished from the campus She explains The new student is involved curious experimental introspective in a way that makes me wonder what the drug culture has to do with it Im convinced he registers for astronomy under the impression its astrology Hes moved to the left but at the same time hes lost interest in collective action Although hes frustrated in many of the old ways hes an individual and wants only to persuade few friends At the Beta house on Dubuque Street David Stryker a junior from Davenport explains this private intensity in more practical terms You know the big issue for us is eco nomic With all these guys coming back from Vietnam flooding the market its going to be tough getting a job Weve never studied so hard in our lives Gerry Denning a senior Phi Beta Kappa history student from an Iowa farm family recalls that in his freshman year his dorm was an intellectual pressure cooker There was this feeling of talking with kids beyond my intelligence and I was attracted to the radicals and their utopian hopes because they were the plowshare of the liberal movement The violence turned him off the radicalism now he regards those of his radical friends from his freshman year who continue to suffer from extremism as pathetic humorous figures just as he views the left as moribund and Womens Lib as a stupid issuethe dead left flogging a dead horse Day care If a man deserves anything in this life its to spend the first years of it with his mother and not with a mess of somebody elses screaming In the handsomely furnished lounge of Alpha Phi a sorority near my house Lee Tysseling a junior told me she had been out there in 70 and far more earnest about it than most of the others who were merely taking a look at the zoo and wanting to get out of classes She claims to be apolitical now along with five out of six of her old radical friends But when Ellen Langrehr her classmate said she didnt agree with the radicals then any  more than she does now and indicated a position Mr Nixon could find little to argue with there was a noticeable crackle of electricity between the two girlsenough I suspected to strain sisterly feelings For those few who do care about politics the student body is a great sleeping beast which they are forever trying to prod awake A bar and pizza joint which the student corporation opened this year is called The Hulk after the fanciful Marvel Comics figure created by Stan Lee He is a shambling brute alter ego to Bruce Banner a conscientious scientist The Hulk is in fact a goodnatured gentle fellow but when confused or misunderstood he is capable of a destructiveness that can be measured on a seismograph The Hulk the management explains is the symbol of latent student power not dimwitted exactly but vulnerable and with tendency to be misled THERE are two kinds of political students herestraight and radical You cannot tell them apart by their look which is stylishhobo nor their speech which is reasonable and precise although ridden with the drugculture clichs Neither likes things as they are and there is general agreement on endsa more humanized university and power for themselves power over people the immediate environment and ultimately the nation The disagreement is over means The radicals are few a scarcely discernible number in so large a state school as this one and some of them have only a tenuous relationship to the university Yet their effect on student thought is considerable Their show is altogether separate from the straight one and customarily excludes it For one thing the radicals scorn formal politics believing it is inherently corrupt They find their alternative in grass roots activity some issue around which they can muster and then disband before be coming institutionalized Institutions they say make people subject to them rather than the other way around The projects they seek are necessary services they can provide free or nearly so to everyone They have found plenty herethe Crisis Center a community referral service for every sort of serious problem day care free medical and legal services the Womens Center At the University of Iowa last years window busters are this years baby sitters vegetable gardeners and abortion counselors Characteristically the radicals separate their careers from what they must do to earn a living They will work 18 hours a week driving truck to get what they need to live and thats it The rest is career time which they freely admit may be no more than smoking a little grass with my friends but will probably include giving service to day care antiwar work womens rights or whatever This livelihood pattern is a reaction to their parents spending 60 hours a week at a job only to find life has become complex and unsatisfying The concept of saving yourself for yourself has even emerged in the fringes of the professional schools where it is regarded with the kind of alarm that might greet the diagnoses of a case Radicals do not buy new cars but prefer old trucks and buses sharing again being together and they avoid new clothes and haircuts which like all finery they see as success symbols and an enslavement Straights although just as leery of the barber have no objection to new cars and are very much into organization The daddy of them is Jim Sutton who came to the universitys Writers Workshop in 1965 and is one of those perennial graduate students here He is a short fellow with heavy black mustache and intense dark looks His father was Greek a waiter with a love for Xenophon who on emigrating to Boston saw his son through the Latin School and Brown University Jim Sutton describes himself as an esthetic anarchist and his role at Iowa as similar to that of the French philosophes He begins with the belief that student interest comes first that students musthave the best education at lowest cost Before Sutton student government concerned itself mainly with transportation to the Rose Bowl games and such but in 68 as a student senator Sutton clashed with university president Howard R Bowen over tuition increases suggesting they were to pay teachers who didnt teach He threatened court action based on Lernfreiheit a free dom to learn which he explained to the dubious Bowen dated from the founding of the University of Paris The core of Suttons reasoning is still the concept of the medieval university Its the only human kind he says one in which students hire and fire their instructors Sutton further believes that student power depends on freedom from the tyranny of the university treasury Soon after he was elected student body president in 69 he conceived and established a student corporation Iowa Student Agencies which today runs a dozen profitable enterprises funds as many essential services and just as he predicted is the backbone of burgeoning student power But for all Jim Suttons concern for The Human University and his belief in the orderly government that will bring it about he admits the recent spectacular political history here has been written around the antiwar movement ground preempted by the radicals FOR the past five years students at Iowa as at every American university have detested the war and felt they were its goats Moreover as impressionable high school kids they had seen the Berkeley riots on TV and recognized in militancy some of the same heroism their fathers had seen in sports or on the battlefield itself Nevertheless the SDS saw students as in need of education Consciousnessraising they called it trying to make the kids aware they could do things At Iowa the SDS and its associated Hawkeye Student party handed out leaflets demonstrated risked being busted made militancy important and exciting Four years ago in November 1967 the core group of SDS concluded that the university had no business being hospitable to the military or related industry and decided to harass the visiting Marine recruiters A graduate assistant aided by a student nurse got the consciousnessawakening off to a bloody start A quart of the reddest was siphoned from a dozen willing arms used as ink for a giant antiwar petition and the balance spilled on the steps of the Union a student center where the pickets tramped it back and forth While 2000 students watched from across the street a salient of jocks tried to clear a path to the Marines inside the Union At least one freshman until that moment uncommitted was moved to join the protest by the sight of a wellknown football player and fraternity man slugging a peace marcher The day ended in the arrest of 108 pickets A month later on Dec 5 the SDS decided to storm the Dow representatives interviewing at the Union For this performance Mr Death was played by David Grant a black student from St Louis who recently changed his name to David Sundance at a campus Indian ceremony Costumed in dark burnoose carrying a scythe he presided over a fireplace in which dolls turned on a spit and a tape recorder provided sounds of crying children The demonstrators did not reach the Dow people but met police lines and Mace the first use of it on the Iowa campus They marched on the station house and confronted the police again in the Pentacrest the center of the campus and the site of the handsome classic Old State Capitol building Here David Sundance placed an empty box dangling a fuse bearing the legend Dow Means Death at the feet of the police They watched the fuse sizzle for an instant then rushed and arrested him along with 18 others The Hulk was stirring David Helland a big blond softspoken Iowan then a freshman and a hawk was getting into stuff about the war I hadnt heard in high school or read in The Des Moines Register I began reading the SDS handouts and Ramparts The issues were fresh and important and I began to think I could do something about them Debbie Bayer also a freshman that year but wholly committed recalls It was really nice then They were the bad guys and we were the good guys Everybody who was a writer or an artist or smoked dope was us All liberals and radicals came together as friends and everybody who got arrested was cool and we knew what was happening Debbie is from Chicago Her crinkly hair parted in the middle falls in corkscrews to her shoulders A generous warmth pinks her cheeks as she talks We were really awakening consciousness she says More people were beginning to smoke dope Thats very political and rebellious you know middleclass people doing something illegal Dope in your pocket changes your whole point of view Youve been taught to trust police and fear black people and then you begin to turn it around and become aware of all the injustice THE revolutionary cycle had turned through its first phase of consciousnessraising and of comingtogether on the transcendent issue of the war Nevertheless formal politics bumbled on largely unaffected and in March 1970 the usual few thousand students who bothered to vote elected Jim Suttons candidate Bo Beller to the presidency Beller is from a rich Glencoe Ill family and goes out of his way to disguise it He looks like a disheveled young Ben Franklin Although progressive he is introspective noncharismatic and was illprepared for the spectacular rebellion which engulfed the university within a month of his taking office marking the second climactic phase of the revolutionary cycle Throughout the early months of 1970 the SDS had been arguing for the ouster of the ROTC unit and on Thursday April 30 when President Nixon announced he was sending troops into Cambodia the controversy flared On May Day 500 students gathered outside the Field House Armory forced open its doors harassed cadets and injured a campus cop Police were mobilized and university authorities called on Bo Beller to get on a mike and tell em to leave Youre the student body president Bo was of two minds While his sympathies lay with the insurgents his job made him an arm of university authority With obvious ambivalence he urged the crowd to break up and it did so sullenly as police arrived Over that weekend the radical groups set up tables in the dormitories where they handed out leaflets and rapped Just as the smoke grew denser at the sessions so did the tension to hang in combustible layers over the town On Monday the torch was flung At 1230 in the afternoon four students were shot and killed by National Guardsmen at Kent State University and evening brought the scene into awed circles gathered around television sets in the Union the dorms and fraternities On the screen the Hulk had witnessed its assassination at the hand of the Federal Government and concluded the radicals had been right all along The Establishment was a conspiracy of Government and corporation against the young But the essential emotion was not vindictive it was an exalted pure one There was a new sense of community a feeling that students at Iowa were not isolated were one with other universities across the land There was hope involved a belief that young people could take control of their own situation and and do responsible things Finally their cause now had its martyrs and with them a righteous That night some 600 students marched to the National Guard Armory in Iowa City then through town bashing in store windows as they went and skirmishing with police By dawn there were 50 arrests However the focus of campus attention went to the nationwide student strike to protest the Cambodian invasion The campus newspaper The Daily Iowan was first to propose it and on Tuesday May 5 student president Beller announced the strike would begin the following day Willard Boyd who had succeeded Bowen as university president urged that the day be one of personal conscience and above all else a day of On the eve of the strike about 4000 students gathered at the Pentacrest The Old Capitols white columns had been sprayed with great DayGlo letters ROTC and from its steps speakers bullhomed the old consciousnessraising slogans But there was no longer a need The Hulk was not only awake it was trembling with emotions it had no idea how to release THIS was the moment both straights and radicals thought might never come and ironically neither had a plan for it The important events which now occurred were spontaneous Hearing that vigilante groups were on their way from Northern Iowa Bill Schmidt a Californian and Howie Weinberg a bushbearded New Yorker prepared to combat violence They proclaimed themselves the monitors recruited friends tied white bands on their arms set up a medical tent called university hospi tals for assistance and organized a communications net with police and National Guard units The monitors  role sympathetic and protective toward the students was welcome As the strikers sat down in the highways which pass through the city and the traffic jams spread the monitors calmed thwarted motorists acted as buffer between the crowd and the police lines drawn to contain it Then as cries of Strike echoed through the throng the need for a program and leadership became obvious The speakers huddled urged all concerned to follow them to the Union and there in the ballroom a procession of candidates for a Strike Coordinating Committee offered themselves The assembly shouted its endorsement or witheld it and when complete the committee consisted of 10 students predominantly radical professing themselves militant but nonviolent The elected student government headed by Bo Beller was thus ignored and toppled The Hulk had formed a new one to climax its revolution The strike was judged about 30 per cent effective but in the balmy weather the rally at the Pentacrest became continuous Its concerns now turned to declarations of righteousness or more precisely to provocation and reprisal LATE one night a few students broke into the Old Capitol and did some damage whereupon the police ordered the campus cleared and made 227 arrests Among those arrested were four blacks who had been hovering near the window of a downtown jeweler and next day in consequence a band of 100 marched on the police station It was warned off at gunpoint while two of its members were beaten in plain view The confrontation became silent and combustible a moment in which anything might happen but its spell was broken when one veteran radical said Theres a time you fight and a time you dont Lets go Those raw unsatisfied emotions were still at large when shortly after midnight on that same Friday university president Boyd joined the procession of speakers on the Old Capitol steps He spoke for 20 minutes in his forthright way indicating an understanding of the students feelings but explaining the legal complexity of an ROTC eviction He urged them to complete the semester At 3 AM with the campus restored to quiet the monitors easing their vigil and going off to bed the police chief relieving all but his skeleton force until noon the night went suddenly bright The Rhetoric Building a temporary structure built in 1948 was ablaze It lighted up all lower Washington Street turning the facade of the huge Main Library bright orange The fire departmeht could do no more than save the nearby buildings By dawn Rhetoric was a heap of ashes Students came throughout the day as to a lyinginstate to stare in awe at the charred steel of chairs and desks the file cabinets still smoking to murmur among themselves that the cause of the fire was unknown but surely no accident and that two professors had lost the work of their lifetimes in the flames Although the Student Senate called upon president Boyd to close the university that day he offered an alternative plan that allowed students to leave the campus without penaltyand most of them did gravely feeling that keen queasy remorse which follows excess and grateful the summer lay ahead for its cure Those who stayed went to teachins and when they passed the debris on Washington Street remembered Rhetoric was no more than a wooden barracks and agreed that architecturally the loss was something of a blessing IT may not be significant that in the next election the Hulk rejected Bo Bellers candidates a coalition of longhaired progressives and chose instead Ted Politis but Politis thinks it is A longfaced Greek boy from Ames he is as hardnosed as Beller is reflective Im more practical Ted Politis admits The past was more on noise than results Students didnt want the radicals I was out there in 70 but there was only a core of fighters Most of them were out to enjoy the fine weather The rest were tired of studying and felt theyd been cheated by some Iowa City businessmen They were going to end war by ending school and then forget about it for a year When they came back in the fall they were thinking about football games and ripple wine Students have gotten more practical now he explains They recognize that change can only be accomplished from a financial power base So were getting out of the clouds of social change and onto the ground of it Change depends on money and trust and people trust you if you have it and manage it responsibly Politiss administration has taken Suttons corporate Iowa Student Agencies and built it into a bustling enterprise which has already taken in and paid out twice as much money as previous administrations In addition to The Hulk it has started a coop bookstore maintains legal services for draft counseling and advice to tenants and funds such social services as the Crisis Center Last spring Politis was prepared for a bust which would equal the previous years He deputized a troop of monitors and as it turned out they were needed for May Day ushered in a fortnight of peace rallies and skirmishes with the police It was the final phase of the revolutionary cycle a time of parade of a challenging of motives and of squabbling over them On Wednesday May 5 a large crowd was drawn to the Pentacrest by the rumor that in emulation of Indochina war tactics a dog was to be burned on the Old Capitol steps When it was learned that no consenting animal could be found the crowd moved off The demonstrators were in an exuberant mood as they trooped the business district in a show of righteous force but here they were menaced and scattered by a fastmoving pickup truck bearing the name Barnys DX a nearby gas station The air of a traditional collegiate rite turned vindictive as the demonstrators converged on Barnys DX broke its windows and then surged through campusand town breaking hundreds more at the post office the Field House Armory and throughout the business district A Daily Iowan photographer caught a historic moment Ted Politis and a dozen monitors arms upraised in a vain attempt to protect Iowa Book and Supplys plate glass against their classmates There were 26 arrests that night and at quarter past 3 in the morning a bomb made of three sticks of dynamite exploded at the police station Although no one was hurt resentment grew and culminated five days later in an allnight battle between students and police It took place on the bluff overlooking the Iowa River site of the mens dormitories There were some injuries among the police and widespread destruction University authorities many of whom had sympathized with student indignation were now alarmed President Boyd noted that everything admirable had gone out of the demonstrations that they were no longer even political The mass of students had stood by conditioned to the trashers selfcasting in the heros role and to permissiveness toward it Not that a few broken windows are important to university but the state of mind which produced them could almost as easily get to the heart of the THE majority of radicals were equally displeased admitting it had been an ugly night one in which even old comrades had lost their humanness They view it now as the end of a revolutionary cycle and the beginning of the disillusion which prevails today Reasons for that disillusionment are real Despite radical skepticism the war has wound down and the changing economy has altered most of the issues Refusal to work for the makers of napalm would be a rather empty gesture in todays job market Indeed the whole sharp blackandwhite picture of four years ago has gone blurred and gray Students no longer see the possibility of participating in and effecting political change The villains are harder to spot and the heroes are dead or dying Chappaquiddick was a herodeath as significant in its way as Martin Luther Kings and Ralph Nader once a true knight has gone gray as General Motors in his own institutionalizing Radicals believe the war is being waged as vigorously as ever Even though Americans are no longer shooting at Asians facetoface American bombers are dropping their loads wiping out villages wholesale and it is not even reported They are as angry as ever about it but frustrated Jerry Seis a New Yorker in the Writers Workshop claims to be the radical leader of Iowa City and the only real radical left The peace movement isnt together anymore he says Energy is low and consciousnessraising is not what it should be The old radicals have moved on or they have families and are concerned with subsisting or else theyve destroyed themselves with dope If the active revolution is over the theoretical one is surely not History professors notice that their brightest students are Marxist and that their teaching assistants make up reading lists heavy with Fannon Cleaver and Debray Student president Politis is pressed to keep his volatile constituency in hand The constituents in turn regularly remind him of the night when his monitors turned against their brothers to pro tect the goods at Iowa Book thus perverting the monitor concept which is to protect the students from harm Similarly they see in such profitable enterprises as The Hulk saloon one more perversion of the originally idealistic Iowa Student Agencies and in Palitiss reluctance to fund abortioncounseling the duplicity of a man who has sold out This cross fire is coming from the new kind of radical who is convinced that the revolution is in fact going beautifully with a whole new set of issues These are not national issues for the radicals believe that they have failed at political action and must now turn inward to more real and personal projects You can take care of your own life and liberate yourself Debbie Bayer says When you read The Whole Earth Catalog you know it We have to live our politics now like the Womens Center and day care Sexism is the central issue today and work at the Womens Center is wholly concerned with it Women there describe their work as a process in which they can clarify their interests establish their goals and help one another assume responsibility for achieving them Women are objects in American society they explain and they are prevented from fulfillment in all sorts of ways Society tells a wom an she is a symbol of male success If society is the enemy Hugh Hefner is an archvillain and cosmetics are a major evil not as an expression of female vanity but in this latest sense of her enslavement Unlike a man her actual body actual complexion are inadequate her gray hair and lined face unacceptable Why are we not good enough the way we come they ask What have you done to us The Womens Center operates along collectivist lines a sharing of authority and responsibility There is neither boss nor fall girl If you are willing to work you must accept the same responsibility as the others says one worker Members give their time and energy to two kinds of endeavor The first predictably is consciousnessraising for themselves and others and second they are concerned with selfsufficiency that is teaching each other such practical skills as fixing faucets and budgeting as well as the group projects of abortion counseling the clinic and day care Day care is thoroughly Womens Lib a service to free the university woman from the yoke of her children There are five daycare centers serving students and faculty mothers at present and while their function is that of allday kindergarten their principles are those of the commune breaking down the family pattern in favor of the community of sexual freedom and of the group taking the responsibility of loving and bringing up the children The pioneer daycarc center called Dum Dum occupies a bare universityowned house near the football stadium When I called there a few weeks ago I found the 2yearolds toddling about daubing each other with paint Two men sat at a kitchen table one doing water colors the other comforting a child in his lap while a woman watched A third man walked by with a plastic bag full of diapers I was told that ordinarily the work is shared evenly between men and women On the bulletin board I found some conventional messages Chris must have a naphe may not go out Sitting in Dum Dum the studentrun daycare center amid the toys and potties one cant help thinking that the turning of all that inspired vandalism of yesteryear into this social service represents a comedown ing a stocking hat Below these was a notice that was distinctively daycare Mens group meets Monday evening we are trying to raise our consciousness about sexism in general and deal with particularly offensive things we do as men Sitting in Dum Dum amid the toys and potties one cant help thinking that the turning of all that inspired vandalism of yesteryear into this social service represents a painful comedown and some observers say sothat daycare centers are an admission of impotence Unable to make any dent on their elders the radicals have turned to their kids in hopes of finding them more impressionable Of course neither daycare centers nor their parent Womens Lib is the exclusive property of the radicals and it is no accident that Jim Suttons choice for the next student body president is a woman sophomore Sue Ross an Iowan with a square freckled face on which cosmetics are not even imaginable Her hair is a bush her nose upturned and her mouth laughs easily but is no less determined She is serious Sutton observes She has really fresh ideas and the kind of beauty which promises a function She is particularly sanguine about day care The centers are making real gains against the oppression of women Its a significant advance  in human terms far more than anything else thats happened in recent years a major societal change Sue Ross thinks the students have plenty of reason for dissatisfaction that they are discriminated against by the tradespeople and by the City Council in its bicycle regulations Nevertheless she is optimistic The election of Ed Czarnecki an associate professor and an independent to the City Council this fall is encouraging as is the growing economic power of the student government She even thinks the radicals may work within the system noting there are nine of them running for senate vacancies Anyway theres more realism among students now Theyve found better ways than rocks The straights and radicals are still at their struggle to inflUence the Hulk Looking to the future Jim Sutton anticipates that students will soon deal with the university as the faculty is about toin collective bargaining Thats going to change everything he says Our objective is to operate like the UAW and university presidents who dont realize that are going to be out of a job If students dont get to the bargaining table theyre going into more alienation and disruption THE issues are still combustible surely but on a clear Iowa day it seems possible that ideological conflict will resolve itself in human terms David Sundance is a tireless and familiar adversary of the university administration but president Boyd along with his administrative staff confesses to perverse affection for him and some others of his views Last spring Sundance and his friends the Guerrilla Gardeners planted a field near the university with vegetables just as the fields ownerthe universitybegan to convert it into a parking lot Sundance who abhors parking lotsThey dont have to happen If people cant find a place to park their cars they should ride the bus took his grievance to the top and president Boyd called off the conversion until the harvest Encountering Sundance on the street president Boyd inquired Hows your garden growing and got an admission of OK Then in the fall a university official asked Sundance if his crops were in and he replied Yes all but the sunflower seeds and well have them in tomorrow which he did just before the bulldozers returned Of course I believe in destruction Sundance observes I wanted to destroy those bulldozers Only everybody would know I did it He brightens at the thought laughs Sandy Boyd Oh hes got a good heart and everything but you know bureaucracy kills people

Straw Dogs is a special disappointment His first nonWesterna contemporary melodrama set on the Cornish coast of England  is an intelligent movie but interesting only in the context of his other works After 90 minutes of filmed equivocation during which Davids Dustin Hoffmans cat has been strangled and hung in his closet and his wife Amy Susan George has been raped not entirely against her will David decides to make a stand when five local toughs try to enter his cottage Curiously enough its not really the violent climax that is objectionable about Straw Dogs Although it is extremely explicit it does serve a dramatic function in a film that seriously attempts to define the meaning of manhood in such terms A much greater problem is that nothing in the screenplay supports his extraordinary finale with conviction I cant quarrel with the point of Straw Dogs There are times when a man must take a position and maintain it But the manner in which Dustin Hoffman does it reminds

on the young in To Find a Man which intimately scrutinizes the today lifestyle of New Yorks affluent adolescents Under Buzz Kuliks crisp direction the largely unknown youngsters here are surprisingly cool and efficient in concentrating on the scripts thin but major premise that abortion is still more of a problem than say unsightly pimples It makes for a hip sometimes funny and occasionally poignant view of kids under momentary stress Handling the comparatively brief adult roles with authority are Lloyd Bridges Phyllis Newman Tom Ewell Tom Bosley and Antonia Rey But To Find a Man really belongs to its young newcomers principally through the extremely sensitive portrayal of Andy by Darren OConnor and the persuasive characterization of the selfish and superficial Rosalind by Pamela

Lelouch the French director traffics in so much charm that one is tempted to call for some kind of Federal controls Save us commissioner before we shrivel to death Actually about half of the film the first half is delightful before it is overtaken by an acute attack of what a friend of mine used to call the elfins Yet the movie about three comradely shipyard workers deserves our interest and maybe even our support Mr Lelouch has attempted to make a firstclass film from something on the order of 30000 Smic Smac Smoc is no major breakthrough as entertainment However it represents such an interesting approach to moviemaking that I must admire it as well as Mr Lelouch and everyone connected with the venture This includes particularly Catherine Allegret and Amidou The film is fairly

its hero walking down city streets which are photographed through zoom lenses accompanied by soft rock music on the soundtrack it takes all the discipline I can muster to keep from immediately walking out of the theater into my own streets and into my own life Although Cisco Pike is better than a couple of dozen other movies that start in the same way its not really that much better and like those movies it finally boils down to the terrible fact that the fiction in the foreground is no match for the realism of the found objects in the background There isnt much to say about Cisco Pike except that Kris Kristofferson as a hasbeen rock star seems to be a much more interesting rock performer than an actor and that Karen Black who plays his mistress has become so familiar to movie audiences

negative reviews Carroll Saviola Shalit Lyons Crist Wolf Schickel Gelmis Drew Vincent Canby Glass Houses is a fairly intelligent perceptive look at a grotip of rather shabby people whose emotions are no deeper nor more complex than the movie that records them Because of the monomaniacal intensity of the sexual hunger that motivates almost everyone in the film it looks very much like a puton  a rather highclass one as a matter of fact  of the oldfashioned softcore pornographic movies that the more technical less Freudianoriented hardcore features have since rendered obsolete Glass Houses however is not pornography and its not really as stupid as it sounds Mr Singer has a certain talent for dealing seriously with characters who are not of the first interest The performers are also completely legitimate especially Bernard Barrow and Jennifer ONeill Glass Houses is not great nor very good but it has its wits about it EAGLE IN A CAGE a film about Napoleon on St Helena directed by

"Even Now, Helping With Abortions Is Traumatic Shock for Some Nurses",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/01/archives/even-now-helping-with-abortions-is-traumatic-shock-for-some-nurses.html,Some nurses left hospitals some transferred to different departments and a number went through group therapy and counseling sessions after New York State passed one of the most liberal abortion laws in the country Even now 19 months after legislative approval many nurses prefer not to work in pregnancy interruption services Most nurses find the destruction of life the very antithesis of what they believe said Mrs Cynthia Kinsella director of nurses at Mount Sinai Hospital The concept of euthanasia and abortion is very difficult for them to accept Mrs Kinsella who is also dean of the School of Nursing at City College said that the trauma produced by some abortions was significant Nurses in delivery rooms had been accustomed to every conceivable effort to save babies even those of one to three pounds and they found that sometimes they were salting out bigger babies than those they had worked to save The salting out process used after the 16th week of pregnancy involves injecting a salt solution into the uterus causing the muscles to contract and expel the fetus Periodically we still have problems Recently a baby emerged from the salting out process still alive There was no hope for ultimate survival but the heart beat The nurses were upset Counseling for Nurses Immediately after passage of the law the hospital called on the services of Dr Marcel Heiman who had been liaison psychiatrist to its Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology The nurses met with him individually or in small group sessions to ventilate their feelings It was an enormous help Mrs Kinsella said We were not prepared for what happen after the law was passed Dr Heiman recalled The nurses in obstetrics are a wonderful lot he said They like babies and they like helping women deliver babies Suddenly they were asked to take part in this They felt in many ways degraded and abused Dr Heiman said that no attempt had been made to influence nurses whose religious beliefs precluded abortion but that nurses whose doubts were other than religious were told that physicians help people in what they need and a nurse should also feel that way During the course of the discussions Dr Heiman found that some of the nurses felt the work was being done like an assembly line and that women became objects The women were in and out of the hospital so quickly most of them the same day that the nurses couldnt have any personal relationship with them and they resented it Dr Heiman said They felt it was part of their professional duty to give these women some emotional support and that the procedure was being done in an impersonal manner I could only appeal to their sense of reality Some Sought Transfers There isnt one nurse who didnt have some feelings about abortion he said But generally speaking the meetings were quite helpful At Mount Sinai and at almost every other hospital dealing in abortion some nurses transferred to services where they have no direct confrontation with abortion Most of them were Catholics a few were Jewish With the new nurses its easier because the situation is established Dr Heiman said Mrs Sandra Kappy a Catholic nurse at Mount Sinai was working in the clinic that induced abortions by the suction or aspiration method when the abortion law came into effect She decided to continue working with women who wished to have their pregnancy terminated but asked to be transferred to the recovery room I didnt like the sight of blood and I was upset at seeing the fetus drawn into a container she said I felt I could be helpful in the recovery room where the salting out procedure is used There we work with the women and they go home and come back in 12 to 48 hours and go into labor in the delivery room We dont see the fetus being passed The suction method is used on pregnancies up to 12 weeks and involves going through the vagina opening the cervix and inserting suction tubing Mrs Kappys husband is against abortion and she said she never have an abortion Her decision to continue working with women who wished abortions she said was based on her belief that a woman has rights over her own body I didnt think that my feelings should interfere with someone elses choice she added By continuing to work in this I felt I could give the patient the emotional support she needs at the time I think a lot of them do feel life in their bodies and are upsetand tearful Very few are bland about it Its a trying time But she added she was very much against abortion being used as a birthcontrol method Third Pregnancy One woman has been here for the third time she said I believe that family planning should be stronger and that there should be psychiatric consultation Why is that woman having these abortions Why is she repeatedly becoming pregnant Mrs Margherita Hawkins a nonpracticing Catholic who was all in favor of abortions said she prided herself on the fact that she did not make moral judgments Mrs Hawkins is head nurse in the prenatal clinic If a woman has desire enough to have an abortion thats reason enough for me she said It doesnt have to be a medical reason Im staunchly in favor of population control Mrs Hawkins who has been married almost four years said that she and her husband an insurance underwriter might eventually adopt children I dont have any hangups about having my own she said There are enough children in the world as it is and a lot of homeless children and we could give them a home She recalled that initially she and many of her nursing colleagues anticipated a hysterical reaction like oh I murdered my child  from women coming in for abortions We didnt get it she said We got a lot of people who looked at it from a realistic point of view Women have been having abortions all along This was just a safe way of doing it
Dobbs Ferry Group Is Fighting Abortion Facility,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/02/archives/dobbs-ferry-group-is-fighting-abortion-facility.html,DOBBS FERRY N Y Feb 1 The presence of three doctors who have performed nearly 4000 abortions since last March in an office they share here has stirred strong emotions in this old Hudson River village of 10350 people Abortion opponents have gathered nearly 700 signatures on a petition asking the village board to adopt a zoning ordinance against abortion facilities Their request raises the same question that other towns and the state courts have wrestled with since New Yorks liberal abortion law went into effect a year and a half ago Can local governments restrict an activity that the state government permits Yesterday the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court resolved at least some of the statewide confusion by overturning a Hempstead L I village ordinance that restricted abortions to hospitals Last May State Supreme Court in Nassau County upheld that ordinance while the same court in Westchester County enjoined the enforcement of a nearly identical law in Orangetown Rockland County George Bergerman the deputy town attorney for Orangetown said today that the Appellate Divisions decision in Hempstead would undoubtedly have some effect on Orangetowns appeal But since Hempstead is expected to bring its case to the State Court of Appeals the confusion remains In any event the abortion opponents in Dobbs Ferry are trying to use the zoning maps rather than the courts John C Ryan spokesman for the informal local group that has been trying to close the office of the three doctors since last spring says he has no doubt a village has the right to restrict through zoning what the state allows by law The new law just removed the civil penalties for performing abortions Mr Ryan said It didnt say that every village has to have an abortion clinic  Board Requests Opinion Lester Lichter another local resident who has spoken out on the issue disagrees These people lost their fight in Albany so they are carrying it to the village level he said in his Manhattan law office They are trying to do indirectly what they cant do directly The seven  member village board made decidedly uneasy by the whole controversy has declined to take action The all  Republican board recently tabled an ordinance that would have barred medical clinics from any future office buildings in town Morally I could never accept abortion but as a trustee I have to accept the law William J Hogan one of the board members said Legally theres nothing the village can do The village board has requested an opinion from the State Attorney Generals office as to whether the office that the three doctors use constitutes a clinic State law requires that all medical facilities including clinics must be licensed although the law does not provide a precise definition of a clinic The doctors presence has even created a mild fiscal crisis for the village Under state law a village registrar is paid 50 cents for preparing and filing each birth and death certificate In past years Dobbs Ferry appropriated about 150 a year to pay Mrs Mairgaret Glennon the village clerk for the paperwork But 4000 fetal death certificates is 2000 although Mrs Glennon says she would rather not get the money and not have to spend her nights and weekends on the extra paperwork The doctors themselves have tried to avoid involvement in the dispute and most people here seem not even to know the doctors names Were three doctors practicing medicine Dr Robert B Dorsen said in his spacious woodpaneled suite of offices Were very square and weve tried hard not to rock any boats He said that he and his two colleagues Dr Donald M Pearlman and Dr Jerome Quint perform about 25 abortions a day using the vacuum aspiration method Many of the patients he said are referred by Planned Parenthood chapters in New York City and Westchester and about half come from out of state Dr Dorsen spent 26 years in the United States Public Health Service where he was the senior obstetriciangynecologist From 1965 to 1968 he was special assistant to the Surgeon General and worked at developing national family  planning policies Eventually he said he and his colleagues hope to develop a specialized family planning practice treating infertility as well as unwanted fertility Dr Dorsen said he had not been surprised by the depth of emotion on the abortion issue here I have a lot of sympathy for their position he said I trained in a Catholic hospital and I can quote Thomas Aquinas pretty well I know that one does not turn around a lifetime of attitudes overnight But Ive delivered 15000 babies in my career and Im convinced that what Im doing now is as constructive a service to the community

in the family No one suggests that Mrs Lindsay is a gray eminence or that she is directing the Mayors Presidential campaign It is more they say that Mrs Lindsay who declined to be interviewed is force and a presence full of assurance and totally certain of who she is Mrs Lindsay was born in Richmond Va but grew up in Greenwich Conn as a child of piivilege Her father Randolph Harrison was vice president of the Hanover Bank and her mother the former Mary Dawes was to become the president of the Garden Club of America Courted on Skis She went to Vassar and she met Mr Lindsay in 1946 at the wedding of the daughter of Senator Prescott Bush of Connecticut She was a bridesmaid and he was an usher They courted on ski slopes and tennis courts and were married in 1949 We very seldom see you You remain behind things said Sherrye Henry the moderator of the television show Woman to Mrs Lindsay not long ago Ive decided really Id rather do things that I like doing myselfquietly Mrs Lindsay said In fact her admirers say it is toughness that allows Mrs Lindsay to do things that she wants to do herself and to do them quietly She is neither driven nor compelled and having endured and even prevailed over the traumas of politics she is detached She has declined to give speeches or to make appointments after 4 PM or on weekends She works twice a week for a museum but prefers that no one know about it She thinks of grade Mansion not as a monument to municipal politics but as her home and regularly routs wandering television crews and stray politicians out of the family rooms Would you like your children to go into politics she was asked Not particularly she said suggesting the distance that sometimes lies between the wisest of politicians wives and politics itself Nonetheless no one around the Mayor believes that Mrs Lindsay or Mare as the Mayor calls her is not close when any big decisions are made The Mayor Listens It wouldnt have stopped him from running for President if she had said no but he would have considered what she said for a long while a campaign official said She couldnt care less about the nuts and bolts of municipal government or about a campaign but shed make herself heard on anything big A politician said They have this arrangement If John and Aurelio are sitting and talking about the race she can walk in any time and listen Most wives in politics dont do it this way They expect to go upstairs when the men leave to have their cigars and brandy Mary would say This is my house and I go where I please Mrs Lindsay says pretty much what she pleases too The thing that shines through about Mary is her candor an old friend said I dont think she ever divides herself Shes all there in one piece and it comes out that way There is in fact something like disdain or perhaps whimsy in some of Mrs Lindsays pronouncements She is after all candid and there are things she does not suffer lightly What the hell kind of mother is it who wont walk a few blocks to get milk she once said dismissing the notion that the stoppage of home milk deliveries in New York was of any great consequence Can you imagine anyone being a Democrat she said after meeting some bigcigar types during a mayoral campaign OK lamb chop lets go she said pulling her husband away from a prolonged conversation with another politician The Peanut Gallery Sometimes the whimsy and disdain can come neatly together In the past the Inner Circle an organization of New York City political reporters did not allow women to attend its annual dinners During Mayor Lindsays first term the dinner was held in the Grand Ballroom of the New York Hilton and Mrs Lindsay was told that she had to sit in the balcony She did and she showed her displeasure by neatly lining up peanuts on the balcony railing and flicking them at the men below In political terms Mrs Lindsay is less apparent When the Mayor announced his Presidential aspirations in Miami she was there and she was with him the next day when he campaigned in Wisconsin When the Mayor introduced her in Miami after saying among other things that he had greatly reduced air pollution in New York he coughed John doesnt trust any air he cant see Mrs Lindsay said Spontaneous Addresses She spoke twice in Wisconsinin the airport at Eau Claire and in a church basement at Cadott Both times it was unplanned with Mrs Lindsay just responding spontaneously to enthusiastic crowds In all the Mayors public life Mrs Lindsay has taken a public partisan position only once appearing at a news conference to defend the states abortion bill She does not talk much about political things and her own views are mostly unknown She declines most requests for interviews Shes totally committed to John an old acquaintance said Im like the tiger protecting the lair Mrs Lindsay has said
Allen Ginsberg Remembers Mama,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/06/archives/allen-ginsberg-remembers-mama-poet-allen-ginsberg-remembers-mama.html,THERE was once a little girl named Naomi Levy She was brought by her family from Russia to America in 1905 following a pogrom She learned English on Orchard and Rivington Streets She grew into a beautiful young woman who loved art nature and justice She tried to paint played the mandolin went to the opera to poetry readings to lectures became a communistbohemian of the twenties and thirties got involved in the Paterson N J silk strikes became secretary of her Communist Party cell became a teacher of retarded children and went to the radical Camp NichtGedeigit where she threaded flowers through her long hair and to Woodstock where she won a prize for designing the most original and beautiful dress She wrote childrens stories for radical publications had lovers an abortion a serious operation married a school principal and poet gave birth to two sons and finally was pursued by enemies and spies Hitler Roosevelt Capitalists a man on the street corner her motherinlaw and her husband both Socialists and even her invalid sister Eleanor Her head was wired like a radio sending and receiving terrible messages she ran screaming naked through hallways banged her head on walls They strapped her down in ambulances strapped her to the table for shock treatments strapped her for a lobotomy Five or six times they brought her home to her family but she always had to be brought back to the insane asylum She had one stroke then another which killed her in 1956 But shortly before she died she wrote a letter to her son the poet Allen Ginsberg The key is in the window the key is in the sunlight at the windowI have the keyget married Allen dont take drugs the key is in the window Allen incorporated those lines into his lament Kaddish for Naomi Ginsberg 18944956 I learned about Naomi from Ginsbergs poem which I read in 1860 when it was published by City Lights Press of San Francisco I wept for her and loved her but didnt want to read the poem again or to hear Allen reading it on a record in the rhythms of the Jewish prayer of mourning from which it derives its title Naomi became a very real person to me and I didnt want to see her transmuted into somebody elses arteven if that somebody was her son who had first told me about her in his own poem Thus it was with mixed feelings that I discovered that the Chelsea Theater Center was going to stage Kaddish as a theatervideo work to face the critics Thursday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music It has a chance of being a very good play indeed Ginsberg did the adaptation reworking it from a screenplay he had worked on with Robert Frank several years ago we couldnt raise the 580000 we figured we needed to make it It is in the hands of a sensitive director Robert Ealfin And the video concept is promising for so much of the work takes place on the unconscious level This will be projected on three large screens in the background while the live action takes place on stage Yes I will have to see it but I wanted to talk to Naomis about it first I visited Ginsberg in his East Tenth Street apartment late one afternoon It is a floorthrough arrangement of tiny rooms You walk directly into the kitchen from the urinesmelling hallway Then there is a kind of diningliving room with some sturdy homemade bookshelves battered file cabinets hifi equipment a casually constructed table Beyond it is a room containing a large mattress on a low platform an improvised desk holding an old standard typewriter set before a proppedup mirror Another tiny room off the the side strewn with India print spreads and cushions is for meditation Peter Orlovsky with whom Ginsberg has lived for many years and a pretty young woman named Denise were in the kitchen cooking a spicily delicioussmelling soy bean soup They served us tea in big white mugs As we talked the light coming through the uncurtained windows of the front room darkened and the cracks in the bare walls seemed to deepen Peter a pale young man with weightlifters biceps and a long silky blond braid down his back and Denise puttered about for a time before leaving Ginsberg getting a little gray about the sides of his intensely black beard still looks young for his 46 years He was businesslike almost brusque at first but this wore off as we talked I told him I had heard he cried when he had seen an early runthrough of the play He nodded It was much better than I thought it would be But he confessed something was bothering him When I wrote the poem I never thought in terms of seeing it in 3D on a stage A few things have been transformed by memory and looseness of imagination I thought at the time I wrote the poem of putting down some words representing my feelings at the moment The events described in the play are literal but some of the details arent When my father and brother go to see the play theyll see that Ive done a piece of trickery on them by using their personages and changing things so that its not really them and not really not them I wanted to know whether Ginsberg saw the poem his mother as I did  a woman whose huge appetite for life and mastery could not be satisfied by her domestic role No he did not My mothers frustration with her role as a woman in New Jersey of the thirties was a partial cause of her disorientation in the social world entire but there was also her frustration as a communard her difficulties and traumas as a refugee from the pogroms of Russia Of course It wasnt possible to read the poem and not see that And yet  Ginsberg returned to the and yet later in our conversation Of his own volition he brought up the idea that his mother must have felt a certain powerlessness in her feminine role in contrast to his father who not only made the money and allotted it as he saw fit but also had considerable standing in the Paterson community as a school principal and poet In any case the feminist issue was clearly not of major concern to Ginsberg What interested him was the humor and messianic correctness of my mothers visions She was no madder than me or my father or for that matter than Schlesinger or Roosevelt himself For example she screamed that Roosevelt was spying on her Well at that time Roosevelt was founding the FBI She thought there was a man on the street corner with a vial of poison germs for her And at that time somebody in a concentration camp in Germany was sticking a needle with poison germs into some Jews arm So symbolically she was correct but she did not have upaya  thats a Sanskrit word meaning the skillful means to communicate her visions into practical terms She had a great grasp of the transient and irrational nature of the modern capitalist world and a clear idea of the brainwashing that was going on in this country but she thought it was all coming from Roosevelt and Washington She didnt realize some of it was coming from Russia Because my father did not perceive the break in the public reality  that break between reality and what is presented by The New York Times  she put him on the other side and included him among the conspirators She used to say Im a truly beautiful woman a great soul and thats why theyre after me On one level that was true  on the level that the nature of the modern mechanical scientific robot government was inimical to any manifestation of human individuality and nonmechanical organic charm That has been the big division in American culture as every poet and critic has pointed out from Poe through Whitman through Henry James Sherwood Anderson Huck Finn on the raft Ginsberg went on to say that his experience with his mother had helped him in dealing with his own life and the people with whom he was involved himself I realized that if I ever got to the point where I was insisting on an idea or facts that everyone around me said were wrong Id better pay attention That inhibited me from going all ourt in any apocalyptic direction In dealing with his community which includes crazies and other assorted radicals  Jerry Rubin John Lennon William Burroughs especially William BurroughsI am always careful to check everything out to get the information straight and to consider what can be done or not done Allen believes that many young revolutionaries today tend to generalize misapply misinterpret and blame the government for every little difficulty they are having with their lives They say The reason I am having trouble is that they are after me A lot of madness begins with a grand universal insight the insight that there is more in the world than subways and offices When the young revolutionary tries to explain this or to explain why automobiles are wrong he meets so much resistance that he takes to insistency on his point If he develops upaya he leads people on a long slow walk into the mountains above the smog where they can breathe the clean air and look down and then he can say to them Dont you realize now what all those cars are doing down there You have to develop the skills of Ralph Nader and that takes years We talked of Allens own visions While Still a student at Columbia he saw God and heard the voice of William Blake He told Mark Van Doren Lionel Trilling and his father and they thought he was crazy but recently he told exactly the same story in exactly the same detail over national television but in a much more reassuring voice and it was accepted as a coherent reasonable explanation of what happened to me  not only that but they projected on a screen one of Blakes drawings of an angel flying down to him in his garden Finally we spoke of Naomis letter Allen Allen you didnt take your mothers advice about getting married and not taking drugs Now that was where she got her levels mixed up He laughed What would I do with a wife It was the last thing I needed It was the sort of advice mothers feel obliged to give Where she was right was about the key being in the sunlight No there was no aotual key She must have woke up one morning and seen the sunshine streaming through the bars in the window and wondered why she worried about Hitler The key was in the sunlight itself Then Ginsberg talked at great length about drugs In essence he believes that they are important visionary tools to which everyone has a right but moralistic class attitudes and a government which resorted to subterfuge blackmail and force of arms have succeeded in damping the ardor of youth and middle age for celestial experience He says that bad drugs  fake LSD strychnine LSD amphetamine LSD and junk peddled by the police are flooding the streets and good drugs have been driven out As things are now Ginsberg says young people are taking these bad drugs under the worst possible circumstances  in an atmosphere of criminality and rebellion against society If a young person freaks out his friends are afraid to take him to a hospital because of the possible legal consequences They simply try to hold him down  with very bad effects A great deal of education about drugs is needed and socially acceptable ways should be found for young people to go on vision quests Classifying himself as a democrat Ginsberg says that every young man has the same right as a Baudelaire to expand his consciousness by whatever means he sees fit I pointed out that he had said that his own visionary experience of seeing God and hearing Blake occurred without benefit of drugs Well of course drugs arent the only way There is mountain climbing yoga music est sex Then Why I never got the answer to that one However Ginsberg said that recent developments may have made the use of acid obsolete The media have created a situation of planetary consciousness in which people know they have to get with the knowledge of their fellow creatures This is the point of LSD as advocated by Timothy Leary he declared  to promote the expansion of consciousness so that everyone would know that all things especially those that are not generally assumed to have consciousness like cows pigs flowers blacks Jews Arabs children women all have complete consciousness
Muskie's Grade a ‘C’ In Politics on Campus,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/07/archives/muskies-grade-a-c-in-politics-on-campus.html,WASHINGTON Feb 6The credibility of Senator Edmund S Muskies politics of trust is undergoing its toughest test on the nations campuses and so far it appears to be getting little more than average grades The Senator from Maine hoping to clinch the Democratic Presidential nomination early is wooing the newly enfranchised 18to20yearolds with a combination of inspirational homilies at youth rallies and candid replies at campus question sessions But there has been no discernible rush to paper dormitory walls with Believe Muskie posters On the same day last week that the Secretary of State charged that Mr Muskies criticism of Nixon Administration efforts to end the Vietnam war was harmful to our national interest antiwar militants in Madison Wis disrupted a Muskie rally and shouted that the Senator was a war criminal The ironic encounter at the University of Wisconsin generally considered one of the most radical campuses in the country was hardly typical But the confrontation dramatized the difficulties facing Senator Muskie as he attempts to build confidence in his late conversion in 1970 to the antiwar movement and to overcome the cynicism many youth display toward politicians in general Heavy Campus Schedule Since he became an official candidate for President last month Mr Muskies schedule has been dotted increasingly with appearances in university towns The scheduling reflects the ease for one thing with which campaign organizers can assemble a large audience on a campus More important however it underscores the potential importance of the youth vote to Senator Muskies campaign strategy He is attempting to eliminate his Democratic rivals in the early primaries In the first eight primary states alone there are three million potential new voters under the age of 21 Mr Muskies customary appeal at campaign rallies dubbed the sermonette by the press corps that accompanies himis a generalized dissertation on the need for new leadership to unite Americans Im convinced that Americans who appear to be at opposite ends of the spectrum are not as far apart as they want to believe the Senator told a variety of audiences as he toured Illinois and Missouri yesterday You can go down through the litany those who have and those who have not he deGlared What appears to divide them is not what they want not what they need not what they hope for but what they have If there is any lesson in American history it is that in a country like ours people of widely different backgrounds widely different experiences widely different circumstances find the waysits not always easy its often too difficult and even agonizingto work together to serve these common needs Complaints From Students Such a message delivered without notes and sometimes with fervor has occasionally enthralled a middleage audience In St Louis last night 125 wealthy couples paying 1000 applauded it But students leaving Muskie rallies after listening to similar words frequently complain that while they can accept the words and often applaud them the words are not enough In Skokie Ill on Friday a bearded veteran wearing the olive drab field jacket he brought back from military service in Vietnam protested that he had the same reaction to Mr Muskie as he had had earlier after listening to Senator Hubert H Humphrey of Minnesota They tell me whats wrong with Nixon and what the countrys problems are the youth declared but not what theyre going to do specifically His attitude was no different from that of Susan Levasseur a 19yearold student in Hudson N H after hearing Senator Muskie last month She said that she had difficulty choosing between the theory that Mr Muskie would be the strongest Democratic opponent to run against Mr Nixon and her desire to identify with the views of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota whose standings in national opinion polls have been low I keep coming back to Muskie Miss Levasseur said He says believe me believe me but Im not sure if I can Marijuana in His Face The cynicism of the young generation that began the antiwar movement has dogged Mr Muskie although it has not often been so explosively evident as it was Thursday night at the Wisconsin rally Mr Muskies remarks were continually interrupted by shouted obscenities mock expressions of sympathy derision and even after the Senator voiced doubt about legalizing the use of marijuana a cloud of marijuana smoke blown in the candidates face One young man yelled out A vote for Muskie is a vote for Eisenhower Earlier as Mr Muskie toured the Student Union at the University of Wisconsinand the following day at the comparatively placid campus of Wisconsin State University in rural Eau Clairehe was peppered with questions about his support of the Vietnam war in 1968 his refusal to pledge amnesty for draft evaders and his rejection of abortion as a form of birth control Many students applauded the apparent candor in Mr Muskies replieshe was wrong about the war he would seek repatriation of draftage men who fled to Canada but would define the terms only when those who had submitted unwillingly to the draft were all safely home from Vietnam he treasured the value of human life and thus would favor abortions only if aecessary to save the lives of mothers One young man wearing a campaign button of Mayor Lindsay of New York told Mr Muskie at Madison that you handled yourself tremenodusly Another young man turned from a bridge game in the student center to get Mr Muskies autograph on a playing card The card was a joker It seemed appropriate the youth explained One of the key young liberals in the national Muskie headquarters here voiced his own personal uncertainty If Ed Muskie is what I think he is in his best moments said the aide hell do more to change this cluntry than any President since Franklin Roosevelt If he is what he seems to be in his worst moments Il lead a dumpMuskie movement in 1976 I really cant be sure which it is
Bar Group Supports Eased Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/08/archives/bar-group-supports-eased-abortions.html,NEW ORLEANS Feb 7The American Bar Association endorsed today a uniform statute to permit women to obtain abortions upon demand The association however rejected a uniform nofault divorce law Both proposals had been drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws a group of 250 judges lawyers and law professors from the 50 states that tries to reduce disparities among state laws The ABAs 307member House of Delegates a traditionally conservative body heavily weighted with elderly corporate attorneys approved the abortion proposal without debate and with only 30 dissenting votes The measure is more liberal than the laws now on the books in all states except New York and Hawaii where abortion upon demand is now in effect The proposed law would be slightly less liberal than these statutes because abortions could be performed by physicians upon demand only within 20 weeks of the onset of pregnancy After that period they would be allowed only to preserve the physical or mental health of the mother if the fetus were gravely deformed or in case of rape or incest After Pill Backed The uniform law would legalize a new development in birth controlthe morning after pill that will eliminate any pregnancy if taken by a woman within 24 hours of intercourse Pills of this type have worked in tests but have not yet been cleared for general use by the Food and Drug Administration If they are cleared the uniform law would make their use legaleven if technically this constitutes a selfinduced abortionas long as a doctor prescribes the pill The nofault divorce proposal would have established irretrievable breakdown of a marriage as the sole grounds for divorce California Colorado Michigan and North Dakota have recently passed laws adopting this concept but in most other states divorces are granted only if one party is found guilty of such grounds as adultery cruelty or abandonment On the issue of nofault divorce the associations section on domestic relations law objected Some lawyers believe that the measure would drastically reduce domestic relations law practices Ralph J Podell of Milwaukee acting chairman of the section on family law posed the issue as whether the family itself in this country will go down the drain because divorce would become too quick and easy The proposed law sets up a minimum 30day coolingoff period after the filing of divorce action and requires divorce hearing within 30 days Speedy Divorces Scored Frederick G Buesser Jr of Detroit president of the Michigan Bar Association assailed the unseemly speed of divorce under the new nofault law in Michigan He said the common experience of divorce lawyers was that reconciliations often occurred during the year or more required to obtain divorces In most states The statute would also reduce the legal age to marry to 18 years without parental consent and 16 with it In many states the age is 21 without consent It would also divide each couples property evenly rather than require judges to decide the amount of alimony on a casebycase basis The National Association of Women Lawyers and the ABAs young lawyers section also opposed the uniform divorce act It was rejected by a 170to72 vote The House of Delegates also rejected today by a vote of 144 to 100 the District of Columbia Bar Associations request for endorsement of the concept of home rule and representation in Congress for the District of Columbia The Philadelphia Bar Association had asked the national organization to rescind the endorsement it voted last year of wiretapping by policemen with judicial approval The House of Delegates declined to vote on the question after the Philadelphia group agreed to discuss it further with other interested groups within the bar association The ABA midyear meeting is being held at the Roosevelt Hotel here The meeting will adjourn tomorrow
Catholics Get Council of Churches Bid,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/09/archives/catholics-get-council-of-churches-bid.html,An official committee of Roman Catholic Protestant and Eastern Orthodox churchmen recommended yesterday that the Catholic Church in this country become a member of the National Council of Churches The council established in 1950 represents most major Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations in the country It has 33 memberdenominations with a total of 42 million members The addition of the Catholic Church with 48 million members would mean the creation for the first time of a single national organization encom passing all three branches of American Christianity and al majority of American Christians The recommendation was made in a 47page report by the Joint Study Committee on Possible Roman Catholic Membership in the National Council of Churches which was set up two years ago Decision Up to Bishops The committee consisted of seven Catholics nine Protestants and one Orthodox churchman Its chairmen were the Most Rev Charles H Helmsing Catholic Bishop of Kansas City St Joseph and the Rev John C Smith a United Presbyterian who is a president of the World Council of Churches Its recommendations will now go to the American Bishops of the Catholic Church with whom any decision to seek membership ultimately rests A spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops said yesterday that because of the importance of such a move the committee report would be sent to Diocesan ecumenical commissions religious superiors directors of Catholic agencies and others for study and recommendations A reliable source at the Catholic headquarters said yesterday it was unlikely that any such action would be taken before the Bishops regular spring meeting in 1973 The question of Catholic membership in the Protestant and Orthodox organization arose several years ago in the context of growing informal cooperation between the two groups In 1966 the General Board of the National Council officially recognized the Catholic Church as being in accord with the general principles of its constitution and five Catholics are now members of the council staff In 1970 Catholics became members of the councils theological arm the Commission on Faith and Order Catholic dioceses are already members of councils of churches in 11 states and nearly 100 local communities in this country An international interfaith committee has also been working on the question of Catholic membership in the World Council of Churches and a report recommending such a move is expected to be released in the near future Possible Problems In the report released yesterday the Joint Study Committee took the view that Roman Catholic ecclesiological principles are in substantial accord with the aims and methods of the National Council of Churches The group cited several prob lerns that Catholic membership might pose These included the possibility that the council might adopt policies on issues such as abortion and divorce that varied from Catholic belief that Catholic membership might delay the adoption of some programs and that a broaderbased organization would be forced to become too bland in some of its pronouncements Noting however that most of these problems were already faced by present members the group said that in general the arguments for Roman Catholic mebership in the National Council of Churches are as strong as the arguments for membership in the case of many other member churdhes Among the clear advantages that would arise from membership the committee said are more efficient interfaith cooperation and a wider basis of support and understanding in the American community an matters of common interest To avoid domination of the council by the Catholic Church which lists more members than all present council members combined the joint study suggested that Catholics have between onefifth and onethird of the seats on council policymaking bodies The council is already involved in a major restructuring of its operations a task that is expected to be completed at its triennial General Assembly in December A Catholic spokesman said that it was quite unlikely that the American Bishops would vote to affiliate with the council until it was clear exactly what we were joining

Appeals Court Upholds Medicaid Abortions Curb,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/11/archives/appeals-court-upholds-medicaid-abortions-curb.html,ALBANY Feb 10  The states highest court today upheld a directive by the states Social Services Commissioner George K Wyman banning the use of Medicaid funds for abortions on demand In a 4to3 ruling the Court of Appeals overturned decisions by lower courts These had held that the Commissioners directive was unconstitutional and violated the legislative intent of the liberalized abortion law of 1970 Todays decision reinstates the directive that Mr Wyman issued at the behest of Governor Rockefeller last April and that permits the use of Medicaid funds only for abortions that are necessary for medical reasons Action Assailed by Chase The decision which did not contain a written opinion by the majority was assailed by New York Citys Health and Hospitals Corporation and by Gordon Chase the citys Health Services Administrator _ In a statement Mr Chase said The decision to suspend state payments for abortions for welfare recipients and the working poor in the Medicaid program is tragic The effect of the ruling Mr Chase said is not to deny abortions to everyone but just to deny them to women who cannot pay for them and to force some of them to risk their lives at the hands of backalley abortionists or by denIgerous attempts at selfinduced abortions A similar criticism was contained in a dissent by Judge James Gibson in which Chief Judge Stanley H Fuld and Judge Francis Bergan concurred Restricting abortions for Medicaid patients to medically indicated reasons Judge Gibson wrote subverts the intent of the states new law which permits a woman to consent to an abortion during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy Judge Gibson said that during the first nine months of the new law the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation partner in the suit had performed in municipal institutions 16168 abortions on women eligible for Medicaid Those individuals without sufficient funds for adequate medical care the judge wrote will once again bear the brunt of the unfortunate and often tragic consequences that resulted from the states old abortion law which permitted abortions only when the mothers life was imperiled Policy on Collection George Kalkines general counsel for the citys hospitals corporation said the decision was very clearly discriminatory He said that the corporation would continue to provide abortion services to the indigent and would try to collect as much as we can from those who can afford to pay something The added costs to the city were estimated at 2million to 3million But Mr Kalkines said that his agencys officials were more disturbed that the decision meant that the voluntary private nonprofit hospitals in the city would stay performing abortions for the poor if they were not reimbursed by Medicaid This meant he said increasing the backlog for abortions at the already overtaxed city facilities since onethird of the Medicaid abortions performed in the city are at voluntary hospitals

exercise in multiple choice one day last week From 830 AM to 2 PM the seventh to twelfth graders were permitted to select from an academic smorgasbord that included a dizzying array of celebrities and subjects including doing nothing for which two rooms were set aside The problem was whether to hear William M Kunstler the controversial civil rights lawyer speak on the case of the Harlem Four four young defendants charged with murder whose third trial ended in a hung jury a few weeks ago attend an Association for the Study of Abortion workshop try Hindu exercises demonstrated by two supple

riding clinic or play volleyball in the boys gym Cheer leaders were giving lessons in the girls gym It was a day of decisions decisions There was Paul Stookey of the musical trio Peter raul and Mary to sing along with and another kind of sound from devotees of Hare Krishna who swayed and chanted before an enthusiastic assemblage Ive never seen it before 14yearold Rod Kennedy said somewhat awed as cries of Hare Krishna Hare Rama filled the air Its pretty good kinda camp his friend Tommy Solazzo acknowledged The day goes as well as it is planned Thomas E Birch the principal commented as students on their way to various happenings eddied around him This is our third one but last years was a bust It was badly put together but I have to give these girls credit They have really done a job this year These girls were Nancy Sachs and Barbara Angel two willowy 16yearolds with the organizational talents of seasoned cruise directors Nancy a petite brunette with hyacinth eye  and a husky voice said that her first step was to send out 100 letters I wrote to everybody Mayor Lindsay Representative Ogden Reid people like that she said Then I followed up the letters with phone callsmany many phone calls At first she made the calls from home later on from school The phone bill she admitted will be pretty steep but my father wont be too mad at me I dont think she said It Had to Be a Winner Nancy said that she was determined to make this years program succeed because last years was so bad we were afraid if this year wasnt a smash there might not be another one And a smash it was Out of

and William Johnson of the New York State Chapters of the Black Panthers It attracted most of the black students 5 per cent of the total enrollment and a host of white ones from this eminently middleto uppermiddleclass bedroom community Meanwhile lest starvation set in ninthgraders had baked up a storm and were selling all sorts of goodies The range of ideas open to the students went from those of the Planned Parenthood Association and Womens World a womens lib publication to a discussion on civil liberties by Arthur Rosenberg a sixthgrade teacher who was fired by the Rye Neck Board of Education in 1965 for his vigorous opposition to the war in Vietnam Mr Rosenberg has since instituted a suit against the school district that is scheduled to come up next month Its much more versatile than the average school day Guy LongleyCook a mathematics and physics teacher at the high school observed Its a chance forthe kids to meet wellknownpeople firsthand and ask them questions I think its great There was flack from some of the parents who called up horrified that this one or that one was going to speak but very few in the overall the principal said over his shoulder as he took off to conduct a basketball clinic After all the choice was up to the individual no one had to go anywhere

A severe case of sycophantiasis,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/13/archives/the-partys-over-now-reminiscences-of-the-fifties-new-yorks-artists.html,During the 1950s John Gruen was a composer as well as a critic of both music and art His breathless account of the New York cultural scene The Gruening of the Fifties leads one to believe that he suffers from cultural emphysema complicated by a severe case of sycophantiasis Sycophantiasis is a classic form of obsession frequently encountered in those with identity deficiency It is often a source of envy superficiality and trite reminiscences in book form the latter may constitute the more serious problem Mr Gruen admits that poliitics and sociology have never ignited my imagination and also that he can never fathom people completely or himself Rosalyn Drexler playwright novelist and painter is the author of a forthcoming novel To Smitherines at all Therefore the diorama he has fashioned lacks dimension his characters hang lopsided and paper thin He also remarks that the 19th century is more suited to his temperament and that he cannot talk about the fifties in sequence since that vast interruption known as life keeps interfering He is prone to use words previously encountered in Romantic literature verdant eschewed espy enthralled alas bewail beset He describes the waterbirds and herons of Dylan Thomass poetry in prose as sentimental and rouged as a Rod McKuen song One could hear the whoosh of their flight as they hovered over landscapes and shorelines that shimmered through summer trees and autumn winds He calls women who paint lady painters and when they wear jeans or other comfortable clothing he describes their clothes as invariably masculine Having set Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird by the poet Wallace Stevens to music Mr Gruen invites him to dinner so that he can sing his songs to him yet he is disappointed on finding that his conversation could not be called dazzling or arresting On that evening there were no memorable exchanges about the art of poetry or the art of life Master of the inept phrase he describes Julian Beck and Judith Malina as injustice collectors because of their concern for peace legalization of abortion and other social causes He focuses on the petty giving us the scoop on two wellknown womens nosejobs finding their faces vacuous and ordinary Rushing around with his wife Jane Wilson the painter from one social event to another Mr Gruen is forever in search of the bonmot which is either withheld from him What this all boils down to is that there are some people you can talk to and some people that you cant or which results in chitchat His anxieties finally beset him and he has recourse to psychoanalysis this amorphous science of which he says And so I became part of the army of psychoanalyzed men and women each with his own special set of problems Gruen muses about Edward Albee I would suspect that his real parents were people of some breeding because Im sure that the family he moved into would be certain that they werent getting a mongrel or something About Helen Frankenthaler he says No crude words ever crossed the lips of Helen Frankenthaler she dressed with taste and elegance even at her most casual Clearly a wellbrought In the very act of consummating his passion for delving into the lives of the famous Mr Gruen has withdrawn Unlike the Paris Review interviews which contain bath question and answer Mr Gruens interviews lack the question One can only surmise while reading his bisected exchanges why conversation seems wooden in people who are known to have a flowing exuberant style Perhaps the interviewer does not bring out the best in his subjects Or could it be that some of the tapes have been poorly trnrce riled In spite of its shortcomings and prejudices the book does contain some important material How could you miss with say Robert Motherwell Virgil Thomson Philip Pavia Elaine DeKooning Harold Rosenberg John Ashbery Jack Gelber Larry Rivers and Ned Rorem to name a few telling how it was in the fifties One would wish to read their autobiographies rather than the few paragraphs recorded in Mr Gruens book which does not manage to evoke the spirit and sense of discovery that informed the artists Abstract Expressionists writers New York School poets and musicians Cageian of the fifties What Mr Gruen has managed to do is to dig up the graveyard and revel among the corpses No doubt he will be back at dawn seeking those who expired in the sixties eager to drive a Script pen through their hearts Those who have contracted sycophantiasis will never be cured
A.C.L.U. Is Under Attack For New Activist Stands,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/13/archives/aclu-is-under-attack-for-new-activist-stands-american-civil.html,The American Civil Liberties Union which for nearly 52 years has been defending the rights of others to speak out freely on any issue now finds as it undergoes dramatic change critics attacking its own right to take stands on such issues as the war in Vietnam From its beginnings the union has been involved in controversy It has been called communistic and socialistic atheistic and unAmerican But now for the first time even some who consider themselves civil libertarians are joining the attack The charge is that the union is changing its basic characterfrom simply a defender of constitutional rights to an activist organization committed to a broad range of political and social change This charge has grown out of the positions the ACLU has taken on the Vietnam war the Berrigan case the Spock trial draft resistance school decentralization and the appointment of William H Rehnquist to the Supreme Court What it is often doing in such cases is expanding the definition of civil liberties to include some illegal acts as a matter of consciencealthough the union has steadfastly refused to adopt the position that civil disobedience is a civil liberty that must be defended The union in answering its critics insists that its change has not been one of basic character that it still only marches to its traditional drummerdefense of the Constitution and its amendments The change then it says is one of structure and ability change made inevitable by its increasing size and affluence And its positions on such volatile questions as the war are rooted not in politics the union says but in constitutional precepts of free speech and due process Is the war for instance a constitutional war particularly after it was extended into Cambodia And if not does not a man have the right to urge prospective draftees to stay out of it More Aggressive Whatever side one takes on these questions the facts would tend to show that the union has changed It has become more aggressive in seeking out issues that it will bring to court and often these issues are broadly social and political The union seeks out broad subjects such as free speech and fair trial and electronic surveillance and hires experts to write reports on themreports that the unions increasingly active public relations departtrent disseminates with great vigor The subjects admittedly Involve grave questions of civil liberties But mostly the reports are for general information and propaganda and do not lead to individual court cases In some parts of the country ACLU affiliates do get involved in local or regional politics The New York City Liberties Union for instance has begun to rate state legislators on their voting records And the ACLUs recent literature asking for members started out this way The NixonAgnewMitchell Administration is engaged in a concerted attack on American liberties Unsupported Charge But even some of its severest critics would not agree that the unions recent aggressiveness supports the charge in Commentary by Professor Joseph W Bishop Jr of the Yale Law School that the union has itself embarked on a series of political crusades And it is demonstratedly untrue that the ACLU as he also charged has virtually ceased to defend right wingers whose civil liberties are under attack Moreover much of the change in the organization is owing to the fact that the union by the very nature of its work is a mirror of the social and legal issues of its times and these issues were expanded rapidly by the Earl Warren Court We could not trail behind the courts and stay viable says Aryeh Neier the unions executive director We have to lead the courts or go out of business Because of the change some of its members have resigned Others have continued in the organization but are uncomfortable with a decade of change But for every member who has resigned a hundred persons of varying political beliefs have joined bringing its membership rolls to 170000twice the number it had five years ago In the last year alone it has taken in 20000 new members Affiliates and Chapters There is nothing homogeneous about the ACLU and indeed its varied composition would appear to belie to some extent the charge by Professor Bishop for one that it has become an organization committed to political crusade The union is in fact a loosely structured group of 49 regional andor state affiliates and about 325 smaller local chapters They range in size and vigor from the New York Civil Liberties Union one of the largest affiliates which has a fulltime staff of 26 a parttime staff of 10 and 13 subchapters to a small almost clandestine operation in a southern Georgia village with a volunteer lawyer and several housewives as a staff Moreover each affiliate and chapter is fiercely independent Policy is formulated by the organizations 78member national board of directors For the most part the board is made up of independent thinking vocal opinionated individuals representing nearly every shade of political opinion except perhaps the extremes of the radical left and radical right Often it is the affiliates that lead the national organization Into areas of action It was the Massachusetts affiliate for instance that pushed the ACLU into the Spock case in 1968 National Board Against Dr Benjamin Spock the pediatrician and author and four codefendants were indicted in Boston for counseling draft evasion In January 1968 the national board decided that it would not supply lawyers to the five defendants because it feared that the case would raise the issues of war crimes In Vietnam and the legality of the war The board did consider offering an amicus curiae friend of the court brief on the free speech aspects of the case and even debated offering lawyers who would pursue in court the free speech aspects but who would be forbidden to raise substantial questions about the war This middle course was rejected as unfair to the defendants Subsequently however the Massachusettes chapter decided to defend the case on the grounds of free speech with the knowledge that when an attorney directly represents client that attorney must raise every issue helpful to that client even if the issue is not one of civil liberties In March 1968 by six votes the board reversed itself It was Mr Neier recalls the major internal controversy in the ACLU in the past 30 years Some board members quit and some refused to run for reelection he added There were other cases in which affiliates were far ahead of the national ACLU The Southern California affiliate for instance started its court attack on the death penalty seven years before the national outfit took a stand on the subject and the New York Civil Liberties Union was five years ahead of the national one on the question of legalizing abortion and also was the leader in womens liberation cases On other issues the national organization has steadfastfully refused to follow the lead of an affiliate Envirornental and ecological suits are examples Southern California has undertaken a number of such suits on the grounds that one of the basic civil liberties is the right to breath clean air and swim in clean water The national group does not at this time see this as a civil liberties issue If nothing else this shows that the union is more diverse than monolithic that it tends in fact to be rather slow moving and that what is a civil liberties issue in one section of the country is not in another For every affiliate or chapter that moves the union into new fields there are many equally viable that stick to the traditional ACLU positions War Related Subjects To the extent that there is debate within the organization it revolves around the same question that bothers the ACLUs critics on the outside the current thrust of the union as exemplified by its stand on the Speck case the war school decentralization etc Herbert Prashker a New York lawyer resigned as a national director and member of the unions executive committee not over a particular issue but because I thought it was losing its focus There are too many war and war related subjects he says We spent a lot of time on marijuana cases and guaranteed income on the whole welfare field We were getting into a lot of political issuesnot that they were particularly left wing but they certainly were a lot of novel interests But as if to emphasize the anomaly in the current controversy Mr Prashker said that he was not bothered at all by the New York Civil Liberties Unions stand on the Ocean HillBrownsville school decentralization dispute  a stand that cost the ACLU 300 members the most to resign in recent years over a single issue I felt school decentralization was a proper civil liberties issue he said There have been others who resigned from high offices in the organization over similar issues Still the internal debates within the union have been conducted with considerably less acrimony than is generally believed Partly this is because of the makeup of the membership itself White Middle Class The membership is mostly white and middle class Nearly 85 per cent of its members are college graduates and slightly more than 40 per cent have had three years of graduate school More than 60 per cent are city dwellers and more than 30 per cent live in the suburbs A goodly number earn between 16000 and 20000 a year The national board which sets overall policy pretty much reflects this membership Policy change comes rather slowly and when it comes there is always at least a defense of the civil liberties rationale The most recent example is the conspiracy trial of the Rev Philip F Demean and six other antiwar activists now under way in Harrisburg Pa Some critics contend that the union entered the case because of its political activism But Mr Neier says that the board made the decision to become involved if requested because its really a free speech case Not Overt Acts The charge is conspiracy to kidnap a Presidential adviser he said But nowhere does the Government contend that anyone tried to further the conspiracy with overt acts The case also Involves the abuse of lundercover agents and the improper use of grand juries and immunity We say that there should be an overt act before the Government brings such a case lOtherwise it does involve a persons civil liberties Mr Neier explained that the union was not taking a position in the case of Angela Davis the black militant who is awaiting trial on charges of murder kidnapping and conspiracy In that case he said the Government does charge overt acts Another major departure from ACLU policy was the adoption by the board of a resolution in July 1970 calling for the immediate termination of the war in Southeast Asia Previously to the Cambodian incursion the board had skirted the war as a civil liberties issue Found Illegal It was an undeclared war1 Mr Neier said but at the same time there was some substance to the claims by its proponents that the United States was invited in by South Vietnam Nobody could claim it was legal for us to go in Cambodia nut that is only part of the ACLU rationalization What had concerned the organization before its resolution was what it believed to be the civil liberties issues that were spinning off from the mere fact of the war which in fact was undeclared These included draft resistance and draftcard burning cases the increased violence in America including the Kent State killings and the urban neglect caused by channeling tax money into the war What the organization is doingand this is the biggest change of allis attempting to lextend traditional constitutional rights to persons caught up in large institutions such as the military draft boards prisons and even mental hospitals Charles Morgan who heads the unions national office in Atlanta and who has probably handled more civil rights cases In the South than any other lawyer says that if the ACLU wouldnt become involved in the problems of our times there is no reason for it to stay in business Some of the change has come merely because of the ACLIrs growth Ten years ago for instance nearly 90 per cent of its work consisted of supplying amicus briefs in civil liberties cases and only 10 per cent in actual litigation Today the percentages are merely exactly reversed There are several reasons for this Ten years ago the union was neither large enough or wealthy enough to do much more than submit amlcus briefs Last year the organization and Its affiliates and chapters and the ACLU Foundation its tax deductible arm spent about Further a decade ago there were only about 30 topflight civil liberty lawyers in the United States Now according to Mr Nelers estimates there are about L000 Whatever the reason to stay viable the ACLU believes it had to move into the direct representation of clients on large scale either with its own fulltime staff of 40 lawyers or with the thousands of others who handle ACLU cases on a voluntary basis around the country Defends Clients And this in turn meant an immediate automatic and fundamental change for the organization could not content itself with merely raising single points of constitutional law but had to go on and defend its clients much as any criminal 61swyer defends his client If this meant attacking the constitutionality of the war for instance in defending a mens right to advocate draft resistance then the ACLU in its new role was committed to take that step Inevitably as it became more activist it opened itself to the charge that it was only defending the constitutional rights of persons on the political left But this is not true What is true is that persons on the political right often do not think in terms of asking the ACLU to defend them and further as Mr Neier says in the present climate it is mostly the rights of the left that are under attack by the Government Still among the More than 2000 cases the organization is constantly litigating there are many involving the civil liberties of political conservatives and even extreme rightists In Connecticut for instance the ACLU has defended the John Birch Societys right to sponsor a parade in Norwalk It has also supported the rights of Young Americans For Freedom a conservative group to use school auditoriums for rallies and it defended the American Nazi partys right to use Shea Stadium for a rally In New York City it most recently spoke out against the Knapp Commissions investigation into police corruption calling its public hearings without the right of

Justice of the Municipal Court and a leader in the struggle for womens rights and social reform for more than half century died Saturday at her home 433 West 21st Street She would have been 84 years old On Thursday From her admission to the bar in 1917 through a legal career that included private practice civic work the judgeship and membership on the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women Judge Kenyon remained an outspoken and witty advocate of social betterment I always pick the losing cause she said in on inter view in 1936 1 guess Im crazy about the underdog But I think Im helping women by my kind of life For years her letters to the editor peppered the pages of The New York Times most recently on Aug 29 1971 when as a board member of the American Civil Liberties Union she inveighed against discrimination by sex on college campuses One of the most important precepts of the movement for womens rights she wrote is that the aspirations of women are bounded only by their talents abilities and potentialities as individual human beings Daughter of a Lawyer Miss Kenyon was born in New York the daughter of a lawyer William Houston Kenyon and of the former Maria Wellington Stanwood Her two brothers also became lawyers Years ago she recalled my lawyer father said the words I should like to hear everybody use today Holding tight to his hand and skipping to keep up with his long stride the little girl that was me suddenly popped this question out of nowhere to him Can girls be lawyers father And he answered smiling Why not my dear Miss Kenyon graduated in 1903 from Smith College where she majored in economics and history played on the hockey team and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa On a trip to Mexico the condition of the Indians aroused her sense of public obligation She matriculated at New York University Law School one of the few such institutions that then accepted women and received a Doctor of Jurisprudence degree in 1917 Practiced Law After being admitted to the bar she served as research specialist for a group of lawyers who were preparing studies for the delegates to the 1919 Peace Conference She practiced law at first privately and then with Dorothy Straus M the firm of Straus  Kenyon from 1930 to 1939 As chairman of the committee to study procedure in womens courts in 1936 she called for more sympathetic treatment of

and long an activist in liberal causes she was accused in 1950 by the late Senator Joseph R McCarthy Republican of Wisconsin of having been affiliated with as least 28 Communistfront organiiza dons Miss Kenyon in her direct way called McCarthy an unmitigated liar and a coward to take shelter in the cloak of Congressional immunity Before a Senate subcommittee she denied any connection of any kind with communism or its adherents Some years ago she presented in The New York Times Magazine the case for women lawyers There is a growing school of thought she wrote including such an eminent authority as Judge Jerome Frank that regards the entire field of law as feminine rather than masculine If the subject matter of law is human relations the rules of conduct of human beings in society can it be that law is peculiarly womens field after all women who are supposed if nothing else to be experts in human relations women who are the lawgivers the prosecutors the jury the judges of their

NEW CENSUS STUDY PROJECTS DECLINE IN RATE OF BIRTHS,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/17/archives/new-census-study-projects-decline-in-rate-of-births-nation-found.html,WASHINGTON Feb 16The number of children that American women expected to bear dropped so sharply between 1967 and 1971 the Census Bureau reported today that the nation is fast approaching zero population growth rates among younger women The average number of children expected by wives aged 18 to 24 dropped from 29 to 24 in that period a bureau report said Applied to all women in that age group married or not this might well mean a fertility rate of 22 children That is not quite zero population growth the ideal of the national movement seeking that goal The rate needed simply to replace deaths is 21 children Nor do the figures take immigration into account Social Implications But the size and speed of the drop in the rates is nonetheless regarded as striking The bureau said in its report that it was by far the largest change since 1955 when birth expectation statistics were first published The new report has two important social implications One concerns the future size of the population If the rate of 24 children for each wife continues that will mean 25 million fewer Americans by the year 2000 than there would otherwise be The total population then would be about 280 million compared to the present population of about 208 million If the 29 rate had continued the population in the year 2000 would have been 305 million Other Studies Supported Whether lower fertility rates will continue until the year 2000 obviously cannot bi known demographers say They caution that a populatiort bomb remains since the trend could turn up again as quickly as it has now turned down The second implication of the report concerns the size of individual families It shows dramatic increase in the number of young wives who want two children or fewer In 1967 only 44 per cent wanted families of such size In 1971 the figure jumped to 64 per cent The census report based on interviews with 15000 wives 18 to 39 in 50000 households last June gives authoritative support to other recent showings of at least a shortterm drop in the growth rate of the population The preliminary findings of the National Fertility Study made every five years showed an overall drop in the number of children that women intend to havefrom 31 children in 1965 to 26 in 1970 While both figures are slightly higher than the change from 29 to 24 reported by the Census Bureau they are for different years In any event both siUdies show the same halfachild drop in expectations Birth expectations are generally regarded as highly acmite overall indicators of future births While the expectations of individual women are not reliable analysts estimate that in the aggregate expectations are accurate to 01 child Both studies are bolstered by the total number of births reported in 1971 Final figures for the year are not yet available But in the first 11 months of the year births dropped 4 per cent compared to the like period in 1970 The census report is based on a combination of figuresthose for children already born and those for total expected family size reported by wives in the survey Among all wives between the ages of 18 to 39 the average expectation figure in 1971 was 28 children The figure was 31 in 1967 These figures are regarded as less significant signs of future population growth than those for younger women only The older the wife the more likely she is to have already completed childbearing The census report showed that the decline in expectations among younger wives was both sharp and rapid In the 12 years between 1955 and 1967 theaverage fell three points from 32 to 29 children But in the four years between 1967 and 1971 it fell five points to the 24 figure This figure applicable only Co wives is not the total fertility rate That is a complex compound of various calculations and apportions the total number of children among all women of childbearing age whether they are mothers or not But by making a aeries of technical probable assumptions the Census Bureau calculated that the 24 figure meant that there would be about 22 births per woman for all women born between 1947 and 1953 The report indicated two broad reasons for the decline The average age of marriage among women rose from 203 to 209 years between 1960 and 1971 And the proportion of women who are single at ages 20 to 24 jumped from 28 to 37 per cent Other authorities have offered a series of additional reasons Two of the most important are the economy and the environment in the view of Charles F Westoff a codirector of the National Fertility Study Historically he said in an interview today fertility rises and falls with economic con ditions Thus some current decrease should be expected There is growing evidence also that environmental ideology is also a factor said Mr Westoff who is also executive director of the Federal Commission on Population Growth and the American Future He cited an annual survey of freshmmen hi Eastern womens colleges that showed that for years the largest group said that they hoped to have four children In the last two years however the figure has dropped to two children Such lower expectations have become increasingly possible Mr Westoff said because of improved contraception and re cent liberalization of abortion laws Still other reasons given by experts for the decline in fertility include the rapid increase in the number of working women the womens liberation movement and the marriage squeeze This last refers to a current shortterm phenomenon As young women born during the postwar baby boom come of age they find a shortage of older men born during the lowbirth depression and war years The new census report series P20 No 232 is available from the Government Printing Office Washington D C 20402 for ID cents

Aborting Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/18/archives/aborting-abortions.html,The New York Court of Appeals in a decision that defies logic and undermines human rights has ruled by a fourtothree margin that Medicaid funds cannot be used to pay for elective abortions The effect Of this decision is to deny the poor the equal protection of the laws to which they are clearly entitled One of the reasons for the enactment of a humane reformed abortion law in New York State was that the welltodo could always have access to an abortionthrough the cooperation of local physicians or a journey to more enlightened jurisdictions that permitted abortionsbut the poor were left In a terrible dilemma The poor woman could have an unwanted child or she could throw herself on the notsotender mercies an illegal abortion mill This double standard of justice has now been perpetuated by the highest state court The poor must rely on Medicaid funds To deny them the use of these funds for elective abortions is to deny them elective abortions There is a measure of economic irony in the courts decision which upholds an administrative order issued by the states former Social Services Commissioner George K Wyman This order was issued in response to conservative sentiment within the State Legislature against the spending of Medicaid funds for abortions for the poor The irony is that it costs the taxpayers many times more for poor women to have children and add them to the welfare rolls than to have elective abortions which might enable the women to enter remain in the job market A bill to correct the wrongheaded court decision has been introduced in Albany by Assemblyman Albert H Blumenthal of Manhattan and Assemblywoman Constance E Cook of Ithaca leaders of the earlier struggle to enact abortion law reform They believe that abortion is a medical procedure their bill would make Medicaid funds available to pay for it While the Federal courts may ultimately reverse the state on appeal this bill deserves immediate enactment
Science Medicine,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/20/archives/a-job-for-the-birth-control-teams-chinas-people.html,A girl on her way to work steps briskly from her Shanghai apartment pokes her head in a door down the street and says mark me down for today then continues on ft is a procedure repeated countless times each clay in the urban areas of Chinaand to some extent in rural coramunes The girl is letting the local barefoot doctor or other health work itnow that her monthly period has begun The fact is noted in her record and is used to help her keep on schedule in taking contraceptive pills for 20 to 22 days of her monthly cycle This is but one of the various ways In which China is trying to stern its everexpanding population The program is aimed not only at improving the standard of living for the average Chinese but also at freeing women from the burdens of prolonged childbearing According to a study by the Population Reference Bureau in Washington D C birth control was frowned on in the early years after the Chinese Communist revolution because of the Marxist view that the Malthusian doctrine of population control by hunger was reactionary Productivity it was argued couid outstrip population growth However it became obvious that to improve living standards the population growth would have to be checked Only in the socalled national minority areas is there no attempt to check the birth rate These are the sparsely Inhabited regions such as Inner Mongolia where It is believed a larger population can be accommodated But to what extent has Pekings program been successful in altering the growth rate For Western demographers the margin of uncertainty in estimating the population of China is enormous For example an estimate by the United States Bureau of the Census puts the 1970 population of mainland China at about 871 million Yet two other studies one under United Nations auspices put it closer to 753 million The margin of difference as noted in an issue of the Population Bulletin circulated last week is almost 120 million  more than half the total population of the United States and Canada combined The Population Bulletin published by the Population Reference Bureau notes that despite current difficulties in estimating Chinas population the countrys historical population statistics are the most abundant of any nation reaching back almost 2000 years In 2 AD the population was recorded at GO million Presumably it then expanded but 12 centuries later after the Mongols had been driven out and the Ming Dynasty was founded it was again back to 60 million It reached a peak of more than 430 million in the middle of the last century only to be devastated by the Taiping Rebellion In 1953 China underwent its first modern census The result was a count of 582603417 on the mainland 7591298 on Taiwan Chinesea total of more than GOO million The problem in estimating the current population centers on birth and death rates Birth control efforts are said to have begun under the Communists as early as 1956 but the problems of mass producing birth control pills and devices getting them to the vast Chinese populace and persuading them to use the devices have been formidable In 1964 Premier Chou Enlai told Edgar Snow the author who died in Switzerland last week that his Government hoped to see the birth rate drop below 2 per cent by 1970 Mr Snow was later told that it had dropped that low as early as 1966 but had then shot up during the cultural revolution Millions of Red Guards went on the march the vexes mingling freely and many early marriages resulted Now however reports from many sources indicate that marraige before the age of 28 for men and 25 for women is discouraged Marriage before the ages of 20 and 18 respectively is illegal However a number of sources report that the tendency of some women to forget their pilltaking has troubled the Chinese birthcontrol effort It is for this reason that local checkoff lists are used For several years the Chinese have been experimenting with a onceamonth pill but so far it seems to produce more side effects than the daily pill Mr Snow was told by Dr Lin Cifiaochili a female gynecologist trained in England We are experimenting with a onceinthreemonths pill and we now believe we can develop a pill or vaccine effective for about a year It was reported to him that in Peking 70 per cent of the women of childbearing age use contraceptives with two thirds of them taking the pill Apart from the oral contraceptives intrauterine loops are said to be used extensively The writer Han Suyin who is a doctor of medicine has reported that in every commune that she visited in 1969 both the pill and Intrauterine devices were available at no charge In the rural communes however the figure for pilltakers is only about 40 per cent Couples are encouraged to limit their families to two children and abortions are available to women who do not wish additional children Girls pregnant for the first time are said to be discouraged from having an abortion The aspiration technique is used in the early weeks of pregnancy The method widely favored in the West as well employs suction and avoids surgical procedures Key figures in all of these efforts are the socalled barefoot doctors A description of their rolebased in part on a communication from Mr Snowappeared in a report last year by the Victor Bostrom Fund Committee and the Population Crisis Commitee both in Washington The report described the barefoot doctors as paramedical personnel of both sexes who average 20 years in age They receive three months training in hospital schools and may return for further instruction after assignment to a commune or urban block organization where they dispense contraceptives and supervise their use WALTER SULLIVAN
"Family Size, Not Illegitimacy, Called the Main Reason for Residents’ Abortions",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/20/archives/family-size-not-illegitimacy-called-the-main-reason-for-residents.html,New York City women tended to get abortions to limit family size while nonresidents tended to get abortions for a first outofwedlock pregnancy Gordon Chase the Health Services Administrator said yesterday These were among striking differences he reported in a statistical study on 18 months of legal abortion here between resident and nonresident abortion seekers Mr Chase said statistics indicated that nonresidents tended to be younger white and probably more welltodo than residents He also promised that no city resident would be turned away from a municipal hospital despite a courtordered ban on Medicaid payments for abortions Since abortion became legal on July 1 1970 Mr Chase estimated 278122 legal abortions have been performed in the city 3Month Total Declines For the first time he said there was a decline in the reported threemonth totalfrom 57090 abortions in the third quarter of 1971 to 52282 in the final three months The reason for the decline is not certain and it may be temporary he said It could represent a levelingoff of demand it could be a seasonal phenomenon or might result from liberalized abortion laws in other states during the past year The decline between the third and fourth quarters of 1971 occurred among municipal hospitals voluntary hospitals and proprietary hospitals Among freestanding clinics however there was a slight rise Clinics along with proprietary hospitals serve primarily women from out of state Municipal hospitals and voluntary hospitals are the principal sources of care for New York City residents Almost half of all abortions in the city during the period JulyDecember 1971 were performed in clinicsup from about onethird duringthe first year of the law 65 Are Nonresidents Mr Chase said that the rising clinic case load reflected an increasing proportion of women who came to the city for abortions65 per cent overall from the time the law took effect through the end of last September He criticized sharply a recent Court of Appeals decision bar ring payments for abortion with Medicaid money The decision he said upheld Governor Rockefellers regressive and punitive ban but he pledged that the city would make strenuous efforts to ensure that abortion remains available to all city residents Mr Chase said that the citys chief concern was to ensure that lowerincome residents who want an abortion would not be penalized City to Fight Ban Our municipal hospitals will not turn away any city resident regardless of whether she can pay he said In addition we will pursue every legal avenue to overturn this ban which undermines the clear intent of the liberalizedabortion law Mr Chase said that the abortion safety record was improving The death rate from legal abortions has dropped to 37 deaths per 100000 abortions he said down from 47 during the first year of the law Another index of safety the complications rate dropped to 57 per thousand abortions between July and December 1971 down from 124 in the first six months of the law and 64 in the second six months

But Liza Refuses To Be Shocking,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/20/archives/-but-liza-refuses-to-be-shocking-but-liza-refuses-to-be-shocking.html,IS it true Miss Minnelli that you drink a bottle of Grand Manlier a day A rude question to be sure but then there have been rumors that Liza Minnellilike Sally Bowles the deliciously decadent night club performer she plays to sizzling perfection in the movie version of Cabaretis burning her candle at both ends Comparisons have also been made between Lizas frantic life style and that of Judy Garland her talented and legendarily tormented mother Everyone knowsor thinks he knows about Judys lamentable luck with the men and the money that got away and the booze and the pills that didnt Now they whisper heres little Liza with a marriage shattered by her allconsuming drive to become a superstar And here too is Liza in Australia playing pals with a prime minister and here is Liza in some smokefilled Parisian den of iniquity hobnobbing with barons and such Apparently Pookie Adams the sweetly melancholy misfit of The Sterile Cuckoo has been replaced by heartless hoyden dancing atop a table drink in hand and devilmaycare look in her brown A bottle of Grand Marnlerl Liza gasps her eyes more enormous than ever Are you crazed Thats absolutely Insane Why I dont even enjoy drinkIng Oh I may have one on occasion  One bottle This question turns Lizas frown upside down Haaahhhhl she shrieks patting me on the back I like that One bottle thats funny Grand Mamier is a cordialso sweet that nobody could drink more than one or two glasses day But you know Ive had the feeling these past few days in New York that Im so disappointing I must be truly boring to people who are looking for dirt Probably if I suddenly decided to run stark naked down the street screaming at the top of my lungs theyd all say  Youre drunk No not that Im drunk she says giving me a playful jab on the arm Theyd say There see see we told you about her Dammit it really does make me mad So mad that I think Ill Just have myself a Grand Marnier Liza in her black and white caftan and her bare feet marches across her room at the Plaza and pours herself drink Then quicker than you can say cordial the sweet liquid gold has disappeared down the hatch Well Im certainly not a sipper she says with wink I cant drink anything without slugging it down I must have had nanny who hit me over the head with milk bottle Hardworking gossips have also hinted that Liza has developed a penchant for pills On hearing this report she slumps into her chair shaking her head in disbelief Look Im terrified of any kind of drugs I dont even take aspirins I dont like anything that screws up my selfcontrol anything that dulls my senses I think if God has given you a talent you have a duty to develop that talent that its a crime to do anything which destroys it Youre not allowed to do that Judy Garland so the saga goes came to rely heavily on uppers and downers during her days as a child star at MGM Im lucky Liza says I had a choice I didnt have to go through the problem at the age of 14 of having a doctor come into my room shove some pills down my throat and say Come on kid go to work That was a terrible thing to do to any kid When asked to describe her saddest memory of Judy Garland Liza smiles Im never sad when I remember More Our home life was strangely normal My mother was not the tragic victim of fate that she presented to the world That was something she planted there for the public to see She let everyone else wallow in her misery while she sailed on through life Mom was exactly what she wanted to be a brilliant witty optimistic lady She was not selfpitying eitherexcept on rare occasions We were having an argument once and I turned to her and said How can you be so selfpitying Why are you so full of sympathy for yourself She looked me straight in the eyeIll never forget itand she said Sympathy is my business You see Mom always knew what she was doing There were times though when Judy did experience some slight doubt and she went to Liza for advice I talked my mother out of doing the part that Susan Hayward finally did in Valley of the Dolls I said Its going to be a cheap movie Mom dont you understand That woman they want you to play Is a tough hard woman And Mom said But rd lI1e to play that sort of woman0K Mom said but not in this film Its not to standard Liza was right of course about that role in Valley of the Dolls Just as she was right about the role of Sally Bowles a role that could well win the 25yearold actress the Oscar her mother never got Sally is a spoiled American girl who gees to Berlin during the thirties gets a job singing in a seedy night club sleeps around a lot and ends up getting an abortion even though Brian her bisexual roommateplayed splendidly by Michael Yorkwants to marry her and raise the child his That abortion was the most generous thing Sally had ever done in her whole life says Liza because have a feeling Sally really wonted that kid And Brian would have married her because he was honorable But what was there in it for him really I dont find Sally admirable but I do find her understandable I know Sally Ive known lots of Sallys Its dandy to discover that not only is Liza neither an alcoholic nor a drug addict but that her career is also in shipshape health She has high hopes in fact that her next film will be Zeldato be directed by her father Vincente Minnolli I like Daddys concept of concentrating on the early yearsnot all the frantic stuff that came later Daddy and I are determined to work together But how healthy is Lizas love life There must have been some rocky battles with her estranged husband Peter Allen an Australian rock singer who has failed to scale the heights of American showbiz Peter and I never battled Liza says astonished that anyone should entertain such a farout notion Sure there was a career conflict but Peter never resented my success dont think Peter ever resented anything But with our two careers it was just hard for us to lead a normal kind of life Peter is one of my very best friends I think we had a good marriage Suddenly Liza launches an Intensive examination of her brightly painted toenails My toenails are not looking well tonight she concludes with a sigh And neither are my poor calloused gypsy dancers feet As a matter of fact Liza who manages from moment to moment to look amazingly like each of her famous parents has never been tremendously thrilled by any of her physical attributes She considers Lorna Luft her younger sister who recently made her Broadway debut in Promises Promises to be the family beauty I saw Lorna in Promises Promises three times Shes terrific She has this marvelous vulnerability Not like me she has more of a Monroe quality glamorous with incredibly white skin thats sort of translucent Ive got my fathers old Italian skin Its not that I think Im ugly Im just not pretty mean if somebody is reading a casting list that calls for a beautiful young girl he doesnt instantly think of Liza Minnelli Nevertheless she has seldom been without a beau For example there was that funloving baron who was introduced to Liza by Marisa Barenson her cafe society costar in Cabaret Oh he was terrific Liza says but he was never anything more than a really super friend As it turns out the affair with John G Gorton former Prime Minister of Australia never even reached the super friend status According to Liza it was no more than an absurdly brief backstage chat In a Sydney night club with Gorton and a group of his friends But according to Gortons enemies the drama of the married Prime Minister and the show girl had distinct romantic overtones That only proves one thingthat I must be very popular in Australia popular enough for them to use my name in the papers when theyre trying to get somebody out of of But now there is a genuine romancewith Deal Amaz Jr the handsome I9yearold actor who recently won the Foreign Press Associations Golden Globe award as the most promising newcomer of the year for his performance in Red Sky at Morning And a couple of nights after my first meeting with Liza Lucys grownup boy is on the scene The scene however is no longer the elegant Plaza suite provided by the producers of Cabaret Instead its the cozy East 57th Street pad once shared by Liza and her husband At present Peter is nowhere to be seen but Lorna has dropped by As Deal tinkers with a stereo set in a corner of the softly lit living room Liza is asked if Deal has taken her home to meet the family Deals family she laughs I met them when I was a year and a half old We get along fine Would she care to describe her relationship with Deal I think youd better ask Desl that one Deal he wants you to describe our relationship Desi wheels around from the stereo with some wires in his hand Me Oh I Just do the work around the house he says His hair is brown and of medium length his eyes a clear blue and his manner nicely nonchalant Im kidding I really only do the electrical work around the house Liza has a couple of other guys who come in and do the rest Deal adjusts the volume on the stereo stud takea a seat opposite Liza whose soulful eyes have been glued to him for the last few minutes Our relationship Deal continues Were in love But we have no plans to get marriedyet Just as soon as we do well let you know Oh Deal Liza claps her hands and lets loose with a brief emotional burst that is part shriek part laugh She seems vastly amused by the spectacle of Desi meeting the press Earlier in the evening while Liza cavorted on the Dick Cavett Show Desi was backstage informing a press agent named Sandy that letters addressed to Patty Duke were arriving at his Los Angeles apartment Could you please tell them Patty Duke doesnt live there any more I do The subject of Patty seems a potential hot potato so approach it now as delicately as possible Excuse me this really will seem like a rude question  Oh for Gods sake Liza says with a wink Were on to you by now Go ahead and ask your question Desi a while ago I happened to overhear you mention another girls name  Oh you mean Patty Well I just wanted Sandy to know that Patty doesnt live in my apartment any more Surely he didnt think she did says Liza sitting forward in her chair You want to know about my relationship with Patty We were together for about a year and a half but we arent seeing each other any mom Pattys a terrific actress volunteers Liza One of the great American actresses of our time But for some reason she has to keep proving it But getting back to the personal side of Patty Isnt Desi the father of her 11monthold son Oh the baby well you see thats not necessarily true It was probably by me But Pattys engaged to somebody else now And how did the love story of Lucys son and Judys daughter begin I didnt really know Liza that well when we were kids Id see her at a party once in a while and wed say Hello but that was about it Then not long ago I went up to Las Vegas to catch Tony Bennetts opening Liza was closing that night so I saw her show and we met backstage The next day I took her to tee Tony Bennett The similarity of their backgroundeach the child of a superstar and each determined to make it on his ownmust have been one of the things that brought Liza and Desi together Im sure thats a factor says Liza If youve both been raised In show business that eliminates a lot of opening questions Like Where are you from But low business can also tear people apart Next May Deal will be off to Japan where he will star In a movie musical about Marco Polo How will Liza survive the trauma I wont know that until hes gone she answers But as soon as I do Ill let you know Liza looks at Des and they both laugh And something in their laughter suggests that this time the boy next door will not be the man that got away
‘Cabaret’ May Shock Kansas.,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/20/archives/-cabaret-may-shock-kansas-cabaret-may-shock-kansas.html,GIVEN the impossible contradictions inherent in a project like Cabareta bigbudget massaudience musical about the decadence of preNazi Germany and the rise of Hitlerscreenwriter Jay Allen and director Bob Fosse must be credited with an hororable try With the future of two big companies riding on the film most of the compromises and evasions seem practically inevitable First there are the industry censors to contend with Since the studios will do anything to avoid a restricted rating on such an expensive film the creative people are circumscribed from the outset It is questionable whether the story of Sally Bowles the cheerful amateur whore celebrating the decline of the West can be honestly told with the restraint demanded in unrestricted films It is to the credit of the makers of Cabaret that under what must have been phenomenal pressures they have taken some chances Kansas is still in for a few nasty shocks Fosse has adopted an intimate experimental style rather than the conventional slick splashy musical format that the executives probably would have preferred The abrasiveness of the materialderiving from Christopher Isherwoods The Berlin Storiesdraws us in and keeps us absorbed even through the most banal stretches like the obstacleridden romance between a Jewish heiress and German gigolo that is the worst kind of musical comedy subplot Fosses major achievement is that Cabaret almost always seems like a movie not a photographed play he has even managed to integrate the musical numbers in inventive fashion The songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb are sardonic and evocative of the period and the distinctly secondrate quality of the Kit Kat Klubs merchandised decadence is wittily captured Joel Grey recreating his stage role as the androgynous master of ceremonies has a sly insinuating presence his eyes contain really dirty secret Grey sets the style for the film and supplies an authentic tawdriness that one does not expect to find in a musical And there is one moment when the film actually seems equal to the intimidating demands of the subject the singing of Tomorrow Belongs To Me in a Bavarian beer garden led beautiful blond Hitler youth becomes without warning a terrifying prophecy of the barbarism ahead and a profoundly disturbing unforgettable image of Innocence perverted Not many movies have a sequence as powerful as that but the occasional brilliance of Cabaret only intensifies the disappointment we feel by the end of the film For it fails to explore the most interesting possibilities of its theme and characterizations At the center of the film Is Sally Bowlesthe innocent abroad playing at divine decadence taking her chances in a city where momentarily all sense of order has broken down Sally as conceived is the degenerate flapper the thirties emancipated woman in Sodom and she might have been a character with some of the qualities of Zelda Fitzgerald or Jeanne Moreaus Catherine in Jules and Jim At the start Liza Minnellis slightly awkward selfconscious daring seems exactly right for the part Her first cabaret number by contrast is genuinely erotic and electrifying through performance Sally transforms herself and releases the a little nervously offstage Unfortunately the fierceness and selfconfidence that Miss Minnell projects when performing are never developed in dramatic scenes Instead the film explains Sally with that allpurpose characteran unloving fatherand turns Isherwoods tribute to a resilient amoral girl into a routine love story with a moralistic conclusion In choosing abortion and career over marriage and family Sally returns to the Kit Kat Klub and begins her descent to hell By limiting her choices to domesticity or degradation the film fails to accept the challenge of a truly liberated hero The treatment of Sallys character is indicative of a larger and more fundamental problem with the filmits oversimplified view of the sexual experimentation of Berlin between the wars Through a very effective but very specious use of crosscutting for example a transvestite number in the cabaret intercut with a Nazi attack on the home of a Jewish family the film makes it seem as if the decadent atmosphere of Berlin is not merely a symptom of social disorder and disillusionment but somehow directly responsible for the rise of Nazism The fascinating paradox is that a culture known for its obsession with order and regimentation was also capable of producing a particularly overripe and fetid sexual night world Even in the film one is struck by the contrast between the rosycheeked German faces In the beer garden and the rouged lacquered faces in the cabaret But instead of confronting those tensions in the German character the distorted responses to extreme repression Cabaret implies a simple causal relationship between decadence And audiences are probably quite willing to accept the neat unexamined parallels between sexual dissipation and Nazi brutality parallels that seem equally dubious in The Damned Cabaret may even be read as a cautionary tale for today a warning that contemporary America because of its new sexual freedom is a sick society comparable to Weimar Germany or the declining Roman Empirea society on the brink of some kind of horrible apocalypse The only link between America and Germany in this reuard is that many of the people attending the sex shows and porno movies today like those who frequented the Berlin cabarets are respectable middleaged people still wracked by guilt and sneaking out for a glimpse of forbidden pleasures The hypocrisy not the sexual explicitness is what makes these shows seem dirtycold and lewd Cabaret however makes no distinction between sexual experimentation and this kind of hypocritical voyeurism A character like Sally Bowles is in her way a true sexual revolutionarysearching for completely honest approach to life that in a less conventional film would have been seen as a sign of health not sickness And must the wealthy promiscuous bisexual baron Helmut Griern be presented as epitomizing the corruption of Germany Did the hedonism of people like him really pave the way for the concentration camps The moralizing isnt fair to Griems charming elegant performance which in spite of the films tensions suggests that decadence The narrator of The Berlin Stories understood this when contemplating the temptation of being corrupted he wrote It was a curious exhilarating not unpleasant sensation but at the same time I felt slightly scared That seems an honest response to decadence but in Cabaret the Isherwood character has become an English university student played by Michael York who wont admit to any exhilaration With an amoral heroine the filmmakers must have felt obliged to provide an incorruptible hero But Yorks unyielding virtue is boring and unbelievable In the most interesting sequence the bisexual mnage A trois he is momentarily tempted by the luxury that the baron offers him He even allows himself to be sexually seducedthough because of the for PG rating the seduction has to take place off screen and there is a jarring break in continuity at this point in the film Had we actually seen York abandoning himself to voluptuous living experimenting sexually with some of Sallys curiosity his confusion and ambivalence might have helped to bring the period alive in more than an academic way For if Berlin in the twenties and thirties was as Stefan Zweig wrote the Babel of the world it was also one of the bohemian capitals of Europe the center of an artistic renaissance A society in chaos frees the artist to experiment and preNazi Germany produced among others Bertlt Brecht George Grosz Erwin Piscator Kurt Weill and Marlene Dietrich I dont suggest that the decadence of the period was therefore simply benign but decadence can be imaginatively esthetically sensually stimulatinga fact that helps to explain why people would want to make a film like Cabaret in the first place Director Fosse like his upright hero seems slightly frightened to acknowledge the glamour of decadence He confuses that with being soft fascism The filmmakers may argue that Cabaret as a period piece and musical should be exempt from criticisms like these But in choosing an unconventional approach Cabaret opens itself to more vigorous analysis and evaluation than one would think of applying to a Hello Dolly or even to a less frivolous but unmistakably popular kitsch musical like Fiddler on the Roof In contrast to these films Cabaret is a genuinely serious attempt at something fresh in movies One may dispute most of the films assumptions but at least it raises questions that are worth discussing and arguing about Even with its PG rating Cabaret deserves to be called the first adult film musical and one regrets that having gone as far as it did it finally had settle for conventional resolutions The film teases us but it stops short

Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/25/archives/the-doctor-and-his-patient.html,Poking around In the annals of some less than eminent Victorians the English biographer and novelist Elizabeth Jenkins has come across a sensationmaking scandal of the late 1870ssensationmaking even by newsworthy standards of today The incidents as the author details them for us prove once again that though the age was Victorian a large number of people were not Those in good social position of ample funds and with a choice of options bent the mores of their time to their own needs Moreover the two lovers in Miss Jenkinss story were so purely motivated and so innocent of mind that it never seems to have occurred to them that their behavior might mean disaster for thorn or thocp dearest to them Love conquers all as Chaucer caustically remarked almost six centuries ago The account as it unfolded to the English reader went roughly like this The youngish husband of a newly married couple of independent means dies after imbibing poison His death is first ruled suicide But because of what appears to be irregular proceedings in determining the cause of death a second inquest is held The widow her woman companion the servants are questioned whereupon a tale unfolds that holds clubmen from play and old men from the chimney corner and must have sold newspapers like scorecards at the Superbowl Testimony is offered to show that the husband died in a fit of jealousy against his wifes earlier lover that this lover married though separated is a renowned and controversial physician who had once ministered to such worthies as Tennyson and Carlyle that he and his inamorata had entered on their liaison when she was 25 and he was 62 and that he had at one point performed an abortion when she had become pregnant by him Well you can imagine Terrorized by Drunken Husband This though Is not the outline of the story as Miss Jenkins tells it She starts at the beginning of the relationship when none of the later events are known and when the patient Florence Ricardo by marriage and the doctor James Gully first meetshe a neurasthenic wreck in fear almost in flight or a drunken husband and he a solid member of the medical profession Years back he had moved from London to a small town in Worcestershire where he had set up a water cure and although one or two voices could be heard saying that he was a quack it was not an opinion shared by the great bulk of his patients To the townsfolk Dr Gully was a benefactor whose clients brought trade and wealth into the community And as he appears in the book he is a man of quiet power and authority benign kind a pillar one could and many did lean on It was not hard to see what attracted the ailing young wife to him Her husband was so far gone in liquor that he died soon after But while he was alive he was dangerous when drunk and a terror to his wife In addition as the author makes explicit the marriage had not been consummated and the woman was suffering from a nervous illness whose source she did not recognize Dr Gully was everything she needed at the moment a calm refuge strong support a man whose

State Abortion Law Upheld on Appeal,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/26/archives/state-abortion-law-upheld-on-appeal-states-abortion-law-is-upheld.html,An Appellate Division decision in Brooklyn yesterday affirmed the constitutionality of the states liberalized abortion law overturning a State Supreme Court ruling that could have halted abortions in municipal hospitals here In a 4to1 decision the court rejected a challenge to the law enacted in 1970 that permits abortions up to the 24th week of pregnancy The suit was brought by Robert M Byrn a 40yearold bachelor and law professor at Fordham University Professor Byrn a specialist in criminal law and his attorney Thomas J Ford announced that they would appeal immediately to the State Court of Appeals In a prelude to the suit last Dec 3 State Supreme Court Justice Lester Holtzman in Queens appointed Mr 13yrn special guardian of all tinhorn fetuses whose mothers were awaiting abortions in the hospitals operated by the citys Health and Hospital Corporation Mr Byrn a Roman Catholic had charged that the state law violated the 14th Amendment to the Constitution which holds in part that no state shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law On Jan 5 Justice Francis X Smith in Queens issued temporary injunction to prevent abortions He held that fetus was a living human being But the ban was automatically stayed by an appeal filed by the city and Attorney General Louis J Lefkowitz There has been no disruption of abortion services The Appellate Division Second Department yesterday reversed Justice Smiths ruling Since the new abortion law became effective on July 1 1970 49000 abortions have been performed in municipal hospitals here The Appellate Division majority opinion written by Justice Marcus G Christ stressed the legal aspects in the case The opinion found no factual issues requiring a trial The medical affidavits submitted by the guardian have not been factually disputed and New York courts have already acknowledged that in the contemporary medical view the child begins a separate life the ruling said The decision went on to say however that the unborn child was not a legal person This court is not required to weigh and choose between the competing values urged by those who support the law and those who oppose it wrote Justice Christ The Legislature has made that determination and the court inquires only whether the Federal Constitution permits the choice it made and whether there is a reasonable basis for it We answer both questions in the affirmative In our opinion the extent to which fetal life should he protected is a value judgment not commited to the discretion of judges but reposing instead in the representative branch of government  The opinion said that the law bore with it a strong presumption of constitutionality It added that questions of wisdom need or appropriateness are for the Legislature While recognizing the opposition to abortion on both religious and philosophic grounds the court noted that a substantial number of people regard the law as a decisive but incomplete victory for enlightenment over an oppressive law which violated a womans constitutional right to control her own body and intruded into the intimate affairs of the family marriage and sex without a compelling state interest The majority agreed that had found no case directly in point which controls our determination It declared that the substantive question was whether afetus of less than 24 weeks gestation was a person within the protection of the Fifth and 14th Amendments Presiding Justice Samuel Rabin and Justices Henry J Latham and J Irwin Shapiro concurred in the opinion In his dissent Justice Frank Gulotta said he would allow the case to proceed to trial This was needed he said to ascertain whether in the light of current scientific and medical knowledge and the sociological and economic problems with which the Legislature had to deal there was a rationally sustainable basis for the course it took Professor Byrn commenting on the decision said that to deny the laws protection to members of the human family because they are too young is a principle that can easily be expanded to deny the laws protection to members of the human family because they are too old George Kalkines general counsel of the Health and Hospitals Corporation said that he was elated with the ruling and that the corporation would

Abortions on L.I.—A Progress Report,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/27/archives/abortions-on-l-i-a-progress-report-abortion-on-l-i-a-progress.html,Fifteen minutes after her abortion at a clinic in Hempstead L I a 16yearold girl from New York City explained why she had chosen the clinic for the procedure instead of a hospital It was cheaper and a hospital would have taken two days she said Although the girls mother knew of her pregnancy her father did not and neither helped raise the 150 her clinic abortion cost If I had gone to a hospital I couldnt have explained to my family why Id be gone two days the girl added Then my father would have known Last year 16593 women had abortions on Long Island and like the young woman from New York more than half of them were aborted in nonhospital clinics in Nassau County Despite the popularity of the clinics however they have come under fire from Long Island municipalities that have passed local laws banning abortions except in hospitals The ordinances which followed liberalization of New Yorks abortion law in July 1970 are currently in effect in the Cities of Glen Cove and Long Beach the Towns of North Hempstead Hempstead and Oyster Bay in Nassau County and in the Towns of Huntington and Babylon in Suffolk County In addition the Suffolk County Board of Health has passed a resolution restricting abortions to hospitals or hospitalaffiliated clinics A similar ordinance has been overturned in Hempstead Village where it was challenged by the Parents Aid Society one of three abortion clinics on Long Island The town regulations are being challenged by the other clinicsone in Garden City and one in Westburywhich last year performed most of the abortions on Long Island The Garden City and Westbury clinics have been able to continue doing abortions pending an appeal of the two ordinances But the clinic in Hempstead Village had been enjoined from doing them when the village ban was upheld in May by State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Suozzi His ruling was reversed recently In New York City abortions are restricted to hospitals clinics that have backup hospitals within a tenminute ambulance ride and independent clinics that have blood banks and fulltime anesthesiologists and professional staff members Backers of the local ordinance say they are concerned for the welfare of residents who might want abortions and fear the establishment of what they believe are inadequate storefront clinics Donald Kehne the public information officer of Oyster Bay which adopted its ordinance last July 27 said that the Town Board had received many letters indicating concern about clinics There appeared to be a growth of medical centers which become abortion centers Mr Kehoe said The town felt they wouldnt be equipped for overnight care if overnight care was needed The whole thing was not a stand against abortions Rather it was a concern for the health of the patient There was no attempt to circumvent the law We support abortions in hospitals not in storefronts The Long Island Right to Life Committee a fouryearold organization that says it has 16000 members has been opposing abortionsin hospitals or notthrough an educational pro gram Weve held seminars at high schools grade schools and public libraries said John Carlin a lawyer who is chairman of the organization The group also puts out a newsletter six times a year and has produced futuristic film Mr Carlin said which shows the ultimate consequences of taking the rights of a child our attempt is to show the horrors of abortion Were against abortion because it taking an innocent human life Mr Carlin added A child is a human being and abortion destroys basic human rights For pregnant women who do not want abortions Catholic Charities the largest nongovernmental social agency on Long Island has a maternity counseling service in both Nassau and Suffolk and a residence in Port Jefferson where women can spend the last two months of their pregnancies Most of the girls we see [about 380 each yeari are in some kind of conflict said John Sullivan director of the family services division which runs the counseling program But the conflict is usually What do I do now that Im pregnant rather than Shall I abort or not Figures from the Nassau County Board of Health indicate how popular the clinics arc Of the 14545 abortions performed in Nassau last year 8832 were performed in the Garden City and Westbury clinics and most of these for outofslate women This represents an increase of 10000 abortions over the sixmonth total of 1970 The 2048 abortions reported last year in Suffolk County which has no nonhospital clinics were largely for women who live in the county said Peter Backman of the countys health board Only 121 procedures were for nonSuffolk women but Mr Backman said that 901 Suffolk women went out of the county for abortions There were 1500 abortions in Suffolk in 1970 Both counties report that the hospitals are able to take care of all women seeking abortions And Dr William Finn chairman of thc abortion review committee of the Nassau Obstetrical and Gynocological Society said Nassau hospitals like those in Suffolk last year handled abortions almost exclusively for resident women Ninetyone per cent of the Nassau women who had abortions in 1971 went to Nassau hospitals Dr Finn said and the hospitals tell me they can do twice as many abortions as they are now Unlike New York City where the 1971 abortion rate nearly equaled the birth rate Nassau and Suffolk report many more resident births than abortions In Nassau there were 12225 live births triple the number of resident abortions Suffolk reported 18216 live births nearly 10 times the number of abortions among residents But Dr Finn said legalization of abortions had reduced the number of illegitimate births Citing 1971 birth and abortion figures for women under 20in the past the prime source for adoptive babiesDr Finn said there vere 767 abortions and only 899live births Suffolk reported a drop of 72 in the total number of illegitimate births from 768 to 699 No Deaths Reported Neither county reported any deaths among women last year as a result of abortions and Dr Finn said Nassau hospitals were seeing fewer emergency cases as result of badly done abortions In the first six months of legal abortions there were major complications in one half of one per cent of the abortions Dr Finn said Its down now to onetenth of one per cent Representatives from the clinics counter charges that they are unequipped to handle medical complications that might arise James Corcoran administrator of the Eastgate Medical Center in Garden City which last year performed 6166 abortions said his clinic could handle any medical problem because of its affiliation with Long Island Doctors Hospital An abortion at the yearold clinic costs from nothing to 180that for a saline abortion for women at least four months pregnant Most Are Unmarried The clinic has 6 gynecologists 3 anesthesiologists 2 general practioners a pathologist 14 nurses and 5 counselors According to Nassau figures 95 per cent of the abortions at the clinic were done for outofstate unmarried women who were 18 to 30 years old The smaller clinic in Westbury which is headed by Dr Saul Bilik performed 2726 procedures last year2556 for nonNassau County women In addition to Dr Bilik an obstretician the 18monthold clinic has another obstretician a general practioner and two nurses Most of the outofstate patients come to the clinics through referral services which list the Nassau facilities said Jack H Schneider administrator of Dr Biliks clinic These include Planned Parenthood and the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortions a national organization of Protestant clergyman Ten to 20 per cent of our referrals are by previous patients Mr Schneider added Like the Eastgate clinic the cost of an abortion at the Bilik clinic is based on the ability to pay and the length of pregnancy which determines the abortion procelure The average fee is 5175 which includes laboratory work medication and a followup visit according to Alan Sterenfeld an attorney for the clinic Complications Called Minimal William Baird director of the center in the Village of Hempstead also contested the argument that clinics were unequipped to handle complications Medical complications You can have them with having a tooth extracted or with getting penicillin Mr Baird said Its not so much where abortions are done but the skill of the people involved A 23yearold woman who recently came to the Parents Aid Society from Cambridge Mass  she learned of the clinic through a newspaper adagreed with Mr Baird I felt comfortable and found everyone very helpful the woman said shortly after her abortion I chose the clinic mainly because a hospital was more expensive and I couldnt see spending two days there for a 10minute operation A clinic abortion usually is cheaper than one performed in a hospital A hospital abortion ranges from 125 for a procedure requiring a local anesthetic and no overnight stay to 385 for a saline abortion requiring at least a 48hour stay in the hospital The same abortion in one of the clinics would he 175 to 200 Another factor is the immediacy with which an abortion can be done in a clinic At the Parents Aid Society no permission is required for any woman In the Eastgate and Westbury centers a woman under 18 must have parental permission but no married women needs to have her husbands permission for an abortion Although it is not a stand35 Long Island hospitals doing abortions require either parental permission for young unmarried women or permission from the husbands of married women This is just a legal precaution said Dr Michael Buscemi deputy health commissioner in Suffolk And the matter of permission may be up to the physician Dr Buscemi said Its his right and perogative to take or not to take the risk of performing an abortion

Court Voids Jersey Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/02/archives/court-voids-jersey-abortion-law.html,TRENTON March 1  A threejudge Federal court has struck down New Jerseys 122 yearold abortion law declaring it unconstitutional on two groundsvagueness and invasion of privacy The vote was 2 to 1 In an opinion filed late yesterday the court took the more traditional void for vagueness tack first finding that the statutes wordingprohibiting abortions performed without lawful justificationprovides not a glimmer of notice as to what one may or may not do Nor has the application of the statute been clear the court said for courts have found that it allows only abortions necessary to save the life of the mother while prosecutors have agreed not to take action against abortions needed to protect either the mothers life or her health The law also chills doctors exercise of their free speech rights under the First Amendment the court said and violates their rights under the 14th Amendment to freely practice the profession of their choice But then following the recent lead of a handful of state and Federal courts across the country the court held that the constitutionally protected right of privacy extended to abortion and that the reasoning behind the provisions restricting abortions was not compelling enough to justify the invasion of that right The majority said in an opinion by Chief Judge Phillip Forman We hold that a woman has a constitutional right of privacy cognizable under the Ninth and the 14th Amendments to determine for herself whether to bear a child or to terminate a pregnancy in its early stages free from unreasonable interference by the state Safety Standards Noted The court noted that it was not precluding the state from establishing reasonable standards of safety in the conditions under which abortion services may be rendered But it said the abortion law passed in 1849 as well as a provision permitting the suspension or revocation of doctors licenses because of abortions were impermissible invasions of privacy The court had been asked to enjdin the state from enforcing its abortion law But it declined to do so explaining that an injunction was not for the moment necessary The court however did leave open the possibility of an injunction saying that one could be sought if the state did not abide by its decision and continued to enforce the laws it had ruled unconstitutional Attorneys on he winning side from the American Civil Libertes Union of New Jersey and the Population Law Center in New York pondered today whether to appeal the courts denial of the injunctionan appeal that could be made in the Circuit Court of Appeals The courts decision arose out of two cases that were consolidated on appeal One was brought by nine doctors two of whose licenses had been revoked after prosecutlon under the abortion law by three women and the state branch of the Womens International League for Peace and Freedom and by one woman for herself and for the Princeton Young Womens Christian Association The other suit was brought by 1200 women for themselves as well as for all New Jersey women

Birth Rates Found Ina Sharp Decline Among Poor Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/03/archives/birth-rates-found-in-a-sharp-decline-among-poor-women-birth-rates.html,WASHINGTON March 2Birth rates among lowerincome women declined so sharply in the late nineteensixties that they bore a million fewer children than they would have at the earlier rates according to a new private study of Census Bureau data In percentage terms the decline in rates for poorer women those with family incomes under 5000was 27 per cent only a little greater than the 18 per cent decline for others And the rates for poorer women remained significantly higher than the rate for the population as a whole But in absolute terms the study showed a significant narrowing of the historic divergence between the fertility rates of poorer and richer women The number of babies born to the poorer group dropped nearly twice as fast32 fewer babies per thousand compared to 17 fewer among more affluent women The change was even steeper among poor black women They had 49 fewer babies per thousand in the late sixties The study was conducted by Planned Parenthood World Population a major nonprofit birthcontrol organization A primary explanation for the findings is the availability to the poor of better contraceptives Frederick S Jaffe the author of the study said today in an interview When it comes to contraception most everybody in the United States does something The difference is that lowerincome women have been depending on the least effective methods Since 1967 more effective methods have become increasingly available to them The acceleration of Federal assistance was evidenced today in President Nixons special message on health to Congress In 1968 Federal family planning spending totaled 15million The President called today for a spending level in 1973 of 248million The new study is one of series of current indications that the nations population growth rate is declining significantly Another to be distributed this week is the provisional 1971 report of the National Center for Health Statistics It shows that total births declined 4 per cent from the 1970 total even though the number of potential mothers in the population increased There were 3559000 births in 1971 Had 1970 birth rates prevailed analysts estimate there would have been 413000 more The provisional figures also showed a crude birth rate of 173 the lowest corrected rate on record The crude birth rate is the number of births per thousand people The figures included a general fertility rate of 823 the lowest since the late nineteenthirties The general fertility rate is the number of births per thousand women of childbearing age 15 to 44 Census Bureau analysts estimate that these figures would translate into a total fertility rate of 2284 children per mother That would be the lowest since the midthirties when it was 2235 The rate needed to maintain the population is 2110 The Planned Parenthood analysis showed that between 1960 and 1965 the general fertility rate among women with incomes above 5000 was 98 babies per thousand women This fell to 81 between 1966 and 1970 This represented an 18 per cent decline 21 Per Cent Decline Meanwhile the rate among poorer women fell from 153 to 121 babies per thousand a decline of 21 per cent Among the poorest black women the rate dropped from 186 to 137 births per thousand a 26 per cent decline The category covered women with incomes below the Federal poverty level 3968 a year Overall Mr Jaffe said if the 6682000 women aged 15 to 44 classified as poor and nearpoor had experienced the same fertility rate for 196670 as for 196065 they would have had 1065000 more births than they actually had over this fiveyear period In his assessment Mr Jaffe said he had found two distinct patterns of fertility in the late sixties one in which the average was about 120 births per thousand the other about 69 But the dividing line he said was not povertylevel income The high fertility level extends up to families with incomes of about 8000 a year This Mr Jaffe contended shows a need for augmented Federal and private family planning activity Many programs now limit assistance to the poorest of farninos but improved fertility control he said is a critical factor in helping moderateincome families to avoid becoming poorer Family planning services generally make birth control pills and intrauterine devices available to their patients Increased abortions are not thought relevant to the Planned Parenthood findings General liberalization of abortion laws did not begin until about 1970

New Laws Help Minors to Receive Health Care Without Consent of Their Parents,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/05/archives/new-laws-help-minors-to-receive-health-care-without-consent-of.html,A 15yearold boy with a bad Cut on his hand went with his parents to the emergency room of a New York City hospital The cut was stitched When he returned alone a week later to have the stitches removed the Hospital refused to treat him because his parents were not there In a Midwestern city a 16yearold girl asked a private gynecologist for contraception nstead the doctor told her she had no business doing things like that and anyway I could hot even examine you without your parents tonsent2 Four Months later she showed up at a family planning clinic in test  which was positive Difficulties such as these Commonly faced by young people who seek medical treatment have spurred a nation Wide effort to guarantee minors easily accessible and confidential medical care on their own Consent The effort has gained impetus in the last few years as a reatilt of the changing life styles Of many of the nations teenagers  the vast numbers who are emotionally andphysically alienated from their families and the tremendous increase in the needs of young people for treatment in such sensitive areas as contraception pregnancy venereal disease and drugs States End Restrictions Across the nation a rash of new state lawS have abolished the common law requirement for parental consent for at least Certain minors seeking some norms of medical treatment Similar legislation is pending in a dozen other states In States without such laws the age of majority is defined as either 21 or 18 In states currently lacking such legislation a number of Medical care facilities  ineluding many birth control Clinics and a few hospitals and private physicians as well have made it their policy to provide care to minors without requiring that parents be involved or informed At the same times several hundred free clinica catering to the youth trade have sprung up across the country to proVide confidential medical care without a hassle to anyone Who needs it Although initially these clinics served hipples runaways and other street peoPle almost exclusively several are now being used by Ordinary teenagers who have found traditional sources of medical care unresponsive to their needs Several of the nations medical organizations have recently dome me out in support of the minors right to health care The American Medical Association the Arnerican Academy of Pediatries and the American Academy of Family Physicians have endorsed the right of teenage girl to contraception if necessary on her own consent and the American College Of Obstetricians and Gynecologists the Society for Adolescent Medicine and de American Public Health Association recommended further the removal of all legal barriers to the treatment of a minor who refuses to involve his or her parents Daily throughout the country the requirement for parental consent sends youths in need of treatment back into the streets untreated During one recent week in which the admitting office of large Denver hospital kept track five youths walked out when administrators pressed them for information about their parents We never even found out what they had one official remarked In New York Dr Joan Morgenthau director of adolescent medicine at Mount Sinai Hose pital recalls that a group of youngsters came into the clinic who had been using drugs and were concerned about hepatitis She said We felt that some form of adult supervision was necessary and when we suggested that they stopped coming in And Charles T Lindman of Maines Health Department reports that before a law was passed in 1969 enabling physicians to treat minors for venereal disease on their own consent teenagers would plead with a doctor not to tell their parents and then they would walk out of the office without treatment There is considerable evidence of the American teen agers need for health care in sensitive areas Forty per cent of the nations illegitimate births are to teenage mothers and onethird of the brides 18 years old or younger are pregnant on their wedding day In the last decade teenagers have contributed in large part to the soaring epidemic of veneral disease In 1970 the VD rate among the nations 15to 19yearolds was double the national rate Heavy Use of Drugs Although there are no precise figures it is estimated that a quarter to a third of the nations high school age population has used such dangerous drugs as amphetamines LSD and heroin In addition teenagers suffer from more than their share of accidents psychological problems and psychosomatic symptoms According to Harriet Pilpel a New York lawyer who has surveyed the state laws at least 43 states have passed laws in the last few years to permit doctors to diagnose and treat venereal disease in minors on their own consent And 25 states have extended to at least certain minors the right to treatment in such areas as contraception and other pregnancy related conditions drug addiction and sometimes the full range of medical services The tmajority of these states liowever limit the broad range of services to what are called emancipated minorsusually those18 or over or married or living away from home and supporting them Alabama has one of the nations most liberal laws It pro vides among other things that any minor age 14 or older may consent to medical treatment and that other minors can be treated on their own consent for pregnancy VD drug problems reportable diseases or if in the doctors judgment the attempt to gain parental consent would impair the childs mental or physical health But inconsistencies and paradoxes abound in existing laws such as the following In Hawaii and Nebraska a doctor can treat an unemancipated minor for VD on his own consent but then the doctor must inform the parents of it In Illinois a minor with a baby can give consent for medical treatment for her child but not for herself In California a girl can consent to an abortion at any age but youngsters under 15 cannot obtain contraception Those opposed to legislation that would abolish the requirement for parental consent usually argue that it would undermine the family unit But Dr William J Curran professor of legal medicine at Harvard Medical and Law Schools said that such laws would result in a breakaway from alienation for these kids It would encourage them to get into a relationship with an adult namely a doctor and that might be the one healthy relationship they have with an adult he declared Most professionals involved in adolescent health care believe that it is best when the youngster is supported by an understanding parent But according to Dr Adele D Hofmann director of adolescent medicine at Bellevue Hospital here such support is not always possible and lasometimes undesirable Parents are the moral stan dard bearers said the doctor herSelf a mother of two They cant say with consistency You shouldnt do this but if you do you must be Sure to protect Yourself As a 16yearold New Jersey girl explained My mother is a doctor in a Planned Parenthood clinic and she has no trotible dealing with the kids there But when it comes to her own daughter its different couldnttell her Im having sex with my boy friend The confrontation is very difficultafter all shes my mother Another common objection to minors health legislation is if parents are not involved who would foot the bill Dr Hofmann calls this an empty issue She suggested that a doctor who regularly treats a minor might make an arrangement with the parents such that they would know he must deal with the youngster on a confidential basis and secure their willingness to pay his fees Or if this cannot work Dr Hofmann said most doctors can afford to have a few patients who cannot pay Doctors reluctance to treat minors without parental consent derives largely from unwritten law that could make them liable to the charges of malpractice assault and battery or in the case of contraceptive treatment contributing to the delinquency of a minor Dr Hofmann observed that a doctor is damned if he does and damned if he doesnt She said A physician may well be liable if damages result from his withholding of treatment from a youth in need Largely on the basis of this reasoning at least 27 Planned Parenthood clinics throughout the country are now serving teenagers on their own consent The New York City clinics report that 42 per cent of their 12000 new patients last year were under age 19 and the clinics have established special hours after school and on weekends to accommodate them Alfred F Moran executive director of the clinics here said We get a lot of calls from irate parents When we explain to them that we are providing service to protect their youngsters they usually end up not happy but resigned to the reality and willing to go along with it At least they get a sense of security that the youngster was smart enough to come to us for contraception rather than walk in pregnant three months later Another approach to health care for minors  the free medical clinic  skirts the issue of parental involvement almost entirely At the more than 200 such clinics that have opened in the last four years in metropolitan areas throughout the country youngsters are treated without charge and with no questions asked The vomit majority of clinic patients are between the ages of 15 and 24 Dr Joseph Brenner psychiatrist at MassachUsetts Institute of Technology and director of the Cambridgeport Clinic says he assumes that any minor to shows the good udgment to seek treatment is emancipated If theres no need to involve the parents and if the youngster doesnt want to we dont he said Dr Brenner added that in the three years the clinic has been operating he has received Only five calls from angry pa ents and no laWsults Most of the parental feedback has been good and occasionally its been accompanied by a check he remarked
Population Growth Said to Slow In Countries of the Soviet Bloc,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/05/archives/population-growth-said-to-slow-in-countries-of-the-soviet-bloc.html,As a result of a marked fall in the birth rate since the middle nineteenfifties population growth in the Soviet Union and other countries of the Warsaw Pact has slowed according to report by the Economic Committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization As a result the population gap between the Eastern and Western alliances is expected to widen in favor of NATO The population of the Warsaw Pact countries in 1970 was 3459 million and that of the 15 Atlantic Alliance countries 5538 million For 1980 the figures forecast by demographic experts are 377 million and 5961 million respectively United States British West German and French demographers submitted reports to the Economic Committee recently Danish and Belgian experts also attended the meetings which examined population trends in the Soviet Union Poland Rumania East Germany Bulgaria Czechoslovakia and Hungary The experts found that abortion has bees the chief cause of the decline in the birth rate in the Warsaw Pact countries in the last 15 years Since the liberalization of abortion laws in the middle nineteenfifties the number of legal abortions has grown strikingly 60 Abortions In Hungary They estimated that 60 per cent of all pregnancies are aborted in Hungary and that this figure probably applies also to the Soviet Union Other estimates were 44 per cent of pregnancies aborted in Bulgaria 36 per cent in Czechoslovakia and 23 per cent in Poland Authorities in these countries alarmed by the decline in births have attempted to raise the rate The abortion law was tightened in Rumania and the birth rate rose from 12 per thousand in December 1966 to 40 in September 1967 Since then however the sate has declined steadily because it is believed of use of contraceptives and illegal abortions In the first quarter of 1971 the birth rate was 20 per thousand Decline In 1980s Seen Despite the general decline in the birth rate the experts foresee no shortage of military manpower over the next decade in the Warsaw Pact in comparison with NATO United States projections submitted to the committee showed about 2250000 men reaching the military age of 18 years in the Soviet Union each year at present This figure it is believed will rise to about 2500000 in the early nineteeneighties when it will begin to decline slightly In the other countries of Eastern Europe the number of men reaching military age each yearabout 1000000 at present  is seen as beginning to diminish by the middle of this decade Neither the Soviet Union nor the East European countries are likely to resort to reductions in armed forces because of lack of manpower the report stated One main point that emerged from the experts papers was that future industrial growth in the Warsaw Pact countries will depend almost exclusively on higher productivity In the past such growth depended largely on a rapid expansion of the labor force through the recruiting of the young the transfer and migration of young peasants to industrial areas and increased participation of women Peasant Force Depleted Although an appreciable number of young people will be reaching working age in the future the experts concluded that the reserve work force of peasants and women is almost exhausted Within the Warsaw Pact the Soviet population makes up 70 per cent of the total and if current trends continue this share is expected to rise in the future Inside the Soviet Union the nonEuropean peoples of Central Asia the Caucasus and Siberia although a minority of about 20 per cent of the total population of 2428 million in 1970 are increasing much faster than the Europeans the Great Russians the Byelorussians the Ukrainians and the Baltic peoples
Three Movies That Promise More Than They Deliver,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/05/archives/three-movies-that-promise-more-than-they-deliver-three-that-fail-to.html,WITH the exception of Cabaret and possibly several other films including Bartleby which closed before I had chance to see it all of the movies that have recently opened in New York have been alarmingly numbingly uppermediocre Not bad In intelligent or extravagant ways that demand attention but certainly not good It may simply be the time of year That is the postChristmas preEaster slump during which fortunate exhibitors play off their endoftheyear hits while their desperate competitors offer whatever is available including reissues of movies like Patton and Around The World in 80 Days or invite us in gesture that is meant to seem generous to spend a day with Clint Eastwood watching four of his old Westerns programed in the kind of solemn sequential order usually reserved for The Apu Trilogy Im thinking of star vehicles on the order of Mary Queen of Scots and The Nightcomers but mostly of smaller films like Dealing Outback and To Find A Man whose themes concerns and production auspices promise something more in the way of excitement than is ever achieved Although there are good things in each of these three films they are taken together significantly disappointing Because the structure of the film industry must change as the major companies make fewer and fewer films the industrys future is dependent upon the success of young filmmakers like Paul Williams and Edward R Pressman Dealing on the adventurousness of outside money sources such as Group W which financed Outback and on the chutzpah of the conventional bigdream producer like Ray Stark whose company backed Buzz Kuilks To Find A Man and who can occasionally afford to be spectacularly wrong by backing the difficult project Unfortunately none of these films is spectacularly wrong They are movies that lack any sense of urgencyexisting in the practical deadcenter of the great gray void that separates the very good from the very bad Take for example To Find A Man which deals with the very real mysteries of adolescent love in terms that at best recall Sally Bensons Junior Miss stories gone sour Andy Darren OConnor and Rosalind Pamela Martin are teenagers whose parents occupy adjacent townhouses on New Yorks Sutton Place Rosalinds problem is that she is pregnant and that she must get a secret abortion within the two days she has between arriving home from boarding school for Christmas vacation and leaving for Acapulco with her family Andy who has always loved Rosalind but never had the nerve to kiss her sees the beautiful irritable girl through the crisis and in so doing suddenly finds himself falling out of lovehis first time There is something properly grave and very funny about the growing up of Andy as played by the 16yearold Mr OConnor but Mr Kulik the director and Arnold Schulman who wrote the screenplay studiously ignore all of the seriously comic potential in the situation Instead they define it in exchanges like the one in which a classmate advises Rosalind to abort herself by taking her fathers heart attack pills ROSALIND My father doesnt take heart attack pills FRIEND Wait till he hears youre pregnant There are scenes of Rosalind jumping off high places and guzzling castor oil of Rosalind and Andy sitting in an abortion clinic while Rosalind frets about missing an appointment with her orthodontist and finally of Rosalind just aborted asking the kindly doctor Tom Ewell if it was a girl or a boy The effect of the gags which are both simple and sick is to deny the humanity of Andy and the possibility of Intelligent social satire The movie sees nothing especially sad in the fact that Rosalind fails to recognize her problem as anything but a minor physical one nor does it make any but the most obvious comments about the highincome poshness in which the story is set This is the fictitious Sutton Place of several generations of bad Broadway comedies Its there to give the characters class rather than a connection to a world of authentic manners and morals Dealing Or The BerkeleytoBoston FortyBrick LostBag Blues is the third film to be made by Paul Williams the director and Edward R Pressman the producer who were responsible for Out of It and The Revolutionary both of which I liked The new film about a Harvard Law School stlident who occasionally acts as a marijuana courier is a comedy that pretty much drifts into a commitment with its theme which is as I see it the need for commitment Peter Robert F Lyons has no special aim in life until his girl Barbara Hershey is arrested by a crooked Boston narcotics detective on a grass charge Peter sets up and successfully carries out an elaborate scheme to blackmail the cop to free his girl Much to his amazement he becomes at the same time involved with real narcotics pushers real guns and real death Its good idea nicely acted but like The Revolutionary its so understated and at intervals so vague that I really wasnt certain it had anything on its mind until it was all over Even now I feel that I may be givig it the benefit of the doubt Im still not sure whether some of its confusions should be granted the status of ambiguities or simply chalked up to bad editing Ted Kotcheff a Canadian director Tiara Tahiti Life At The Top who lives in Britain made Outback where it all might have happenedin the Australian outback Although I have no way of knowing for sure suspect that in this case the screenplay by Evan Jones might have been a little betterless fancy reallythan the production that has been given it Outback is the existential horror story of a young cleancut school teacher from the bush country who on his way to Sydney to spend his Christmas vacation stops to spend one night in a dreary provincial town In the kind of breakdown that used to fascinate Paul Bowles the teacher manages to lose his money his vacation his almost his life after hoisting a few beers in a local pub I dont mind that the film ultimately does not honor its own pessimism beautifully synopsized in two wild and drunken kangaroo hunts But I do mind a lot of the needlessly elaborate camerawork and most of all some scenes toward the end of the film that effectively repudiate everything that has gone before like the denouement ofw a mystery film that admits it has been arbitrarily withholding important facts lei not a bad movie but its not the sort of film one can easily recommend especially if

Both Sides Prepare for Battles on Court's Ruling Against Ban on Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/05/archives/both-sides-prepare-for-battles-on-courts-ruling-against-ban-on.html,TRENTONAttorney General George F Kugler Jr of New Jersey is readying an appeal of the Federal Court decision that struck down New Jerseys 123yearold abortion law as organizations on both sides of the issue map their next movesIn a 21 decision last Wednesday a Circuit Court panel said the state statute was unconstitutionally vague and invaded a womans right to privacy The court stopped short however of issuing an injunction against prosecu don under the statute saying it cohsidered that unnecessary The reaction to the decision was swift Spokesmen for religious communities and antiabortion groups denounOed the ruling and are looking to bolster the state appeal with supporting briefs and Ito inspire new strict abortion legislation In the event the decision is upheld Birth control Liberalized abortion and civil rights groups are moving immediately to make abortions more available to women who want them despite the possibility of prosecution Medical Parley Called Mrs Sharon Clark of Princeton coordinator for the New Jersey abortion and birth control coalition said a meeting would be called this week in the New Brunswick area to discuss medical standards for abortion a recommended schedule of doctors fees and plans for a referral service She said the coalition represented 75 birthcontrol and abortion reform groups throughout the state Stephen M Nagler executive director of the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union said his first move would be totry to win reinstatement for a physician whose license was still revoked because of a conviction under the abortion statute He said the ACLU which was One of the successful litigants in the court test also move immediately for the injunction the first time a prosecutor tries to crack down on a doctor for performing an abortion within the guidelines set down in the decision The court said abortions could be performed in the first four months of pregnancy Mr Nagler said that a number of doctors had indicated to him they intended to wive to establish abortion clinics in the very near future Old and New The court ruling contained something old and something new The1849 law had long been criticized as vague even by the New Jersey Supreme Court which recommended in 1967 that the State Legislature decide exactly what was proscribed under the law which made it a crime to perform an abortion without legal justification The only ground allowed in the statute was to protect the life of the mother but some prosecutors extended that to include the mothers health as well as her life Chief Justice Joseph Weintraub said It is the Legislature which Should decide what conduct shall be punishable and although the judiciary should labor to find the legislative intent and to sustain it within constitutional bounds it is something else to permit the Legislature to pass the policy decision to the judiciary An attempt to create an abortionstudy commission in the Legislature that year failed and former Attorney General Arthur J Sills attempted to handle the problem administratively by appointing a committee of county prosecutors to reach a consensus on how the law should be interpreted and enforced The move failed because of toogreat a variety of opinions among the 21 county prosecutors The new aspect of the decision was the right to privacy doctrine first enunciated in the United States Supreme Court decision that overturned a Connecticut statute banning the use of contraceptives The high court said this was an invasion of the right of privacy th the marital bed and this doctrine has been used in a number of similar abortion decisions across the country before the New Jersey decision was handed doWn last week Mr Nagler said the state Legislature would have been constrained to enact a new law immediately if the only ground for striking down the old one was its vagueness But he said the fact thatjt upheld the pregnant womans right to privacy should convince the lawmakers they must do nothing to interfere with that right Spokesmen for the New Jersey Catholic Conference and the Birthright Committee of New Jersey are dismayed that the decision in their view places the right to privacy above the right to live A spokesman for the Birthright Committee said the law that was struck down talked of the right of an unborn child but the decision refers only to embryo fetus and protoplasm and nowhere refers to a child How can the court do anything with statute if it cannot use its own language In the majority opinion the court noted the abortion issue raised profound religious philosophical and medical arguments concerning when the embryo was considered a human being that are beyond the competence of judicial resolution The Birthright Committee spokesman said that even though the court had held it could not rule on this question its decision had the affect of stating definitely that the unborn child was not a human being The Right ReV Aloysius J Welsh executive coordinator of the Catholic Conference the official voice Of the states five Roman Catholic bishopssaid the decision ran counter to a growing body of medical knowledge and legal recognition of the fetus as a human being The unborn child has the right to sue for damages in accident cases and to be mentioned in deeds and wills among other legal rights It is obvious that the laws conferral upon the unborn infant of a full panolpy of legal rights was an inescapable conclusion based on scientific fact he said In a statement Dr Jacob Kassin chief rabbi of the Rabbinical Council of America which represents Sephardic Jews attacked the court decision as immoral and atrocious and a Judicial approval of the legalized murder of innocent and defenseless unborn but live babies Rabbi Kassin said that more than 700 rabbis agreed at a convention ih Jertisalem that abortion should be banned except when it was necessary to save the life of the mother Most lawyers concerned with the abortion issue agree that the courts decision has the affect of reinstating the old common law which was superceded by the 1840 abortion statute Under common law an abortion is permitted before quickening when the pregnant woman feels life within herbut is a crime after that time The penalty is strictly left to the discretion of the sentencing judge and anyone can perform an abortion under the common law Mr Nagler said It was still questionable whether the state would automatically return to the common law but he said existing medical statutes provided all the safeguards needed to protect women from abortions by anyone but a qualified physician
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/06/archives/are-some-more-equal.html,To the Editor Your Feb 18 editorial on abortion and Medicaid once again demonstrates an amazing lack of sensitivity to human needs and values You speak of equal protection of the laws but in practice you advocate the Orwellian concept that some human beings are more equal than others You are I am sure aware that in the Byrn litigation a corporation counsel of the City of New York and the Attorney General of the State of New York admitted that the child in the womb is scientifically and medically a human being They maintain however this human being is not person entitled to constitutional protection Once any class of human beings may be treated as nonpersons one need Took only to the existence of slavery and the resultant civil rights problems in this country to the Nazi terror in Germany and other similar examples to see where this path ends If protection can be denied to any human being or class of human beings then it is not equal and then none of us has any protection HAROLD A MERIAM Jr Brooklyn Feb 18 1972
JERSEY TO APPEAL ABORTION DECISION,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/08/archives/jersey-to-appeal-abortion-decision.html,TRENTON March 7State Attorney General George F Kugler Jr anounced today that New Jersey would appeal the decision last week by a threeman Federal court that declared the states 123yearold abortion law as unconstitutional and the ground that it was vague In the interim Mr Kugler said in a statement issued here he has recommended to New Jerseys 21 Prosecutors that pending prosecution for violations of the criminal abortion statue be held in abeyance However he said in a later statement that any alleged violators of the statute would still be subject to arrest and criminal indictment Mr Kugler said that his interpretation of the Federal courts ruling was that it certainly did not intend to sanction backroom abortion or to authorize abortion mills Rather he said it would appear that the court desires that the status quo prevail pending a final decision by the Appellate Courts
Mercury Poisoning in Iraq Is Said to Kill 100 to 400,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/09/archives/mercury-poisoning-in-iraq-is-said-to-kill-100-to-400.html,BEIRUT Lebanon March 8Informed travelers from Baghdad say Iraq is in the grip of a severe mercurypoisoning outbreak The travelers who arrived last night reported that 100 to 400 people had died since the outbreak began early in February The poisoning appeared to be the result of improper use of mercurytreated imported wheat seed Hospitals are jammed with patients some suffering from brain damage blindness or paralysis caused by mercury poisoning the travelers said The Government in Baghdad has imposed a blackout on news of the pollution allowing only brief official announcements to be printed in the statecontrolled newspapers or broadcast on the radio Situation Under Control The travelers said the Government had the situation under control now and had just lifted a ban on slaughter of cattle and the sale of locally produced poultry and fish However Iraqis are not buying national products and line up daily in front of grocery stores to buy imported frozen or canned meat The rush has produced a shortage of imported foods The outbreak in Iraq appears to be the worst on record anywhere The largest previously reported outbreaks occurred in Japan in the ninteenfifties among the families of fishermen who consumed a great deal of mercurycontaminated fish At least 52 deaths and some 170 illnegses were reported in the two Japanese incidents The source of the Iraqi poisoning is believed to be a shipment of wheat seeds imported by the Government a few months ago reportedly from Canada to keep the peasants supplied in the wake of drought last summer that seriously affected crops The seeds had been treated with mercury probably as fungicide A warning about the poisonous material was printed on every sack of wheat with clear instructions that it was to be used only for planting when it is not harmful Sick Cattle Sold for Meat However the peasants apparently ignored the warning and used the seeds as fodder for their cattle and other animals Because mercury has a delayed effect the peasants seeing that the animals did not appear to be affected began to use the grain in making flour When the cattle showed symptoms of sickness the travelers said they were rushed to the slaughterhouse and sold for meat The contamination prompted the Government to ban all locally produced meats while the slaughter of cattle chicken and sheep was forbidden A special Government commission formed to investigate the situation ordered all peasants in possesSion of the seeds to turn them over to the Government immediately The Revolutionary Command Council the highest executive authority stepped in and issued a decree stipulating that those who deal in or sell the poisonous seeds were punishable by death Some of the farmers panicked and dumped the seed into the Tigris thus polluting the river bed and the fish in it The Government promptly prohibited river fishing but later lifted the ban after investigation showed the pollution had been checked The illness began in the Kirkuk region about 150 miles north of Baghdad but did not spread to the Kurdish areas farther north the travelers said Doctors nurses and veterinarians were mobilized by the Ministry of Health and more beds were moved into hospitals which were placed in a state of emergency The travelers said that a number of pregnant women especially foreign housewives underwent abortions for fear they may have been exposed to the poison which can severely damage unborn babies The Governmentowned Iraqi Airways has been buying food for its passengers from Beirut airline sources reported An Insidious Poison Since 1960 until the present outbreak in Iraq more than 450 persons in several countries have become seriously ill and many have died from eating seed grain treated with mercury compounds The most recent reported case occurred two years ago among a hograising family in Alamogordo NM in which three children suffered severe brain damage after having eaten pork from animals fed treated seed grain Mercury especially in its organic form is an insidious poison the effects of which occur slowly through continued exposure Symptoms of mercury poisoning are likely to go undetected until the damage is irreversible Early symptoms are nonspecificfatigue headache and irritability Symptoms Described Later symptoms may include tremor numbness of the limbs blurred vision loss of coordination deafness speech impairment and erratic personality and emotional disturb ances Ultimate effects may be death brain damage or blindness The growing concern over mercury poisoning in this country in the last two years results from the realization that many of the nations waterwaysand the fish that inhabit themare heavily contaminated with mercury largely from industrial wastes The contamination is particularly serious in fish at the end of the food chain Consequently Americans were cautioned recently about consumption of swordfish and tuna both of which are large predatory fish that accumulate mercury for years before they are caught Canada Ending Practice In Toronto an official of Canadas agriculture department said that mercury compounds had been used for decades to protect seed from insects and fungi but that the practice was gradually being abandoned Government officials were unable to check immediately on whether Canada had sent seed wheat to Iraq in recent months They explained that no export permit would be required for such a shipment and that Canada did not give economic aid to Iraq Robert G Savage chief of the Agriculture Departments seed section said that because of the mercury scare of the last several years were in ell throes of changing over from mercury products to other substances However Mr Savage added some of these mercury products have still been available In Alberta in the autumn of 1970 gamebird hunting was prohibited because the birds had been ingesting mercurycontaminated seed Canada also has experienced mercury contamination of some lakes and rivers and there have been bans on fishing
East German Parliament Approves Free Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/10/archives/east-german-parliament-approves-free-abortion.html,BERLIN March 9The East German Parliament passed a bill today allowing free abortion on demand within the first 12 weeks of pregnancyDr Mecklinger took note of the opposition of the churches and of a religiously motivated sense of morality among some East German women He said the new bill left it to the women concerned to make use of the right or to waive it The controversial nature of the measure was pointed up when 14 members of Parliament voted against the bill and 8 others abstained In the past the 500 members had always voted unanimously Along with the new law East Genially also lowered to 16 the age at which birthcontrol pills may be provided on prescription The primary reason for the legislative move was a desire to end illegal abortions said to abound throughout East Germany While no official statistics have been disclosed informed East Germans have said that the rate of aborted pregnancies equalled that of births Seven years ago in a previous step toward liberalization women under 16 years of age or over 40 and mothers given the right to abortion afwith at least four children were given the right to abortion after applying to a state commission Move Was Delayed In introducing the legislation passed today the Minister of Health Prof Ludwig Mecklinger said that woman must have the right to determine whether they want to have a baby or whether they wish to end an unwanted pregnancy Originally the East German Communist partys Politburo and the Council of Ministers had sought to introduce the liberalized abortion plan by decree at the end of last year Opposition particularly from churches forced the Communists to go through months of parliamentary procedures and to allow discussion in newspapers and other media Doctors and nurses with moral or religious scruples are said to have been assured that they would not be forced to perform abortions Issue in Bonn West Germany too is in the midst of parliamentary debate on abortion reform But there the prevalence of conservative thinking and of church influence make liberalization like that in East Germany unlikely Instead the West German Government has prepared a bill that would facilitate abortions as medical or social needs indicate At present most kinds of abortions are illegal in West Germany The East German decision came as a surprise to those acquainted with East Germanys stagnant population figures In a grossly overaged population of 17 million the country has had a negative birth ratemore people dying than being bornsince 1968 East Germanys apparent need to augment its labor force through women workers was an influential factor in the decision More than 80 per cent of females aged 16 to 60 are employed in factories collective farms plants or public utilities The new law enables women to get speedy abortions in the first three months of preg nancies at approved hospitals and other gynecological insti talons Doctors were told that they must advise patients of medical risks and instruct them on use of contraceptives Costs of the operations are to be underwritten by the East German social security system
Population Panel Warns Growth Must Be Slowed,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/12/archives/population-panel-warns-growth-must-be-slowed-first-of-3-final.html,WASHINGTON March 11America should slowand gradually stopthe growth of her population the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future told President Nixon and Congress today After a detailed twoyear assessment of the impact of population growth on the economy the environment government and the quality of life the commission concluded that no substantial benefits would result from continued growth of the nations population In the first of three final reports the commission rejected views at the extremes of the current public debate over population It challenged both biggerthebetter boosterism on the one hand and the emergencycrisis response on the other Emphasis on Prudence Neither crisis nor complacency are in order said John D Rockefeller 3d chairman of the 24member Federal commission The operative word should be prudence the report said Thus it called on the United States to become the first na tion to adopt a deliberate population policy And it said that much of the population problem could be solved simply by enabling parents now to avoid unwanted childbearing The commission was established by Congress at the request of President Nixon in March 070 to assess the consequences of population growth in the United States for the rest of this century The commission includes Congressmen businessmen labor leaders foundation and university officials youths and members of minorities Special Recommendations Two subsequent reports will contain special recommendations touching on the volatile issue of population control Among them a commissioner indicated privately will be a call for liberalized abortion laws and regulations a recommendation that would appear to be at odds with the present Nixon Administration policy In the first report which was released today the commissions main concern was not the quantity of people in the future but the quality of life The commission said for example that unless population growth was checked social freedom would be choked by fees forms licenses lines regulations and red tape The resulting society would be so oppressive the commission added that the population of the year 2020 may look back with envy on what from their vantage point appears te be our relatively unfettered way of life Numbers are part of the problem the report continued If families average two children the nations population would rise from the present 208 million to 271 million by the year 2000 But if families average three children the population then would be 322 million In the next 100 years the twochild average would produce 350 million Americans while the threechild average would produce nearly a billion The time has come to challenge the tradition that population growth is desirable What was intended may turn out to be unwanted in the society as in the family Distribution Cited As important as the size of the population is the distribution of the population the report said In the nineteensixties the nations population grew by 24 million At the same time in part because of internal migration the population concentrated in metropolitan areas grew by more than 26 million Population growth is metropolitan growth in the contemporary United States the report said The commission intimated that it would later offer recommendations concerning regional and metropolitan government and the idea of purposely establishing alternate growth centers to ease pressures on existing metropolitan areas But the underlying recommendation the report made clear remains population stabilization At the moment commission officials asknowledged that recommendation calls on people to do only what they are already doing A series of recent population indicators have disclosed sharp drops in the birth and fertility rates and in the number of children women expect to bear However the report sought to explain why this babybust phenomenon may be shortterm and warned that the birth and fertility rates could easily go up again Because of the large and maturing postwar baby boom population the United States has a potential for further growth greater than that of almost any other advanced country the report said And it added that even if couples now had only two children enough to replace themselvesand even if all immigration stopped the nations population would not stop growing for 70 years At the same time the commission was persuaded by evidence showing that if unwanted births could be better prevented the population growth problem would be substantially solved The persistence of this problem reflects an effective denial of freedom of choice and equality of access to the means of fertility control the report said Making effective contraception and presumably abortion  more readily available would thus promote freedom of personal choice and fewer children This in turn would lead to national social benefit a smaller populationthe report said The proper mission for government in this matter is to insure the fullest opportunity for people to decide their own future in this regard based on the best available knowledge the report said Potential Controversy The commissions sensitivity to potential controversy on this issue and others was evidenced by frequent delicacy of language and strategy For example while this report was unanimous it contained a series of separate statements These focused on two major issues the problems of minorities and the present economic organization of the nation as it affects the environment The commissions report bridged these differences of priority Whatever the primary needs of our society the policies recommended here all lead in right directions the report said And subsequent chapters gave extended attention to environmental and minority group problems For example on environment the report said The real risk lies in the fact that increasing numbers press us to adopt new technologies before we know what we are doing When one pesticide or food additive is found to be dangerous to man it is replaced with another about which we know less Slower population growth will not eliminate this situation but it will buy time for the development of sensible solutions On minorities the report emphasized that blacks and Puerto Ricans may have higher birth rates but that 70 per cent of the population growth is contributed by whites The idea that our population growth is primarily fueled by the poor and minorities having lots of babies is a myth the report said In the economic sector the commission questioned what it termed the growth mystique in business and labor It found that continued growth was not an economic asset On the contrary most of the plusses are on the side of slower growth the report said In the next 10 or 15 years slower growth will cause total as well as per capita income to rise faster the commission found after a study of some 15 major economic sectors After that period changes in consumer tastes and technological developments should far exceed the problems of adjusting to a lower population rate the report said The loom tender in the diaper factory is hurt more by the competition from synthetic disposables than by the recent decline in births

Lieut. Gov. Wilson: No. 2 Bides His Time,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/13/archives/lieut-gov-wilson-no-2-bides-his-time-wilson-biding-time-for-move-if.html,ALBANY March 12The Valentines Day gathering of Republican women tittered appreciatively as the speaker lauded Governor Rockefeller for the achievements of his 13 years one month 1300BD days and two hours and 29 minutes in office It was precisely 229 PM and the box score of Nelson A Rockefellers tenure as Governor was being kept by Lieut Gov Malcolm Wilson who has served alongside Mr Rockefeller since the days in 1958 when Mr Wilson drove the gubernatorial candidate around the state without sycophants or bag bearers The trips were made in Mr Wilsons car he recalled in an interview because it was essential that Mr Rockefeller not make a show of his enormous wealth Mr Wilson then in his 20th year in the Assembly was also a political tour guide for Mr Rockefeller introducing him to local GOP leaders and smoothing the way for him in countless spots in the state Word of Tribute And it paid off Mr Wilson recalled because by August of that year Mr Rockefeller had all the hay in the barn Now in his fourth fouryear term Mr Rockefeller has not forgotten Frankly if it werent for Malcolm I wouldnt be here the Governor told a gathering of newspaper publishers here recently And then came the inevitable fillip the comment that in one form or another pursues Mr Wilson from dais to dais dinner to dinner fried chicken lunch to fried chicken lunch And if I werent here Malcolm would be the Governor concluded to the wry cackles that inevitably accompany remarks about Mr Wilsons years as No 2 If there is a tinge of annoyance Mr Wilson hides it well He is not a man to display emotion publicly The public mien is propercourteous sometimes dour often amiablebut always proper Getting a Chance It is no secret that Mr Wilson would like to remove the word lieutenant from his title and more than one highranking Republican has spoken of a commitment Mr Rockefeller reportedly has made to give Malcolm a shot at the Governors office The reports have been accented recentlyby repeated talk that Mr Rockefeller will not serve out his fourth term but will instead join the Nixon Administration Some Republican politicians say that whether or not the reports are true they have galvanized such potential gubernatorial candidates as Assembly Speaker Perry B Duryea Republican of Montauk L I into action and spurred them into feeling out their prospects about the state Asked about such reports Mr Wilson replied in the deep measured tones and the cautious and precise oratory for which he is known in the Capitol I have no reason to believe other than that the Governor intends to serve out the balance of his term As he spoke he casually flicked cigarette ashes into wastebasket in his handsome paneled office decorated with red leather chairs and red brocade draperies If he does leave assuming I was still alive I would be the Governor Mr Wilson said Under all of these circumstances I believe that I would be a candidate for a full term The 58yearold Lieutenant Governor is in his 34th year of state service During his 20 years in the Assembly he earned a reputation as a superb parliamentarian a talent that has improved while he has presided as Lieutenant Governor over the deliberations of the Senate Under the State Constitution the only other function of a Lieutenant Governor is to replace the Governor if he is disabled or out of the state Rut Mr Rockefeller invested Mr Wilson a Westchester attorney with more than that when the two men took office In 1958 And to this day Mr Wilson has enjoyed the confidence of Mr Rockefeller and has accepted being in the shadows as part of the job His is a voice thats listened to an aide to Mr Rockefeller said of Mr Wilson Mr Wilson is addicted to detail and studies voluminous state reports that cause lets disciplined types to doze off He translates this dedication into discourse at meetings and sometimes he can border on the soporific although no one disputes his ability to grapple with complex issues It was Mr Wilson who sold Mr Rockefeller on the idea of making a strong push for Federal revenue sharing to aid financially strapped state governments He did this right after the 1970 elections and Mr Rockefeller has relentlessly pursued the idea since Hes a politicians polltician one knowledgeable Republican said recently Getting to Know Everyone The comment was testimony to Mr Wilsons unabating conviction that the key to political success is knowing everybody everywhere at every level in the state who can deliver votes I have never been any place on Election Day but a polling place from the time I wasa kid he said I had this orthodox background in terms of understanding the importance of the organization structure he said I still go around to all those county organizations Yet he is a man who can walk unnoticed in New York City And that is due in some measure to his concept of his office and the dearth of press releases his office issues I have endeavored constantly to work with the Governor and to differ with him in our private meetings Agreement does not make news he said I feel I should not get into a public controversy with the Governor he said leaning back in his chair eyes closed speaking slowly Clarifying a Point Then to make sure the record was accurate Mr Wilson corrected himself and said there were two occasions during his 13 years with the Governor when he publicly differed with him One was on the product turned out by the illfated Constitutional Convention of 1967 The other was when Mr Rockefeller proposed liberalization of the abortion law and Mr Wilson a stanch Roman Catholic vigorously demurred Mr Wilson conceded he might not be recognized on a New York City street But he hastened to note that he was wellknown to such important voting blocs as policemen firemen sanitation workers Civil Service employesall through their union representatives Mr Wilson has had extensive dealings with these officials in Albany and at 22 West 55th Street where he has an office at the Governors city headquarters The Lieutenant Governor described himself as an economic conservative and a human rights liberal He was concerned he said over the everincreasing amount of state and local government financing of operational expenses that is done by variety of fiscal gimmicks for which there must at some point be a day of reckoning Not All That Simple We have to beware of people who have simple solutions to things that sound good to the voters he told a businessmens gathering recently continuing You knowget rid of the real estate tax free tuition all the slogansbecause oversimplification is the great corrupter of our times and I suggest that what we need are more complexifiers Clearly Mr Wilson regards himself as a complexifier But even a complexifier is not above a light moment At a recent gubernatorial dinner dance at thee Executive Mansion where he stays when he is in Albany Mr Wilson showed up wearing kilts and was told your knees are the talk of Albany And within the tightknit circle of state officials with whom he is friendly he is not above a prank According to one source he recently had an ersatz bill drafted naming the new bar association building here in honor of Senator Jacob K Javits The bill was sent to Attorney General Louis J Lefkowitzwhose relationship with the Senator can be politely described as arctic
Feminists vs. the Media: Signs of Change,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/14/archives/feminists-vs-the-media-signs-of-change.html,About two years ago when the quotation marks were still bracketing womens liberation about 100 allegedly militant feminists staged a wellpublicized invasion of the editorial offices of The Ladies Home Journaltrying to change attitudes according to a spokeswoman for the invaders They had some specific demands too ranging from the replacement of the magazines editor by a woman to an end of exploitative advertisements While their 11hour siege did not bring about these endsit did win them an eightpage liberation supplement in a later issue of the Journalit begins to look as if two years later some attitudes have changed A little This is not to any that the glossy magazines aimed at women have abandoned fullcolor layouts of molded marshmallow salads and hostess dresses you can whip up in 14 hours with just a little help from a professional dress maker Nor have the soap operas and folksy morning kaffeeklatsches disappeared from the television screens Any weekday morning one can be regaled by such unlikely visions as Sam Yorty Mayor of Los Angeles and Presidential candidate grinning with pride and appetite above a casserole of his wifes tunaalaking as Dinah Shore asks Mrs Yorty You cook a lot for the Mayor Vaguely Defined Female Creature But new magazines from the frankly causeespousing to the silkensell have sprung up directed at a creature known as todays woman or the new woman And so have new daytimetelevision programs also directed more or less frankly at some yaguely defined female creature whose interests are now assumed to extend at least slightly beyond the preoccupations of domesticity Some women feel that this trend is no more than a shrewdand apparently successful as it is continuingattempt to cash in on a serious issue There are others who feel it demonstrates a new media awareness of women and an effort to communicate better with them Even the existing womens magazines show signs of change The March issue of The Ladies Home Journal features on its cover a jambalaya of goodiesSophia Loren in the unlikely role of great Italian cook lessons in makeup from over girl and a serialized novel as well as articles on decorating love children health and Henry Kissingers secretaries But there is also a blurb reading Labor Unions Unfair to Women This it turns out is the months article in a regular series called The Working Woman by Letty Cottin Pogrebin Among the other big slicks McCalls now has a monthly newsletter for women titled Right Now a potpourri of mostly traditional short service pieces and features with occasional bows in the direction of the liberated woman McCalls also selected Gloria Steinem as its Woman of the Year A ReadersDigestsized magazine called The Woman aimed at an audience for whom even McCalls or Redbook is too chic features the usual how tosetyourhair articles knit in the April issue adds to them a piece on how to set up your own small boutique a page on Women in the News and a condensed book Free To Be a Woman that is blurbed You dont have to be womens lib to know that somethings wrong with our lives None of this is coincidental The climate out there is changing said Diana Lurvey the editor of the 6yearold magazine And we are trying to change with it within the framework of our audience As an example Miss Lurvey recalled a recent article called Im Glad I Never Had a Child which she thought would be the most unpopular article weve ever run She asked for mail from the readers and got quite a bitnot always sympathetic but in the main understanding I just thought the readers were going to land on us with both feet and they did not At the other end of the spectrum probably is the most celebrated of the new womens magazines Ms sleeksophisticated and skillfully polemical appealing directly to an audience of the converted or at least the willing prospects The first spring issue of Ms touched all the feminist bases from abortion to lesbianism from the inequities of marriage to the malechauvinist quality of the English lnaguage The next issue whose contents are not being disclosed is due out at the end of May This June issue will be followed by monthly issues Subscriptions on the basis of the first issue have reached 30000 There are also a considerable number of feminist journals that make no effort to reach a mass audience such as Aphra and Off Our Backs Less militant is a magazine called Progressive Woman with a claimed 16000 subscribers PrOgressive Woman which put out its first issue in July 1971 is published in Middlebury Ind by Corson Publishing whose president Rosalie Corson is also the magazines editor Miss Corson who once edited an engineering magazine said in a telephone interview that PW was born because I felt there was a need for a magazine that didnt regard a woman first as a homemaker or first as a parent or first as a fashion plate It is not she said a cause magazine such as Ms but rather an attempt to broaden the perspective of women to make up for the fact that in areas other than those of tradition rolemodels are lacking Each month features just such rolemodels from politician Shirley Chisholm to in the March issue a marine biologist and an Illinois lawyerphysician Another new womens magazine boldly calls itself New Woman and proclaims itself as offering New Life Styles for the Thinking Woman Its first issue however seemed to be aimed somewhere below cerebrum It achieved a certain succes de scandale by virtue of a multipage fullcolor male striptease that some readers felt would do more to cut the birthrate than anything since The Pill The February Issue of New Woman with Ms Steinem on the cover offers liberatedwomans view of the major Presidential candidates a long lovingly illustrated interview with Lauren Deceit as a prototype new woman features on fashion and beauty for the new woman that bear a close resemblance to features on fashion etc for the old models and a number of liberationoriented features Another very recent entry is weekly called New York Woman which has the format of a tabloid newspaper It has departments on shopping the theater trends and a lot of space devoted to fashion Again there is a lacing of liberation  a frontpage story on Sex Equality The Secret Storm about the Equal Rights Amendment and pieces about and by Representative Bella Abzug But the emphasis is on chic ways to spend money Many of the new television shows for women show the

on the premise that women at home are intelligent and blight like to be entertained It is needed according to Nora Ephron the freelance writer who is the moderator because the condescension implicit

Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/17/archives/a-fetus-as-person.html,To the Editor The unspoken premise of Harold A Meriam Jrs letter of March 6 is that our original Federal Constitution of 1787 treated slaves as nonpersons On the contrary in no fewer than three clauses slaves were explicitly referred to as Personsthe Enumeration clause art I 12 cl 3 the Slave Trade clause art 1 19 cl 1 and the Fugitive Slave clause art IV 1 2 cl 3 The original Constitution did not treat all Persons as equalthat would not be commanded until the Fourteenth Amendment 1868but it did refer to all persons as persons What neither the original Constitution nor any amendment ever did was to call or treat a fetus as a person Although the Enumeration clause commands each decennial census to count the whole Number of Personsa command repeated in the Fourteenth Amendmentno censustaker from 1790 to 1970 has ever counted a fetus The reason is that at no stage has the Constitution ever treated a fetus as a person That the Corporation Counsel and the State Attorney General conceded that a human fetus is a human being does not imply that it is a human person An adult heart donor suffering from irreversible brain damage is also a living human being but he is no longer a human person That is why his life may be ended by the excision of his heart for the benefit of another the donee who still is a human person If there can be human beings who are nonpersons at one end of the life span why not also at the other end CYRIL C MEANS Jr Professor of Constitutional Law New York Law School New York March6 1972
"Priests’ Convention Backs Harrisburg, 7; Denies Membership to Married Clergy",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/17/archives/priests-convention-backs-harrisburg-7-denies-membership-to-married.html,DENVER March 16The National Federation of Priests Councils strongly backed the Harrisburg Seven defendants today and denied membership in the Roman Catholic organization to a married priests group The action ended a fourday convention that some delegates regarded as a retreat from the emphatic stance taken a year ago on the celibacy issue The Rev James Purcell an executive board member from San Francisco said that the celibacy resolution passed yesterday indicated that some guys for political reasons apparently compromised their principles and backed off from the moment of truth statement This document which the federation passed almost unanimously last year included an immediate call for optional celibacy Yesterdays resolution adopt ed 128 to 70 called for continuing efforts to change the celibacy law so that the clergy would include married men A Step Forward The Rev Frank J tionnike who was reelected today to a second twoyear term as president of the priests organization called the resolution a step forward because it dealt with what he described as practical steps based on last years statement He also said that celibacy was a focus of last years meeting while justice and peace was this years theme Nevertheless Father Bonnike termed the convention conciliatory in that the conservative members of the clergy were heard There was general agreement that the tone this year more accurately reflected the attitude of priests around the country The Harrisburg resolution asked member priests councils to solicit voluntary contributions to support the legal defense of the Rev Philip F Berrigan and six codefendants They are on trial in Harrisburg Pa on charges of conspiring to kidnap Henry A Kissinger President Nixons adviser on national security affairs to blow up heating tunnels to Federal buildings in Washington and to destroy records in several states Membership Denied The conference refused to consider a resolution that would have admitted to membership the Society of Priests for a Free Ministry most of whose members are married The conference did admit priests councils representing MexicanAmericans and blacks after changing its constitution to allow membership of other than diocesan and religious order councils The 200 delegates who represent 30000 clergymen more than half the Roman Catholic priests in the United States  also called for a task force to develop a model for Christian ministry to homosexuals and supported admission of women as permanent deacons a recently revived role for laymen Among other resolutions adopted by the federation were ones that did the following Called on the American bishops to address themselves at their April meeting to the immorality of the automated air war in Indochina Urged the President and Congress to grant an immediate amnesty to those who have left the country or had been imprisoned because of opposition to compulsory military service in the Indochina war Asked the Elks Moose Eagles and other clubs to change constitutions and statutes that have discriminatory provisions Opposed all legislation removing restrictions against abortion Favored abolition of the death penalty Supported freedom of residence for priests Provisions for implementing social aotion resolutions often were vague which the Rev Pat OMalley of Chicago attributed to complexity More Vital issues There were more important issues this year that they felt less able to deal with and therefore were more careful Father OMalley said Father Bonnike suggested that the delegates had benefited fromvarious workshops and would go home with more courage because they know they have the backing of other priests But some delegates questioned whether the words they had heard would be translated into action As one delegate put it no one argued with the substance of the various speeches but how can you argue against peace and justice
A Presidential Panel Supports Abortion on Request,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/17/archives/a-presidential-panel-supports-abortion-on-request-panel-supports.html,WASHINGTON March 16 A Presidential study commission formally recommended today that all states  following New Yorks example  greatly liberalize abortion laws and permit a doctor to perform an abortion at a patients request In the second of three final reports the Commission of Population Growth and the American Future also called for government to fund abortion services and urged that abortion costs be covered by health inisurance These recommendations  as well as a series of others in the report  are likely to trigger wide and heated public debate They put the commission clearly at odds with some conservatives and Roman Catholic and Jewish groups And they appear to put the commission members in conflict with the President who appointed them two years ago to study population growth problems Last April President Nixon ordered military hospitals toll abandon liberalized abortion policies Abortion he said is an unacceptable method of population control The commission however based Its recommendation entirely on other grounds than population control Reflecting a dominant general theme the report assailed prohibitions en abortion as obstacles to the exercise of individual freedom Women it said should be free to make their own moral choices to control their own fertility and to avoid the burdens of unwanted childbearing Whether this tack was sufficient to mollify the White House could not be gauged today The White House news office had no immediate comment on the report The report contained a series of other potentially controversial recommendations some of which also appear to conflict with present Administration policies These included the following Public and private forces should join together to make highquality day care available to all families who wish it This effort because it is innovative should be coupled with continuing research and evaluation The states should actively eccourage teenagers to receive contraceptive services Failing to recognize extensive sexual activity among unmarried young people can only mean failing to act against venereal disease dropping out of school and outofwedlock pregnancy Responsible sex education should be made widely available to all particularly young people  despite the opposi tion of some groups that go so far as to interpret sex education as a politically inspired plot Many hospitals whose policies now make voluntary sterilization difficult should relax those policies to make it easy But the commission sharply assailed the idea of giving financial rewards for sterilization The poor the report said would be especially vulnerable to such bonuses Stress on Freedom These and related recommendations were all grounded in the commissions basic belief that the nations prime population concern should not be the quantity of people but the quality of life with maximum personal freedom The objective for American society should be to make the childbearing decision as free as possible of unintended societal pressures the report said We should strive for the ideal of diversity in which it would be equally honorable to marry or not to be childless or not to have one child or two or for that matter more Our goal is one of less regimentation of reproductive behavior not more This was the moral argument offered by the commission on behalf of its abortion recommendations In addition it presented a series of practical arguments concluding We are impressed that the availability of abortion on request causes a reduction in the number of illegal abortions maternal and infant deaths and outofwedlock births thereby greatly improving the health of women and children Four of the 24 commissioners expressed varying degrees of dissent to the abortion recommendations but not to the whole report The four are the commissions Roman Catholics
Population Report Excerpts,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/17/archives/population-report-excerpts.html,Washington March 16Following are excerpts from the second report of the Federal Commission on Population Growth and the American Future made today to the President Congress and the public HUMAN REPRODUCTION Contemporary American couples are planning to have en average of between two and three children Given the fact of youthful marriage farfromperfect means of fertility control and varying motivation many of these couples will have children before they want them and a significant fraction will ultimately exceed the number they want Recent research has disclosed a substantial incidence of such unplanned pregnanties and unwanted births in the United States According to estimates developed in the 1970 National Fertility Study conducted by the Office of Population Research at Princeton University 44 percent of all births to currently married women during the five years between 1966 and 1970 were unplanned 15 percent were reported by the parents as having never been wanted In theory this incidence of unwanted births implies that 265 million births occurring in that fiveyear period would never have occurred had the complete availability of perfect fertility control permitted couples to realize their preferences And these estimates are all conservative Unwanted fertility is highest among those whose levels of education and income are lowest For example in 1970 women with no high school education reported that 31 per cent of their births in the preceding five years were unwanted at the time they were conceived the figure for women college graduates was 7 per cent Mainly because of differences in education and incomeand a general exclusion from the socioeconomic mainstreamunwanted fertility weighs most heavily on certain minority groups in our population For example if blacks could have the number of children they want and no more their fertility and that of the majority white population would be very similar Not all unwanted births become unwanted children Many perhaps most are eventually accepted and loved indistinguishably from earlier births that were deliberately planned But many are not and the costs to them to their siblings and parents and to society at large are considerable though not easy to measure We conclude that there are many costs associated with unwanted fertility not only financial but health social psychological and demographphic costs as well The commission believes that all Americans regardless of age marital status or income should be enabled to avoid unwanted births Major efforts should be made to enlarge and improve the opportunity for individuals to control their own fertility aiming towardthe development of a basic ethical principle that only wanted children are brought into the world ABORTION The Law Currently in over twothirds of the states abortion is a crime except to preserve the life of the mother 12 states have changed their abortion statutes consistent with the American Law Institute Model Penal Code provision on abortion which prohibits abortion except in cases where the mothers life or her mental or physical health is in danger or to prevent the birth of defective offspring or in cases of rape or incest In 1970 abortion laws In Alaska Hawaii and New York were liberalized by law and in the State of Washington by popular referendum Currently abortion is being reviewed in the courts in over half of the states At its 1972 meeting the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association approved a Uniform Abortion Act recommended by the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws stating that abortion may be performed by a duly licensed physician upon request The Moral Question In the development of western culture the tendency has been toward a greater protection of life At the same time there is a deep commitment in our moral tradition to individual freedom and social justice The commission believes that the various prohibitions against abortion throughout the United States stand as obstacles to the exercise of individual freedom the freedom of women to make difficult moral choices based on their personal values the freedom of women to control their own fertility and finally freedom from the burdens of unwantedchildbearing Restrictive statutes also violate social justice for when abortion is prohibited women resort to illegal abortions to prevent unwanted births Medically safe abortions have always been available to the wealthy to those who could afford the high costs of physicians and trips abroad but the poor woman has been forced to risk her life and health with folk remedies and disreputable practiyioners Public Health Abortion is not new it has been an alternative to unwanted birth for large numbers of American women estimates ranged from 200000 to 1200000 illegal abortions per year in the United States The commission regards the issue of illegal abortion with great concern and supports measures to bring this medical procedure from the backrooms to they hospitals and clinics of this country It is becoming increasingly clear that where abortion is available on request one result is a reduction in the number of illegal abortions A reduction in the number of illegal abortions has an important impact on maternal mortality Maternal mortality ratios Including the 12 deaths out of 278122 abortions performed under legal auspices in New York City dropped by twothirds the year after abortion became available on request For 1971 New York City experienced the lowest ratio of maternal deaths ever recorded Judging from the experience in other countries there is reason to suspect that the maternal death ratio will continue to decline What is the effect of abortion on illegitimacy The best information comes from New York where outofwedlock births have been on the rise since they were first recorded in 1954 Statistics for the first eight months of 1971 indicate that for the first time the rate is declining Moreover the New York City programs for unmarried pregnant girls have reported a sharp decline in the num ber of applicants thit year In summary we are impressed that the availability of abortion on request causes a reduction in the number of illegal abortions maternal and infant deaths and outofwedlock births thereby greatly improving the health of women and children RECOMMENDATIONS The majority of the commission believes that women should be free to determine their own fertility that the matter of abortion should be left to the conscience of the individual concerned in consultation with her physician and that states should be encouraged to enact affirmative statutes creating a clear and positive framework for practice of abortion on request Therefore with the admonition that abortion not be considered a primary means of fertility control the commission recommends that present state laws restricting abortion be liberalized along the lines of the New York State statute such abortions to be performed on request by duly licensed physicians under conditions of medical safety In carrying out this policy the commission recommends That Federal state and local governments make fundsavailableto support abortion services in states with liberalized statutes That abortion be specifically included in comprehensive health insurance benefits both public and private Services for Teenagers As a society we have been reluctant to acknowledge that there is a considerable amount of sexual activity among unmarried young people The national study [a public opinion survey made for the commission] which disclosed that 27 per cent of unmarried girls 15 to ID years old had had sexual relations further revealed that girls have a considerable acquaintance with contraceptive methods over 95 per cent of all girls 15 to 19 for example know about the pill Contraceptive practice however contrasts sharply with this picture Although many young women who have had intercourse have used a contraceptive at some time this age group is characterized by a great deal of chance taking The majority of these young women have either never used or at best have sometimes used birth control methods We deplore the various consequences of teenage pregnancy including the recent report from New York that teenagers account for about onequarter of the abortions performed under their new statute during its first year Adolescent pregnancy offers a generally bleak picture of serious physical psychological and social implications for the teenager and the child Once a teenager becomes pregnant her chances of enjoying a rewarding satisfying life are diminished Pregnancy is the number one cause of school dropout among females in the United States The psychological effects of adolescent pregnancy are indicated by a recent study that estimated that teenage mothers have a suicide attempt rate 10 times that of the general population The commission is not addressing the moral questions involved in teenage sexual behavior However we are concerned with the complex issue of teenage pregnancy Therefore the commission believes that young people must be given access to contraceptive information and services Toward the goal of reducing unwanted pregnancies and childbearing among the young the commission rec ommends that birth control information and services be made available to teenagers in appropriate facilities sen sitive to their needs concerns SEPARATE STATEMENTS By Marilyn Brandt Chandler The commission report does stress that abortion should not be a substitute for birth control but has not intimated that liberal abortion takes the responsibility away from sexual activity Impulsive irresponsible sexual involvement can be rationalized without fear of pregnancy if abortion is open legal and free By Paul B Cornley MD The Law The argumentative posture of these paragraphs [of the commission report] is exclusively that of the proaborthanists namely that abortion legislation has been no more than a health measure postulated on the welfare of the mother only This section of the report does not even make an attempt to provide a legal accounting for the unborn developing child The Moral Question This section of the report proposes that only one moral principle be the controlling factor in the abortion situation the womans freedom to reproduce Such moralistic monism simplistic as it is at bottom fails to consider the freedom of the unborn child live By RepJohn N Erlenborn Since this is a population commission and not a birth control commission what compelling consideration leads the commission to make this very controversial [abortion] recommendation when it has littleor no population or demographicconsequence
Three's a Crowd,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/17/archives/threes-a-crowd.html,The second part of the report of the Presidents Commission on Population Growth issued yesterday is model of courage candor and clarity The commission has tackled head on such sensitive issues as sex education genetic research abortion and the dissemination contraceptive information and services In every case it has taken a forceful stand for open discussion and freedom of individual choice Sharply dissenting opinions appended to the 64page document offer a foretaste of the public controversy the commissions recommendations are bound to provoke But the thoroughness of its arguments developed through two years of study should promote intelligent public policy in an area too long dominated by emotions and unexamined tradition The commissions proposals for more and better education in matters pertaining to sex and for greater freedom of individual choice in decisions affecting childbearing are a logical sequel to the first part of its report issued last week Although less forthright that initial statement clearly pointed toward the desirabilityif not the necessityfor moving toward a policy of zero population growth for the United States Part one carefully examined the consequences for the quality of AmeriCan life in the year 2000 of having a predominance of twochild families as against threechild families It made plain that a threechild choice by American couples would produce a crowded America with harmful effects in economics social life government and the environment The commissions report soon to be completed with a third release deserves thoughtful note by every Americanespecially by the young whose individual decisions on family size will vitally affect the future wellbeing of themselves their children and the nation
Science;Math Models:;Wise Up! That Computer Is Just a Giant Moron,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/19/archives/science-math-models-wise-up-that-computer-is-just-a-giant-moron.html,The average layman Is awed by the computer and its accomplishments But as these machines are increasingly used to analyze and forecast major social and economic issues there is a danger that he may fail to understand that they are merely giant moron  calculating machines that simply add and subtract very rapidly The hot that a policy has been decided upon with the help of computers doesnt make it necessarily correct merely harder for the ordinary citizen to judge The importance of computer stud les or simulations has been pointed up by the controversy attending the book The Limits of Growth written by a group of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute Technology This classics example of a computer simulation argues that the world faces disaster in the decades ahead unless both population growth and economic growth are checked in the near future Experts have both attacked and defended this study For the layman to reach an independent judgment in this and other such cases he needs to know what computer simulations are how they are prepared and the virtoes and faults of the technique The essence of a computer simulation is its mathematical model Such a model is simply asset of mathematical equations In The Limits of Growth model for example there were five bask equations for populatlon capital supply food supply supply of nonrenewable mineral resources and pollution How does one arrive at an equaLion that represents for example futore population changes The equation must take into account present birth rates and death rates and also the forces that might change them such as the increasing use of contracaption and abortion the decline in infant mortality the increase of longevity as a result of improved medical care the effect on longevity of increased levels of pollution The accuracy of both the final equation for population and thus of the entire study depends not only upon the selection of the proper variables but also upon the numerical values associated with them Thus in the case of The Limits of Growth it makes a difference whether one assumes average longevity will remain little changed or that heart disease cancer and stroke will all become curable diseases soon so that the average expectation of life will rapidly rise to 100 years or perhaps more When the equations have been accepted the mathematical model in effect has been completed and all that remains to be done is to put it into the computer to solve for the unknowns The end result is the forecast of population food supply pollution etc In The Limits of Growth the desired forecasts covered many years into the future This required that the model take into account the feedback of the different elements ie that the increased pollution in one year would affect the population hi the next year or that the increase of production year after year would cumulatively increase pollution in subsequent years Sometimes mathematical models are used to decide between alternative policies For example should a particular amount of money be used to cut pollution or to reduce the birth rate In each case the same basic equations are used but with different numerical values inserted where appropriate These computer simulations make possible imaginary experiments with societal development experiments that can never be carried out in the real world Do computer simulations pay off Sometimes they do sometimes not They certainly give correct predictions often enough so that their use is increasing and the demand for systems analysts  who do such work is still brisk But sometimes mathematical models fail The most highly publicized recent example took place last year It involved a model of the American economy prepared for the Nixon Administration by economists of the Office of Management and Budget The model supported the optimistic forecasts for economic growth in 1971 issued by the Administration at the beginning of last year The forecasts turned out to be wrong of course and the model was discredited  which was no surprise to many economists who had critic cited it originally as being too simple it only involved four equations and using inappropriate data What happens to models that have failed Apparently they simply fade away At any rate the models chief author Government economist Dr Arthur B Leffer said recently he hadnt even looked at the model for the last several months HARRY SCHWARTZ
Religion,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/19/archives/barriers-to-the-liberal-trends-priests.html,For many American Catholic priests there surely was something unreal to the messages emanating last week from Denver where the annual meetlug of the National Federation of Priests Councils focused on the theme justice and peace The federation is an independent organization of 127 clergy groups representing 30000 priests more than half the Catholic clergy in the United States The messages admonished priests to hold fast against any pullback from social action any retrenchment of commitment any tailoring of personal involvement either within the community of believers or the larger secular society The meeting adopted resolutions that among other things urged an end to discrimination in clubs favored abolition of the death penalty called on the American bishops to address themselves at their April meeting to the immorality of the automated air war in Indochina and urged amnesty for military dissenters who have fled the country or been imprisoned As the federations East Coast Representative for Justice and Peace the Rev Robert P Kennedy of Brooklyn explained What is developing is not a demand for new expertise but for new and expanded concern Priests on the firing line particularly those in parish life must have wondered Demanded by whom There is a large school of thought that the demands will not come from many of the people left in the pews In this view give them their way and there will be a lot lessnot expandedconcern That is the experience of not a few American priests and it is a situation which crystallizes a new reality of American Catholicism In parish after parish many observers of the Catholic scene contend one can find almost the precise reverse of 10 and more yearsago when the clergy was predominantly conservative and the laity mixedbut including a strong liberal element Today there is not a radicalized clergy to be sure but a clergy which shows new signs of being committed and involved and a laity whose ideological cast seems to become more and more conservative as many liberals in search of a more revolutionary theology than official Catholicism has to offer evolve out of the church and moderates with neither the will nor the patience for ecclesiastical infighting take to islands of detachment It a situation readymade for wellorganized factions with staying power andwhile there is no hard sociological data to document the trend the conservatives who frequently are minority in terms of the total parish picture seem not to have let their opportunity pass Discussions at the Denver meeting indicated that the development has left priests in an extremely difficult position How does the conscientious priest witness and involve himself as the theoreticians urge and at the same time survive emotionally and financially with a conservative laity which through parish councils and the pocketbook has a leverage that the American laity has not known since the controversies of the last century when lay people commonly acted as trustees of the parish The question points up a major paradox of the postVatican Council II church The parish priest is freer within his prescribed role as Vatican II intended he should be but he is also less free because the ideological evolution of the laity and the democratization processes instituted by Vatican II creation of the parish councilshave passed the machinery of numerous parishes into the hands of conservatives a result not intended at least not exactly The conservative laity is not impressed when the parish priest talks about Attica Prison problems from the pulpit or in the parish schools religion class Nor is it particularly edified when the parish priest witnesses for peace by getting himself arrested for violating some legal statute In the new conservatism at least as the  erals see it Fathers duties are to preside over the liturgy to preach piously to help save the parochial school to fight abortion and leave the rest of the world to the world Against conservative lay criticism the parish priest can steel hithself But what happens when the laity hold back their church donations or sum port only those parish expennesqthey find ideologically congenial The nancial situation of most Catholic parishes is so precarious that selective givinggiving that discounts rectory expenses for example or some portion of clerical salariescould speedily wreck the parish economically At what point does the priest decide that persistence in his particular witness is not worth it to himself off not fair to the parish as a whole units have answered that question by narrowing social commitments arid surrendering to pragmatics and this may be what prompted one Denver speaker the Rev Eugene a Boyle tit San Francisco to flail at what seems a tacit agreement that the limit of advance has been reached and now is the time to retrench But many parish priests would hotly dispute thee retrenchment is that pronounced or more relevantly that the trend will be arrested by neglecting to take into consideration the special new circurnstances under which priests must function JOHN DEEDY Mr Seedy is managing editor of Commonweal magazine
MUSKIE TO STRESS STANDS ON ISSUES IN NEW PRIMARIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/19/archives/muskie-to-stress-stands-on-issues-in-new-primaries-senator-changing.html,PEORIA Ill March 18Senator Edmund S Muskie heads into the second round of Presidential primarieshere in Illinois on Tuesday and in Wisconsin on April 4determined to avoid the mistakes of the first round The Maine Democrat who finished a feeble fourth in the Florida primary last Tuesday said in an interview yesterday that the results there had convinced him that we must present ourselves more clearly more toughly more crisply on the issues Unpublicized Record Mr Muskie told of meeting with two prominent black politicians DeLores Tucker of Pennsylvania and Leroy Johnson of Georgia during his whistlestop train trip in Florida They told him he had a marvelous record the Senator recalled and then asked But why isnt it getting out The Senators views came four days before the Illinois primary in which he is pitted against former Senator Eugene J McCarthy of Minnesota for the Democratic nomination for President The voters will also elect 160 delegates to the Democratic National Convention Coming Primaries Illinois Tuesday Wisconsin April 4 Massachusetts April 25 Pennsylvania April 25 Meanwhile the latest Gallup Poll based on questioning just before the New Hampshire primary showed that Senator Hubert H Humphrey of Minnesota had taken a clearcut lead over Mr Muskie as the Democrats choice Mr Humphrey led by 35 per cent to 28 per cent where as a month ago Mr Muskie had 35 per cent to Mr Humphreys 32 per cent Relaxing in his hotel suite here after stumping across central Illinois Mr Muskie said he ascribed his difficulties to several factors some of which were within his control and some not He needs more time than he had had in Florida to put across his ideas Mr Muskie said That problem was compounded by vague and subliminal television commercials and by failure to use radio spots effectively he added But beyond that he said he probably should have picked out two or three or four issues and stated his position on them clearly and repetitively rather than trying to discuis many issues and relate them to general themes Richard Pettigrew speaker of the Florida House of Representatives who was a key Muskie supporter made the same point in explaining the day before the primary why he expected the Senator to fare poorly And electionday interviews conducted for The New York Times by Daniel Yankelovich Inc showed that few Florida voters identified Mr Muskie with any issue The new Muskie as some of his staff members began calling him this week was on view Thursday at a rally in Knights of Columbus hall in East Chicago Ind a grimy industrial town in Lake County His voice was louder harsher almost rasping his eyes looked intense and angry his wattles shook as he jerked his head for emphasis The pedagogical style was gone There was fire in his words too He lambasted Gov George C Wallace of Alabama as an apostle of privilege and said I hate what George Wallace stands for Then he took a swipe at Senators Humphrey and Henry M Jackson of Washington who beat him in Florida he thinks because they did not stand up to Mr Wallace There were those who waffled during the Florida campaign Mr Muskie said competing with Wallace for a grip on the hard line resting on the memory of their courage in another easier time But he named no names and he intends to name none even though some of his opponents have regularly needled him He said in the interview that the target is winning in November  its not a backyard fight among Democrats By adopting that stance Senator Muskie hopes to establish himself as the sane trustworthy alternative to President Nixon A generalized image most analysts believe is valuable in general elections But to get to the general election in November Mr Muskie must win some primaries and in large primary fields voters tend to opt for the candidate who has focused on the issues they are focused on rather than the man like Mr Muskie whom they approve of in general The result was demonstrated in The TimesYankelovich survey Mr Muskie was the second choice of a large number of those interviewed but got few firstplace votes The Senators new aggressiveness did not last long this week By the time he reached Northern Illinois University late Thursday and the University of Illinois yesterday he was back to a lowkey presentation giving rambling avuncular answers to questions At Northern Illinois he responded to only five questions in 26 minutes Nor did he adopt more liberal stances on such issues as amnesty for war deserters and marijuana and abortion The kids were disappointed one of his young staff men said afterward and so was I But how can he come out hard on that stuff One word and there goes our labor support in Wisconsin and other people we cant afford to lose The comment suggests the limitations on Mr Muskies effort to project a more liberal tone He is in fact the candidate of the partys establish ment not an insurgent like Mayor Lindsay or Senator George McGovern of South Dakota A man who appeared with him at East Chicago was a symbol of that He was Robert Pastrick the citys mayor a product of a political machine with an unsavory reputation Mr McCarthy who is facing Mr Muskie headtohead in the balloting here Tuesday tries to dramatize Mr Muskies links to the past in his newspaper ads One of them says Hubert Humphrey George McGovern John Lindsay Henry Jackson Shirley Chisholm Sam Yorty Wilbur Mills Vance Hartke George Wallace and Richard Nixon will not be in the Illinois preference primary Only two candidates will be on the ballot Gene McCarthy and Edmund Muskie We can stay with the old politics and vote for Ed Muskie Or we can take a step forward Mr Muskie remains confident He said that he and his entire staff were relieved to be liberated from carrying a load we couldnt carrythe expectation of victory everywhere He said he saw no sign among party leaders of a growing conviction that Mr Humphrey could win in November Now Working Harder John Reilly one of his advisers said that some of those who had endorsed Mr Muskie but had just lumplumped along doing nothing were now ready to work hardenpresumably because they now see their prestige at stake But strong showings here and in Wisconsin have become imperative in the judgment of the Muskie staff There are still money problems as illustrated by the decision to put the entire national staff off the payroll until after Wisconsin And it may be necessary one adviser said to bypass some primaries He mentioned Tennessee on May 4 and Maryland on May 16 as two that Mr Muskie might write off even though his name is automatically on the ballot in both But the Senator is still unwilling to go back on commitments to enter others despite the time pressure For example he will run in Indiana on May 2 with its perils of a strong Wallace showing because he committed himself weeks ago to Senator Birch Bayh who endorsed him this week

handsome and still livable cities only Copenhagen whose fame has recently spread for being equally hospitable and almost as freewheeling can contest Amsterdams title to being the youth capital of the western world If Amsterdammers have learned to be tolerant of young tourists ways thisis largely due to the fact that their own youth have been persistent occasionally flamboyant and generally skillful tutors From 1965 until 1967 the provocative Provos a political party of young radicals repeatedly challenged the rather smug stiffness of established Amsterdam burgherdam coming up with proposals which combined shock tactics with varying amounts of uncommon sense Thus for example to eliminate the congestion of automobile traffic which plagues the narrow streets of the old city centrum the Provos recommended that all cars be banned and that 20000 white bicycles be placed at the publics takeituseitleaveit disposal Lacking New Amsterdams gentle hills Old Amsterdam is as flat as a pannelzoeh and accordingly easy to cycle around although the dense stream Qf still unbanned cars may make the going a bit hazardous for the tyro The tourist who wants to try his luckcan rent a hike or fiets at the Central Station for a nominal free Advice and Contraceptives To combat overpopulation in one of the worlds most densely populated countries the Provos further proposed that health centers be set up to dispense advice and contraceptives To deal with the policemans regrettable tendency to get tough with Provos who protested the war in Vietnam they suggested that the Dutch police be disarmed and transformed into social workers who in their spare time could distribute medicine and more contraceptives Within little more than a year the Provos surrealistically serious platform won them the support of 13000 voters and in 1966 the party was granted one of the 45 seats on the AniSterdam City Council More recently the Kabouters or Dwarfs a political party which took over where the Provos left off and which likewise speaks for the young won five seats on the Council On one occasion twodroll Dwarfs were temporarily expelled for smoking hashish while the Council was in session Their act had a typically youthful pedagogical aim to protest the hypocrisy as the Dwarfs see it of laws which make the possession and use of grass and hash a crime while they permit the possession and use of liquor cigarettes and all sorts of other drugs A Copious Supply The fact that owning or smoking marijuana andor hashish is indeed officially a punishable offense in the Netherlands may come as a surprise not only to readers of numerous magazine articles bearing the hip Amsterdam dateline but to many young Americans just back from that city as well The supply was so copious the atmosphere so relaxed the police so totally unconcerned about whether one smoked a thin or a thick cigarettecould it really be illegal A polyglot leaflet entitled Welkomwhich was got up and handed out on the streets by members of the Dutch Work Group Youth Tourism and which carried a gentle cautionarygreeting to all young tourists from Amsterdams Burgomaster Dr No Samkaldenineluded a blunt note about drugs among its compendium of helpful hints and tips to the tourist Here typographical warts and all is what Welkom had to say on the subject in English Drugs the use and possession of hard or soft drugs is forbidden and therefore illegal in the Netherlands as in most other countries If for example hashish is found on you you will have to appear before the judge if you are a Dutch subject Aliens are ordered out of the country If large quantities of drugs are found on you you supposedly become a dealer and you run the risk of being arrested nationality whatsoever On the other hand Welkom also lists among other swinging places the young tourist wont want to miss the Paradiso a citysubsidized club which boasts a huge dance floor the building was formerly a church light shows yoga sessions films and within which smoking grass and hash is legal If the existence of a couple of such clubs in Amsterdam Studio Seven is another strikes many Dwarfs and also a number of politically unaffiliated young Amsterdammers in general as a sop grudgingly granted them by their slowlearning elders the free atmosphere found within these clubs often blows the minds of young tourists from uptight America One 21yearold studenta psychology major at Harper College in Binghamton N Y recently said that one of the nicest things about the Paradiso is that girls and guys just walk out on the dance floor and start dancing all by themselves and theyre happy that way and its all right with them too if somebody else wants to dance with them I mean its just relaxed And the hifi speakers they got there are beautiful Another young man contented himself with saying In about the year 2001 we may have something like this in Des Moines but I doubt it A 20yearold girla dropout from Boston Universityviewed the Paradiso from a different angle Its great she said except during the summer its so full of Americans and I didnt come all the way Ever here just to get to know more Americans And to add one minority complaint also from a young woman I found it drag  everybody sitting around and getting stoned I got to know more people and had a much jollier time going around the Heineken Brewery with a mixed bunch of sightseers At the end of the tour you all sit down around a table and they serve you beer and cheese and crackers and at least everybody talks Tours of the sundry Amsterdambased breweries and distilleries can indeed be both instructive and jolly They are also free Getting into clubs like the Paradise is only next to free membership dues come to 28 cents admission is about 54 cents The Mod Minnies While the Provos and the Dwarfs have won official tolerance for some of the tribal customs of the rockdrug sector other Amsterdam groups have been continuously at work trying to enlarge their own specific domains of personal libertyand in the process have educated the populace on the issues involved and accustomed them to some rather exotic behavior Not long ago members of a Dutch Womens Lib group known as Dolle Minas or Mod Minnies burst into a gynecologists convention with slogans painted on their bared stomachs BAAS IN EIGEN BULK or Boss in our own bellies a pun on the proverb that each man is the boss in his own house and a plea for liberal abortion Taws Recently after a campaign which included tying pink ribbons on the menonly urinals which have long adorned the streets of Amsterdam the Mad Minnies succeeded In shaming the city into putting up toilets for women too Homosexuality is tolerated in the Netherlands ie homosexual acts between consenting adults are legal and Amsterdam has a number of gay membersonly bars and clubs The largest of theserun by an Amsterdambased organization which led the fight for state recognition of the rights of homosexualshas a bar and dance floor where male couples can dance together without fretting about what heterosexuals may think As one American homosexuat observed In Amsterdam as in London one feels included in society and human again The atmosphere here is relaxed Its shame really that the Pilgrim Fathers didnt stay here a few centuries before boarding the Mayflower Commenting on an unuptight atmosphere which the youth of Amsterdam has done a good deal to create sustain and expand one young American said that the scene had come together in his head for him when he attended a free at fresco concert along with hundreds of others young and old Dutch and foreign What got me he said was that the old and the young got along so well together and the fact that so many older people turned out to hear acidrock in the first place And then it started to rain and they had trouble with the electrical system No hassle Nobody started tearing the place apart A few people left and the rest of us stayed but the point is there Just wasnt any hassle People still know how to get along with each other over here I guess The city fathers for their part swung with the summer scene with considerable dexterity Though The Damthe big midtcwn square where hundreds of young tourists bedded down until they were expelled in the summer of 1970was still offlimits for sleepers the city opened up the far more spacious and comfortable Vondel Park as a free openair dormitory The kids call it Fondle Park This year Amsterdam authorities will try to reroute many of the youngsters into student hotels charging 70 cents to a dollar a night and into the old RAI Congress Building a former exhibition center that has been converted into a mammoth free youth dormitoryt is situated near the Heineken Brewery not far from the Japanese Okura Hotel which along with the towering Alpha the tall est hotel in Holland is among the citys newest hostelries Worlds Fair of Flowers The burghers are particularly anxious to show off the Amsterdam parks to their best advantage in the months ahead since the city will host a Floriade the first worlds fair of horticulture from March 30 to Oct 1 The exhibition of flowers and plants will cover a 200acre site near the new RAI Convention Center on the citys outskirts Amsterdam officials feel that they are filling a role rather like that of surrogate parents to the young tourists and point out that almost all of the 260 persons arrested on drug charges in the period extending from January to July were charged with selling or possessing large amounts of narcotics while the possessors of a modest supply were not bothered One young American justifiably confused as to just where the limits of tolerance ended and the brawn of the law began said that Dutch friends had counseled him not to be snowed by the tolerancelike dont offer a joint to a policeman because it still pays to be discreet Just how Tong Amsterdam will continue to rank with Copenhagen as the youth capital of the Western world anybodys guess The fact that it not only on the direct flightline to Europe but also a great city in its own right is likely to keep it well stocked with over30 tourists for some time to come Last summer some 200000 Americans visited Amsterdam while an estimated 2 million tourists of all nationalities visited the city in the course of the year It would be a pity though if those who still flock to it in the future see as little of the unique citysights as did many of the young Americans spoke with The Rijksmuseum Yes theyd been there but had found it too crowded for their taste and hadnt stayed long The Stedelijk or City Museum Yes theyd dug that a lot because it had more modern exhibits and hadnt been so jammed up Also its sculpture gardenwhich one does not need to pay to enterwas a neat place to eat bread and cheese for lunch Rembrandts House A good portion of Amsterdams soul is as it should be concealed from the tourist who cant be bothered to turn off the main streeteven the reward is a swift switch from 20th century bustle to the serenity of the distant past The Kalverstraat for instance is one of the busiest and most people thronged streets in all Amsterdam yet just off to one side of it the worlds least conspicuous passageway opens out into a marvelously quiet courtyard known as the Begjinhof Here around a small central green 15thto 17thcentury houses stand shoulder to shoulder No two are alike and each has a typically individual tilt Dressed up with flowerboxes and an assortment of gables they serve us almshouses for old ladies To one side of this sequestered square rises the English Reformed Church where the Pilgrims worshiped when they came to Amsterdam in 1609 before setting out for America Also just off the Kalverstraat behind an archway dated 1581 the alert tourist will find a sprawling complex of buildings that grew out of a cloister founded in 1414 later became the municipal orphanage and in 1969 after a decade of restoration became the new home of the Amsterdam Historical Museum The restored cloister farmhouse is now a restaurant called In The Goliath which boasts a 16foottall statue of the giant and a smaller one of his slayer Davidboth survivors of a 17thcentury pleasure garden which Rembrandt occasionally visited Yet before the tourist sets off to discover the citys hidden soul he would be well advised to first get his bearings Where is this Kalverstraat How do I get there Wheres that passageway nobodys ever supposed to notice And the best way to get ones bearings is smack in the middle of thingsat the Amsterdam Tourist Office at Rokin 5 steps away from The Dam around which stand the Hotel Krasnapolsky the Bijenkorf Amsterdams Macys the Royal Palace and the New Church At this efficient tourist office one can obtain answers to all sorts of cityrelated questions pick up maps a must in this city which expanded in semicircles and also copy of This Week In Amsterdam which lists galleries museums restaurants films operas ballets and sporting and other events The next prudent step is to pick one of two pleasant ways of getting the feel of the city as a whole One way is by striding off to the 17th century Westerkerk then mounting the churchtower stairs for a breathtaking view of rooftops gable tops canals the harborthe works There are other good reasons for visiting this church the interior is radiantly beautiful Rembrandt is burled there and the Anne Frank house is just around the corner The other more restful way of taking in the whole is by sitting down for a belowseaandstreetlevel ride in a glassroofed sightseeing boat Most of these rondvaart boats dock and leave from the Damrak just across from the Central Station others tie up at the juncture of the Spui and the Rokin As these craft wind their way through the citys canals and slip under a score or so of its 365 bridges multilingual guides point out the sights Recommended for romantics the nocturnal rondvaarts devised by the Bergman Tour company for those who enjoy sipping wine and nibbling cheese at candlelit tables while watching the illuminated houses of Amsterdams Golden Age sleep by at night Hidden Gems Now presumably with map in hand and some clues in mind the tourist should be able to find his or her way to such enclaves of the past as those just off the Kalverstraatand from there to other hidden gems Our Lord in the Attic at 40 Oudezijds Voorburgwal is one such gemIt was built in 1663a time when the Catholic minority Roman Catholics now constitute roughly 40 per cent of the nations population was free to worship as it saw fit but forbidden to build recognizably Catholic churches out in the open Downstairs one enters the house of a wealthy 17thcentury merchant up in the attic one finds a balconied church and an altar which could be rolled out on wheels from behind a false door Only a short stroll from Our Lord in the Atticone of Amsterdams 30 socalled schuilkerken or concealed churchesis the Old Church begun in the early 14th century where the tombstone of Rembrandts wife Saskia was recently discovered At this point the tourist in search of the citys hidden soul will discover that in Surprising Amsterdam he is literally surrounded by unconcealed flesh The Old Church towers up in  the midst of the redlight district Prostitution is legal in Amsterdam but since all forms of active soliciting are prohibited the women can only patiently display themselves from behind the picture windows of their small streetfront shops Mournful in terms of human lives the streets of the Walleties as this district is known are among the citys oldest and rank among its loveliest Crossing two bridges leading eastwardfirst across the Oudezijds Voorburgwal then across the Oudezijds Achterburgwalthe explorer will presently come to the Nieuwe Markt the marketplace presided over by the towers of the Weighing House Here among booths where flowers fruits and vegetables are sold the foreigner may still Vet a sniff and feel of the village life which continues to pulse within this city of 860000 souls Second Jerusalem If the traveler takes time to step into the Weighing Houses Jewish Museum he may subsequently want to explore what remains of the citys once so vital Jewish presence and soul Only fragments remain Before World War II some 140000 Jews lived in Amsterdama city their forefathers had gratefully nicknamed the Second Jerusalem During the war 110000 were deported of whom all but 5000 were killed Roughly 8000 survived by hiding out elsewhere in the Netherlands Furthermore during the cold hunger winter of 194445 many of their empty houses were ransacked for firewood by fuelless and starving Amsterdammers Even now many sections of the old Jewish district which formerly extended south of the Nieuwe Markt along Jodenbreestraat Jews Broad Street and on to the environs of Waterlooplain look derelict The region where the first of Amsterdams Jewsmainly Portuguese and Spanish Sephardimsettled in the 1590s this is also the region in which the successful 33year old Rembrandt chose to settle down when he bought a mansion in 1639 Rembrandt sketched etched and painted portraits of his neighbors The Jewish Bride for example was presumably inspired by a wedding at the Portuguese Synagogue just behind Waterlooplein This plein or square was formerly thesite of the old Jewish market Now it is a flea market during weekdays with antique stalls on Saturdays Set up daily against a backdrop of synagogues the stalls and the mainly Dutch crowds they attract retain much soul which the average unhip tourist seldom stops by to savor Another revealing route which can be taken from the Nieuwe Markt is along the Kloveniersburgwal Which starts at the southern end of the mar ketplace and ends where it joins up with the dammed up at The Dam river after which the city was named the Amstel Shortly before canal meets river one comes to a long covered passagewaylined with secondhand bookshops and stalls which opens out onto rows of beautiful Golden Age houses clustered at the juncture of three tranquil canals As for the connecting passageway itself with its sculpted entrance known as the Oudemanhuispoort or Old Mens Almshouse Portal this leads nowadays into one of the widely Scattered parts of Amsterdam University Summer tourists walking through this shadowy corridor devoid of its student population can hardly be expected to guess they are anywhere near a university much less appreciate the part it plays in keeping Amsterdams modern soul up to date Amsterdam University students were early and vehement critics of the United States role in the Vietnam war and of the Netherlands tacit support of US policy In 1967 convinced that knowledge of developments in China was crucial and that traditional educational media were grossly inadequate to the task they invited both conservative and radical China experts to join them and letting the curriculum slide staged a heady weeklong China teachin There are an estimated 100 Americans enrolled in Dutch universities and students have staged protests time and time again for more inspraak or more involvement in decisions affecting tint varsity affairs The colony of American expatriates in Amsterdam has grown considerably in recent years and these together with businessmen and members of the diplomatic corps are currently said to number about 6000 By now whether the tourist is still haggling over the price of a pair of brass candlesticks at Waterlooplein or serenely gazing at the 17thcentury House on the Three Canals he may be more in need of spirits than soul Yet here again some of the pleasanter spots are apt to be just around the corner rather than out in the open One such allbuthidden pub is Wynand Fockinks 17thcentury tasting pub on the Pijlsteeg a little alley behind the Krasnapolsky Hotel on The Dam Here from 10 AM to 8 PM one can taste all sorts of Dutch gins and liqueurs and blends of liqueurs in a simple charming room along one side of which extends a wooden counter Tulipshaped glasses are filled to the brim and the custom is to fold ones hands behind ones back bow from the waist toward the counter then sip up enough so the taster can pick up his glass without spilling Another old tasting pub is the Drie Flesjes Three Bottles at Gravenstraat 16 just behind the New Church A third the Bols Taverne is across the street from the Bois distillery on the Rosengracht All three of these pubs may be a bit touristy yet with a slight difference These are not pubs which most tourists find on their own they are usually brought in by an Amsterdam friend who can serve as a knowing guide For local atmosphere the best pubs are those in the Jordaan a workingclass quarter whosename is a corruption of the French jardin A typical Jordaan bar is de Prins on the Prinsengracht across from the Westerkerk and the Anne Frank House After downing a cocktail or two the tourist on the lookout for a good restaurant will find that Amsterdam has an abundance of them To mention only a few which the visitor might otherwise overlook there are first of all a couple of good ones in the redlight district Though occasionally boisterous  especially along the Zeedijk where strip joints and sailors bars abound this region is safe to walk through both by day and at night Bodega Big Ben next to Our Lord in the Attic at Oudezijds Voorburgwal 42 has a good bar and offers steaks shish kebab and the Indonesian specialty sad pork on a stick in spicy sauce At the corner of the Zeedijk and the Oudezijds Kolk another good restaurant Du Chat Qul Pelote offers diners one of the closest views which short of diving right in for a look they are likely to get of Amsterdams canals The ground floor is practically flush with the water level and the tables by the restaurants french doors offer a ringside seat for canal traffic and the night life on the streets above Restaurant Region The blocklong mixed ChineseandIndonesian restaurant region on the Binnen Bantammerstraat is another reli warding section few foreigners find their way to on their own East of the Nieuwe Markt this bantam thoroughfare is lined with restaurants some of which like the aboveaverage Lotus at No 5 specialize in dishing up a delicious Peking cuisine Variety spices Amsterdams life in many ways If the variety of its cuisine stretches from traditional herring smoked eel North Sea shrimp Zealand mussels pea soup and pannekoeken to the elaborate luxury of a 34dish Indonesian rijsttafel rice table so too the variety of its museums stretches to include everything from ships museums a museum devoted to the history of gin to the great Rijksmuseum In fact Surprising Amsterdam has more museums43than cinemas38 And if it welcomes the young with unusual understanding and tolerance it also stands ready to provide visitors of all ages with splendid sightsboth hidden and right out in the openand revealing insights into its uniquely sprightly sOul

‘To Bear or Beget’,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/25/archives/to-bear-or-beget.html,The Supreme Court has given a timely boost to recent controversial but constructive proposals of the Presidents Commission on Population Growth The Court ruled this week that a state cannot outlaw the distribution of contraceptives to single persons when birth control devices are legally available to married couples This advances by one small yet significant step the commissions recommendation for the elimination of existing legal inhibitions and restrictions on access to contraceptive information procedures and supplies Although the ruling is directly applicable in a limited sphere and to only two statesMassachusetts and Wisconsinthe reasoning on which it is based appears apply to other areas of contraceptive control and may even influence pending abortion cases The Population Commission has argued in defense of its recommendations that individuals should be free to make their own decisions regarding parenthood Justice William J Brennan the only Roman Catholic on the Court and author of its opinion gave strong constitutional sanction to this argument when he wrote If the right of privacy means anything it is the right of the individual married or single to be free from unwarranted intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child
Bess Is Their Woman Now,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/26/archives/bess-is-their-woman-now.html,ITS rather late on a recent chill winter night Bess Myerson somehow resembling a giant Barbie doll shes 5 feet 10 inches tall bounces a small red ball as therapy for a hand injury against the bare par quet floor in her new and largely unfurnished Upper East Side flat and endures yet another interview in this case about her television show Fortyeight and freshly divorced she dislikes the per sonal interview Why are people curious about my sex life She has thus far had three incarnations as a cul ture hero beauty queen TV personality consumer advo cate And shes bored by recurrent queries Shes also too busy to answer them For besides holding down a full time job as New York Citys consumer affairs com missioner Bess Myerson has returned to TV with a syndicated fivedayaweek program called What Every Woman Wants to Know shown locally on WABCTV from 1030 to 11 AM The shows format is familiar with a difference its Naderized There are two or three individual inter views with consumerists an author a public official a cooking or some other demonstration and a consumer oriented editorial The last a rebuke to the Food and Drug Administration perhaps or a plea for nationwide abortion laws is very tough occasionally radical though somewhat vitiated by its brevity What is fas cinating about the show is Bess Myerson herself who seems as serious as the amazed press agents said she was when she was crowned Miss America in 1945 Although Bess Myerson entered the Miss America con test to get money for graduate study in music winning nevertheless stereotyped her as a bathing beauty Its a tough act to follow After I won the title she once told a newspaper reporter I toured vaudeville I came out in a high necked gown and played The Ritual Fire Dance and Malaguefia on the piano and flute I could hear the boys up front complaining and muttering Wheres the bath ing suit So in the finale I came out in a white bathing suit and the boys would cheer Toward the end of the tour I realized they didnt want to hear my music so I just came out in a bathing suit Finally I was losing weight and not filling out the bathing suit so I quit Then was the title an albatross Silenceexcept for the sound of the little red ball It was painful you cant imagine how painfulshe gri macesto walk night after night through the crowded ballrooms to mount the daises to be introduced as the representative of American womanhood the representa tive But it was also instructive to travel across the country to go to a town below the MasonDixon line and to see actually see blacks on one side of the street and whites on the other to be discriminated against myself because of my Jewishness It was instructiveand it was shocking In fact it shocked Bess Myerson into abandoning her musical career Oh I was talented she declares re minding you that she once played with the New York Philharmonic But the Miss America tour convinced me that I wasnt cut out for the insulated life of the musi cian She became an activist speaking out against bigotry for civil tights She also married twice had a daughter Barra now 23 and went on television Her television career eight years as the star of The Big PayOff nine years as a panelist on Ive Got a Secret was long and lucrative And undistinguished the reporter asks going alas too far Silence The red ball bounces furiously Undistin guished she says in echo Compared with whom With Pauline Frederick Which women had distinguished careers in television then There was Lucille Ball She pauses smiling a little And there were Kitty Carlisle Arlene Francis Dorothy Kilgallen Phyllis Newman Betsy Palmerand me But with Dave Garroway on the Today show I did what Barbara Walters now does And I worked on specials which were watched by millions the Tourna ment of Roses the Miss America Pageant The red ball stops Bess Myerson flashes a full smile Looking back I guess my head was into financial se curity she concedes Now my daughter Barra [Grant] is an actress She has great integrity is very careful in selecting her roles And I respect that But our life ex perience is different I began just above the poverty line She didnt I went to a city college Hunter She was sent to Bryn Mawr When she had to choose between a tele vision commercial with good residuals and a oneshot television part shequite rightly as it turned outtook the part At her stage I would have taken the commercial Bess Myerson is a pragmatist Is her TV show insur ance against losing her city job when Mayor Lindsays term expires No no she protests earnestly If I wanted to return to television Id just quit now The show is supposed be an extension of my city jobnot a substitute Its inform consumers about their rights Its to raise money for investigations and educational programs and product tests that we have no budget for All my television fees go into a nonprofit fund [The Administration Manage ment and Research Association of the City of New York] which channels them into my department E I du Pont de Nemours  Co is the principal spon sor of What Every Woman Wants to Know and there are various other sponsors as wella figure salon an air conditioning and refrigeration specialists school a patent medicine all of which should bring lots of money to the Department of Consumer Affairs Still isnt it unseemly for a consumer advocate to appear on a sponsored show The little red ball bounces out of reach That worries me She is grave I wonder whether viewers think that I endorse the products that are advertised during the breaks in my showI dont endorse products There was a time when I didbut that time is passed Thats not my career and thats not where Im at Then why didnt she take her show to public television Commercial television pays better and reaches a wider audience replies the pragmatist And Bess Myer son wants consumer advocates across the country to copy

the same time there are more handicapped and retarded children than ever before in the state who are in need of families to give them a home and to raise them There are 14 couples for every healthy baby available one state official said What were seeing in New Jersey is only part of a trend in the Northeast as a whole State officials say that in New Jersey as elsewhere in the Northeast there are three main reasons why the pool of children available for adoption has decreased in the last two or three years The first is that women particularly single women are better informed than ever before on contraception In addition attitudes to ward and the availability of abortions have been liberal ized In several states in this area notably New York abortions are now legal The third main reason is that more and more the stigma of raising a child born out of wedlock seems to be disappearing more and more unwed mothers are keeping their children where once these very women were the richest source for supplying orphanages and foster homes with babies Last year 51 per cent of single girls giving birth kept their child according to official esti mates Fewer Given Away The oncefrequent situa tion in which a single girl gave away her baby stealth ily for adoption is becoming less noticeable said Judith Johnston supervisor of the interagency services of the states Bureau of Childrens Services It would be accurate to say that most of the states 16 placement agencies do not have children in care that they can place Last year these agencies placed 1336 infants and older children In 1970 the number of children placed for adoption was 1847 In 1968 the figure was 1908 One million 800 thousand children were adopted in the United States by families through various agencies last year While precise figures are not available officials maintain that fewer children were adopted in 1971 than in the year before According to Mrs Eliza beth Cole supervisor of the Adoption Service Unit of the Bureau of Childrens Serv ices the crucial problem lies in not the adoption of nor mal children  because the demand for such children far exceeds the availability but in placing handicapped and retarded children with families Age Called Crucial Age snore than race or any other factor is the cru cial thing to remember here Mrs Cole said last week The number of readily adoptable children under the age of 2 is not commensurate with the number of couple who want them The children who remain to be placed are those from 8 years old to adolescent years she continued and more significantly those who have learning problems and those with serious medical disabilities such as cerebral palsy epilepsy congenital heart conditions paralysis and other birth defects These are the unwanted children Mrs Cole asserted The bureau is the third largest placement agency for childadoption in the coun try Last year it placed 600 children Mrs Cole said At the present time 75 children with some handicap or other are waiting for a family to adopt them Two important develop ments have taken place with in the last year that promise to alleviate the plight of these handicapped children One is the formation of a new adoption agency in Westfield Spaulding for Children which specializes in finding homes for children who are hard to place We are a private non profit agency Lillian Kawut the executive director said We do not charge any fee for adoptive parents Other placement agencies charge between 8 and 12 per cent of the familys monthly sal ary as a fee Focus on the Handicapped Because we focus on placing handicapped chil dren said Mrs Kawut who is in her midtwenties Spaulding also offers after adoption services such as counselling for the family and tries to help the child with adjusting to that fam ily To date Spaulding has placed 28 children and ac cording to Mrs Kawut ex pects to step up its placement services in the coming months The other significant de velopment in assisting hard toplace children is legisla tion pending in the state Senate The bill which would provide a subsidy to parents adopting handicapped chil dren has already been ap proved by the Assembly If enacted into law as appears likely the legislation would make New Jersey the 15th state  New York is among themto provide subsidies to families taking handi capped children into their fold Under this plan not only will the handicapped child get apermanent home but it would also cost the state substantially less to finance its operations that it costs it now to fund its foster home programs Mrs Cole said The state now spends 22 million each year in main taining the fosterhomes services This figure includes administrative expenses

Suburban Housewives Striving to Become the New Woman’,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/31/archives/suburban-housewives-striving-to-become-the-new-woman.html,WESTPORT Conn  I dont know if its really possible to be free and married says a Fairfield County house wife I think of marriage as an op pressive institution Suddenly I get the whole message says another member of the rap group and when your husband goes along with It and admires you and lets you be equal you start loving him more than ever For a while its rough going but when you get together on this new basis my God its better than any thing I havent changed about housework a young wife from Weston Conn says Im still sloppy I just dont feel guilty about it any more Members of the same suburban con sciousnessraising group the women are speaking of changes within themselves since the rap group began nine months ago They are middleclass housewives married for the most part to successful professional men and business execu tives From the beginning the group at tracted certain types of women neither militant feminists nor selfsatisfied homemakers but rather women open to change They ranged in age from the 30s to late 40s Bright educated former career women in some cases most were working full time as wives moth ers homemakers Although they gave time to community work to parttime jobs and to pursuit of the arts home Making was the primary job Mostly they were still saddled with young chil dren Most were married to careeror iented New York City commuters Two Housewives Began the Group The group was begun last spring by two friends from Weston and Westport themselves housewives mothers of small children occasional writers and emerging feminists who had attended several womens lib rap sessions Women came to the leaderless week ly meetings bringing others and bring in a variety of topics and experiences With a policy of open attendance the group vaned in size from week to week revolving around a core of 10 to 15 regular participants They followed the rules of the con sciousnessraising game Use personal experience no putdowns give every one a chance to talk Discussion ranged over a wide field including sex and sexuality financial control marriage contracts abortion appearance and selfimage volunteer ism roleplaying destructive aspects of marriage  in short every subject that affected them as women One particularly emotional session dealt with the theme You Belong to Me It was precipitated by one wo man who said that her husband often settled their arguments by saying You belong to me and you do what I say I went home from that session very shaken one young woman confessed and I said to my husband that night Do you think you own me He said I absolutely do I pay the bills That comment brought about a long discus sion between us ending with a change in his attitude It was a real break through How Widespread Are the Changes Many of the womens attitudes have changed too But have the changes af fected their daily lives changed family patterns influenced husbands Are household chores redistributed Who spends time in the kitchen Who takes out the garbage For one thing division of labor is less sharply defined and stereotyped roles are breaking down for these women Weve switched roles said Elsa who is married to a young lawyer My husband does the marketing and I do the mowing and yard work I love to dig in with a pickax and make holes for trees and he hates it He started marketing for me when I was pregnant and then discovered he really like to do it she continued He doesnt feel that It threatens his masculinity although I think a few years ago he would have Isabella who is deeply involved in theater and recently directed her own production for the Westport Community Theater says that she is particularly gratified to have a cooperative husband at this time She said that she and her husband a writer have always exchanged roles He likes to do the laundry He finds it soothing to his brain and Ive be come aware that Ive always liked to do maletype chores like putting up cab inets But now I am even more flexible about the roles Janet who is married to a corpora tion executive and who writes for a local advertising agency and lives in one of Westports magnificent showcase homes commented on her changed attitude toward homemaking My husband points out things in the house that need repairing and cleaning and asks when Im going to attend to it When I reply I dont know his shocked response is Dont you care I realize that I really dont care any more that I have more important concerns and that I would in fact be happy with a much simpler setup If someone in the family says Wheres the water I tell him its in the kitchen sink said Jean wife of a doctor and mother of four The other night we were having dinner and my husband looking at the empty nap kinholder said Dont we have any more napkins Ordinarily I would have jumped up to get them but I said Yes theyre in the cabinet He looked at me finally got the message and went to get them himself Still its not easy Its hard to fight culture patterns Children too are learning to help My 8yearold son who takes out the garbage said I was treating him like a slave Jean continued I told him that I felt like a slave too going to the supermarket when I really didnt want to and I knew just how he felt We are now living with more mess and disorder but with less rigid rou tines said Audrey the wife of a New York lawyer If Im involved in some thing and the children are anxious for dinner I dont have second thoughts about telling them to go into the kitchen and get the meal started The women have also become more aware of their financial circumstances Facing up to their economic dependen cy they know that they could never match their husbands incomes or earn enough to maintain their present life styles For many their entire sense cis selfworth  or lack of it  is tied up in this revelation Several of the women have opened their own bank accounts a move that has puzzled and offended husbands even as they have tried to understand it My wife who has a small indepen dent income opened her own checking account one husband reported and she now has the best of both worlds her account and our account  But I do see her point Logically speaking it should go into our joint account But since I put in most of the money I have no hesitancy about spending it any way I choose while she tells me that she does hesitate and that is de grading for her I dont know where she gets the idea that whats mine is hers and whats hers is hers said another The rap sessions have scrutinized wo mens financial and legal status within the family forcing the women to look more carefully into their own situa tions Investments as a Family Affair My husband feels that the rest of the money after household and other expenses are paid is his to invest said Jean Granted he is verygener ous and he sets us up comfortably I have no complaints on that score But I feel that the investments are my kids education and our oldage thing I want to know what stocks he is buying How do the husbands react to this New Woman According to several members their husbands show them more respect find them more exciting Communication has improved Sexual relations are report edly better At the same time the wo men gay that the men feel threatened by change and view the rap group with mixed feelings I was in favor of my wife joining a Bridgeport lawyer said because I felt that insofar as she felt better about herself our whole marriage would be better We have been working right along toward a real equality in our marriage something the rap group may be helping to speed up and I welcome it But another husband said No I dont object if she finds some thing to do for two hours a week on a Thursday afternoon It doesnt cost me anything She still gets my dinner on time does the laundry It doesnt change my lifestyle one bit Why should I complain about it According to the wives the husbands have more underlying hostility to the group and to womens lib ideas than they will admit The men also wonder how much of their intimate lives are being revealed to strangers My husband hates It says Jean He comes across very sarcastically and bitterly Two years ago for example he bought me a copy of Kate Millens Sexual Politics for Christmas and this year he spent four hours in the book store looking for an antiwomens lib book My husband likes the fact I am de veloping independence and new asser tiveness Audrey concluded Yet he still has this vision of the superwife The other day he looked into his drawer and said It would be so nice if you ironed my underwear He wants me to be liberated and be his mommy all at the same time

Paisley once the symbol of Ulster Protestant extremism has surprised followers and emerged in recent weeks as a voice of political moderation Mr Paisley a fundamentalist minister and the selfstyled moderator of the Free Presbyterian Church of Northern Ireland has won praise from the Conservative and Labor parties in England newspapers in London and Dublin and Protestant moderates in Belfast The 46yearold Member of Parliament has condemned the policies of William Craig the former Ulster cabinet minister who heads the Ulster Vanguard a powerful militant Protestant force He also opposed the recent general strike that crippled Northern Ireland for two days and has called for total integration of Ulster into the United Kingdom which Protestant hard liners oppose The voice of Mr Craig and the advice of Mr Craig are the voice and the advice of folly Mr Paisley said in Parliament last week For any responsible member of the public to say he will make Ireland ungovernable is playing into the hands of the enemies of Ulster Mr Craig has bitterly attacked Mr Paisley Hes no longer a politician with a following said Mr Craig You can just disregard him He has no one behind him He has the attitude of a bankrupt man Its ridiculous to want integration with the United Kingdom said Mr Craig discussing a proposal that was also made by the former Ulster prime minister Brian Faulkner Its a sign of weakness It would lead to the eventual sellout to the IRA Mr Paisley who has appeared on television in the Irish Republic which is unusual for most Protestant hard liners said last week Complete integration with the United Kingdomthere lies the best way for all in Northern Ireland Catholic and Protestant alike I have only one aim It is to save the union If I could achieve that it would represent the pinnacle of everything want and hope for Under total integration Ulster would have the same status as Scotland and Wales Since 1921 the six counties of Northern Ireland had been a subordinate part of the United Kingdom but with greater legal independence than Scotland and Wales Uhtil the Ulster parliament and government were formally suspended this week they had considerable power over local affairs Some what Mysterious Mr Paisley has said that integration would end Protestant fears that Britain would eventually weary of the Ulster problem and negotiate to abandon the border between Northern Ireland and the republic Mr Paisley remains nevertheless a somewhat mysterious figure who generally avoids newspapers interviews He has been widely influenced by a colleague Desmond Boal in the Democratic Unionist party founded by Mr Paisley Mr Boal a lawyer who was a member of the Ulster parliament is a Protestant who had a brilliant academic career at Trinity College Dublin He has close links with Catholics in the Irish Republic Although a militant Ulster Protestant Mr Boal has defended Irish Republican Army members anarchists and civil rights leaders He is widely

illegally at the time of the Cultural Revolution Friends say that Mr Paisley and Mr Boal admire each other and both view themselves as essentially antiEstablishment figures Both Opposed Internment The two were virtually alone among Protestant politicians in condemning Brian Faulkners policy of interning suspected terrorists without trial Mr Paisley has termed the tactic unworkable and ineffective Mr Boal condemned it outright in principle The two have also indicated that Protestants in Ulster might be prepared to look again at the question of unification if Dublins 1937 Constitution were scrapped This gives the Roman Catholic Church in Ire land a special position in the nation where the sale of contraceptives abortion and divorce are illegal and widespread censorship prevails Mr

Another Free Presbyterian church is being built in Drum in the Irish Republic In 1970 Mr Paisley was elected to the Ulster and British Parliaments Mr Paisleys enemies insist that he has been

2 PARTIES TO NAME COURT CANDIDATES,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/03/archives/2-parties-to-name-court-candidates-democrats-favor-3-justices-for.html,Supreme Court Justices Bernard Meyer of Nassau M Henry Martuscello of Brooklyn and Lawrence H Cooke of Monticello emerged yesterday as the  leading contenders for Democratic nominations for the Court of Appeals The selection of their Republican opponents for the November election was clouded by a controversy over the State Bar Associations rejection of Assemblyman Constance E Cook of Ithaca for one of the GOP nominations for the states highest court The Democratic and Republican State Committees are scheduled to designate their candidates at meetings this afternoon in Queens and Albany respectively Democratic party officials said that barring any rebellion in the state committee Justices Meyer Martuscello and Cooke would receive the Democratic judicial designations Three seats will have to be filled on the sevenmember court which often has the final say on many vital issues Turnover Coming One other member of the court will be retiring next year and another the following year so that the court will have an almost complete turnover in the next two years without even taking into account deaths or unexpected retirements Mrs Cooke who is chairman of the Assembly Education Committee and was a leader of the legislative fight to liberalize the states abortion law had been given a good chance of becoming the first woman nominee of a major party for the Court of Appeals Governor Rockefeller had called for the nomination of a woman and Mrs Cook had been the only one on a list of prospective nominees submitted by the Republican State Committee to the State Bar Associations judiciary committee for scrutiny However Mrs Cook conceded yesterday in a telephone interview from her Ithaca home that the bar association committee had not found her or another leading GOP contender for the Court of Appeals Supreme Court Justice Sol Wachtler of Nassau qualified Rating Setup Scored Mrs Cook charged that the bar associations procedure for rating candidates was vague and secretive She added that its incredible that selection of judges to the highest court would depend on this type of procedure She was particularly critical of the fact that she had not been interviewed by the full judiciary committee of the bar association or given a chance to answer contentions that she did not have judicial experience and had given up her law practice Mrs Cook also noted that Hugh Jones president of the bar association was one of the Republican contenders for the Court of Appeals nomination and that Earl Evans chairman of the judiciary committee of the bar association was a law partner of Charles Schoeneck of Syracuse another Court of Appeals aspirant and a former Republican state chairman Neither Mr Jones nor Mr Evans could be reached yesterday for ciamment Im breaking a gentlemans agreementthey keep these things secretivebut then Im not a gentleman said Mrs Cook Im hoping the Governor will say that this has not been a valid procedure my only chance is that the Governor intervenes To See Rockefeller Mrs Cook said she intended to get in touch with Mr Rockefeller today hours before the state committee meets Justice Wachtler could not be reached for comment nor could it be determined why he was not on the bar associations qualified list However the failure to include Judge Wachtler and Mrs Cook on the list upset the bestlaid plans of the Governor and the Republican State Committee Both had been considered leading contenders for the Court of Appeals nominations The Republican State Committee had indicated that bar association approval of a judicial aspirant was a precondition for nomination although the move has no legal standing Similarly the Democratic State Committee has suggested that any Democratic aspirants for the Court of Appeals also submit to bar association scrutiny individually The association report on Democratic aspirants is due today Because of the lateness of the bar association decision final decision on the Republican nominations was not expected until this morning if then A spokesman fur the Governor declined to comment on Mrs Cooks statement Meanwhile the usually contentious Democrats had apparently reached agreement on the Court of Appeals nominations of their party without too much trouble although there would undoubtedly be some squabbling at the state committee meeting in the Ramada Inn near Kennedy International Airport

The Older Children Who Needed Homes —And Found Them,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/07/archives/the-older-children-who-needed-homes-and-found-them.html,John Fairweather has no recollection of ever seeing his natural father and he cant remember what his mother looked like His memory goes back to the time when he was 4 years old and awakened before dawn to find he was alone in the bed he shared with his mother She had disappeared as had his father some years earlier It was still dark but I thought she had gone to the store he recalled I went down to the street and wandered around and the cops picked me up John is 16 now and for some years has had the security of a legal father and mother He was adopted when he was 7 after a period spent in an orphanage I still hate white soup and foster homes The idea of adopting an older child is now more popular than it once was but it is still anathema to most prospective parents The shortage of babies has led to the acceptance by an increasing number of couples of toddlers up to 2 years of age but the older the child the more difficult he or she is to place The New York Foundling Hospital Adoption Department recently started rejecting applications for adoption unless the applicants indicated that they were willing to adopt either older children children of any race or the physically handicapped Children in these categories need homes a spokeswoman for the hospital said It was getting ridiculous to take applications for white babies because there arent any available and there isnt much hope in the near future She attributed the shortage in part to the abortion law and to a change in attitude that has led to more single mothers deciding to keep their children There is a general hesitancy about taking older children because parents feel the child has had so much experience in other living situations that it makes things more difficult said Mrs Marjorie Edwards a case worker who has handled the adoption of many older children for Sheltering Arms Children Service School age children are the most difficult of all she added The child has to adjust not only to new parents but to new schools and new friends Its more difficult but it can be handled It is more difficult according to most parents but many of the difficulties are inherent in raising any children There are occasionally financial strains curtailment of social life through the period of adjustment and sibling rivalry if there are other children The more unusual problems are primarily emotional ranging from insecurity to possessiveness A few families have encountered prejudice from neighbors and their children They want to know all about the parents of the children all about their backgrounds reported one father His wife added Our son came home one day and said one of the children had told him that he didnt come from his mothers egg I told him that he didnt come from my egg but that he certainly came from his mothers egg You just wouldnt believe some of the ridiculous things that are aaid Being Older Not a Problem Surprisingly few problems stem from the fact that most couples who adopt older children are older themselves The parents in cases like this are usually older because most of them wait some years before accepting the fact that they wont have children of their own said one adoption agency official There are some too who have raised their own children or members of their family and then want to adopt other children There have been times in the nine years since Johns arrival at the Fairweather home in River Vale NJ when his parents have considered that they might be too old Mr Fairweather who works in the accounting division of a trucking company is 57 his wife a plump amiable woman who has worked as a secretary and is now employed parttime by a weekly newspaper is in her 40s Ive sometimes thought maybe we were too old but Ive never felt too old to cope Mrs Fairweather said We both adjusted well but I think maybe his father had a harder time in sharing me with a child We always had kids around anyway Mr Fairweather said We had Fresh Air children and foreign exchange students and nieces and nephews there were always young people around the house But when John first moved into the spacious splitlevel home after the usual preliminary visits and overnight stays he was according to his mother an impossible kid who screamed a lot We gave up almost all our social life for the first 18 months we never left him alone Mrs Fairweather said Hes changed a lot Hes adjusted to our demands and what we expected of him But not completely The Fairweathers in fact didnt expect certain things anymore than did thousands of other parents natural or adoptive We went through the commune bit but that died thank God said Mr Fairweather a husky man who teaches Sunday school at the Methodist church  now hes a member of the Jesus People There is no objection to their sons religious fervor but the Fairweathers are somewhat chagrined at the value placed on some of the comforts they have provided My father sees only what he can hold said John a boy of serious mien whose conversation is studded with religious references Hes a materialistic person and Im a spiritual person He thinks you have to make money  to buy food and things like that The Lord Helps Those Mrs Fairweather interjected John thinks the Lord is going to take care of you and I think the Lord expects you to do a few things yourself John who plans to be a minister I have got to serve the Lord somehow  there were so many holes in my life travels that I could have fallen in any of them but somehow I always walked on top also foresees the time when he may adopt a child Why have new kids when you can have old kids he asked rhetorically There are kids who are already here  I know how it feels Ive been there The Henry Whites who have always been surrounded by innumerable nieces and nephews adopted two of their own only recently Their first experience was with Yon now 212 who came to them as a foster child and was legally adopted early this year Mrs White who is 53 and her husband a 63yearold longshoreman adopted 6yearold Victoria a year ago My husband has a lot of patience with children he plays with them and takes them for drives and I get a lot of pleasure from their company Mrs White said There isnt any financial drain its all in the way you manage The Whites who live in Hollis now regret only the size of their house Wed take more children if we had room Mrs White said The sentiment was reiterated by William Greitz a 46yearold sergeant in the Nassau County police force Financially its some strain said Mr Greitz whose son Douglas 17 and daughter Gloria 10 are both adopted But if I got a call tomorrow asking me to take another Id probably say yeh sure we can probably make out The Greitzes were both 32 when they adopted Douglas We always wanted children and we went to clinics and the whole bit Mr Greitz said When we decided to adopt we asked for an infant and they kept on edging up the age and finally we were told they had a little boy who was over two we found out he was almost three The minute we laid eyes on him we loved him Mrs Greltz said If you cant have a child and you are offered one I cant fathom anyone saying they dont like the color of the hair or the eyes or they want a younger child If you are fortunate enough to get a child you are lucky Always Room For One More Ten years after adopting Douglas Mrs Greitz telephoned her husband one day at the police station I was on desk dutyhe grinned at the recollection I picked up the phone and it was my wife saying how about adopting another child The second child was Gloria who was already in school when she was adopted Her previous living experience brought a rather unusual problem She was really spoiled when she first came Mrs Greitz said She had been in a foster home for three years and although the people felt they couldnt adopt her they thought they would have her forever as a foster child They took her removal pretty emotionally Gloria says about those days I remember I could wrap them around my little finger I could do anything wanted Boy is it different now Mrs Greitz admits candidly that she is the screamer in the family We are very strict she said We were determined to have children and we went out and adopted them and we are going to raise them the best way we can They know when I holler at them its because I love them The Greitzes who spend a good deal of time with the children going to concerts both children are musical and taking camping trips found that their major periods of anxiety were the two years spent waiting to legally adopt the children You dont want to let your feelings go too far thinking maybe something terrible will happen Mrs Greitz said The minute you walk out of that courtroom you feel completely different There are thousands of older kids like this all over the United States said Mr Greitz who plans to retire from the police force next year to do social community or probation work They are like secondclass citizens There is no one to really care for them or give them an extra push They deserve a chance
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/09/archives/practicing-beliefs.html,TO THE EDITOR It may comfort Professor Adelson to note that everyone believes in equal pay for equal work and that women should not be sharply limited in the economic roles available to them but it is not much comfort to countless women We in the womens movement are working to translate such egalitarian beliefs into egalitarian practice As a social scientist Professor Adelson must be perfectly well aware that the facts of the economic world are a far cry from societal consensus on goals It is no comfort to a woman to be told job equality as a goal has won nearly universal concurrence She wants to see it reflected in her paycheck It is the implementation of such goals that absorbs the energies of the womens movement today That the spearhead of the feminist movement has been middleclass in origin no one will deny That its impact and concerns are exclusively middieclass is increasingly less true Professor Adelson is clearly reading only what the media tell him about womens liberation or he could not claim that as far as the average citizen is concerned our issues are as remote as happenings on the moon A great deal of the real work of the womens movement is focused on breadandbutter issues of state protective law repeal amicus curiae briefs to defend the rights of employed factory women the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and the organization of countless thousands of women to assure their presence among the delegates to the national conventions this summer And who does Professor Adelson think played a major role in the change in state abortion laws across the country during the past five years The efforts of thousands of women have gone into these campaigns seeking a right to control their reproductive lives that is the very opposite of remote Professor Adelson questions whether educated women as a group are really interested in the movement and cites as evidence that only one out of 34 women surveyed in a student dissertation had any connection with or interest in the movement So small a sample and so vague an indicator can mean almost anything There are in fact impressive indices of the extent to which interest is being expressed by educated women with the concerns of the womens movement In December 1970 there were 110 womens studies courses and two womens studies programs on college campuses across the country One year later there were 610 such course and some 15 womens studies programs In just the past two months Florence Rowe and Carol Ahhun who have been tracing this new trend in higher education have added 60 new courses to their list know of 17 additional institutions now considering a full womens studies program and predict a sharp increase in such courses in secondary schools by this fall Students who have taken these courses now number in the thousands I suspect very few of them have as limited a knowledge of what the womens movement is concerned with as Professor Adelson shows In his desire to see the movement die Professor Adelson does not tell his readers that membership in the National Organization for Women has doubled this past year that there are now several dozen feminist journals and newspapers in the country and that feminist presses have a backlog of manuscripts submitted for publication As for his supermarket cocktailparty interviewing if the attitude projected in his article was communicated to his interviewees it does not surprise me that he got the responses he did That many women are irritated by some of the ideas circulated by the liberation movement is undoubtedly the case Depending on where you are at they can be very irritating indeed For some women that irritation will be followed by anger and then by action as they come up against experiences in life that give direct evidence of discrimination and ridicule against women This is not to deny that some silly and irritating things are being said by women in the movement Since we are very diverse and articulately reject any superorganization that funnels one line to the media this is inevitably the case But if Professor Adelson had an opportunity to hear a discussion within a womens group which he wouldnt be able to do in any event since such a group would freeze upon his approach he would learn that the specifics of family roles of management of dual careers of concern for a childs development of meshing the desires and needs of a husband and a wife are constant themes of dialogue and exploration The movement cannot be gauged from reading a few extremist books and TV interview And as a social scientist I would also expect Professor Adelson to be sensitive to the phases of a social movement In its early stages one must expect a strong component of rhetoric I suspect the rhetoric will be as strong in one direction as the culture has been in the other but that with time the dialectic of ideas in interaction will produce a more moderate tested residue It is the very extremity of the pressure toward potstirring and babyrocking of the domestic ethos of the postWorld War II period that is being reacted against and in due course current ideas will be shaken down and distilled Later in his article Professor Adelson tells us that in the early days of the movement one heard strident but sometimes charismatic voices while today we hear a different voice that of the technocratic intelligence He is too nonspecific to offer us dates but since the movement he is discussing has a very short history of at most five or six years one might assume that by new voice he is referring to things said in the past two years or so The passage he saw fit to quote from my work argued that with institutional arrangements for child care a professional woman could envisage a continuous career with only a year of withdrawal for childbearing What he does not tell the readers is that this quote comes from my earliest essay on sex equality written in 1963 and published in 1964 It was to combat the message his own field of psychology had been espousing for years that women with children belong at home or their children would suffer emotional damage that I undertook to review the empirical evidence of the effect of employment on children and to suggest the problem might lie in institutional change That analysis is no longer necessary in 1972 precisely because of the impact of the womens movement on educated wom Had Professor Adelson read what I have published most recently he would have heard a rather different note but then it would not fit his desire to discredit the womens movement I suspect the technological futurists in our midst draw an erroneous conclusion from consumergoods gullibility The woman easily tempted to purchase a dress she does not need would surprise many futurists by her sales resistance to having a testtube pregnancy Studies of maternal adaptation suggest that difficulty of adjustment is greater with multipars than primipara births A womans need for help goes up with each additional child but the help and emotional support available to her goes down Solutions involve not onlyinore community help to adult mothers but perhaps equally important more challenging training in girlhood in carrying multiple responsibilities Childcare centers are only one and not necessarily the best of many possible institutional devices to assist young mothersstayathome as well as career women American Journal of Psychiatry March 1972 ALICE S Rossi President

Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/17/archives/sanctity-of-life.html,To the Editor For the most part your March 17 story on Part II of the Report of the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future represents responsible reporting I must however take exception to an implication in your story The commission recommends the liberalization of our abortion laws so that abortion may be available on request Four of us who served on the commission could not concur in this recommendation Your story associates the fact that the four of us are Catholics with our position on abortion In doing so you clearly imply that our position is based on a narrow religions tenet to be equated with attending church on Sunday or with abstinence from meat on church holy days Thus the possibility that any one of us may have searched beyond our religious faith is effectively foreclosed and whatever impact our statements may have had is immediately diminished Is our religion relevant to the issue think not For my part my position is premised on the moral conviction that sanctity of life must be respected JOHN N ERLENBORN Member of Congress 14th District Ill Washington March 21 1972
A Group Flight to Los Angeles To Get a Quick Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/17/archives/a-group-flight-to-los-angeles-to-get-a-quick-abortion.html,DALLAS APTheres a special group fare flight that leaves Dallas every Saturday for Los Angeles Its always full but never popular To qualify for the group rate you have to need an abortion Do you know what its like having to face something like this said Carol D a Dallas schoolteacher in her midtwenties who was one of the women who made the 24hour trip on a recent weekend They tell you its safe and legal In New York or California but its still an operation and you still have to face it alone Thats the worst part being alone How many husbands or friends can afford an extra 120 to go along and hold your hand A Package Deal The group trip is sponsored by Problem Pregnancy Information Services which has telephone answering services in Dallas and Houston The organization offers a package dealplane transportation doctor motel hospital and counseling for 346 Miss D arrived at the Dallas airport with Just a small overnight bag that she carried with her on the plane The group was flying on a regularly scheduled airliner and the waiting room was full How many of these women are here for the same reason she asked her boy friend who was waiting with her I wonder if they feel as conspicuous as I do Look at those girls sitting alone Oh God I hope theyre not with us I couldnt have started out alone I hope they are going to LA for a game or something and never get near a hospital all weekend Tom Grant who was among the Los Angeles welcoming committee could have easily been a tour director meeting a group about to embark on a tour of California He and a girl named Candy quickly checked to make sure that no one was missing among the 70 women from Dallas and Houston who were in for the weekend Then they divided the arrivals into groups of 15 The women were for the most part in their early twenties The youngest was 15 and accompanied by an older sister There were three women over 40 One husband one boyfriend and one mother made the trip Forty per cent of the women were married Well go over tomorrows procedure step by step Well also be given a brief talk on birth control You might find it informative The remark broke the ice The women began to laugh and look to each other for reassurance The counseling session lasted for about an hour The atmosphere was somewhat reminiscent of a sorority rush orientation Several of the women managed to maintain a sense of humor The pill said a worker during the birth control lecture is 99 per cent effective She went through various other methods Dont forget abstinence said a voice in the back Thats 100 per cent I think the worst part of all said a 23yearold was keeping this from my younger sisters My parents know and are being wonderful But Im their big sister Im supposed to set a good example You ought to tell them said the sister of the 15yearold I had an abortion four years ago illegally in New Mexico Afterwards I told my mother we were going to have to start telling the younger girls about birth control She was shocked and avoided the subject So look who Im here with Ive got three children Im crazy about another women said But my husband and I just cant afford to have another child mentally or financially It almost tore us apart to make this decision But there was no other choice Another explained her children were grown and she and her husband were grandparents She thought she was going through menopause when her doctor told her she was pregnant Still another came with her 2yearold son She said she was in the midst of a divorce and had no place to leave him It was a Long Night A 17yearold who had come alone remained calm and didnt talk much She said she just wished it was all over For most It was a long night The women met in the motel lobby which by 5 AM was quite full Everyone seemed a bit quiet and some a little pale The hospital was small about 22 beds and privately owned by several doctors The only procedures being done there on Sunday were abortions The women had been told they would receive a mild anesthetic that would put them to sleep for about an hour One doctor would be operating on the approximately 40 patients in this particular group One by one the girls were carted into the hall and then into the operating room the doctor spent about three minutes for each procedure waiting a few minutes then starting on another It was run with mechanical precision The assemblyline aspect caused anger among some of the women These doctors make a fortune off our misfortune Miss D complained That doctor is getting at least 50 a patient today Thats not even a full days work and he is making about 2000 Most doctors charge 150 This one here can make 100000 for just working on Sundays and still take a twoweek vacation Motivated by Personal Experience Mr Grant noted that some of the girls working with the service are there because of a personal experience I was pregnant when I was 19 and living in Florida said one My family doctor told me he could arrange an abortion for 700 I was sent to a restaurant where I was blindfolded and taken to a house It was horrible And still after all that I was still pregnant I had the baby and put it up for adoption I dont want anyone else to ever have to go through that About an hour after the first operation the first girl was brought back to her room from the recovery room She was awake and saying that she was glad it was over The PPIS people visited each room to ward off any postoperative depression They also announced breakfast would be served shortly When the food did arrive the women were touched to find a fresh longstemmed carnation on each tray I know this is going to affect me for the rest of my life Miss D said I dont feel anything right now except relief But its the kind of thing that hits you later and you never quite forget You can walk away from the hospital but you cant walk away from that She arose put on her clothes and prepared to go home When the plane touched down at Love Field Dallas the group broke up and quickly went in separate directions Some went anxiously to the people who came to pick them up Those who were alone seemed intent on leaving as soon as possible There were few goodbys to each other and no lingering conversations After Miss D commented Its not the kind of thing one uses to form an alumnae group

Assembly Votes Lindsay Plan too Save Corona Homes,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/18/archives/assembly-votes-lindsay-plan-to-save-corona-homes.html,ALBANY April 17  After bottling the measure up for more than a year the State Assembly this evening passed Mayor Lind says compromise plan for spar ing and relocating a number of Corona Queens homes original ly condemned to make way for a high school The bill was passed 135 to 2 and was sent to the Senate where its chances are considered favorable because that cham ber passed a similar bill last year Governor Rockefeller in dicated support for the compro mise when it was first worked out in 1970 The plan was considered ex traordinary at the time because city officials reconsidered the condemnation and agreed to yield to a number of complaints that they had previously ignored from residents of the tightly knit bluecollar community of modest homes some of them handbuilt by immigrant fore bears The plan was snatched from limbo with the legislative action on the bill sponsored by the areas Democrat Assemblyman Joseph F Lisa Last year the measure was kept stymied in committee at the behest of Assemblyman Vito P Battista a Republican from Brooklyn and a rival of Mr Lisa on the issue Mr Battista has kept up a running denunciation of Mr Lindsay that continued today Last year Mr Battista had the backing of the Republican majority leaders on the issue reportedly a singleyear com mitment made because his vote was needed on a number of other measures they wanted passed This year however the leadership chose to accept co operation from the Democratic minority on a number of is sues so Mr Lisa had a bit more leverage The bill was passed immedi ately after the unanimous ap proval of Mr Battistas own measure to set up state pro cedures for returning excess condemned property without competitive bidding City officials have maintained that the Battista bill was too broad and not tailored enough for the complicated mortgage rental and relocation problems of the Mayors compromise In voting against the Lisa bill Mr Battista said it was unconstitutional and would permit the Mayor to perform il legal acts The only other opponent Herbert J Miller Democrat of Forest Hills Queens which is near Corona described the bill as a miserable rotten cor rupt hoax Mr Lisa defending the bill as the way to save his com munitys integrity glared at Mr Miller and accused him of a sellout alleging that Mr Miller wanted to see the high school switched to Forest Hills to substitute for the controver sial plan for public housing that has engulfed that neighborhood Mr Miller described that re mark as despicable Minutes later Mr Lisa rushed to the back of the chamber and was congratulated by City Hall lobbyists The Corona issue came up at the end of a sixhour day unusual in the current session until now in which the As sembly began its annual two week finale of voting on bills and closing out issues at break neck speed after weeks of gen erally light work In other action PRISON WARDENS The Assembly passed and sent to the Senate a bill that would eliminate the require ment that prison superintend ents be appointed from Civil Service lists It is designed to give state officials more flexi bility in dealing with prisons Another approved bill sent to the Senate would liberalize parole standards for inmates incarcerated before the 1967 changes in the penal law went into effect EXTENDED DETENTION The Assembly passed 97 to 40 and sent to the Senate a measure that would increase to five days the present 72hour limit within which a felony de fendant may be detained with out bail before having his first court hearing Assemblyman Robert C Wertz Republican of Suffolk County said prosecu tors needed the extra time to verify possible evidence but a number of legislators said that the bill violated civil rights DRUNKEN DRIVING A bill to have New York join 42 other states in a drunken driving breathometer standard of 010 of 1 per cent of alcohol in the blood by weight was defeated 70 to 38 The present standard is 012 of 1 per cent Proponents ar gued that the tighter limit would fight the highway car nage and opponents said the test was unreliable and rarely accepted by juries WELFARE RESIDENCY A housecleaning bill to ex punge last years welfareresi dency law from the books because it was later de clared unconstitutional narrow ly passed 77 to 59 The routine measure drew numerous con servative and upstate no votes when Edward F Craw ford Republican of Oswego in vited opposition as a way of protesting

Connecticut Will Appeal Ruling Against Anti‐Abortion Statutes,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/20/archives/connecticut-will-appeal-ruling-against-antiabortion-statutes.html,NEW HAVEN April 19 Connecticut officials are planning to appeal a Federal judicial decision declaring the states 122yearold antiabortion statutes unconstitutional After almost two months of deliberations a panel of three Federal judges yesterday ruled in a 2to1 decision that the state could no longer prevent a woman from deciding whether she will bear a child According to George Stoughton a states attorney who represented Connecticut in the case the ruling will probably now go to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit The state has 30 days in which to file an appeal Although a number of dismayed opponents of abortion called for legislative action Mr Stoughton noted that the Legislature cant do anything to countermand what the court has done Representative Morris Cohen a Bloomfield Democrat who is cochairman of the Public Health and Safety Committee said that he would order drafting of legislation so that the state would not be without some form of control over abortions Stricter Abortion Rules He emphasized that such legislation would not be an attempt to prevent abortions but to make sure that they are performed in a hospital or clinic by proper physicians It would be a temporary measure to avoid any unnecessary carnage to avoid having abortions performed by somebody with a coat hanger he added He said he hoped to have such legislation acted upon by May 3 the deadline of the current General Assembly or in a special session afterwards Advocates of abortion reform were elated by the unexpectedly strong language and wide scope of the decision but remain cautious and undecided on a course of action Although precise figures are not available officials of the Clergy Counseling Service on Problem Pregnancies which handles referrals from the Planned Parenthood League estimated that more than 100 Connecticut women have abortions performed in New York every week Meanwhile in a statement relayed from Phoenix where he is attending a Roman Catholic conference on alcoholism Archbishop John F Whealon of Hartford expressed dismay at the court decision
"… for Old Reform, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/20/archives/-for-old-reform-too.html,The pellmell drive to adjourn heightens danger that a small but intensely aggressive movement to repeal abortion law reform may succeed in sweeping away a desirable legislative advance won after decades of bitter struggle Behind all the emotion on this issue is the reality that the chief effect of the reform has been to make abortions available to those of modest means just as they have always been available to the welltodo Nothing in the reform law compels women to have abortions on the contrary the choice is left with the woman and with her doctor Those who seek to repeal this reform in effect seek to deny women this choice The impact would be to compel them to have unwanted children or put them at the mercy of charlatans Ironically this backward movement manifests itself at Albany just as a threejudge Federal court in Connecticut has declared that states ban on abortions unconstitutional In a similar case in New Jersey another court reached exactly the same decision

Analysis of Cells of Fetus Settles a Paternity Dispute,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/21/archives/analysis-of-cells-of-fetus-settles-a-paternity-dispute.html,By analyzing the cells of an unborn child early in pregnancy Swedish doctors settled a paternity dispute and established the husband as the childs probable father The analysis spared the couple an abortion and a divorce because they had applied for both unless it could be shown likely that the husband was the father of the fetus the doctors said The case described in the current issue of the British journal Nature is believed to be the first time that prenatal analysis was used in a paternity dispute The procedure a relatively new technique is usually used to diagnosis possible genetic defects in the fetus early enough in pregnancy so that an abortion could be performed to prevent the birth of a defective child Social Grounds The Swedish case involved white woman who was married to a Negro The woman said she had had sexual intercourse with a white man as well as with her husband near the time of conception The woman applied for an abortion on social grounds because it would always be understood that the husband could not be the father of a white child the doctors reported In Sweden an abortion would be permitted for such a reason they said Nearly all children of mixed racial parentage have some outward characteristics of both parents At the end of the fourth month of pregnancy doctors from the Karolinska Hospital and Sabbatsbergs Hospital in Stockholm used an enlarged hypodermic needle to remove a small quantity of the amniotic fluid that surrounded the fetus This fluid contains among other things cells shed by the developing fetus A Second Test The fetal cells were separated out and grown in the laboratory Then the chromosomes of the fetal cells were stained with a quinacrinc dye which makes portions of the chromosomes fluorescent Similarly the chromosomes of the white blood cells of the woman her husband and the white man were stained with the dye The chromosomes of different persons tend to have some differences in the resulting fluorescent pattern In this case the fluorescent pattern of the fetal chromosomes more closely resembled the husbands pattern than the pattern of the other man In a second test doctors at the Aarhus Kommunehospital and the University of Aarhus studied the cells of the fetus the mother and the two men to determine what is called their tissue type a relative of blood type but often more precise in establishing differences between persons The fetus and the husband were found to have a tissue type factor in common that was missing in the other man and in the mother In addition there was no evidence that the fetus had any of the factors peculiar to the other man Tissue type factors are now commonly used in paternity disputes but they are not yet accepted as court evidence in this country according to American authorities On the basis of these tests the Swedish doctors concluded that the white man was not the father and that the husband probably was Paternity can never be established with certaintyonly the impossibility of a certain mans being the father can be proved Five months after their study began the doctors diagnosis was confirmed with the birth of a black baby

The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/23/archives/two-states-two-views-abortion.html,Several thousand strong they marched down Fifth Avenue last Sunday It was Right to Life Sundayso designated by New Yorks Cardinal Cookeand the marchers carried such signs as Stop the War Against Babies Then on Wednesday a dozen women stormed the floor of the Assembly in Albany demanding an end to legalized abortions Were not going to move one said insisting that an antiabortion bill be let out of committee But eventually she and her colleagues were led out of the chamber by Assembly attendants Legislative observers said there was little chance that the move to repeal the twoyearold abortion statutethe most liberal in the nationwould succeed Meanwhile in Connecticut proponents of legalized abortion scored major victory For 122 years the state had had one of the nations strictest and most fiercely defended abortion laws Only when a womans life is endangered is the operation legal A year ago 838 women of childbearing age in the state brought suit against the ancient statute The case called Women v Connecticut was heard by a threejudge Federal panel which last week found for the Women Opponents of legalized abortion were dismayed Many agreed with the dissent of Judge T Emmett Clark that the ruling invites unlimited feticide the murder of unborn human beings as a way of life in a state long known as the land of steady habits The state said it would appeal the ruling the Supreme Court has yet to hand down a definitive ruling on abortions and legislators said they would introduce bills to overturn the decision or to make sure that if abortions were performed in Connecticut they would be done by doctors in hospitals and not by somebody with a coat hanger
An 18‐Year‐Old Looks Back On Life,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/23/archives/an-18yearold-looks-back-on-life-an-18yearold-looks-back.html,EVERY generation thinks its specialmy grandparents because they remember horses and buggies my parents because of the Depression The over30s are special because they knew the Red Scare of Korea Chuck Berry and beatniks My older sister is special because she belonged to the first generation of teenagers before that people in their teens were adolescents when being a teenager was still fun And II am 18 caught in the middle Mine is the generation of unfulfilled expectations When youre older my mother promised you can wear lipstick But when the time came of course lipstick wasnt being worn When were big well dance like that my friends and I whispered watching Chubby Checker twist on American Bandstand But we inherited no dance steps ours was a limp formless shrug to watereddown music that rarely made the feet tap Just wait till we can vote I said bursting with 10yearold fervor ready to fast freeze march and die for peace and freedom as Joan Baez barefoot sang We Shall Overcome Well now we can vote and were old enough to attend rallies and knock on doors and wave placards and suddenly it doesnt seem to matterany more My generation is special because of what we missed rather than what we got because in a certain sense we are the first and the last The first to take technology for granted What was a space shot to us except an hour cut from Social Studies to gather before a TV in the gym as Cape Canaveral counted down The first to grow up with TV My sister was 8 when we got our set so to her it seemed magic and always somewhat foreign She had known books already and would never really replace them But for me the TV set was like the kitchen sink and the telephone a fact of life We inherited a previous generations handmedowns and took in the seams turned up the hems to make our new fashions We took drugs from the college kids and made them a highschool commonplace We got the Beatles but not those lovable lookalikes in matching suits with barber cuts and songs that made you want to cry They came to us like a bad jokeaged bearded discordant And we inherited the Vietnam war just after the crest of the wavetoo late to burn draft cards and too early not to be drafted The boys of 1953my yearwill So where are we now Generalizing is dangerous Call us the apathetic generation and we will become that Say times are changing nobody cares about prom queens and getting into the college of his choice any moresay that because it sounds good it indicates a trend gives a symmetry to history and you make a movement and a unit out of a generation unified only in its common fragmentation If there is reason why we are where we are it comes from where we have been Like overanxious patients in analysis we treasure the traumas of our childhood Ours was more traumatic than most The Kennedy assassination has become our myth Talk to us for an evening or twoabout movies or summer jobs or Nixons trip to China or the weatherand the subject will come up Where were you when you heard as if having lived through Jackie and the red roses JohnJohns salute and Oswalds oncamera murder justifies our disenchantment We havent all emerged the same of course because our lives were lived in highschool corridors and drivein hamburger joints as well as in the pages of Time and Life and the images on the TV screen National events and personal memory blur so that for me Nov 22 1963 was a birthday party that had to be called off and Armstrongs moonwalk was my first full can of beer If you want to know who we are now if you wonder how well vote or whether we will or whether 10 years from now well end up just like all those other generations that thought they were specialwith 22 kids and a house in Connecticutif thats what youre wondering look to the past because whether we should blame it or not we do IDIDNT know till years later that they called it the Cuban Missile Crisis But I remember Castro We called him Castor Oil and were awed by his beard  beards were rare in those days We might not have worried so much what would the Communists want with our small New Hampshire town except that we lived 10 miles from an air base Planes buzzed around us like mosquitoes that summer People talked about fallout shelters in their basements and one family on our street packed their car to go to the mountains I couldnt understand that If everybody was going to die I certainly didnt want to stick around with my hair falling out andlatera plague of thalidomide  type babies I wanted to go quickly with my family Dying didnt bother me so muchId never known anyone who died and death was unreal fascinating I wanted Doctor Kildare to have more terminal cancer patients and fewer love affairs What bothered me was the business of immortality Sometimes the growingup sort of concepts germinate slowly but the full impact of death hit me like a bomb in the night Not only would my body be gone  that I could take but I would cease to think That I would no longer be a participant I had realized before now I saw that I wouldnt even be an observer What especially alarmed me about The Bomb always singular like a few years later The Pill was the possibility of total obliteration All traces of me would be destroyed There would be no grave and if there were no one left to visit it Newly philosophical I pondered the universe If the earth was in the solar system and the solar system was in the galaxy and the galaxy was in the universe what was the universe in And if the sun was just a dotthe head of a pinwhat was I We visited a planetarium that year in third grade and saw a dramatization of the sun exploding Somehow the image of that orange ball zooming toward us merged with my image of The Bomb The effect was devastating and for the first time in my lifeexcept for Easter Sundays when I wished went to church so I could have a fancy new dress like my Catholic and Protestant friendsI longed for religion I WAS 8 when Joan Baez entered our lives with long black beatnik hair and a dress made out of a burlap bag When we got her first record we called her Joan Baze thensoon she was simply Joan we listened all day to All My Trials and Silver Dagger and Wildwood Flower My sister grew her hair and started wearing sandals making pilgrimages to Harvard Square I took up the guitar We loved her voice and her songs but even more we loved the idea of Joan like the 15th  century Girl of Orleans burning at societys stake marching along or singing solitary in a prison cell to protest segregation She was the champion of nonconformity and so  like thousands of others  we joined the of her fans I KNEW she must but somehow I could never imagine Jackie Kennedy going to the bathroom She was too cool and poised and perfect We had a book about her filled with color pictures of Jackie painting in a spotless yellow linen dress Jackie on the beach with Caroline and JohnJohn Jackie riding elephants in India and Jackie in a long white gown greeting Khrushchev like Snow White welcoming one of the seven dwarfs No I wasnt betraying Joan in my adoration Joan was beautiful but human like us Jackie was magic When years later she married Rumpelstiltskin I felt like a child discovering in his fathers drawer the Santa Claus suit And later still reading some Ladies Home Journal expos Jacqueline Onassiss secretary tells all  I felt almost sick After the first few pages I put the magazine down I wasnt interested in the fragmenta only in the fact that the glass had broken THEY told us constantly that Oyster River Elementary School was one of the best in the state but the state was New Hampshire and that was like calling a mound of earth a peak because it rose up from the Sahara Desert One fact of New Hampshire politics I learned early We had no broadbased tax No sales or income tax because the antiFederalist farmers and the shoefactory workers who feared the Reds and creeping Socialism acquired their political philosophy from William Loebs Manchester Union Leader We in Durham where the state university stands were a specially hated target a pocket of liberals filling the minds of New Hampshires young with highfalutin intellectual garbage And that was why the archaic New Hampshire Legislature always cut the university budget in half and why my family had only one car secondhand my father taught English at the university And The Union Leader was the reason finally why any man who wanted to be elected Governor had better pledge himself against the sales tax so schools were supported by local property taxes and the sweepstakes which meant that they werent supported very well So Oyster River school But in all the bleaknessthe annual memorizing of Kilmers Trees the punishment administered by banging guilty heads on hard oak deskswe had one fine fancy new gimmick that followed us from fourth grade through eighth It was a white cardboard box of folders condensed twopage stories about dinosaurs and earthquakes and SeeingEye dogs with questions at the end The folders were called Power Builders and they were leveled according to color  red blue yellow orange brown  all the way up to the dreamedfor cheatedfor purple Power Builders came with their own answer keys the idea being that you moved at your own rate and we heard it a hundred times that when you cheated you only cheated yourself The whole program was called SRA and there were a dozen other abbreviations TTUM FSU PQBall having to do with formulas that had reduced reading to a science We had Listening Skill Builders too  more readerdigested minimodules of information read aloud to us while we sat poised stiffly in our chairs trying frantically to remember the five steps SRQPT VWCNB XUSLIN to Better Listening Comprehension A Listening Skill Test would come later to catch the mental wanderers the doodlers the deaf I and most of the others in the Purple groupsolved the problem by tucking an answer key into my Power Builder and writing down the answers making an occasional error for credibility without reading the story or the questions By sixth grade a whole group of us had been promoted to a special reading group and sent to an independent studyconference unit nothing was a room any more where we copied answer keys five at a time and then told dirty jokes SRA took over reading the way New Math took over arithmetic By seventh grade there was a special Development Reading class Mental reading we called it The classroom was filled with audiovisual aids phonetics charts reading laboratories Once a week the teacher plugged in the speedreading machine that projected a story on the board one phrase at a time faster and faster Get a piece of dust in your eyeblinkand you were lost There were ho books in the Developmental Reading room  the lab Even in English class we escaped books easily The project of the year was to portray a famous author one of the 100 greatest of all time I was Louisa May Alcott and my best friend was Robert McCloskey the man who wrote Make Way for Ducklings For this we put on skits cut out pictures from magazines and at the end of the year dressed up I wore a long nightgown with my hair in a bun and got Aplus my friend came as a duck I have never read a book by Louisa May Alcoa I dont think I read a book all that year All through high school in fact I read little except for magazines Though Ive started reading seriously now in college I still find myself drawn in bookstores to the bright covers and shiny powerbuilder look My eyes have been trained to skip nonessentials adjectives adverbs and dart straight to the meaty phrases TVPQM But perhaps in defiance of that whirring black ratebuilder projectorit takes me three hours to read 100 pages IF I had spent at the piano the hours I gave to television on all those afternoons when I came home from school I would be an accomplished pianist now Or if Id danced or read or painted But I turned on the set instead every day almost every year and sank into an old green easy chair smothered in quilts with a bag of Fritos beside me and a glass of milk to wash them down facing life and death with Dr Kildare laughing at Danny Thomas whispering the answersout loud sometimeswith Password and To Tell the Truth Looking back over all those afternoons I try to convince myself they werent wasted I must have learned something I must at least have changed What I learned was certainly not what TV tried to teach me From the reams of trivia collected over years of quiz shows I remember only the questions never the answers I loved Leave It to Beaver for the messes Beaver got into not for the inevitable lecture from Dad at the end of each show I saw every episode two or three times witnessed Beavers aging his legs getting longer and his voice lower only to start all over again with young Beaver every fall Someone told me recently that the boy who played Beaver Cleaver died in Vietnam The news was shockI kept coming back to it for days until another distressed Beaver fan wrote to tell me that it wasnt true after all I got so I could predict punch lines and endings not really knowing whether Id seen the episode before or only watched one like it There was the bowlingball routine for instance Lucy Dobie Gillis Pete and Gladys they all used it Somebody would get his finger stuck in a bowling ball Lucy later updated the gimmick using Liz Taylors ring and then theyd have to go to a wedding or give a speech at the PTA or have the boss to dinner concealing one hand all the while We werent supposed to ask questions like Why dont they just tell the truth These shows were built on deviousness on the longest distance between two points and on a kind of symmetry which decrees that no loose ends shall be left untied no lingering doubts allowed The Surgeon General is off the track in worrying about TV violence I think I grew up in the days before lawmen became peacemakers What carries over is not the gunfights but the memory that everything always turned out all right Optimism shone through all those half hours I spent in the dark shadows of the TV roomout of evil shall come good Most of all the situation comedies steeped me in American culture I emerged from years of TV viewing indifferent to the museums of France the architecture of Italy the literature of England A perversely homebound American I pick up paperbacks in bookstores checking before I buy to see if the characters have foreign names whether the action takes place in London or New York Vulgarity and banality fascinate me More intellectual friends who watch no TV cant understand what I see in My Three Sons Nothing happens they say The characters are dull plastic faceless Every show is the same I guess thats why I watch them boring repetition is itself a rhythm a steady pulse of flashing CocaCola signs McDonalds Golden Arches and Howard Johnson roofs I dont watch TV as an anthropologist rising loftily above my subject to analyze Neither do I watch as some kids now tune in to reruns of The Lone Ranger and Superman in the same spirit they enjoy comic books and pop art for their camp I watch in earnest How can I do anything else Five thousand hours of my life have gone into this box THERE were almost no blacks in our school They were Negroes then the word black was hard to say at first Negro got hard to say for a while too so I said nothing at all and was embarrassed If you had asked me at 9 to describe Cassius Clay I would have taken great liberal pains to be colorblind mentioning height build eye color and shoe size disregarding skin I knew black people only from newspapers and the TV screen  picket lines National Guardsmen at the doors of schools There were few black actors on TV then except for Jack Bennys Rochester It was easy in 1963 to embrace the Negro cause Later faced with cold stares from an allblack table in the cafeteria or heckled by a Panther selling newspapers I first became aware of the foct that maybe the little old lady didnt want to be helped across the street My visions of blackandwhitetogether look to me now like shots from To Sir With Love If a black is friendly to me I wonder as other blacks might if hes a sellout I HAD no desire to scream or cry or throw jelly beans when I first saw the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show An eighthgrader would have been old enough to revert to childhood but I was too young to act anything but old So mostly we laughed at them We were in fifth grade for Goldwater you were against them Equally earnest Republicans would expound the domino theory and I would waver in spite of myself what they said sounded logical knowing there was fallacy somewhere but saying only If my father was here hed explain it  A friend and I set up a campaign headquarters at school under a huge All the Way With LBJ sign The tough kids snickered at that  all the way was reserved for the behavior of fast girls in the janitors closet at dances The pleasure we got from our LBJ headquarters and its neat stacks of buttons and pamphlets was much the same as the pleasure I got five years later manning the Support your Junior Prom bakesale table in the lobby at school I liked playing store no matter what the goods And I believed then in the power of dissent and the possibility for change I wrote protest songs filled with bloody babies and starving Negroes to the tune of America the Beautiful I marched through the streets of town a tall candle flickering in ray hand surrounded by college kids with love beads and placards what they said seems mild and polite now I remember it was all so beautiful I cried but when I try to recapture the feeling nothing comes Like a sharp pain or the taste of peach ice cream on a hot July day the sensation lasts only as long as the stimulus ASK us whose face is on the 5 bill and we may not know the answer But nearly everyone my age remembers a cover of Life magazine that came out in the spring of 1965 part of a series of photographs that enter my dreams and my nightmares still They were the first shots ever taken of an unborn fetus curled up tightly in a sack of veins and membranes with blue fingernails and almost transparent skin that made the pictures look like double exposures More than the moon photographs a few years later that grotesque figure fascinated me as the map of a new territory It was often that way with photographs in Lifethe issue that reported on the In Cold Blood murders a single picture of a boy falling from an airplane and another of a woman who had lost 200 pounds I remember the faces of victims and killers from seven or eight years ago while the endless issues Rome and nature studies are entirely lost Photographs are the illustrations for a decade of experiences Just as when we think of Alice in Wonderland we all see Tenniels drawings and when we think of the Cowardly Lion we all see Bert Lahr so when we think of Lyndon Johnsons airborne swearingin as President in 1963 we have a common image furnished by magazines and when we think of fetuses now those cabbages we were supposed to have come from and smiling goldenhaired cherubs have been replaced forever by the cover of Life Having had so many pictures to grow up with we share a common visual idiom and have far less room for personal vision The movie versions of books decide for us what our heroes and villains will look like and we are powerless to change the cameras decree So while I was stunned and fascinated by that eerie fetus where is he now I wonder and are those pictures in his family album Im saddened too knowing what it did to me If I were asked to pinpoint major moments in my growing up experiences that changed me the sight of that photograph would be EIGHTH grade was groovy When I think of 1966 I see pink and orange stripes and wild purple paisleys and black and white vibrating to make the head ache We were too young for drugs they hadnt reached the junior high yet but we didnt need them Our world was psychedelic our clothes and our makeup and our jewelry and our hair styles were trips in themselves It was the year of the gimmick and what mattered was being noticed which meant being wild and mod and having the shortest skirt and the whitest Yardley Slicker lips and the dangliest earrings We all pierced our ears that year You can tell the girls of 1966theyre the ones with notquitehealedover holes in their ears Ive kept my Seventeen magazines from junior high vinyl skirts paper dresses Op and Pop Sassoon haircuts Patty Duke curls and body painting My own clothes that year would have glowed in the dark I remember one a poorboy top and mod Carnaby Street hat a silver microskirt and purple stockings Pantyhose hadnt been invented yet among our other distinctions call us the last generation to wear garter belts I recall an agonizing seventhperiod math class in which 10 minutes before the bell rang my front and back garters came simultaneously undone It was as if wed just discovered color and all the shiny sterile things machines made possible for us Now we cultivate the natural homemade look with earthy colors and frayed lumpy macrame sashes that no one would mistake for storebought But back then we tried to look like spacemen distorting natural forms Nature wasnt a vanishing treasure to us yetit was a barrier to be overcome The highest compliment the ultimate adjective was unreal I CAN understand the Jesus freaks turning dopemuddled to a life of selfdenial and asceticism The excesses of eighthgrade psychedelia left me feeling the same way and I turned in 1967 to God To the church at least anxious to wash away the bad aftertaste of too many Cokes and too much eye shadow The church I chose the only one conceivable for a confirmed atheist wasnt really a church at all but a dark gray building that housed the Unitarian Fellowship They were an earnest liberalminded sociallyconscious congregation numbering 35 or 40 If I had been looking for spirituality I knocked at the wrong door the Unitarians were rationalistsscientists mostly whose programs would be sfide shows of plant life in North Africa or discussions of migratory labor problems We believed in our fellow man We tried Biblereading in my Liberal Religious Youth group sitting on orange crates in a circle of four but in that mildewed attic room the Old Testament held no power We gave up on Genesis and rapped instead with a casual college student who started class saying Man do I have a hangover We tried singing one soprano two tenors and a tonedeaf alto draped in shabby black robes designed for taller worshipers After a couple of weeks of singing we switched wisely to what Unitarians do best to the subjects suited to orange crates We found a cause We discovered the Welfare Mothers of Americaone Welfare Mother in particular She was an angry militant mother of eight no husband in the picture who wanted to go to the national conference in Tennessee and needed someone to foot the bill I dont know who told us about Mrs Mahoney or her about us In one excited Sunday meeting anyway the four of us voted to pay her way and never having earned 4 without spending it never having met Peg Mahoney we called the state office of the Unitarian Church and arranged for a 200 loan Then we made lists allocated jobs formed committees as well as committees can be formed with an active membership of four and half dozen others who preferred to sleep in on Sundays We would hold a spaghetti supper all proceeds to go to the Mahoney fund We never heard what happened at the welfare conferencein fact we never heard from our welfare mother again She disappeared with the redplaid suitcase I lent her for the journey and the new hat we saw her off in Our 200 debt lingered on through not one but three spaghetti suppers during which I discovered that theres more to Italianstyle fundraising dinners than redandwhite  checked tablecloths and Segovia records Every supper began with five or six helpers as more and more customers arrived though fewer and fewer LRYers stayed on to help By 10 oclock when the last walnutsized meatball had been cooked and the last pot of spaghetti drained there would be two of us left in our tomatospotted red aprons while all around religious youth high on red wine sprawled and hiccupped on the kitchen floor staggering nervously to the door every few minutes to make sure their parents werent around I never again felt the same about group activityunited we stand and that wonderful feeling I used to get at Pete Seeger concerts singing This Land is Your Landthat if we worked together nothing was impossible After the debt was paid left LRY which had just discovered sensitivity training Now the group held weekly nonverbal communication sessions with lots of hugging and feeling that boosted attendance to triple what it had been in our old savetheworld days It seemed that everybodys favorite topic was himself MARIJUANA and the class of 71 moved through high school together When we came in as freshmen drugs were still strange and new marijuana was smoked only by a few marginal figures while those in the mainstream guzzled beer It was called pot then  the words grass and dope came later hash and acid and pills were almost unheard of By my sophomore year lots of the seniors and even a few younger kids were trying it By the time I was a juniorin 1969 grass was no longer reserved for the hippies basketball players and cheerleaders and boys with crewcuts and boys in blackleather jackets all smoked And with senior year maybe because of the nostalgia crazethere was an odd liquor revival In my last month of school a major bust led to the suspension of half a dozen boys They were high on beer Now people are saying that the drug era is winding down Its those statisticians with their graphs again charting social phenomena like the rise and fall of hemlines I doubt if its real this abandonment of marijuana But the frenzy is gone certainly the excitement and the fear of getting caught and the worry of where to get good stuff Whats happened to dope is what happens to a new record you play it constantly full volume at first Then as you get to know the songs you play them less often not because youre tired of them exactly but just because you know them Theyre with you always but quietly in your head My position was a difficult one all through those four years when grass took root in Oyster River High I was on the side of all those things that went along with smoking dopethe clothes the music the books the candidates More and more of my friends smoked and many people werent completely my friends I think because I didnt Drugs took on a disproportionate importance Why was it I could spend half a dozen evenings with someone without his ever asking me what I thought of Beethoven or Picasso but always in the first half hour hed ask whether I smoked It becamelike hair length and record collectiona symbol for who you were and you couldnt be all the other thingsprogressive and creative and freethinkingwithout taking that crumpled roll of dry brown vegetation and holding it to your lips You are what you eator what you smoke or what you dont smoke And when you say like  you know youre speaking the code and suddenly the music of the Grateful Dead and the poetry of Bob Dylan and the general brilliance of Ken Kesey all belong to you as if in those three fuzzy mumbled words youd created art yourself and uttered the wisdom of the universe IN my junior year I had English and algebra and French and art and history but what I really had was fun It was a year when I didnt give a thought to welfare mothers or war or peace or brotherhood the big questions in my life were whether to cut my hair and what the theme of the Junior Prom should be I left my hair long We decided on a castle Looking back on a year of sitting around just talking and drinking beer and driving around drinking beer and dancing and drinking beer and just drinking beer I can say Ah yes the postWoodstock disenchantment the postChicago postelection apathy the rootlessness of a generation whose leaders had all been killed  But if thats what it was we certainly didnt know it Our lives were dominated by parties and pranks and dances and soccer games We won the state championship that year Riding home in a streamertrailing yellow bus cheering Were Number One it never occurred to us that so were 49 other schools in 49 other states It was a time straight out of the goldfrsh   with a difference We knew just enough to feel guilty like trick  or  treaters nervously passing a ghost with a UNICEF box in his hand We didnt feel bad enough not to build a 20  foot cardboard  andcrepepaper castle but we knew enough to realize as we ripped it down the next morning Grecian curls unwinding limply down our backs that silver  painted cardboard and tissuepaper carnations werent biodegradable I HAD never taken Womens Liberation very seriously Partly it was the looks of the movement that bothered me I believed in all the right things but just as my social conscience evaporated at the prospect of roughing it in some tiny village with the Peace Corps so my feminist notions disappeared at the thought of giving up eye liner just when Id discovered it Mediavulnerable I wanted to be on the side of the beautiful graceful people and Womens Libbers seemed  except for Gloria Steinem who was just emerging  plain and graceless Womens Lib was still new and foreign suggestingto kids at an age of stillundefined sexuality  things like lesbianism and bisexuality We hadnt mastered one how could we cope with the possibility of two Besides male chauvinism had no reality for me In my family two girls and two girlloving parents  females occupied a privileged position My mother and sister and I had no trouble getting equal status in our household At school too girls seemed never to be discriminated against I wonder if Id see things differently going back there now Our class was run mostly by girls The boys played soccer and sometimes held office on the student council  amiable figureheads but it was the girls whose names filled the honor roll and the girls who ran class meetings While I would never be Homecoming Sweetheart  I knew that I had power in the school Then suddenly everything changed A nearby boys prep school announced that it would admit girls as day students So at 17 in my  year I left Oyster River High for Phillips Exeter Academy The new world wasnt quite as Id imagined Exeter was a boys school Huc venite pueri ut viri sitis in which girls were an afterthought We were so few that to many we appeared unapproachable Like the Exeter blacks the Exeter girls moved in gangs across the campus ate together at allgirl tables and fled after classes to the isolated study areas allotted to them The flight of the girls angered me I felt newly militant determined not to be intimidated by all those suits and ties and all the ivycovered education I wasnt just me anymore but a symbol of my sex who had to prove to 800 boys used to weekend girls at mixers that I could hold my own I found myself the only girl in every classturned to occasionally by a faculty member rccustomed to mantalk and asked to give the female point of view It makes one suspicious paranoid Why was I never asked to give the Scorpios viewpoint the myopics the half  Jewish right  handed New Hampshire residents Was being female my most significant feature The subject of coeducation gets boring after a while I wanted to talk about a book Id read having just discovered that reading could be fun or a play I was inand then somebody would ask the inevitable Whats it like to be a girl at Exeter I became a compulsive overachiever joining clubs and falling asleep at the typewriter in the hope of battering down doors I was used to having open at my old school where they knew me Here someone else was the newspaper editor the yearbook boss the actor the writer I was the girl All of first semester I approached school like a warrior on the offensive a selfproclaimed outsider Then in the ceasefire over Christmas I went to a hometown New Years Eve party with the people Id been romanticizing all that fall when I was surrounded by lawyers sons The conversation back home was of soccer games I hadnt been to and a graduation I wouldnt be marching in The school had gone on without me I was a preppie SOMETHING strange got into the boys at Exeter that year as if along with the legendary saltpeter something like lust for the country was being  into the nightly mashed potatoes It wasnt just the overalls with a tie on top to meet the dress code or the country music that came humming out of every dorm ExoniansJonathan Jr and Carter 3ds Latin scholars and mathematicians with 800s on their college boardswere suddenly announcing to the collegeplacement counselor that no they didnt want a Harvard interview not now or ever Hampshire maybe thats the place where you can go and study Eastern religion or dulcimermaking But many werent applying any placethey were going to study weaving in Norway to be shepherds in the Alps deckhands on a fishing boat ormost often  farmers After the first ecological fury died down after Ehrlichs Population Bomb exploded thats what we were left with Prep school boys felt it more than most perhaps because they more than most had worked their minds at the expense of their hands And now their heads full of theorems and declensions they wanted to get back to the basicsto the simple honest uncluttered life where manure was cow s not bovine waste Exeters return to the soil took the form of the farm project a group of boys who got together sold a few stocks bought a red pickup truck and proposed for a spring project that they work a plot of schoolowned land a few miles out of town The country kids I went to Oyster River with grown up now and working in the shoe factory or marriedthey would have been amused at the farming fairy tale In March before the ice thawed the harvest was already being planned The faculty objected and the project died and mostnot allwent on to college in the fall They talk now from a safe distance about the irrelevance of Spenser and the smell of country soil and freshcut hay A friend who really did go on to farming came to visit me at school this fall He looked out of place in the dorm he put his boots up on my desk and then remembered he had cow dung on the soles He laughed when I reminded him about the farm project Its best they never really tried I think That way in 10 years when theyre brokers theyll still have the dream tomatoes big as pumpkins pumpkins big as suns and corn thats never known the touch of GENE McCARTHY must have encountered blizzards in 1968 and mill towns like Berlin N Hwhere I went to campaign for George McGovern last Februarymust have smelled just as bad as they do now But back in 68 those things made the fight even more rewarding because in suffering for your candidate and your dreams you were demonstrating love But now in 1972 theres nothing fun about air so smelly you buy perfume to hold under your nose or snow falling so thick you cant make out the words on the Yorty billboard right in front of you No one feels moved to build snowmen Campaigning in New Hampshire was work Magazines and newspapers blame the absence of youth excitement on McGovern and say he lacks charismahe isnt a poet and his bumper stickers arent daisy shaped But I think the difference in 1972 lies in the canvassers this years crusaders seem joyless humorless A highschool junior stuffing envelopes at campaign headquarters told me that when she was youngwhat is she nowshe was a Socialist Another group of students left after an hour of knocking on doors to go snowmobiling Somebody else getting on the bus for home said This makes the fifth weekend Ive worked for the campaign and I was suddenly struck by the fact that wed all been compiling simi lar figureshow many miles wed walked how many houses wed visited In 1968 we believed and so we shivered in 1972 we shivered so that we might believe Our candidate this year is no less believable but our idealism has soured and our motives have gotten less noble We went to Berlinmany of usso we could say I canvassed in New Hampshire the way highschool kids join clubs so they can write Im a member of the Latin Club on their college applications The students for McGovern whom I worked with were engaged in a businecs deal trading frostbitten fingers for guiltfree consciences 1968s dreams and abstractions just dont hold up on a bill of sale THE freshman womens dorm at Yale has no house mother We have no checkin hours or drinking rules or punishments for having boys in our rooms past midnight A guard sits by the door to offer as they assured us at the beginning cf the year physicalnot moralprotection All of which makes it easy for many girls who feel after highschool curfews and dating regulations suddenly liberated The first week of school last fall many girls stayed out all night every night displaying next morning the circles under their eyes the way some girls show off engagement rings We all received the Sex at Yale book a thick black pamphlet filled with charts and diagrams and a lengthy discussion of contraceptive methods And at the first womens assembly the discussion moved quickly from coursesigningup procedures to gynecology where it stayed for much of the evening Somebody raised her hand to ask where she could fill her pill prescription someone else wanted to know about abortions There was no standing in the middle any moreycu had to either take out a pen and paper and write down the phone numbers they gave out or stare stonily ahead implying that those were numbers you certainly wouldnt be needing From then on it seemed the line had been drawn But of course the problem is that no lines no barriers exist Where five years ago a girls decisions were made for her she had to be in at 12 and if she was foundin with her boyfriend  today the decision rests with her alone She is surrounded by knowledgeable sexually experienced girls and if she isnt willing to sleep with her boyfriend somebody else will Its peergroup pressure 1972 style  the embarrassment of virginity EVERYONE is raised on nursery rhymes and nonsense stories But it used to be that when you grew up the nonsense disappeared Not for usit is at the core of our music and literature and art and in tact of our lives Like characters in an lonesco play we take absurdity unblinking In a world where military officials tell us We had to destroy the village in order to save it Dylan lyrics make an odd kind of sense They arent meant to be understood they dont jar our sensibilities because were used to non sequiturs We dont take anything too seriously these days Was it a thousand earthquake victims or a million Does it matter The casual butchersoperation in the film MASH and the comedy in Vonnegut and the album cover showing John and Yoko bareback are all part of the new absurdity The days of the Little Moron joke and the elephant joke and the knockknock joke are gone It sounds melodramatic but the joke these is life Youre not supposed to care too much any more Reactions have been scaled down from screaming and jellybeanthrowing to nod ding your head and maybeif the music really gets to you and musics the only thing that does any more tapping a finger We need a passion transfusion a shot of energy in the veins Its what Im most impatient with in my generation  this languid Idantgive  a s ism that stems in part at least from a culture of putons in which any serious expression of emotion is branded sentimental and oldfashioned The fact that we set such a premium on being cool reveals a lot about my generation the idea is not to care You can hear it in the speech of college students today cultivated monotones low volume punctuated with fourletter words that come off sounding only bland I feel it most of all on Saturday morning when the sun is shining and the crocuses are about to bloom and walking through the corridors of my dorm see there isnt anyone awake IM basically an optimist Somehow no matter what the latest population figures say I feel everything will work outjust like on TV may doubt mans fundamental goodness but I believe in his power to survive I say sometimes that I wonder if well be around in 30 years but then I forget myself and speak of when Im 50 Death has touched me nowfrom Vietnam and Biafra and a car accident that makes me buckle my seat beltbut like negative numbers and the sound of a dog whistle too highpitched for human ears its not a concept I can comprehend I feel immortal while all the signs around me proclaim that Im not We feel cheated many of usthe crop of 1953which is why we complain about inheriting problms we didnt cause Childhood notions of justice reinforced by Perry Mason linger on Why should I clean up someone elses mess Who can I blame Were excited also of course I cant wait to see how things turn out But I wish I werent quite so involved I wish it werent my life thats being turned into a suspense thriller When my friends and I were little we had big plans I would be a famous actress and singer dancing on the side I would paint my own sets and compose my own music writing the script and the lyrics and reviewing the performance for The New York Times I would marry and have three children they dont allow us dreams like that any more and we would live rich and famous donating lots to charity of course and periodically adopting orphans in a house we designed ourselves When I was older I had visions of good works I saw myself in South American rain forests and African deserts feeding the hungry and healing the sick with an obsessive selflessness I see now as selfish in the end as my original plans for stardom Now my goal is simpler I want to be happy And I want comfortnice clothes a nice house good music and good food and the feeling that Im doing some little thing that matters Ill vote and Ill give to charity but I wont give myself I feel a sudden desire to buy landnot a lot not as a business investment but just a small plot of earth so that whatever they do to the country Ill have a place where I can goa kind of fallout shelter I guess As some people prepare for their old age so I prepare for my 20s A little house a comfortable chair peace and quietretirement sounds tempting 
Bergen Ethical Culture Weighty Despite Size,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/23/archives/bergen-ethical-culture-weighty-despite-size.html,SADDLE BROOK  The Ethical Culture Society of Bergen County may be pititully small in numbers Steven Jacobs said last week but it sure packs a lot of weight Mr Jacobs is president of the American Ethical Union which ends today Its 64th annual fourday national assembly at tne Marriott Motor Hotel here The Bergen County Society is one of 25 ethical culture groups throughout the nation that make up the Union But its 200 members have an edge on the others President Jacobs has been a member of the Bergen Society for 20 years and lives in nearby Paramus In his presidential address to the Union on Thursday Mr Jacobs ticked off some of Bergens recent accomplishments These included the spark that started the Fair Housing Committee of Bergen County establishment of a local branch of the Fortune Society which aids exconvicts and the opening of an investigation of the County Childrens Shelter that touched off reforms that are still in progress under the aegis of Jerseys Board of Freeholders On a broader scale he recalled for the members that the Ethical Union and its societcs supported nonrestrictive abortion opposed Federal aid to private schools fought capital punishment pleaded for fair treatment of minorities on television and founded visiting nurse facilities free kindergarten and child study associations We are here he told the delegates to affirm for ourselves that Ethical Culture whatever its numbersis an important idea  one by which we have decided to give direction to our lives The union claims a membership of 5000 across the country The New York society with about 1500 is the largest of the 25member unit A highlight of the Saturday dinner dance was the presentation of the Unions ElliottBlack Award to Capt Aubrey M Daniel 3d prosecutor at the trial of Lieut William Calley Captain Daniel wrote the nowfamous letter rebuking President Nixon for intervening on Calleys behalf after a jury of officers had found the lieutenant guilty of killing civilians at My Lai Captain Daniel said at the time how shocking it is that so many people across the nation have failed to see the moral issue that it is unlawful for an American soldier to summarily execute unarmed and unresisting men women children and babies The award given to the prosecutor is named for two leaders of the New York Society for Ethical Culture the late John Lovejoy Elliott and Algernon D Black Mr Black was a delegate to the meeting here The American Ethical Union grew out of the ethical culture movement established by Felix Adler in 1876
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/23/archives/-health-lawyers-the-poor-have-a-friend-in-court.html,WASHINGTONIf Federal law assures that the poor are entitled to adequate legal services in courts why arent they entitled to adequate medical services in hospitalsespecially those built with Government moneycare facilitieshave over the past 25 years received 37billion in Federal funds to either build or expand or renovate Viewed another way more than onethird of the nations hospital capacity was constructed with HillBurton money including many facilities in rural areas and economically depressed states For three years this apparent social contradiction has been explored in minute legal detail with a minimum of publicity by a battalion of public interest attorneys operating in 25 states and the District of Columbia They have filed a blizzard of legal papers against hospitals nursing homes and state and Federal agencies to force compliance with laws stretching back a century and more Last week the lawyers won their first major victory although one that may take several years to filter down to the Institutions and people it affects The opening victory could even leadat the farthest extremeto the complete redefinition of the public responsibilities of doctors and hospitals The Department of Health Education and Welfare issued regulations ordering 6308 health care institutions including half of the nations hospitals that have received Federal construction funds under the HillBurton Act to dispense a vaguely defined minimum level of charity care These facilitiesgeneral hospitals mental hospitals public health centers rehabilitation institutes and longterm care facilitieshave over the past 25 years received 37billion in Federal funds to either build or expand or renovate Viewed another way more than onethird of the nations hospital capacity was constructed with HillBurton money including many facilities in rural areas and economically depressed states In addition to dispensing Federal largesse however the act also directed the institutions to provide a reasonable volume of hospital services to persons unableto pay if the financial burden to the hospital was not too great The HEW regulations left it to the states to assure that the institutions were complying with the law The public interest attorneys say that the financial and compliance loopholes may delay implementation of the new rules But at the very least they insist the regulations established a basis for legal action if an institution fails to provide the minimum services The HEW regulation followed the filing of five law suits by public interest legal groups in West Virginia Florida Louisiana Colorado and the District of Columbia A Federal district court here this week will hear another legal action whose outcome might be even more farreaching in its impact on the provision of charitable services than the HillBurton funds issue In this case the public interest groups will challenge the right of the Internal Revenue Service to grant under section 501C3 of the tax code tax exemptions to nonprofit hospitals which do not provide free medical services to people unable to pay for them The legal theory is that taxexempt charitable organizations should indeed be charitable The combined effect of the two cases assuming the HEW regulations withstand possible court tests and the public interest legal groups win the tax case would be to force more than 90 per cent of the nations hospitals to provide minimum levels of charity care The exceptions would be the 750 profitmaking hospitals but even these eventually may be forced to give charity care by a series of suits being constructed now The legal theory here is that a proprietary forprofit hospital must be licensed to open Ergo it owes an obligation to the people in the area whose government issues the license Officials of the American Hospital Association have contested the HEW regulation and fought the challenge to the IRS exemption for hospitals They contend that most hospitals already are providing a large amount of free careno statistics are availableand that forcing them to give more is financially unrealistic in view of the budgetary troubles of many Hospital officials Federal bureaucrats and judges have tended to look upon the public interest lawyers as troublemakers The main groups involved have been the National Health and Environmental Law Program at UCLA the Health Law Project at the University of Pennsylvania and group at the law school of the University of Miami In dozens of other suits they have attacked abortion reform laws as being too restrictive challenged state medicaid laws for providing too few services complained that minority groups ranging from Aleuts in Alaska to Zunis in New Mexico are receiving discriminatory levels of health care and sued to end secrecy at HEW and protested interpretations of the Medicare program that have ousted the elderly from nursing homes offering a high level of care While the tactics have yet to be worked out future legal challenges could include forcing individual doctors to provide minimum charity care The rationale might be either that many physicians have received Federal funds to underwrite their training or that if they are to retain the privilege of practicing a hospital aided by Federal funds they would have to dispense a minimum level of charitable services RICHARD D LYONS

where another man waits with another car Everything all right the tall man asks All set I think well make it on time Plenty of time We dont have to be there till 10 This center of vehicular attention is Perry Belmont Duryea Jr 50 years old Speaker of the New York State Assembly the states most influential Republican after Governor Rockefeller and a man mentioned almost every time his name appears in print as the possible successor to Rockefeller in 1974 With him his wife Betty Waiting with cars for them and the others in their party his chauffeur and his publicrelations man Robert E Spearman an exTVnews executive Destination Skidmore College 35 minutes away in Saratoga Springs for a speech to an education conference Skidmore also the alma mater of Mrs Duryea class of 44 who is along not to hear her husband give yet another speech although will be a special one for her but to visit her former art teacher I T will be an ordinary day for the Speaker a day begun at 6 AM in his home on the wintry beachfront of Montauk a busy day of limited significance a day in which no lightning would be forked a day of two speeches a day to enhance a public image shape some law make a little news Bob Spearman drives with me in the front the Duryeas riding in back Had the Speaker heard that Earl Brydges Republican majority leader of the Senate had been hospitalized with the flu No says the surprised Speaker he hadnt heard But Earl hasnt been well he adds He hasnt been well at all Brydges 66 a wellliked Niagara Falls Irishman who controls the Senate more by friendships than programs has been a Senator since 1948 and his power is secure But long ago it was clear he had reached his political apogee He served 17 years before achieving power first as minority then majority leader Perry Duryea made the climb quicker elected Assemblyman in 1960 minority leader in 1966 Speaker in 1969 In three years as Speaker he has given the Assembly an image far more vivid than that of the Senate Brydgess absence will only intensify the contrast Bob Spearman drives onto the Adirondack Northway and heads north while the Speaker halfglasses on nose studies crib cards for his speech Betty Duryea recalls her Skidmore days amid Saratoga history the old mansions the track where Skidmore girls could never go the lore of Diamond Jim and Richard Canfield She majored in art and has just made an esthetic contribution to the state helping to choose 600 paintings that will eventually hang in the new legislative office building in Albany Spearman turns off the Northway onto Saratogas Union Avenue the street of the race track and old elms and of Yaddo the Spencer Trask mansion now an artists and writers retreat There it is Betty Duryea says pointing to one of Yaddos structures barely visible through the trees We did our courting on the lawns and in the old boathouse Perry carved our initials Then Yaddo is gone and the Speaker is climbing the steps of Skidmores new music building to be greeted by the Chancellor of the State University Skidmores president and the State Education Commissioner When his turn comes the Speaker wearing dark blue suit black and gray rep tie longcollared white shirt steps to the dais with crib cards One hand in trouser pocket and the other free for gestures he begins with a reference to the courtship of his wife in the early nineteenforties while he was at Colgate Initials carved at Yaddo Third upright post on the east side of the building He fiscalizes the courtship When four fellows came up with 14 apiece the decision at 130 PM Friday was go  threehour trip by car from Colgate to Skidmore  60cent spaghetti dinner at Fuscos  skiing 3 for a party of eight  Sunday two whisky sours at 35 cents a copy sixcourse steak dinner for 150 at the New Worden  And what would that cost today Tuition rise at the State Univer sity If that happens it must be accompanied by scholar  incentive programs for low  income families Tuition rise at City University of New York as the Governor suggested Not likely in an election year Aid to private schools The legislative mood is inclined to help Building funds Schools in trouble Downturn Close with a gag The talking computer is asked by a skeptic Where is my father Fishing on Saratoga Lake Its a fake my father is buried in Plattsburg Ask it again OK Wheres my mothers husband Answer In an attractive Plattsburg graveyard  but your father is still fishing at Saratoga Laughter Always leave em laughing The speech will make news for the Speaker by predicting no CUNY tuition rise has upstaged the Governor The Associated Press will write yet another article on the strained RockefellerDuryea relationship Back in the car as an old dorm comes into view Betty Duryea remembers a famous night Perry saying good night to her through the screen and a crazy night watchman taking a shot at him Nostalgia Aging Betty Duryea says to her husband What a long full circle from those beer picnics on Yaddos lawn And to come back there 30 years later td the podium The past Pride The future SINCE his entry into politics he has been called a man in a hurry His success has been rapid and uninterrupted but instead of a sharp image he has created a blur few people can clearly assess a composite of labels fiscal watchdog legislative reformer heartless reactionary courageous progressive archenemy of New York City ambitious opportunist flaming moderate A clear ideology is lacking He has not defined the conservatism that most people associate him with as has say New Yorks Senator James Buckley and so the accusation of nondescript powermongering sticks to him Political activists in New York City see him as one of the major Albany enemies maltreating the city But some Manhattan legislators admit their constituents really know him only slightly better than they know Lieut Gov Malcolm Wilson And they call him Malcolm Who These legislators themselves are friendly to the Speaker and avoid knocking him personally a bit of protocol about which a poetic insider remarked You have to expect that here This is the peaceable kingdom where the lion and the leopard sit down together and share the antelope Legislative reform is said by his boosters to be Duryeas main achievementrestructuring the Assembly to give it greater sophistication power and autonomy increasing its independence of the executive branch Others see it as merely transient style change written on the water And Democrats see very little change at all The spoils system prevails Democratic bills and amendments get scant attention and usually fall victim to a GOP party vote and the new Assembly research staff of which Duryeas people are so proud does no work for Democratic Assemblymen People can think hes genuinely doing things in the areas of reform Democratic Assemblywoman Mary Ann Krupsak a fiery upstate feminist said in an interview but he still uses it for the perpetuation of partisan politics Hes dangerous because hes slick He knows all the angles on imagebuilding on PR stuff he looks attractive and hell do just enough to give people the suggestion that hes opening up the system when the real guts the hardcore stuff that would really make the system work in a democratic way hes not touched at all Some high points of the Speakers legislative career suggest the ideological blur which confuses people about his aims He sponsored the Environmental Bill of Rights now part of the State Constitution He worked hard for the 18yearold vote He earned the Humanitarian Award from the New York Kidney Foundation for his legislation since emulated by 30 states creating the Kidney Disease Institute He has perennially backed increased aid to education his main interest He cast the tiebreaking vote that legalized abortion But he also presides over a legislative body which seems consistently to punish the poor and nearpoor all but repealing the pioneering Medicaid program cutting welfare drastically Duryea masterminded the legislation decontrolling some New York City rents only to see them recontrolled as inflationary by the Nixon freeze and so on During the past three years Stanley Steingut leader of the Assemblys Democratic minority said in an interview weve seen the great influence of reactionary members in the Legislature I dont like to be personally critical of the Speaker but he must bear the responsibility for what this Legislature produced I believe weve gone back 20 years ONE thing is clear about the confusion the Speaker has generated it reflects the contradictory concerns of his Suffolk County constituency Suffolk has had the largest numerical population growth of any county in the state and possibly the nationup almost half a million since 1960 to 112 million This year it will gain because of population shift three new Assembly seats the same number New York City will lose Suffolk is a traditionally Republican enclave by al most two to one at the far end of Long Island a bedroom community for New York a summer resort heavily agricultural potatoes and ducks dominantly middle class 50 per cent Catholic and probably the most conservative county on the New York City periphery The hordes of exNew Yorkers who have come there to live rule of thumb 50000 newcomers each year bring with them city concerns and allegiances to the Democratic party Many are willing to buy Republicanism if it will hold down taxes provide good schools and fend off the crime drugs filth traffic snarls pollution and racial tension they fled the city to avoid The result is a new agenda that conforms to neither the xenophobic antigovernment rural conservatism which was the prevailing Suffolk ideology not so long ago nor to urban liberalism which was the perennial threat Suffolk Republican leaders assess the hybrid agenda as moderate Republicanism but there are too many rightleaning concerns  restrictive zoning fiscal austerity sentiment against social programsfor it to carry a moderate label In 1971 the Suffolk GOP barred their party candidates from accepting Conservative endorsement  because the Conservatives had grown too strong Conservative resentment over this development could threaten Duryeas own political future Suburban Conservatism is a more apt description It finds adherents in any area trying to homogenize the suburban squire and the urban refugee And since one of the most visible political translations of the problem and prejudices of this odd lot is at the moment Perry Duryea his gubernatorial wagon rolls and rolls and rolls THE speculation is that if Rockefeller serves until 74 Duryea is a natural for the nomination But an enduring rumor has the Governor manager of the 1972 Nixon campaign in New York ready to accept a Cabinet job or a flashy equivalent should Nixon win and offer same This would put Malcolm Wilson more conservative by reputation than Duryea in the Governors chair for the unexpired part of the term and a DuryeaWilson fight would be likely Duryea downplays his candidacy and says he hasnt even discussed it with his wife Whatever happens will be decided in large part by factors beyond my control he said in an interview I couldnt even be an effective leader in the Assembly if the Republicans felt the only concern I really had was to further my personal career A lot of people say Youre stupid you should start raising money If Im stupid Im stupid Im just not going to get into that kind of thing The immediate focus is on keeping an Assembly majority this year for a reversal of only five votes would sweep Duryea back into the politically fell void of minorityism The Presidential election could affect the outcome The memory is still vivid of 64 when Lyndon Johnsons landslide carried away both Speaker Joseph F Carlin and Senate Majority Leader Walter J Mahoney and gave the Democrats both houses for the first time since 1935 The Republicans regained the Senate in 65 but it was four years before they took back the Assembly When they did it was with help from the new Conservative partyabout a dozen and a half crossendorsements they were then glad to get Perry Duryea came to power in this starboardtilting ship Was it because he was a conservative in his heart Emmet OBrien a Gannett newsman who has covered the Capitol for 27 years looks askance at such questions about political animals I suppose hes closer to Nixon than Rockefeller or Kennedy but all this is subject to change Irving Ives came up here as a red hot conservative and through upheavals got leadership He went to the U S Senate as a Republican liberal The Albany Day 4 PM IN the anteroom of the Speakers office at the Capitol the crush is on Just about everybody except maybe the bored assistant secretary who is selling chances on 200 glass elephant is waiting to see Perry Sitting beside Loretta Pelkey Perrys principal secretary Assemblyman Pete Biondo of Westchester hums a tarantellatempo tune while Loretta peruses a song sheet Pete writes the annual Duryea musicale a spoof of Assembly doings aimed at intensifying esprit de corps among the toooften spiritless boys You like the song You recognize it Pete asks Its nice Loretta says Its Italian Pete says and he laughs fortissimo Pete is very fond of his own musicales even before they happen Loretta smiles politely and goes back to work The crowd grows Now four Assemblymen are waiting to see the Speaker and Henry Mund the short baldish exbottledgas executive who is Duryeas righthand man looks at his watch A meeting of the Speakers staff is already 15 minutes overdue and what is keeping him Henry opens the door to Perrys inner sanctum to discover no Perry He went out the other door Henry says shrugging Hes on the rostrum ON the dark wooden rostrum which rises out of the well of the opulent Assembly chamber where 79 Republicans and 71 Democratic Assemblymen three members are women transact business Perry Duryea gavel in hand stands tall and lean 6 foot 2 195 pounds a sartorially conservative paradigm for his staff smiling his milliondollar smile even though he claims hes only a halfmillionaire his silver hair giving him the image of a gray eminence and also a nickname The Silver Fox This disciplined presence on this late winter afternoon a month and a half into very slow session moves to rostrums edge to welcome Alaskas U S Senator Democrat Mike Gravel who has just been introduced from the floor and is now being escorted to the rostrum steps by Stanley Steingut This guy Stanley is telling the Senator about Perry is quite a fisherman you know Gravel has no chance to make fishing talk Perry says hello then slams the gavel powerfully perhaps therapeutically certainly uninhibitedly and authoritatively against the wooden block He occasionally breaks both gavel and block in this manual power display The lawmakers cough and haruumph into respectful silence I used to be a Speaker myself Senator Gravel says We had the same kind of pandemonium He says he also knew the value of brevity and so he hopes only that the great national problemtaxescould be solved through Federal revenuesharing and urges the New York Legislature and Congress to work together toward that Duryea a skeptic about Federal revenuesharing becoming a 1972 reality has said in his Skidmore speech that the Governors 197273 budget was still 400million out of balance implying that to the extent that it counted on this amount in Federal revenue the document was either inept or gullible And as Senator Gravel moves down the rostrums steps the Speaker advises him and the rest of his listeners in a most ironic tone Senator whenever youre prepared to send the revenue were prepared to receive Laughter Always leave em laughing Exit Perry back to his office And to the rostrum comes Republican Assemblyman Neil Kelleher an extroverted and quickwitted Irishman from Troy who has become known as the assistant speaker Technically there is no such animal but Kelleher earned the title because hes so often chosen among others as Perrys surrogate to mediate debate Behind the Speakers door Duryea can follow floor debate via loudspeaker An aide said that when he hears trouble he makes it to the rostrum in about three seconds The assistant speaker frees the Speaker for other legislative and political business This is very unlike the style of the previous Speaker Anthony J Travia who ruled from 1965 through 1968 and is now a Federal District Court Judge Travia used the rostrum as an office as well as a Speakers platform Manhattan reform Democrat AI Blumenthal the Assembly minority whip recalled that Perry did start out in Travia style When he was first elected he never left the ros trum It was as if when he went to the john somebody would take his chair And Tony he never left He went beyond the control of nature Tony never left the rostrum period Perry himself says this about Travias work habits Hed be on the rostrum all day then take home 300 bills at night and sit with two people in his hotel room and work from 8 oclock till 3 in the morning As chairman of the Rules Committee he along with those two aides actually considered 3000 bills a year and reported them to the floor Thats not the legislative process in my mind That work should be done in the committees with the people who represent the entire state making the decisions rather than a very tight group But saying that doesnt mean Tony wasnt a great and constructive force in his own way The Albany Day 430 PM THE Speaker sits behind his large orderly desk half glasses again on the nose looking over the agenda for the meeting while his highsalaried staff assemblesAl Roberts 38900 June

26000 expenses The staff settles into tan leather chairs and sofas around the large goldcarpeted office the walls of which reflect the Speakers interests a print of four lobstermen in a small boat hauling a net out of calm waters a map of the Bahamas where he plays and also has a partinterest in 100 acres eight paintings of duck heads and ducks in flight and on the window sill a carved woollen duck He begins the rundown of the meetings agenda a bistate commission on coastline control a way to get homebuilding money for the Poospatuck and Shinnecock Indians of Suffolk now excluded from Federal mortgage money child abuse a package of five bills screened by Charlie Webb and bearing the Speakers name I dont think we have any technical problems on the bills if they satisfy Charlie says the Speaker but shouldnt we touch base with the Judicial Conference What were doing is tampering with the courts Narcotics  anything new Not much Perry Henry Mund says What about a conference of Narcotics Guidance Councils The council idea originated in 1969 as an alternative for parents of young addicts and preaddicts to turning Junior over to the police came from Mund and became Duryea legislation Now 420 councils exist Im a little leery of bringing that many people here the Speaker says Cant we send a letter out A letter will be sent Environmental conservation Congress may pull back 15million in matching funds for beach erosion since the Governors budget didnt mention it The Environmental Commissioner the Speaker says claims he can scratch around and find a quarter of a million Court reform Where are we Charlie A package of bills in process  Program bills from the Governor Very light Phil Bisceglia says Only what was in the message   Nofault insurance One thing we have to watch here the Speaker says Johnny McCarthy Assembly Insurance Committee chairman went to investigate the Massachusetts plan which is not so great as reports in the press indicate They saved on one end Bisceglia says but collision went up 38 per cent So maybe there shouldnt be a nofault bill yet If we only saved 10 per cent itd be something the Speaker says plus the cutback on the court calendar that would result Its a step forward Im firmly convinced we have to take one step in New York this year Were still piggybacking on Massachusetts And I dont want to see the Senates bill come to this house at the end of the session with no Assembly input THE Speakers concern that Assembly inputeasily the must overworked word in the Duryea campbe fin all major legislation be it original bills or amendments has earned him the designation of autocrat cool organized efficient ubiquitous administrator legislator and taskmaster His ability to stay abreast of it all touch what he wants to touch is ascribed to a prodigious memory a talent for quick comprehension and instant decision But such control is a progression from quite another Perry Duryea the fledgling Speaker whom Al Blumenthal remembers watching from the other side of the aisle in 1969 He was very uptight very thinskinned If you challenged his rule he got very sore His face would turn red and hed rule me out of order and end up trying to punish our side Willful Duryea politicking goes back to Perrys greatgrandfather Charles Duryea a Queens Democratic Assemblyman in 1864 Beaten by seven votes in a reelection bid he traveled to Albany anyway for the 1865 session sat at his old desk and wouldnt leave the chamber Seven sergeantsatarms carried out him and his desk and that was that for greatgranddad Perrys Brooklynborn father settled in Montauk after World War I and eventually bought into a fishing business He won a State Senate seat in 1942 and later was Gov Thomas E Deweys Conservation Commissioner Perry Jr after graduating from Colgate with a BA in economics in 1942 joined the Navy and became a lieutenant commander flying PB2Y transports He married Elizabeth Ann Weed of Bronxville in 1944 and fathered two children Perry 3d like father Colgate grad is about to enter Columbia Business School and Lynn 25 like mother an art major is now finishing masters at NYU In 1946 Perry took over the family seafood business emphasizing lobsters During Assembly sessions he attends it largely by proxy and on weekends In the summer he usually gives it more attention This year however after Assembly adjournment at the end of April or early in May he will also be a heavy campaigner since all Assemblymen are up for crucial reelection But the business hardly suffers from the political distractions Perry B Duryea and Son Inc is one of the East Coasts largest lobster distributors with an annual volume of 15 million pounds at 175 HE debuted in politics at the town level in East Hampton prospered by leading the move to oust Suffolks GOP leadership in the late nineteenfifties during avast political scandal He campaigned for the Assembly in 1959 using car and plane and won The plane he now has twinengine Piper Aztec let him live in remote Suffolk and still commute swiftly to Albany It also streamlined his image and advanced his career Carlino named him Assembly campaign chairman and from 1964 to 1968 he flew back and forth across the state to aid sagging campaigns Legislative reform a hohum issue at best gained prominence in the 68 campaign and when Duryea took over as Speaker in 69 he gave it priority He cut back the 38 standing committees most of them irrelevant under Travia to 21 put them to work yearround and established the research staff to help them A reverse reform was Duryeas removal of the electronic voting machine Travia had installed in 1967 for 250000 Travia used it only once Duryea also tried it but both found it an enemy Duryeas reason for removal was cost and slowness but what the machine really meant said Al Blumenthal was the end of guys staying for the roll call and the first part of Mondays calendar then taking off and for the rest of the week being marked present and voting The reform that worked better than anyone anticipated and that ushered in The Era of the Auditor was the restructuring of the Ways and Means Committee to wage fiscal war on the Governor A special commission advised Ways and Means it should review revenues as well as expenditures in the Governors budget And so when the 197172 budget of 845billion arrived Ways and Means was ready with both revenue and expenditure analysts and what they turned up sent Al Roberts director of the budgetprobing scurrying to Duryea We told him Roberts says that the Governors revenue estimates could not possibly be met Roberts found the governments growth rate far exceeding revenue growth That was when Roberts recalls having been with him five years I thought I was watching the Speaker indicate a course of action totally at odds with the request of the Governor To say the least Ways and Means reattacked the budgetwith a meat ax the Governor saidand on March 4 recommended cuts that eventually came in at 756million axing almost everything Medicaid welfare school aid mental hygiene health Rockefeller unleashed some Cabinet members to retaliate but only the Mental Hygiene Commissioner Dr Alan D Miller drew blood He wrote every legislator that if 49million was cut from his department as planned many patients could not receive needed treatment many would be poorly cared for some would die Apparently Dr Miller said with adverbial innocence during an interview those last three words were political dynamite Press public and Perry Duryea thought so The Legislature has its prerogatives the Speaker says in not entirely tranquil recollection of that fight and if people want to confront us they have to recognize they may be getting into open war Duryea called Miller mad as hell Miller recalls Who did I think I was doing a thing like that He said thered been problems in my department and that the Legislature was going to look into them One source claims Duryea was so angry he told Miller hed see to it that his department got nothing A special new Assembly subcommittee was formed and promptly turned Mental Hygiene inside out with hearings Cuts of 35million not 49million were made generating vast layoffs Public protests and the media focused on mental hospitals the horrible example being Willowbrook State School for the Retarded on Staten Island Duryea in a total turnaround recently told a newsman that he urged Ways and Means to reorder priorities this year and find an additional 10million to 20million for Mental Hygiene SLASHES in the current budget were forestalled in January when Democratic votes were needed to pass the Governors 407million tax package In return for their votes Democrats demanded that spending for education and social programs not fall below given levels The Governor and Earl Brydges agreed but Perry Duryea only went along to a degree The tax program went through however Al Blumenthal admits to being confused by the Speakers role in the tax negotiations He allowed his party to divide and refused to take sides Im not sure where that leaves him as a leader And on the budget cuts Blumenthal adds I dont know whether he led that or merely allowed the cuts to occur In the first three years he developed himself as a strong leader but in terms of where he is taking his troops no direction ever became clear to me What is certain is that Duryea approved initially of the cuts and then a deadlock developed between upstate conservative Republicans who wanted even further cuts and downstate suburban moderate Republicans who resisted Without compromising too much with the Democrats Duryea persuaded armtwisted and tradedoff with all his Republican colleagues until hed patched 76 votes together to pass the modified budget R EMEMBER one of Perrys friends says he grew up in Montauk a cold remote place People thought of him that way aloof independent His speeches were said to lack warmth and humor He was deficient one writer said in bonhomie But his peers see him then as now as a mans man and a swashbuckling typeHemingway stuffa warm witty companion on the hunt the sail the voyage aboard his converted lobster boat a sailor who harpoons sharks a pilot who flies friends to Maryland for a shoot a hunter who sits for five hours in a duck blind when the temperature is 5 below The closer you get to Montauk the more Suffolk County looks like New England street in Bennington sometimes or maybe Stockbridge A lot like Cape Cod including the shingles but with more space You come to what seems like the thinning out of a settled area and then a Cadillac dealer looms up One night club advertises music by the Baggy Knees Live Band and the Red Onion offers Banjos Banjos Ban jos Real estate is the business to be

Trouble Going east to Montauk the world in winter truly does thin down Soon you are riding along the desolate Old Montauk Highway the beach right there alongside you rich with beautiful Japanese black pine planted years ago to hold off erosion You pass an inn where in summer you can rent a cottage for two for 50 a day and then a few houses up the road the mailbox says Spindrift This is the Duryea house It is ranchstyle designed by Betty Duryea built on an acre of land nine years ago at a cost of 50000 but worth much more now It sits on the crest of a sandy hill that slopes down to the beach Beyond the snowcovered dunes and the dead brown beach grass easy breakers roll up strips of foam to match the snow on the beach and a solitary white gull stands at thee waters edge a readymade symbol for the Speaker who flies into Montauk from Albany sometimes just for the day just to be alone on that beach This gregarious solitary enters his living room in gray flannel trousers opencollared shirt

follows a rambling conversationinterrupted by a lobster dinner cooked by Betty Duryea succulent modified Newburg without eggs or cream The talk immediately clarifies small curlicue in the blur and reinforces what hed said about the governorship But it goes beyond that suggesting that restlessness may be the element that explains Perry Duryea as a man for whom lateral questing is survival one place one thing one thought unrelieved deadens the life of the day A friend has said he couldnt picture Perry Duryea outside politics but that is because the high promise of the mo ment suits the Speakers need But let a Democratic upset toss him back Into the minority or let Rockefeller abdicate and Malcolm win the primary leaving the once upwardbound lobsterman only the long wait for 78 and

THE ABORTION LAW SCORED BY RABBIS,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/24/archives/the-abortion-law-scored-by-rabbis-orthodox-council-urges-the-repeal.html,The Rabbinical Council of America the largest organization of Orthodox rabbis in the country called yesterday for the repeal of New York States abortion law which permits abortion on demand in the first 24 weeks of pregnancy A statement unanimously adopted by the councils 80member policymaking executive board declared that abortions had already assumed epidemic proportions in the state In New York City alone the Council said over 200000 unborn children have been aborted since the liberalized law went into effect in July 1970 Most of these abortions are dictated by considerations of convenience not of health and the murder of these fetuses is a reflection of the hardening of human sensitivities characteristic of our age 900 Rabbis Belong More than 900 rabbis in both the United States and Canada are members of the Rabbinical Council With its statement yesterday the Orthodox group aligned itself with the Roman Catholic Church which has been actively campaigning for repeal of the abortion law Most major Protestant denominations favor liberalized abortion laws Reform Judaism has been outspokenly in favor of the liberalized law while Conservative Judaism has taken no stand apparently because of division within its own ranks Purpose Stressed The Orthodox statement emphasized that the council was not seeking to impose strict Jewish law upon society in general As regards members of our faith the statement declared our own spiritual leaders are conducting an avid campaign of enlightment What does perturb us however is the general deterioration of moral values in our society of which permissive abortion is a significant symptom No woman is the final arbiter about the disposition of her body and the embryonic human life flourishing therein the statement said Doctors too must face up to the moral dilemma whether they can play havoc with the basic worth and dignity of human life when they freely perform abortions at all stages of pregnancy
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/25/archives/-and-if-it-succumbs.html,To the Editor Supporters of New Yorks current abortion law say that it leaves the question of abortion a private moral decision while forcing no one to submit to an abortion In the South before the Civil War slavery was equally a private moral decision No white man who disapproved of slavery was required to own slaves Unfortunately this freedom of choice was not extended to the slaves No one asked them if they wanted to submit to slavery Similarly no one asks unborn children if they want to submit to being killed by abortion MARTIN W HELGESEN Malverne L I April 18 1972
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/25/archives/if-right-to-life-prevails-.html,To the Editor The present push on the part of Right to Life Knights of Columbus and similar groups to repeal New Yorks present abortion law would make sense only if that law required women to have an abortion Since all the law does is permit those women who wish them to have abortions by physicians it leaves entire freedom of choice to all women in this state If the opponents of the present law were to prevail there would be denial of freedom of choice and denial of conscience to those women who want abortions Moreover our past experience indicates that denying legal abortions to women who desire them will not result in substantially fewer abortions but will merely substitute illegal and dangerous abortions for safe and healthpreserving abortions A repeal of the present law would throw New York back decades in terms of personal liberty and public not to seek abortions for themselves Such a backward step would be unconstitutional and unconscionable HARRIET F PILPEL Vice Chairman American Civil Liberties Union New York April 19 1972
Revision of State's Mental Health Law Gets Final Approval by the Assembly,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/25/archives/revision-of-states-mental-health-law-gets-final-approval-by-the.html,ALBANY April 24  The Assembly voted final approval this evening of the first broad revision of the state mental health law in 45 years The measure is designed to strengthen the civil rights of mental patients and insure improved treatment its proponents said Some critics questioned whether the bill was strong enough to accomplish reform but it was approved by a vote of 133 to 1 and sent to the Governors office where favorable action is expected The one negative vote came from Herbert A Posner Democrat of Queens who asserted that health officials would receive too much budgetary power under the new law The 280page bill produced after two years of hearings and research provides for three advisory committees  in the areas of mental illness mental retardation and alcoholism to advise the Commissioner of Mental Hygiene It also shortens the permitted periods of time during which patients may be detained without court order or hearing and curtails censorship of patients mail New Council Involved The floor sponsor Martin Ginsberg Republican of Nassau said the bill provides that no change in the rules of the Mental Health Department could be made without first submitting it after public notice to a new council on mental hygiene composed of 10 persons appointed by the Governor from outside the department The bill produced by a joint legislative committee led by Senator Dalwin J Niles Republican of Johnstown also provides that Interest on patients funds no longer be used by the department but be held for individuals that patients be permitted to correspond with lawyers and public officials without censorship and that consent of a patients relatives be obtained before shock treatment is administered Both houses of the Legislature put in longer days than usual as members talked of pushing toward adjournment but no sense of urgency was apparent Most of the dozens of bills considered were relatively limited in scope with several bankingoriented measures suffering defeats and delays ini the Assembly as critics decried latesession special interest bills Beer Pricing Bill Defeated Beer was the headiest subject of debate in the Senate After passing with no debate a bill prohibiting advertising the prices of beer the Senate recalled the measure as it was on its way to the Governors office and defeated it 3519 The bill had passed as many measures do here because virtually none of the Senators had bothered to read it Then Senator Tarky J Lombardi Jr of Syracuse a Republican had it recalled and charged the bill was an attempt at price  fixing Senator Nicholas Ferraro of Queens a Democrat defended the measure saying it was designed to protect beersellers who could not make profit as supermarkets do by selling beer cheaply as advertised lossleaders Do you know the difference between beer and eggs Senator Lombardi asked One you drink the other you eat Senator Ferraro said winning the laughs but not the votes of most of his colleagues Other actions included the following CITY PRIMARY Senate Majority Leader Earl W Brydges revived temporaily at least a bill providing for a twocandidate primary runoff for citywide offices in New York City Mr Brydges Republican of Niagara Falls had removed the bill from consideration on Friday Today without explanation he placed it back on the active Senate agenda eligible for debate and a vote The measure has already been approved in the Assembly ABORTION PROTESTS A half dozen opponents of the states liberalized abortion law disrupted a formal dedication of the courtroom and justices chambers in the vast South Malls new Justice Building The protesters seeking repeal of the law permitting a woman to have an abortion on demand up to 24 weeks of pregnancy stood up in the audience and shouted things such as there have been 500000 deaths in New York State we urge you to repeal this horrible law the group was escorted out by the Capitol police and the ceremony including a speech by Governor Rockefeller continued MAXIMAXI PRISON A spokesman for the State Department of Correction said that reports from Attica that the states controversial maximum program maximum security prison would be created out of a wing at Attica were very premature The spokesman said a number of issues had to be resolved before a site for the socalled maximaxi facility was announced by the department ATTICA AFTERMATH The Assembly approved and sent to the Senate a bill by John E Kingston Republican majority leader from Nassau County that would provide college tuition for the children of prison guards firemen and policemen killed in the line of duty The measure estimated to cost 350000 was prompted by the uprising at the Attica Correctional Facility in which hostage guards as well as inmates were killed It also covers the children of civilian employes of prisons ENVIRONMENTAL BOND ISSUE Henry L Diamond the states Commissioner of Environmental Conservation said that a proposed 12billion bond issue for environmental projects for the next five years had been trimmed to 115billion by conservation chairmen in the Senate and the Assembly The revision meant the deletion of funds for such things as fish hatcheries education centers and ski centers Mr Diamond said adding that he agreed with the changes BALLOT SPOT A bill that would move legislative candidates higher on the ballot placing them above judicial contests was put aside until tomorrow after debate Some members said it would be good because it would mean 15 to 20 per cent more voter interest on long ballots Others said the bottom line was more of a standout position than midballot And Dominick L DiCarlo RepublicanConservative of Brooklyn said the bill was too much of a special interest measure for the body to consider it fairly

Governor Urges Change To 16‐Week Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/26/archives/governor-urges-change-to-16week-abortions.html,ALBANY April 25Governor Rockefeller said today that he favored amending the states abortion law to shorten the period in which such operations may be legally performed The Governors recommendation fell far short of the total repeal of the liberalized law that has been demanded in recent weeks by predominantly Roman Catholic groups Mr Rockefeller said he did not favor repeal of the law which was drastically revised two years ago But he said I would approve an amendment to reduce the period during which an elective abortion may be legally performed from 24 weeks to 16 weeks After nearly two years experience under the states abortion law and consultation with the State Health Department and the State Public Health Council I have coneluded that a modification in the present law is desirable he said If the Legislature adopts this modification I will give it my approval Prospects for legislative approval of such an amendment were not clear tonight as few of the legislators had read Mr Rockefellers statement or had time to sound out their constituencies But some legislative observers felt that the Governors action made it politically difficult for the lawmakers not to take up the issue All but a few of the 207 senators and assemblymen are seeking reelection this fall and some of them face primary elections in June But thus far in the 1972 legislative session bills to repeal the law have been locked in committee The present law permits abortion regardless of whether pregnancy or birth would affect the womans health The old law permitted abortion only if the mothers life was endangered by the pregnancy In recent weeks supporters of abortionlaw repeal said they were confident they could win floor fight on the issue Opponents of repeal were admittedly worried that the law might be revised if the matter went to the floor Blumenthal Disturbed I am sbocked and deeply disturbed to note the Governors efforts to encourage those who would destroy New Yorks abortion law said Albert H Blumenthal the deputy leader of the Democratic minority in the Assembly Mr Blumenthal was the author of abortionlaw liberalization in the late nineteensixties This action on the part of the Governor Mr Blumenthal said is nothing more than political move to placate the forces who are seeking total repeal of the abortion law The issue of abortion is a medical decision to be made by a woman and her doctor What the Governor is saying is that women should be once again forced to backroom illegal and unsafe abortions
ALBANY AWAITS AN ABORTION BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/27/archives/albany-awaits-an-abortion-bill-measure-expected-to-bar-operation.html,ALBANY April 26Governor Rockefellers proposal to shorten the period in which legal abortions may be performed will be introduced in the Legislature this week informed sources said today The legislation is expected to embody the Governors suggestion that the period for legal abortions be reduced to fall within the first 16 weeks of pregnancy from the 24 weeks stipulated in the present law However prospects for the legislation were still unclear as legislators waited to hear from their home districts on the issue The Rockefeller amendment to the abortion law a law that was vastly revised and liberalized two years ago was considered to have a better chance of passage in the Senate than the Assembly But because the abortion issue is a politically delicate one and most of the 207 legislators are seeking reelection in the fall there is likely to be maneuvering over which house considers the bill first Neither house wants to be the first to pass a controversial bill and risk the political consequences only to have the other house kill the measure and effectively escape liability Objections Cited Opponents of the Rockefeller amendment said that the measure would suit neither those who wanted total repeal of the present law and a return to the stricter statute that was revised nor those who wanted the liberalized law left untouched Albert H Blumenthal the Manhattan Democrat and deputy minority leader of the Assembly said that if the Governors proposal were made law one of every eight women seeking a legal abortion would be deniedone He said that in New York City legal abortions had been performed at the rate of 220000 a year since the law was revised in 1970 that the new law had reduced illegal abortions by more than 50 per cent arid that the number of illegitimate births had also declined Mr Blumenthal led the fight that revised the old law which permitted abortion only when the mothers life was in danger State Senator James H Donovan a Republican of Chadwicks and one of the leaders of the movement to repeal the present law said he did not know whether he would vote for the Rockefeller amendment He said he would rather have both a repeal and the Governors bill approved and sent to Mr Rockefeller The Governor has said he would sign only an amendment shortening the abortion period to 16 weeks Governor Rockefeller was said today to have moved toward compromise on the abortion dispute after consultation with the Republican legislative leaders But the 16week proposal was said to be the Governors not that of the Senate majority leader Earl W Brydges of Niagara County or Assembly Speaker Perry B Duryea of Montauk

Assembly Approves Bill Aimed at Unruly Students,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/28/archives/assembly-approves-bill-aimed-at-unruly-students.html,ALBANY April 27  The Assembly gave overwhelming approval today to a bill requiring highschool students to pass citizenship and characterdevelopment requirements to qualify for diplomas The bill sponsored by Assemblyman John A Esposito RepublicanConservative of Queens would require students to show performance and growth in the vital areas of character and citizenship development in addition to passing a designated number of school subjects to earn a highschool diploma The bill which passed by a vote of 101 to 19 now goes to the Senate During debate on the measure Mr Esposito said that it was needed for a punitive leverage in dealing with unruly students Opponents of the bill said that unruly students would be indifferent to the threat and that the requirement could be used unfairly by school administrators who were displeased with civilrights protesters One legislator noted that he had been an activist while in high school and that the principal could have used this measure to keep him from graduating Mr Esposito argued that that school officials had no means to deal with unruly students and could not now put limits on improper antisocial and destructive behavior or hold students accountable for their actions He said that the current situation permits students who have robbed mugged assaulted or been lured into drug use to receive their diplomas along with good students of strong moral fiber In other action the Assembly gave final legislative approval to a bill authorizing the state to create a 115billion environmental bond issue to provide funds for air land and water environmental needs of the state for the next five years The bill which passed by a vote of 140 to 6 wjith no debate now goei to the Governor who is expected to sign it The measure would then be submitted to the votes in a

projects Funds would be used for sewage treatment plants and for upgrading heating plants and incinerators in public facilities Funds would also be provided for development of solidwaste management and disposal projects and for additions to the 6millionacre Adirondack Park and to the Catskill preserve Death Penalty Debated The quick passage of the 115billion bond measure was a sharp contrast to the hourslong debate on a controversial bill that would restore the death penalty The debate was heightened by the presence of television cameras and the fact that some of the rhetoric would be good for home consumption during this election year Despite almost constant talk of adjournment which is expected some time next week the legislators seem intent on sidestepping many of the controversial issues on the calendars The Senate passed 60 noncontroversial measures with little or no debate and laid aside 43 bills that would have required some discussion Many of these items and others not yet on the calendar are considered must legislation and include such items as nofault automobile accident insurance revision of the gambling laws amendment or repeal of the states liberal abortion law the siting of power plants and aid to parochial schools Other action here included the following HAZARDOUS TOYS The Assembly gave final approval to a bill prohibiting the sale of hazardous toys after defeating an amendment to make it apply to toys that could be harmful psychologically The measure applies to toys that present an electrical mechanical or thermal hazard POLITICAL ADS The Senate approved and sent to the Assembly a bill requiring candidates for political office in the state to pay the same rates as commercial advertisers for notices in newspapers and magazines The bill would make candidates for local elections conform to regulations already in effect for national candidates WILD RIVERS The Senate gave final approval to a bill designating 160 miles of rivers in the state as wild and scenic areas The bill limits the development of areas near the rivers and permits the state to study an additional 770 miles of waterway for such designation HUNTER COLLEGE SCHOOLS A bill requiring New York Citys Board of Higher Education to maintain elementary and high schools under its jurisdiction was sent to the Governor The only schools affected are Hunter College Elementary

York Knickerbockers and New York Rangers Day The resolution introduced by Senator Manfred Ohrenstein Democrat of the Bronx is designed to memorialize the achievements of the two teams in reaching the championship rounds in basketball and hockey MTA HEARINGS The Senate approved and sent to the Assembly a bill requiring the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to make investigations and hold public hearings in the furtherance of its operations Previously there was merely permissive language in the law CITY LABOR DEBATE A long Assembly debate ended with the shelving of proposed Taylor Law revisions that would have the State Public Employes Relations Board review actions of New York Citys Office of Collective Bargaining in strike cases and take over the duescheckoff penalty from the

Assembly Defeats Death Penalty Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/28/archives/assembly-defeats-death-penalty-bill-limits-retained-on-death.html,ALBANY April 27 After more than five hours of debate the Assembly tonight defeated bill that would have restored the death penalty for most persons convicted of murder The vote on the bill was 65 to 59 or 11 votes short of the number required for passage The measure sponsored by Assemblyman Robert F Kelly RepublicanConservative of Brooklyn would have nullified the virtual abolition of capital punishment by the Legislature in 1965 The defeat of the measure tame after seven years of pressure by some legislators who sought to restore the death penalty mostly because their constituents related the penalty to the problem of crime in the streets It was considered unlikely that the issue would come before the Legislature again this year In 1965 the Legislature voted to confine the death penalty to those who had murdered peace officers acting in the line of duty and to convicts serving life sentences who murdered prison guards or fellow inmates Prior to that time the death penalty could be Imposed for murder treason or kidnapping The death penalty would not be mandatory under the Kelly bill but left to a jurys discretion Opponents of the restoration of the penalty said tonight that the United States Supreme Court was expected to rule on a California Supreme Court decision in February that the death penalty was unconstitutional because it was cruel and unusual punishment There is no comparable decision by a New York court Emotional Debate No convict has been executed in the United States since June 1967 There are 686 prisoners on death rows across the nation The vote in the Assembly came after one of the longest and most emotional debates of the legislative session At one point several Assemblymen jumped to their feet shouting that they had been personally offended At another a frustrated Assemblyman was ruled out of order five of six times for demanding extra time to speak against the bill While the central issue was ostensibly the death penalty other political issues were also obviously involved in the debate The words law and order were used time after time and the deathpenalty issue was compared with the issue of repealing the states abortion law Various sets of statistics were used to argue that capital punishment was or was not a deterrent to murder Neither side attempted to refute the others statistics But the reaction of proponents of the death penalty was instant visceral and violent when Assemblyman Richard N Gottfried Democrat of Manhattan suggested that supporters of the bill would be willing to kill people to get reelected Dont tell me if I support this measure its for a few lousy votes in my district shouted Assemblyman Charles A Jerabeck RepublicanConservative of Bay Shore L I Gottfried Upbraided Assemblyman Burton G Hecht Democrat of the Bronx angrily told Mr Gottfried he should keep your remarks confined to yourselfa request rarely heard or honored in the Assembly Mr Gottfried a small boyishlooking man with shoulderlength blond hair seemed undisturbed He said he did not mean the lawmakers would actually support the bill for purely political reasons but added that if they did they would be trading votes for human lives After he had finished speaking Mr Gottfried was finally told by the presiding officer of the Assembly to respect requests that he refrain from suggesting that an Assemblyman might act without honor A number of Assemblymen said privately that many of their colleagues would vote for the bill precisely because they were afraid of homedistrict action in this falls election when most of the lawmakers will be seeking reelection Asssemblyman J Edward Meyer Republican of Chappaqua said restoration of the death penalty was opposed by Right to Life an organization that has been campaigning vigorously for repeal of the state abortion law on the ground that it permitted legal murder But Assemblyman John T Flack Republican of Queens said the abortion law amounted to murder of the innocents whereas capital punishment would prevent murders

Abortion Law in Danger,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/29/archives/abortion-law-in-danger.html,Extreme pressure in Albany by the antiabortionists now threatens disaster to New York States model abortion reform law The emotion bordering on hysteria with which the opponents of legalized abortion have been seeking repeal of existing law has shaken many legislators who had the courage to enact this reform in the first place and who fully understand its social and humanitarian importance It is essential that the Legislature in these closing days of the session have spine enough to resist the pressure groups seeking to return the state abortion law to the medieval status from which it only recently emerged Abortions have always been available to women upperincome brackets either locally with the cooperation of understanding doctors or in other jurisdictions but they were not previously available to less fortunately situated women in New York The latter were forced by coercive law either to bear unwanted children or to resort to the butcher shops of illegal abortion rings The current antiabortion drive is ironically being mounted just as figures released by the Health Services Administration of New York City attest to the beneficial impact of the recent reform Thus in the first six months of the life of the present law an average of 480 women reported monthly to municipal hospitals suffering from the effects of incomplete illegal abortions in the second six months the monthly average had dropped to 350 women in the third six months to 199 The figures also show that more women have been having more legal abortions earlier reducing the chance of complications The move against abortion reform comes at a time when restrictive antiabortion laws in some other states have been declared unconstitutional in the Federal courts Recent decisions invalidated such laws in both New Jersey and Connecticut partly on the ground that the decision to have an abortion is one properly to be left with the individual woman and her physician And this is all New York States abortion reform law does It does not compel anyone to have an abortion merely affords freedom of choice In contrast the proposals of the antiabortionists amount to coercion the sense that if the law should flatly prohibit abortions it thereby would compel women to bear unwanted children It is this coercive feature that constitutional experts are increasingly finding unacceptable Governor Rockefeller must shoulder some responsibility for encouraging the antiabortionist forces at this session of the Legislature The other day he announced unexpectedly that he would sign a bill modifying the present reform law which permits abortions up to the twentyfourth week of pregnancy The Governor said he was agreeable to a shorter period permitting abortions only up to the sixteenth week of pregnancy In itself such a limitation would be both unwise and Unreasonable It is likely that the Governors rule would most adversely affect the very young the very poor and the most ignorant those too young to know the signs of pregnancy and those too timid to seek immediate medical advice Most abortions are performed before the twelfth week of pregnancy or after the fifteenth week to restrict legal abortion to the first sixteen weeks of pregnancy would thus effectively limit it to the Brat twelve The Governors proposed modification only seems to have encouraged renewed and furious activity on the part of those seeking total abortion reform repeal Neither this kind of modification nor a fortiori outright repeal is acceptable to the people of New York
News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/29/archives/albany-aims-rhetoric-at-voters.html,ALBANY April 28  As this electionyear legislative session nears completion the lawmakers are increasingly dredging up emotional issues to seize the attention of voters and more and more the rhetoric in the Senate and the Assembly is pure and simple politicking In the last week or so at least three volatile issues heretofore quiescent this year in both houses have come to the fore  abortion capital punishment and busing to achieve racial balance in the schools Some lawmakers feel that the sudden revival of these issues is a diversion to veil the fact that the Legislature has done very little that is positive for the voters since it convened in January After all the reasoning goes it just wont do to go back home and have nothing more to talk about at the reelection kaffee klatsches than the fact that taxes were raised The feeling is it wont hurt to go on the record on these touchy issues before the annual frenzied finale that will precede reelection stumping The clearest instance of the impetus provided by the impending elections occurred Tuesday when the Assembly passed a bill to impose a oneyear moratorium on busing Busing a Catchword The issue in the eyes of many is a spurious one There is very little busing for integration taking place in the state and what little there is is primarily voluntary The State Education Department has no absolute figures on the extent of busing but one official said there were no more than about 35000 students in the state who were bused to school for integration purposes But busing has become an electionyear catchword particularly since President Nixon asked Congress to pass a national moratorium on all court orders that would require busing to achieve school Integration And the lawmakers are certainly not above seizing upon a hot political issue regardless of its merits For the Assembly Republi cans the bill was  with one exception  a partisan af firmation of the Presidents pro posal The sole Republican who voted against the measure was Assemblyman Constance E Cook of Ithaca chairman of the Assembly Education Committee A total of 25 Democrats most of whom represent essentially conservative constituencies also voted for the bill I know that all of us are political creatures and we have to do our best for our communities and to get elected and reelected said Assemblyman Samuel D Wright a black Democrat from Brooklyn during the debate on the busing measure Purely Political Then he added This bill is really a message for those people who want to get across a certain point of view A number of Nassau County Democrats voted against the bill and one of them Assemblyman Stanley Harwood alluding to the Republican majorities in both houses called it a purely political tactic to create the impression that a legislative body that has done virutally nothing was hard at work To highlight the political nature of it all Assemblyman Joseph M Margiotta the Nassau Republican chairman who tightly controls his legislative delegation issued a news release denouncing Mr Harwood and three other Nassau Democrats who voted no on the bill  Irwin Landes Arthur Kremer and Eli Wager Speaking for the county Republican delegation Mr Margiotta said the Democrats vote was a sellout of the people of Nassau who have invested their life savings in a home in a neighborhood they picked because it had a good school system And the release went on to say that the Republicans would pursue the Democrats during the election campaign for their no votes on the busing moratorium Another trigger phrase that crops up in election years is law and order And so it was that a week ago the Assembly Codes Committee startled and angered civil liberties groups by bringing to the Assembly floor a bill that would restore the death penalty in most homicide cases Seven years ago the Legislature voted to restrict capital punishment to the murders of policemen and prison guards Assemblyman Robert F Kelly Republican  Conservative of Brooklyn said he had the restoration bill put on the agenda because people are fed up with wanton killings Theres a hue and cry throughout the state and city throughout the country Mr Kelly said His bill was ultimately defeated late last night after five hours of debate But that was almost secondary to what some observers deemed the main purpose of giving the bill an airingthe opportunity for rhetoric complete with glaring television lights and the whirr of TV cameras By far the most emotional issue to have been reignited here is abortion with a move to repeal the states liberalized abortion law which permits a woman to have an abortion on demand up to the 24th week of pregnancy Since its passage in 1970 by the narrowest of margins the new law replacing a 19thcentury statute permitting an abortion only when a mothers life was imperiled has been ceaselessly criticized by the Right to Life group reprenesting mainly Roman Catholics The opponents have been diligent and untiring in tracking down lawmakers who voted for the liberalized law and have spared no effort to call attention to their vote in these legislators home districts Last year attempts to repeal the law were bottled up in committee by a leadership reluctant to revive the fierce debate that accompanied passage in 1970 A New Ball Game But this year is an election year and there are those who support the new law who feel that a repeal bill would carry and the 19thcentury law would be restored if the measure got to the floor of the Senate and of the Assembly As a compromise Governor Rockefeller has paved the way for amendment of the new law by saying he supported limiting abortions to the first 16 weeks of pregnancy He has said he would veto a total repeal of the liberalized measure Politicians here acknowledge that this probably wont pacify the truly stanch opponents of the new law But they hope that amending the law would mollify some of the opponents and permit lawmakers pressed on the issue to be able to say on the hustings that they were partly successful and had taken the first step towards repeal

WASHINGTON,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/30/archives/john-mitchells-democrats.html,WASHINGTON April 29The only logical explanation of the Democratic Presidential campaign so far is that it must have been planned by the Republicans and directed by John and Martha Mitchell If you were running the Republican show and had to try to explain away a savage war you had promised to end a 90billion deficit in budgets you had promised to balance and wage and price controls you swore youd never use what would you do Well first you would obviously hope for some kind of break that would take Teddy Kennedy out of the race Then in the ensuing confusion you would get at least a dozen Democrats to enter the scramble Humphrey to Infuriate the new young voters George Wallace to raise hell on the right and make the Republicans look moderate George McGovern to run on the left and squeeze out Muskie in the center and a couple of dubs like Vance Hartke and Sam Yorty to make the whole opposition look ridiculous A sound Republican strategy moreover would call for so many state primaries that nobody would know where to go or what to skip It would exhaust the survivors bankrupt the Democrats for years and leave the convention to battle before the TV cameras over Humphrey who is opposed by the left and McGovern who is opposed by George Meany and Mayor Daley This is about what has happened only with additional Republican bonuses on the side George McGovern has run an intelligent and determined campaign and has now got to the top of the greasy pole but with a heavy load of promises to slash the defense budget steeply legalize pot and abortion and grant amnesty to the Vietnam expatriates Selling this to George Meany and the labor organization which is about the only effective political organization the Democrats have will not be easy and it will not be very popular either with Many other Democratic candidates who think pot abortion and amnesty are explosively dangerous issues Humphrey has even steeper barriers to jump It would be difficult to overestimate or even explain the passionate opposition to him among many of his former friends and colleagues on the left who are now threatening to put Gene McCarthy or some other thirdparty candidate in the field if Humphrey is nominated He is still a superb campaigner and the most experienced man in the field and he is strong with labor and many of the party leaders but Mayor Daley will never forgive him for blaming the bloody tumult at the last Democratic convention on the Chicago police and while Daleys power has been reduced he will still have some influence at Miami Beach and he can still lose Illinois to the Republicans merely by not cranking up his machine Even Muskie has helped the Republicans by the way he withdrew He was being whipsawed by the two Georges on the right and left and no doubt had to get out of the rest of the primaries but he didnt have to liberate his delegates dump and infuriate his staff or leave the convention in quite such an awkward position Now it will obviously be more difficult though not impossible for a stalemated convention to turn back to him It cannot do so without seeming to defy the whole primary system and with both McGovern and Humphrey at odds with large and powerful forces in the party the pressure for a Kennedy draft is bound to increase even if he says in public what hes now saying in private that hes for McGovern This will not he the kind of convention that can he controlled by a handful of men as has happened often in the past George McGovern has reformed the rules and the larger numbers of young women and blacks arent likely to be brokered and are more likely to break to McGovern than to Humphrey But if neither of these front runners makes it in the first three ballots Meany will very likely join Daley for Kennedy and try to force a draft There is no reason to believe Kennedy would connive at this or even want it to happen but unless McGovern closes with a rush in California and New York which he may very well do the Kennedy clan will be faced with one more crisis in its long and tragic story For Kennedy himself there could be consolations even in defeat For if he ran and lost he would at least get the Chappaquiddick episode behind him and emerge as the titular head of his party at the beginning of his forties Nevertheless whatever happens in the primaries and at Miami Beach the outlook for the Democrats is fairly bleak They have powerful issues in the war and the economy but Kennedy like McGovern and Humphrey has strong opposition within the party and in the country and a KennedyNixon race could easily be the most vicious election of the century So who could have written a scenario like this or even imagined it Certainly no Democrat

Major Bills Still Unpassed As Albany Aims to Adjourn,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/01/archives/major-bills-still-unpassed-as-albany-aims-to-adjourn.html,ALBANY April 30  With major legislation still to be acted upon the 1972 Legisla ture continues its push for ad journment this week after nearly four months of marking time The states 207 lawmakers must still dispose of such con tentious issues as finding a new way to funnel state funds to parochial schools modification or repeal of the states liberal ized abortion law some form of nofault automobile accident insurance a bill dealing with the siting of new electric power plants and a host of other leg islation of statewide signifi cance Before the legislators can go home to begin reelection cam paigns that for many will in volve primary fights they must also act on requests from New York City for bills that would aid the Lindsay administration in balancing its precarious pro posed budget of 99billion To date with some excep tions the Legislature has been a bit like an errant shopper who came home with only des sert for dinner Special Interests Served Many of the bills passed over the weeks have been special Interest measures or bills need gd by specific localities Their enactment enhanced the stand ing of an individual Assembly man or Senator in his locality Traditionally the major bills or a session wait until the long working hours of adjournment in a process that has been dubbed legislation by fatigue One of the key issues facing the lawmakers and one that has grown in importance be cause of a decision by a three judge Federal court last week is aid to parochial schools In 1970 the Legislature passed a bill providing recom pense to parochial schools of 28million a year for man dated services that is for such things required by the state as maintenance of health records In 1971 to augment these funds another law was enacted providing 33million a year to parochial schools to help pay teachers salaries and other costs for secular subjects Both laws were aimed at cir cumventing the strictures in the State Constitution prohibit ing such aid and both were de clared unconstitutional this year by threejudge Federal panels State Plans Appeal The mandated services law was voided last Thursday and although the state has said it would appeal the decision to the United States Supreme Court the Legislature is being pressured to come up with some other way of providing the 61million a year in state aid that the two laws guaran teed The Committee for Public Education and Religious Liber ty known as PEARL which is a coalition of 33 Organizations in New York of civic religious and labor groups has promised to file suit on whatever new method devised by the Legislature and approved by the Governor PEARL initiated the court challenges that resulted in the voiding of the 1970 and 1971 state laws Governor Rockefeller and the leaders of the Legislature are committed to providing aid to nonpublic schools and the fact that it is an election year will probably reinforce that pledge There are a variety of aid bills pending the most recent being legislation proposed by Senate Majority Leader Earl W Brydges Republican of Niagara Falls that would pro vide tax abatements and in cases of lowincome families direct aid to parents whose children attend parochial schools A spokesman for the Gov ernor said the other day that Mr Rockefeller was still con sidering constitutional ways of funneling the funds including Senator Brydgess proposals Comment Is Significant The comment was significant because Mr Rockefeller in the past has reportedly voiced his opposition to any form of di rect aid to parochial school students or their parents and Mr Brydgess bills are in that vein The Governor has said that such aid could result in support of segregated schools and in addition could create a large lobby of Catholic parents who would seek annual increases in such aid Other major items on the agenda before adjournment are the following NoFault Auto Insurance Governor Rockefeller has de clared that some form of no fault automobile insurance would be a priority item of his 1972 legislative program Since that announcement there has been intense lobbying by trial lawyers and others against the nofault concept which would greatly reduce court actions to recover damages in auto acci dent cases At present there are two bills in the Senate one span sored by Senator Bernard G Gordon Republican of Peeks kill and favored by the Gov ernor another sponsored by Republican Senators Thomas Laverne of Rochester and John H Hughes of Syracuse which is generally palatable to law yers but not to consumer  Both these bills have been amended recently but not enough to effect a compromise between Mr Gordon and Mr Hughes and Mr Laverne Meanwhile the Assembly is preparing its own bill and sources close to the negotia tions say the whole issue could collapse in a clash between the two houses

Legislature Backs Formation Of Siting Unit for Power Plants,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/02/archives/legislature-backs-formation-of-siting-unit-for-power-plants.html,ALBANY May 1The Legis lature approved today the crea tion of a power plant siting board that would have full au thority to overrule local zon ing regulations and settle con troversies involving utility en vironmental and community factions The need for such a panel with the power and responsi bility to say yes or no has been cited repeatedly by the Governor as the only way to break the logjam of power plant controversies that has been growing with the publics concern for the environmental issue Meanwhile with the Legisla ture moving toward adjourn ment the Governor was report ed to have agreed with the leaders on a bill creating an 11 member state commission to revise New York Citys Charter [Details on Page 46] In the Assembly most of the debate was on bills that would make homeowners mortgages more expensive One measure which would have increased the insurance premiums of homes bought with relatively low down payments was defeated But Assembly Speaker Perry B Duryea Republican of Mon tauk L I assured final legis lative approval of a bill that would cost homeowners addi tional interest when they sell their houses Assemblyman Har vey Strelzin Democrat of Brooklyn and other legislators of both parties sought to have the bill reconsidered when it passed after cursory debate in which several Assemblymen said they did not understand its provisions Mr Duryea ruled Mr Strelzin out of order and the bill was sent to the Gov ernor The powerplant siting bill a compromise of Governor Rock efellers earlier stalled pro gram bill was passed in the Senate by a vote of 38 to 16 with mainly Democrats opposed The Assembly passed the measure 90 to 44 and the sponsors said they expected the Governor to sign it The siting board would be composed of five members the State Commissioners of Commerce Environmental Con servation and Health the Di rector of the Public Service Commission and a fifth ap pointee of the Governor This last member would be one of 12 regional appointees depend ing upon which region of the state was involved in a partic ular plant application The sponsors of the measure Thomas F McGowan Republi can of Buffalo and Jeremiah B Bloom Brooklyn Democrat contended that they had struck a fair compromise among the factions involved in the in creasingly tough issue They say the legislation no body likes is best Senator Mc Gowan declared and perhaps this is it Only a few Democrats main ly Nicholas Ferraro of Queens and Joseph L Galiber of the Bronx voiced their opposition in debate In particular they complained that the bills pro visions to permit appeals of the boards ruling to the Appellate Division and Court of Appeals were inadequate for the home rule prerogatives communities would lose The bill provides that the boards hearings will be held in the local area under consid eration presided over by the Public Service Commission rep resentative who would have the Environmental Conservation representative as an associate charged to see that there was sufficient rebuttal and cross examination In addition the measure provides 25000 for each plant site application to help localities pay for expert witnesses and consultant re ports to bolster their argu ments Senator Bloom said the need to have an agency to settle site controversies was critical be cause the states power needs would double in the next five years A companion measure which was also approved would establish a 10member legisla tive commission financed with an 85000 budget to take a longrange look at the states power problems In a separate action the Sen ate granted final approval to a bill that would authorize the State Power Authority to con struct a generating plant for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Senator McGowan said this would lessen the MTAs reliance on Consoli dated Edison In response to city Democrats he indicated he expected that the plant would be built upstate but he con ceded there was no bar to build ing it in the city area With the Legislature expect ed to wind up its business in the next week or so the activi ty today included the following ABORTION AMENDMENT Senate Republican Majority Leader Earl W Brydges of Niagara Falls said it would be unrealistic to attempt to pass a total repeal of the liberalized abortion law because the Gov ernor has said he would veto it Mr Brydges supports the amendment proposed by the Governor to reduce the maxi mum allowable time for abor tion from the present 24 weeks of pregnancy to 16 weeks Various womens groups clergymen and proponents of the present law converged on the Capitol Victor Kovner of the Planned Parenthood Asso ciation promised the same kind of primary election threats and lobbying pressure as have been shown by the prorepeal Right toLife faction NOFAULT INSURANCE Unconfirmed reports circu lated that the Senate might take up tomorrow the nofault auto insurance bill supported by the Governor State officials estimate that the amended version by Senator Bernard J Gordon Peekskill Republican would mean a premium savings of about 100million a year to car owners instead of the 300million of the original bill RELUCTANT SAMARITAN The Senate voted final ap proval of a bill that would re quire a motorist involved in an accident to take the other party to a hospital immediately if such a victim requested help or appeared to be in need of immediate help Opponents said the bill providing a felony charge was vague and would force a nonprofessional to ag gravate the victims injuries ADOPTION BILL The Senate gave final ap proval to a measure that would give natural parents 30 days to change their minds after surrendering a child to an adop tion agency A similar bill was vetoed by the Governor last year but sponsors hope for passage with changes designed to define the best interests of the child and to give courts discretion in the 30day out off period This grew out of the Baby Lenore case in which Mr and Mrs Nickolas DeMartias the babys adoptive parents fled to Florida from Brooklyn rather then surrender Lenore to her natural mother MTA PLANS Final passage was voted by the Senate for a bill that would require the Metropolitan Trans portation Authority to inform local government of its plans and provide for a 60day stay for the locality to seek adjust ments PAROLE CHANGE The Senate gave final ap proval to a bill that would elim inate the dual parole standards under which inmates jailed be fore a criminal code liberaliza tion voted four years ago face more stringent requirements than those jailed since NEW CRIME UNIT Creation of a new State Di vision of Criminal Justice by combining three existing agen cies received final approval in the Senate Critics said the bill was hogwash that would only create high salaried jobs ONASSISGALLELA CASE The Assembly defeated a measure lawmakers said was related to the litigation between Mrs Jacqueline Kennedy Onas sis and Ronald Gallela a free lance photographer The bill would have made it punishable by a year in jail or a 500 fine to intimidate a reporter or pho tographer in the pursuit of news Opponents of the meas ure said its provisions were already covered in existing law SUMMER CAMPS The Assembly gave final legislative approval to a bill providing for stricter regulation of summer camps for youth The bill was prompted its sponsors said by evidence of unsafe and unsanitary condi tions in such camps especially on Long Island URBAN POWERS The Assembly passed and sent to the Senate a measure to compel the State Urban De velopment Corporation to con form to local building laws in its projects The measure was attacked as an erosion of power of the UDC which has the authority to override locali ties in some planning areas
Bill to Stop Forest Hills Project Gets Final Passage in Assembly,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/03/archives/bill-to-stop-forest-hills-project-gets-final-passage-in-assembly.html,ALBANY May 2The As sembly gave final passage today to a bill designed to kill the controversial Forest Hills low income housing project The bill passed by a vote of 101 to 35 provides that where projects planned by a housing authority have not progressed beyond the foundation stage within five years of the ap proval by the local legislative body they would have to be resubmitted for review and fur ther determination as to their approval or disapproval The bill takes effect immedi ately However it provides that it is deemed to have been in effect since Sept 1 1971 The Forest Hills project was ap proved in the latter part of 1966 putting it within the five year provision of the bill If the Forest Hills issue comes before the Board of Estimate the board is expected to vote it down and kill the plan for three 24story buildings on the site in the middleclass community In other action the Senate voted to amend the State Con stitution to permit the legaliza tion of new forms of gambling that are now illicit The meas ure now goes to the Assembly where the sponsors are hopeful of passage In another action the Assem bly Codes Committee released a bill to repeal the states lib eralized abortion law even though Governor Rockefeller has said he would veto it Details on Page 18 The housing bill now goes to the Governor who has not indi cated what action he will take However during a news con ference in March he noted that he was against scattersite housing which places low income projects in the heart of middle income areas The Gov ernor said that he favored rehabilitating deteriorating com munities to provide areas where integrated living could be ac complished I think myself for the long pull that you would avoid exactly the kind of conflict which exists now the Gover nor said at that time The community is faced with a very unfortunate intense situation and I cant believe this is going to be in the interests of that community or in the interest of the larger community The Lindsay administration opposed the measure on consti tutional grounds saying it would impair contractual ob ligations with construction con tractors and with the Federal Government In a memorandum opposing the bill the city noted that the normal process of financing lowincome hous ing would be reversed if the bill became law Would Force Many Reviews While sponsors of the meas ure couched their debate in terms of saving the taxpayers money by forcing the City Housing Authority to move more quickly on projects the net effect of the bill would be to force Board of Estimate re view of a number of projects on the drawing boards During the debate which lasted more than an hour op ponents of the bill argued that review of plans by the board would cause a yearlong delay in many projects More than 9000 units of housing in my community will be interfered with noted As semblyman Albert H Blumen thal whose district encom passes the West Side urban renewal area This is one more copycat conservative sham that tells the people they can control what is happening in their community Proponents of the measure said that costs for constructing lowincome projects were sky rocketing while plans lay dor mant in the Housing Authority Assemblyman John T Gal lagher Republican of Queens the sponsor of the bill said that the plans for the Forest Hills project had been changed three times without having been re viewed He said that the Board of Estimate should have the opportunity to review them and determine if the people in the area wanted the project Other proponents of the bill argued that situation and the community had changed since the plans were first adopted and that many of the personali ties who had made the original decisions were no longer in the same positions Other actions here included the following TAX BREAK FOR STEEL The Senate voted final ap proval of a bill that would aid the Bethlehem Steel Corpora tion in Lackawanna by reducing its local real estate taxes by about 24 per cent The meas ure sent to the Governor passed over objections that other troubled corporations would seek similar tax breaks and that the City of Lacka wanna would have to put more of a burden on homeowners The corporation pays the larg est share of the real estate revenues collected by the city JOB LIMITS ON EXCONVICTS The Senate gave final ap proval to a bill sought by the Governor that would permit former convicts to work in stores sellling liquor for off premise consumption Critics said it was not as beneficial as a broader bill passed earlier this session that would permit jobs in restaurants as well ADJOURNMENT Both houses approved a res olution setting 2 PM Friday as the adjournment date of the Legislature Shortly before the designated time the clocks in both chambers will be stopped and the legislators will continue to debate any items still on the calendars Democrats in the Assembly argued against ad journment charging that many important pieces of legislation must still be acted upon EMPLOYES AT MENTAL HOSPITALS The Assembly approved and sent to the Senate a bill requiring that the number of nurses and ward attendants at state men tal hospitals not be reduced be low the number allotted to the institutions at the end of the fiscal year Proponents of the measure said they wanted to assure full staffing even if budgets for mental institutions were cut There were layoffs last year following budget cuts CHLORINATION OR WATER The Assembly gave final ap proval to a bill putting off until 1974 a regulation of the Public Health Council requiring that water obtained from a ground source be disinfected by chlori nation

Two Bills for Aborting,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/03/archives/two-bills-for-aborting.html,Bowing to the antiabortion pressure exerted on them at Albany members of the Assembly Codes Committee yesterday reported a bill that would totally repeal New York States model abortion reform law Still another bill reducing the time limit for legal abortions from the present 24 weeks of pregnancy to but 16 weeks awaits action in the State Senate If the Assembly were to approve total repeal of the existing model abortion law the Senate would then also consider total repeal The Senate bill reducing the permissible time for legal abortions is bad enough it would have its most negative impact on the very young and the very poor those for whom abortion reform has meant the most Total repeal of course would be even worse The value of New Yorks humane abortion reform is already proven The number of dangerous illegal abortions has steadily declined since its enactment This states abortion reform does not compel any woman to have an abortion it leaves the decision where it belongswith the woman and her doctor Those who favor this laws repeal in effect favor compelling women to bear unwanted children
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/04/archives/letter-to-the-editor-2-no-title.html,To the Editor The Right to Life movement seeks the repeal of New Yorks abortion law as an invasion of the right of all fetuses to be born While I find this evades the main issue in abortion legislation  that of a womans rights regarding her body I am willing to take the case presented by Right to Life to ask Which of us ever had a voice in deciding whether or not we were born Who is to say that denying the right to be born is any worse than imposing the fact of being born I am not speaking here only of the afflicted fetuses whose birth will force them into disabled or diseased lives nor just of those whose birth will kill their mothers and who may grow up feeling the guilt of that death nor of those whose birth will psychologically dam age their mothers and who must live with the pressure of that damage nor even of the fetuses which if born will be illegitimate and thus in our society doomed to secondclass status I am speaking of all fetuses of all children born in world If the Right to Life advocates were to campaign for an improvement in the quality rather than the quantity of life so that the world might truly be a beautiful place to be born into and it could be realistically assumed that every fetus would want to be born and live then I would be willing to listen to their arguments on the right to be born Until that time however I think they should consider the possibility that their actions might impose the burden of being born on many unwitting and unwilling fetuses for whom life in the world as it is would be far from a right to be pro tected Teaneck N J April 26 1972

WASHINGOTON,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/05/archives/mcgoverns-dilemma.html,WASHINGTON May 4There has usually been a difference in American politics between the strategy for win ning the primaries and the strategy for winning the Presidency and George McGovern is rapidly reaching the point where he will have to choose between the two He has come to the fore in the Deniocratic primary elections by being plain and definite and attacking the things that are troubling a great many people the war the tax structure unemployment high prices poor bout ing and the staggering cost of military defense and overseas commitments In the procesi he has defied many of the assumptions of American politics that handsome candidates with theatrical TV personalities are the men for this cosmetic age that moderate programs capture the vast majority of voters in the center that powerful wellorganized forces like the socalled labor vote or Catholic vote or black vote are essential to victory In this space the other day I said that Senator McGovern had supported the legalization of marijuana abortion and amnesty for the Vietnam resisters Pierre Salinger the former Kennedy Johnson White House press secretary who is now working for McGovern has since called to say the Senator is for amnesty but not for legalizing pot and not for Federal laws legal izing abortion Instead the abortion question in Mr McGoverns view should be left to patient and doctor and presumably to the widely different state laws So it is important on such controversial issues to set the McGovern record straight Still the questitin remains and it is the main question even after Hum phreys close victories in the Ohio and Indiana primaries Is his obvious sin cerity blunt candor and radical pop ulism good enough for the playoffs against President Nixon in November or only effective in the preliminaries and in the Democratic convention where the young the activist women and the blacks will be more powerful than ever before Obviously this is not the main question on Mr McGoverns mind now He says the main thing is to defeat President Nixon but his immediate problem is to defeat Hubert Humphrey and win the nomination Yet the fur ther he gets out front the more his party and the country have to looks at his programs and it is here that the strategy for the primaries and the strategy for defeating Mr Nixon come into question if not conflict Mr McGovern is for a major redis tribution of the nations wealth and a major reduction in the nations de fense budget He says he would take about 43 billion a year from tax payers making more than 8000 a year and give it to those making less than 8000 He would have anyone making more than 50000 a year pay 75 per cent of the excess in taxes regardless of present tax shelters He would have an annual guaran teed annual income for the poor 4000 for a family of fourand he would cut the defense budget by about 40 per cent by reducing the armed services from 25 million to 17mil lion and by bringing half of the Amer ican troops home from Europe Federal aid to elementary and secondary schools would go up five times to 15 billion and he wants school busing and a federally funded guaranteed sys tem of comprehensive health insurance for all Americans This is only the shorthand of his major proposals and probably makes it all look a little stark but it illus trates both his success in the last few weeks and his prpblem in the next few More than any other candidate he has been specific He has produced a 66 page manual of populist programs which have helped single him out in the primaries as a serious man with a definite intention and a wellorgan ized and enthusiastic staff of young people who want to make fundamental changes in the country But now that he has taken the lead in the Democratic race the question is whether the country as a whole is ready for changes of this magnitude and whether his radical reforms of the tax structure defense welfare housing and health will prevail against the President who is still trying to capture the center Muskie lost and Humphrey is still trying to put together Mr McGovern says he thinks the country is ready for major change and he may or may not be right It is certainly ready after Johnson and Nixon for some plain speaking and the kind of personal integrity that has usually illuminated George McGoverns career but whether it is ready for his programs is another question It should be noted that whatever George McGovern proposes he is no zealot but a very hardminded practical politician and if he gets the nomina tion by being definite and even radical he will no doubt adjust to the realities of fighting Nixon for the center but this will not be easy For the very things that have brought him to the fore in the pri marieshis plainnness and bluntness and specific reformscould be his problem in the fall campaign His argu ment against President Nixon is that the President says one thing and does another and he cannot very well get the nomination on a radical program and then switch to a moderate program without being vulnerable to the charge that he is as wobbly and expedient as the man in the White House
The Record on Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/05/archives/the-record-on-abortions.html,As members of the State Assembly consider a bill repeal New York States model abortion reform law today they would do well to give weight to the statistical record on the estimated 350000 abortions performed in this city since enactment of abortion law reform The record fully substantiates the benefits of reform These are the figures according to Gordon Chase Health Services Administrator maternal mortality rates have dropped 40 per cent infant mortality rates have reached a new low dropping from 244 deaths per 100 births in 1969 to 207 in 1971 outofwedlock births which so often contribute to a growth in welfare rolls have declined 12 per cent the first yeartoyear decline since these figures were collected in 1954 illegal abor tions have declined each sixmonth period showing a drop in the average number of women entering municipal hospitals because of incomplete or botched abortions This is a remarkable record of humane advance that the threatened repeal of abortion law reform would only reverse To ban legal abortions is to encourage illegal abortions it is to deny women of modest financial means the access to abortions by licensed physicians that has always been available to women of greater financial means While abortion reform does not compel any woman to have an abortion its repeal would compel many women to seek the backalleys of illegal abortions or to bear unwanted children

PRESIDENT BARS BIRTH CURB PLANS,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/06/archives/president-bars-birth-curb-plans-rejects-panels-proposals-on-eased.html,WASHINGTON May 5  President Nixon rejected today two recommendations from his own Commission on Population Growth The commission in reports published in March recom mended that all states greatly liberalize abortion laws and permit a doctor to perform an abortion at a patients request The commission also encour aged states to make contracep tive devices and other family planning services widely avail able to teenagers In a written statement issued today after he formally re ceived the commissions final threevolume report Mr Nixon said that he still regarded abor tion as an unacceptable means of population control and that he did not support what he called unrestricted abortion policies As for the widespread dis tribution of contraceptives to minors Mr Nixon said Such measures would do nothing to preserve and strengthen close family relations He did not elaborate The President said that he would place his trust in the American people themselves He said he felt confident that they would make sound judg ments that are conducive both to the public interest and to personal family goals More over he said he retained a firm belief in the right of married couples to make these judgments by themselves Mr Nixons reaffirmation of the right of married couples to determine family size car ried at least to some observers here a faintly ironic ringfor it was precisely this same right on which the commission based its contention that abortion rules should be liberalized Its report said in part The commission believes that the various prohibitions against abortion throughout the United States stand as obsta cles to the exercise of individu al freedom the freedom of women to make difficult moral choices based on their own personal values the free dom of women to control their own fertility and finally free dom from the burden of un wanted childbearing Despite these disagreements the President said he thought the commissions findings and conclusions would be of great value in assisting governments at all levels of public policy He did not however say which provisions he had found to be valuable and it was not imme diately clear how his Admin istration intended to proceed on the commissions sugges tions No Comment on Growth Halt Nor did Mr Nixon comment on the commissions basic pro posal that the United States should slow  and gradually stopthe growth of its popu lation or on another sugges tion that continuing migration out of rural areas he diverted away from larger cities into economically healthier smaller cities The first suggestion runs counter to the notion that pop ulation growth is essential to economic growth the second has many adherents within the Administration The Presidents opposition to the commissions proposals on abortion and the distribution of contraceptive devices was not unexpected On April 3 1971 he revised liberalized abortion rules in military hospitals stat ing then for the first time that he regarded abortion as an unacceptable means of population control Fully aware of the Presidents views the commission carefully explained that it was recom mending new abortion laws not as a means of controlling popu lation but as a means of enlarg ing individual freedom But this did not satisfy many Roman Catholic leaders some con servatives and as it turned out Mr Nixon The chairman of the 24 member commission whose full title is the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future is John D Rockefeller 3d who presented the report to Mr Nixon The report was the result of two years work

CITY‐CHARTER BILL PASSED IN ALBANY,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/06/archives/citycharter-bill-passed-in-albany-would-form-a-state-unit-on.html,ALBANY May 5The Senate gave final legislative approval today to a bill creating an 11 member state commission to re vise New York Citys Charter The bill which has the sup port of the Governor as well as Republican and Democratic leg islative leaders passed by a vote of 40 to 11 after almost two hours of debate The creation of a commission to revise the City Charter would thwart attempts by the five Borough Presidents to have a decentralization plan submitted to the voters in November The Borough Pres idents have agreed on a plan that would in effect restore many of the powers of the office lost when the citys charter was revised in 1961 There were these other legislative actions today Governor Rockefeller sent to the Legislature a bill that would modify the states liberalized abortion law by permitting abortions on de mand only during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy rather than the 24 weeks now per mitted The Assembly approved 12million for reforms and improvements in the state prison system as sought by the Governor Both houses rescinded an adjournment for 2 PM today and voted to adjourn instead at the same hour on Tuesday The Senate turned down an attempt by Senator Ralph Ma rino Republican of Syosset L I to delay adjournment until later in the week The delay had been sought to allow the Legislature to override an expected veto by the Governor of a bill repealing the power of the Metropolitan Transporta tion Authority to construct the RyeOyster Bay bridge across Long Island Sound The Governor vetoed a sim ilar measure last year and an attempt to override it failed The chartercommission measure empowers the Gover nor with the consent of the legislative leaders of both par ties to create a Charter com mission for any city which shall be a temporary state commission The 11 members of the com mission would be appointed as follows three by the Governor two by the mayor one each by the majority and minority lead ers of both houses one by the local legislative majority leader in the case of New York City the City Councils majority lead er Thomas J Cuiteand one either by an agreement of a majority of the Borough Pres idents in New York City or in the case of other cities by the minority leader of the local legislative body The bill approved today says that while a state Charter com mission is in existence no proposal for changing the structure of government shall be submitted to or voted on by the electors of such city ex cept for a plan submitted by the commission Opponents of the Charter commission bill argued that it was a waste of moneyappro priations are expected to be about 300000 for the first yearand would do nothing but create patronage jobs for politicians They said that a commission could be created for each of the 62 cities in the state and that the eventual cost could run into millions of dollars This is just another attempt to look into the affairs of New York City while creating a po lictical boondoggle asserted Senator John J Santucci Dem ocrat of Queens He added that the bill set no limits on the number of consultants the commission could hire nor on the amount of money they could be paid He said that the Scott Commis sion which was created last year to look into the operations of the city has spent some money did some work but to date I have seen no report Other members of the Queens Democratic delegation also ar gued against the measure Don ald R Manes the Borough President of Queens and Mat thew J Troy Jr the county party leader had opposed the creation of the commission Marchi Defends Bill Senator John J Marchi Re publican of Staten Island de fended the measure and said there was a tremendous need to relate the institutions of the city to the needs of the people Senator Jeremiah B Bloom Democrat of Brooklyn who also favored the bill said that the checks and balances in the city dont function and that the Board of Estimate has not acted responsibly all the time Once and for all we should have a study to set up the kind of government in New York City that is responsible to the people Senator Bloom said Other action here included the following PAROCHIAL SCHOOL AID Senator John D Caemmerer Republican of Williston Park L I introduced a resolution calling upon Congress to con vene a constitutional conven tion to delete prohibitions against public aid to parochial schools He said that twothirds of the states were needed to call such a convention DRUNKEN DRIVERS The Assembly rejected a Senateapproved bill that was designed to produce more con victions of persons accused of drunken driving The bill would have reduced the penalty for conviction but removed the de fendants right to a jury trial NYU HEIGHTS CAMPUS Governor Rockefeller and the State Regents endorsed a plan to have the City University Construction Fund purchase the University Heights campus of New York University in the Bronx At the same time dozens of students gath ered here and protested the plan which would turn the fi nancially troubled campus over to Bronx Community College A statement by Herbert Free man chairman of the depart ment of electrical engineering and of an engineering and sci ence faculty committee assert ed that the plan would seri ously damage the academic careers of more than 2400 graduate and undergraduate students But the Governors statement said the plan would strengthen NYUs fiscal in tegrity and preserve the pres ent engineering program by merging it into an enlarged Polytechnic Institute of Brook lyn CON ED INQUIRY The Public Service Commis sion announced it would hold a hearing on the special con tracts between Consolidated Edison Company and various public agencies in New York City such as the Port of New York Authority and Transit Authority In an earlier decision the commission ordered Con Ed to absorb an 118million defi ciency resulting from special rates granted these large cus tomers rather than passing it on to individual consumers The hearing at a time and place to be announced will go into the issue of whether the PSC should assume jurisdic tion over setting rates charged to the special customers JUDGES AND LAWMAKERS SALARIES The Assembly passed and sent to the Senate a bill creat ing a

New York,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/07/archives/while-massacring-the-mother-tongue-legislature.html,ALBANYThe annual legislative Walpurgisnacht is under way with the states 207 lawmakers busily engaged in massacring the mother tongue as they act on major legislation they have ignored since convening in January Traditionally most of the important bills wait until the end of the session when they are steered to passage by the leaders in late night meetings punctuated by the forgettable speeches of fatigued legislators This year is no exception Last week after about four months of dithering bills dealing with busing abortion gambling parochial school aid the Forest Hills housing controversy and power plant siting appeared on the calendars And a single days Assembly speeches produced three Swords of Damocles two Pandoras boxes and one piginapoke It was not quite up to the standard set by a nowforgotten Assemblyman who once characterized the impact of a bill as a Sword of Damocles hanging over Pandoras box Behind the rhetoric was an acute awareness on the part of the legislators that this is an election year There was more than a little suspicion that some of the major bills were concocted for no other reason than to focus the voters attention on an emotional issue and deflect it from the fact the 1972 session has done very little for the electorate Last Wednesday night for example the Senate gave final approval and sent to the Governor a bill that im posed a moratorium on the compulsory assignment of school children to achieve racial balancea bureaucratic synonym for busing a word not men tioned in the bill The legislation was denounced by opponents as being so broadly drafted that it could thwart all attempts at desegregating the schools including the redrawing of district lines and even the placement of new school buildings There will be court challenges if Governor Rockefeller signs the meas ure It is not yet known what action the Governor will takebut he has already lauded Mr Nixons moratorium proposal and he is acting as the Presi dents reelection campaign chairman in the state Other important legislative actions last week  Forest Hills The Assembly pro vided final passage to a bill that is designed to kill the Forest Hills low income housing project which has caused so much flack in New York City in the past months The bill of dubious constitutionality according to some lawyers requires resubmission to the local legislative body of all ap proved projects planned by a housing authority that have not progressed past the foundation stage within five years But the Mayor has ago indicated there might be a court test by the city if the Governor signs the measure into law Again there are no certain indi cations of what the Governor will do But at a press conference a while back Mr Rockefeller said that he personally did not favor the scattersite housing concept The confusion was further com pounded on Thursday when the Appel late Division unanimously ruled that work on the project could be carried to completion without resubmitting plans to the Board of Estimate and the City Planning Commission  Parochial Aid A 33million a year grant of state funds to parochial schools was contained in a bill passed by the Senate and assured of accept ance by the Assembly The 1971 law voided in January sought to provide state aid for secu lar educational services for pupils in nonpublic schools The judges said it was substantially similar to three other state laws that the United States Supreme Court declared unconstitu tional last June 28 More recently a Federal Court threw out a 1970 paro chial aid law the socalled mandated services act which provided parochial schools with 28million a year The state is appealing that ruling to the United States Supreme Court The new bill provides the aid through grants for school repairs and mainte nance and in tax credits for parents with incomes as high as 20000 a year Mr Rockefeller has pledged to find a way to furnish the funds to the schools and once as expected he signs the bill there will be immediate court challenges on the grounds it violates the constitutional separation of church and state  Abortion A bill to repeal the states liberalized abortion law and re store the 19thcentury statute that per mits an abortion only when a mothers life is jeopardized was voted on in the Assembly Codes Committee The ac tion which assures a rancorous and emotional debate was in large meas ure a response to the relentless lobby ing efforts of socalled Right to Life groups seeking repeal since 1970 of the new law permitting a woman to have an abortion on demand up until 24 weeks of pregnancy The Governor at first favored modifying the law by setting a 16week limit but now favors an 18week limit He has said at least twice that he will veto a repeal bill if it passes both houses But again its an election year and many lawmakers have been challenged in their home districts solely on their aye vote in 1970 for the new law The Capitol has also been besieged in recent days by groups seeking retention of the new law  Power Siting After several tries Mr Rockefeller has succeeded in obtaining the Legislatures approval to create a Power Plant Siting Board that will be able to override local zoning regulations and be the final arbiter of controversies involving utilities environmentalists and com munity groups The siting board would be made up of five members  the head of the Public Service Commission the State Commissioners of Commerce Environ mental Conservation and Health and a fifth appointee by the Governor Not very many are pleased with the bill particularly environmentalists who feel the composition of the board is oriented toward utilities  New York City Charter Mr Rockefeller and the legislative leaders of both parties agreed uponand both Houses approvedlegislation creating an 11member state commission to revise New York Citys charter The bill also thwarts the announced intent of the citys five borough presidents to have a decentralization plan of their own submitted to the voters in a November referendum that would re store many of the powers they lost when the city charter was last revised in 1961 Tomorrow the legislators resume their drive to adjourn Up for action Some form of nofault

President Supports Repeal Of State Law on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/07/archives/president-supports-repeal-of-state-law-on-abortion-president-backs.html,President Nixon taking an unusual step into a state legis lative fight enunciated his sup port yesterday for a campaign to repeal New Yorks liberal ized abortion law In a letter to Cardinal Cooke who has led a repeal campaign by the Archdiocese of New York the President acknowl edged that this is a matter for state decision outside Fed eral jurisdiction but he added I would personally like to associate myself with the con victions you deeply feel and eloquently express With the Legislature slated to take up early this week bills to repeal or modify the 1970 law that permits a woman to have an abortion on demand until the 24th week of preg nancy the Presidents support for repeal came amid intense debate on the emotionally and politically charged question The Presidents intercession drew prompt denunciations from two members of the As sembly Albert H Blumenthal Democrat of Manhattan and Mrs Constance E Cooke Re publican of Ithaca who drafted and sponsored the current law More than 1500 demonstra tors opposed to any change in the law marched on Manhat tans East Side yesterday spearheaded by a banner that read Abortion A Womans Right to Choose Some counterdemonstrators engaged the marchers in shouted argu ment and carried placards of their own including one that read Abortion Is Murder Commissions Plans Rebuffed The Presidents letter to Cardinal Cooke which was made public by the archdiocese followed by a day Mr Nixons rejection of two major recom mendations by his Commission on Population Growth These called for greatly liberalized abortion laws in all states and a policy of making contracep tive devices and other family planning services widely avaliable to teenagers A spokesman for Governor Rockefeller when asked for comment on the Presidents let ter reiterated the Governors opposition to the repeal of the present law and said Mr Rocke feller intended to support only his own measure to modify the statute On Friday the Governor who is Mr Nixons reelection campaign chairman in the statesent the Legislature a bill that would permit elective abortions only until the 18th week of pregnancy Mr Rocke feller also reaffirmed that he would veto any total repeal of the present law A repeal bill which would restore the 19thcentury statute permitting abortions only when a mothers life is imperiled is expected to spark a repetition this week of the fierce and im passioned debate that preceded the passage of the liberalized 1970 law The repeal bill is sponsored by Assemblyman Ed ward F Crawford Republican of Oswego An Unusual Step Mr Nixons letter in support of repeal was viewed by politi cal observers in the state and in Washington as highly un usual in that it appeared to be a step into a pending state leg islative fight While the President has com mented publicly after state and Federal court decisions relating to school busing and integra tion observers could recall nothing parallel to his taking a public posture on the abortion repeal campaign here The President first declared his opposition to abortion on April 3 1971 in a directive to all military hospitals to conform to the abortion laws of the states in which they are situ ated In thus reversing earlier regulations that had liberalized abortion policies in the hospi tals Mr Nixon declared Historically laws regulating abortion in the United States have been the province of states not the Federal Govern ment That remains the situa tion today as one state after another takes up this question debates it and decides it That is where the decisions should be made In his letter to Cardinal Cooke the President wrote Recently I read in The Daily News that the Arch diocese of New York under your leadership had initiated a campaign to bring about re peal of the states liberalized abortion laws Though this is a matter for state decision outside Federal jurisdiction I would personally like to as sociate myself with the con victions you deeply feel and eloquently express The unrestricted abortion policies now recommended by some Americans and the lib eralized abortion policies in effect in some sections of this country seem to me impossi ble to reconcile with either our religious traditions or our Western heritage One of the foundation stones of our so ciety and civilization is the profound belief that human life all human life is a pre cious commoditynot to be taken without the gravest of causes Yet in this great and good country of ours in recent years the right to life of literally hundreds of thousands of un born children has been de stroyed  legally  but in my judgment without anything ap proaching adequate justifica tion Surely in the ongoing national debate about the par ticulars of the quality of life the preservation of life should be moved to the top of the agenda Your decision and that of tens of thousands of Catholics Protestants Jews and men and women of no particular faith to act in the public forum as defenders of the right to life of the unborn is truly a noble en deavor In this calling you and they have my admiration sympathy and support Blumenthal Shocked Assemblyman Blumenthal saying he was shocked at the Presidents letter declared Its just inappropriate for the Pre ident to be doing this Its a state issue with strong religi ous overtones Weve been try ing to avoid a religious blood bath and no whes come in and aggravated an already difficult situation only for political pur poses Theres just no justifica tion for it Mrs Cook described the Pres idents letter as a patent pitch for the Catholic vote and obviously a political move She asserted He hasnt had enough exposure to the pros and cons of the issue I also think he greatly underestimates the support for the liberalized abortion law The issue Mrs Cook added is not whether we do or dont have abortions The issue is wherein some dirty hotel room or some dingy back room of a doctors office or in a hospital under proper medical care The majority of marchers in the proabortion demonstration here yesterday were women After parading from Bellevue Hospital to Herald Square and down Broadway to Union Square the marchers attended a rally at which Mrs John V

they call transitional novels Amer ican houses bring out perhaps 400 to 500 titles a year marked as young adult  or occasionally teenage books Maybe 100 of these come from juvenile departments The rest drift down from adult departments As one editor says Sometimes we dont know our own minds A few see the field as one of great opportunity The American teen ager has money knows how to read and feels alone and misunderstood Communications need we add are lousy between enfranchised adults and stillgrowing adults Thus new books that tell teenagers someone somewhere knows how it is And thus successful authors like Paul Zindel a Pulitzer Prize winner for his play The Effect of Gamma Rays on ManintheMoon Marigolds and Nat Hen toff a gifted polemicist on almost any subject are persuaded to

dirty words I havent heard spoken since belonging to a troop of Roman Catho lic Boy Scouts Go Ask Alice is No 1 on the American Library Associations list of Best Books for Young Adults 1971 published last January Unfortu nately not many teenagers are reading it but adults are Its the kind of book we wish our young would take to heart and that may be enough to keep them away Theres much more to be said about the read ing assignment recommended list approach to teenage read ing It doesnt seem to work That YA tag is a convenient way of describing the age of an imagined audience It isnt an especially accurate descrip tion of what the intended au dience actually reads In early April partly to feed an old curiosity and partly to get facts instead of more in tellectual horsebacking I per suaded two high schools in Kansas City Mo to ask 350 students between the ages of 14 and 18 what and whom they read and like The students were 155 boys at Pembroke Country Day School a serious minded collegeprep commanded by superior teachers and attend ed by affluent kids disguised as hippies and 150 young men and women at Southwest High School for years the public school brain farm of the Kansas City community The sample was from two schools within 10 miles of one another weighted toward males about 90 per cent in the 151617 age group and drawn from an upper socio economic group I dont pretend the results are science How ever Dr Herbert H Jacobs a statistical mathematical and operationsresearcher in Kan sas City thinks the odds are about 75 per cent the same kind of results would occur in two other suburban high schools in a United States city of more than 200000 popula tion The questionnaire inquired about preferred reading and as signed reading It asked for a favorite author It also asked young people to identify titles and books from the American Library Associations Best Books for Young Adults 1971 and Publishers Weeklys best seller list April 3 As a check on honesty I added two non existent books with juicy titles and exoticallynamed authors As it turned out three or four students at both schools had heard of each of the fake books Especially favored was The Demons by Fria Von Falk At both schools a stu dent had not only heard of it but had read it as well Yet the kids were more honest I gather than adults in similar situation Measurable false re sponse was less than 3 per cent of the total Far and away the most recent book read and liked but not assigned as school work was The Godfather Around 14 per cent of the students listed it Next came Tolkiens Lord of the Rings around 2 per cent but it wasnt much ahead of the other 250 or so books named They ranged from Hardys Jude the Obscure and The Satyri con of Petronius Arbiter to Uriss Exodus Brautigans Trout Fishing in America and Tofflers Future Shock Less than one per cent of the books named were original ly written for young adults Zindels name turned up a cou ple of times A majority of the authors

sellers in every way the best seller list appears to be a more reliable record of what these young people were reading than the ALA list Ninetyfive per cent of the best sellers were reported as read at least once 70 per cent of the ALA list Yet the ALA list was much longer The ALA list of 33 books received 136 reported readings the PW list of 19 books 137 readings Bestread books on the ALA list were The Last Whole Earth Catalog about 18 per cent of the students Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee about 9 per cent and then The Making of a Surgeon and Is the Grass Greener Best read books on the PW

books set aside for YAs The range is wide with emphasis on the recent good and the historically great James Dickeys Deliverance Mar jorie Rawlings The Yearling William Goldings Lord of the Flies Dreisers An American Tragedy Melville Tolstoy John Hersey John Knowles A poorlyled young man or woman could begin with Studs Terkels Hard Times and end with Gerald Eskows Your Fu ture in the Trucking Industry Or he could read some of the best that has been written in North America and Western Europe The librarian said she had all except two of the ALA recommended titles Looking over the the shelves I thought I was seeing a selection of certified good books  not avant garde not controversial not inflammatoryset aside in case of catastrophe To me all the evidence sug gests the ceremonial and his torical nature of our education al systemof which publishing and librarying are a partand an obvious truth The obvious truth is a young adult is most often a young person with adult thirsts and hungers  de veloped before he assumes adult responsibilities The most tell ing fact about our youth comes from Leon Eisenberg professor of psychiatry at Harvard Be cause of improvements in nu trition and health in Western Europe and surely in the United States Dr Eisenberg says that biological adoles cence begin four years earlier than it did a century and a half ago The menses are now ap pearing around the age of 12 in 1830 the average menstrua tion began around 16 Were still trying to figure out what this means but what teen agers are reading is one con sequence Teenagers dont read many teenage books Most of the books young people read were written by mature writers for mature readers The Catch er in the Rye a fact worth noting once again began as an adult book So did Anne Franks Diary of a Young Girl So did Capotes In Cold Blood So did Steinbeck Hesse Von negut Tolkien as well as the hundreds of great books we lay on our youth Or with luck they discover for themselves in schools and libraries Isnt one of the obligations weve assigned to our young people the preservation or de struction of the literary heri tage New fiction poetry com mentary enter the culture to be read by adults Teenagers an other truism backstopped by survey will probably read any best seller that comes along Within a few years new works sink or rise to the surface be cause young people want to read them and teachers say OK To survive in short new works must be read by suc cessive waves of young people Indeed after lost authors are officially rediscovered and anointedHesse is an ironic exampleadults often start re reading them in order to learn about young people Or to try to become like young people One senses that adult surviving books are also being read nowa days at a steadily earlier age My son read Animal Farm at 12 my friends children are reading in high school some of the books I discovered in college So where does this leave Literature for Young Adults I think its a semiimaginary cate gory Well have better books written and published for teen agers because American pub lishing is getting smarter faster it has to But most of what these YAs will read is what you read They think theyre grownup They are but we havent ad mitted them to the grownup world Yet they sneak in Books are one way
Television,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/07/archives/the-good-women-still-drink-sherry.html,FOR those of us who watch the soap op eras once the citadel of escapism it is clear that we are living in an age in which even such places as Oakdale Pine Val ley Henderson Bay City and Somersetall soap opera locales  can no longer re main completely aloof from the forces at work in our society We have come a long way from the days when words like abortion rape and suicide couldnt be mentioned on a soap when a married couple couldnt be seen in a double bed and when blacks just as on the old plantation were not allowed in the main part of the houseex cept in the roles of domes tics and delivery boys But the question is Just how far have we come Unfortunately a closer look at the situation reveals that despite some creeping social relevance the soaps have yet to come to grips with reality in any meaning ful way that for too long they have been the perpetu ators of outworn beliefs and values reflecting a generally conservative bias and that the networks presenting these shows still live in an other world in which they have yet to fully appreciate their responsibilities All too often attempts made in the general direc tion of relevance have been halfhearted and not very effective The brief sad his tory of the character called Amy Tyler on All My Chil dren illustrates the point When the show had its pre miere about two years ago it was announced as a bold experiment An ABC press release described the heroine as a liberal political activist dedicated to the peace move ment who married into a conservative family with considerable wealth and stat ure in the community The New York Times heralded the new soap with the headline Social Activism Grips Soap Opera Nevertheless once the show got under way Amys peace activities seemed rath er obscure There were a few political arguments with her conservative inlaws who were afraid that the Com munists had infiltrated her peace movement but that was about it After the show had been on for well over a month Amy had participat ed in exactly one demonstra tion and that was offcam era Several months later when it was discovered that she had an illegitimate child Phillip her marriage was dissolved and Amy abruptly left the show to travel around the world presum ably in the cause of peace Presumably shes still trav eling Asked if social rele vance had been dropped from the show an ABC spokesman told me Oh no Phillip is into ecology The basic ambivalence perhaps reluctance is a bet ter wordin taking the soaps out into the uncharted territory of social issues can also be seen in the develop ments that not so long ago surrounded the Whitney family on CBSs Edge of Night The story largely hinged on the election of the Whitneys eldest son Colin to the United States Senate seat once held by his father However the familys game plan was suddenly upset by the news that Colins play boy brother had secretly married an island woman when he was stationed in the Caribbean The story had all the ele ments of exciting intelligent drama the emotional shock of a mixed marriage in the family the confrontation with their and our racism and the potential risks of a public disclosure during the heat of a political campaign But even at the start the show was uptight about the issue on its hands Guarded references were made about that native girl and never once was it explicitly stated that the young woman was black In addition as if to further soften the blow to the predominantly white au dience over and over again it was made clear that the woman was beautiful re ligious and came from a good family Gradually the story changed The issue was no longer mixed marriage but ready potential bigamy for it was now revealed that the young man was also engaged to an American woman I am sure many viewers were left wondering just how many states make potential bigamy a crime In any event by shifting the story line and worse giving it a prepos terous twist the dramatic effect was reduced consider ably while the opportunity to deal with a difficult sen sitive issue was lost alto gether Taboos remain another problem While it is true that some of the more ri diculous ones have fallen by the wayside others are still very much with us Both the networks and sponsors exer cise a measure of control over all shows regarding subject matter references and story content One pro ducer told me he prefers to call the process coordina tion The exact nature of control depends upon who owns the soap  Procter and Gamble say or the network At present we need to know a great deal more abdut the restrictions them selves precisely which items are frowned upon or not al lowed the circumstances un der which restrictions are in voked variations in network policies the different criteria used and finally their pur pose What is immediately clear however is that some control occasionally in the form of outright censorship does exist and is a fact of soap life The result is that terms like venereal disease and slept with are not used while more controversial is sues such as homosexuality are not likely to be treated for some time The subject of drugs has recently been introducedbut is being handled with excessive cau tion Not long ago the di rector of one show that was attempting to deal with the subject received a copy of the script in which all refer ences to the word pot had been crossed out save for one lone allusion which the censor apparently had missed Because the direc tor had a sense of humor and some integrity the way ward reference stayed in The use of the word abortion is interesting Thanks largely to the pas sage of New Yorks abortion law the word can now be uttered on these shows How ever the stigma formally at tached to the term appar ently still bothers some offi cials in soap land Therefore the tendency is for good women on the soaps to have their pregnancies ter minated while the bad ones go out and get an abortion Accordingly sweet virtuous Meredith Wolelc on ABCs One Life to Live had her pregnancy terminated clue to a blood condition while Erica Kane Martin on All My Children a spoiled selfish manipu lative woman who didnt want her childhad an abor tion The same principle helps explain why the good women on soaps drink sher ry while the baddies lean toward the hard stuff like Scotch or vodka The representation of blacks and other minorities is another explosive issue Last November the Joint Equality Committee a labor group made up of members of the New York offices of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists AFTRA the Screen Actors Guild the Directors Guild and the Writers Guild fired off a letter to the Columbia Broadcasting System accus ing the network of inflating its figures on the number of blacks employed on daytime television series While both groups have since gotten bogged down in a mire of countercharges and counter figures a simple flick of the dial tells the story The fact is that tokenism and television are synon ymous While the situation is considerably better than say five years ago truly sig nificant steps in this area have yet to be taken Blacks and other minority members are still grossly under  rep resented on all the networks With few exceptions they merely get peripheral roles not central to a theme We find out precious little about them as peopletheir lives their families their prob lems And most of the parts go to lightskinned straight looking and straightthinking individuals  the kind who are most palatable to white America Like the late Mar tin Luther King I too have a dream that one day I shall see a very big very black woman wearing a huge Afro on say CBSs As the World Turns While were on the subject of groups some mention ought to be made of the treatment of women on soaps Unlike the minority question the issue here is not one of underrepresenta tion God knows there are enough women on the soaps Rather the issue is the man ner in which women are por trayed The typical soap op era woman wallows in do mesticity She is usually seen in a variety of roleseither whipping up some cake bat ter or graciously serving coffee And Lord help the woman who opts for a ca reer over having children On As the World Turns Dan and Susan Stewart are both doctors Some time ago the plot centered on a con flict in their marriage Dan wanted a child and insisted his wife give up her career both of which Susan refused to agree to Dan was por trayed as an OK kind of guy while Susan was a vil lainess a mean nasty scheming aggressive  doctor Where the soaps are concerned there is little question as to where the womeans place is Recently women have be gun to appear in less stereo typed roles A woman judge here a woman district attor ney there along with some good natured references to Womens Lib But in a fun damental sense the image of women on soaps has yet to change No doubt these criticisms leveled at the soaps will be greeted in some quarters with dismay But the issue is not my soap right or wrong or love it or leave it As soap addicts we like our soaps and take them se riously We merely want to see them improved
He and She: The Sex Hormones And Behavior,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/07/archives/he-and-she-the-sex-hormones-and-behavior-sex-hormones-and-behavior.html,FREUD always maintained that human psychology had as one of its components some un known biological bedrock He thought that we all male and female alike were captives of our physi ology that inborn propensities and tendencies exerted a profound effect upon behaviorand that these inner propensities were different in the two sexes Hence his nowinfamous remark Anatomy is Destiny This belief is however not popular in the present more environmentalist intellectual climate The common assumption nowadays appears to be that where male behavior and female behavior are different they are so because of acculturation that the display of either masculinity or femininity is by and large the result of social training Recent research on the sex hor mones suggests that it is Freuds ideas which may be the more valid ap proximation of the reality Endocrine studies have now established the crit ical role played by the sex hormones during prenatal life These hormones are not only crucial to differentia tion of the male or female sexual organs but they program the brain during fetal development for the later display of either masculine or feminine behavior The word hormone in the Greek means to arouseand this is what hormones do They are chemical sub stances secreted first in one place usually but not always a gland or organ then released into the blood stream to move through the body and exert their ultimate effects else where  on other target organs The hormones and hormoneproduc ing glands are part of an interrelated chemical system as intricately bal anced as the bodys electrical sys tem brain spinal cord nerves sense organs Hormones must be present in order for the initiation  or in some cases inhibitionof a multitude of complex chemical processes They are involved for example in the vital maintenance of correct blood sugar in the body of the overall rate of metabolism in the regulation of water retention of growth of body responses to stress and in the medi ation of behavior The major sex hormones are se creted either in the testes in males testosterone or in the ovaries of females progesterone and the estro gens the important ones being 17 Petaestradiol and estrone The ad renals small yellowish organs lying just above each kidney also secrete some sex hormones including small amounts of testosterone and larger amounts of the weaker male hormone androstenedione ADas well as a variety of other important hormones including cortlsol cortisone and the fightorflight epinephrine adren alin Both sexes produce hormones of the opposite sex In fact men pro duce as much of the potent 17 beta estradiol as adult women early in their menstrual cycle when estrogen levels are at a low ebb Men also have as much or more 17 beta estradiol and estrone in their blood streams as do most postmenopausal women It is not the lack of estrogens which make a male a male but the far higher levels of testosterone an tagonizing and nullifying the biolog ical effects of the female hormones An interesting little example of this is the recent finding that women after puberty have a greater sensi tivity to odors than do men and that this sensitivity is lost if male hormones are administered It is also lost when women are deprived of estrogen and regained if the estrogen is replaced IN both males and females testo sterone appears to be the hormone which most strongly influences levels of libido Incongruous as this idea might seem in the case of the fe male it is now well supported by documentation from many sources Studies of women who have had their adrenals where most of the male hormones produced by females are secreted removed indicate that these women suffer a dramatic loss in sexual desire women who have had their ovaries removed rarely re spond to loss of estrogens with loss of sex drive In a report on a group of women who had had both opera tions adrenalectomy and ovariec tomy it was found that virtually all were affected postoperatively some merely reducing the frequency of in tercourse some losing interest in sex entirely A subgroup of the same patients who had the ovariectomy earlier in a separate and prior opera tion reported experiencing no change in sexual interest or desire at that point Studies of women receiving testos terone injections also confirm the current hypothesis that male hor mone mediates libidinal drive in the female In one survey of a group of women receiving massive male hor mone dosages in the treatment of breast cancer it was found that 99 per cent of the patients were ex periencing a marked surge in sexual desire In another study more than 100 women were treated with male hormone for such symptoms as frigidity dysmenorrhea etc More than threefourths of these women responded with a reported rise in libido some even complained that their sex drives had become excessive A small group of the same patients treated for a period of time with estro gens experienced no apparent change in libido whatsoever In the male testosterone has sometimes been used as a malenessbolstering medi cation Doctors have at tempted to treat a variety of problems including impo tence decreasing libido in aging men and homosexuali ty with extracts of this most potent of male hormones However the efficacy of such treatments remains unclear A massive review of efforts to counteract impotence with male hormones published in 1947 concluded that physi cally healthy men did not re spond to steppedup dosages of testosterone the problem was psychological Where sexual performance did im prove after male hormone in jections it was suggested the improvement came from the easing of psychological anxieties A more recent 1970 re search report suggests how ever that adding testosterone may after all have more than a placebo effect In the study described two groups of male patients with problems of im potence were compared The men in the first group re ceiving a placebo showed im proved sexual performance among less than half of their number The second group receiving real medication in the form of oral testosterone doses responded with more adequate sexual functioning among more than threequar ters of the men taking part As to whether or not testos terone is useful in combat ing the sag in sexual drive sometimes experienced by ag ing males the answer simply is not knowninformation on the results of such treatment is largely anecdotal and not it should be added particular ly optimistic Attempts to overcome homosexuality with added male hormones have of course been doomed Tes tosterone influences libido strength in both sexes but has nothing to do with deter mining the sex of the individ ual toward whom heightened sexual interest will be directed PUBERTY is a time when the sex hormones are said to be awakening The pituitary or master gland an organ just under the brain not much larger than a small pea now begins sending increas ing amounts of hormones called gonadotropins into the bloodstream These are chemi cal messengers which in the case of the male stimulate sperm production and the secretion of testosterone by the cells of the testes In the female the same gonadotro pins chemically identical to those of the male are re leased by the pituitary but in females they appear in sequence rather than simul taneously The first of these hormones stimulates the growth of the egg and its nest cells within the ovary with an accompanying rise in estrogen secretion The sec ond gonadotropin appearing slightly later in the cycle subserves the production or progesterone the female hor mone which prepares the uterine lining to receive the fertilized egg The sex hor mones bring about in their turn the onset of secondary sexual characteristicsbreast development in girls growth of facial hair in boys etc as well as the behavioral changes seen in adolescence Puberty however it now appears does not constitute an awakening so much as it does a reawakening Re search during the past seve ral decades has demonstrated that the sex hormones are in fact present during pre natal development The con centrations in which they ap pear in utero are crucial not only to sexual differentiation to produce a male or a fe male but it now appears to differentiation of central nerv ous system tissues which will mediate masculine or feminine behavior during adult life The primitive gonad It should be mentioned here is sexually bipotential it con tains everything necessary for the fetus to develop either as male or female There is a rind capable of becoming an ovary a core which can develop as a testis and two sets of internal duct systems male and female One of them will become vestigial during sexual differentiation The genital tubercle grows into either a clitoris or a penis the tissue above the urogenital groove either fuses in the male to become a scrotum or remains sepa rate as the lips of the vagina What makes the embryonic gonad move toward differen tiation as male or female Surely it is genetic sex which sets a directionand it used to be assumed deter mined everything that fol lowed But a series of bril liant experiments begun in the late forties by the French physiologist Alfred Jost gave definitive proof that it was In fact the prenatal hormones which played the decisive role in sexual differentiation or the developing fetus Jost using surgical meth ods so delicate that they have been difficult for other in vestigators to imitate cas trated a male rabbit in utero The infant male when it was born had completely female external genitalia It appeared that in the absence of the testes and therefore testo sterone a genetic XY male fetus had developed in a fe male direction What would happen then to an ovariectomized female fetus Jost removed the ovaries of a developing fe male rabbit fetus At birth she had normal female in ternal ducts and external genitalia It seemed that the ovariesand therefore pre natal estrogenswere not vital to the female in order to ensure her normal differ entiation Indeed given that no interference such as the presence of testosterone oc curred the fetus would al ways develop along female lines Josts work suggested that Nature had some funda mental bias in favor of prod ucing females Femaleness thus could not beas Freud had suggestedsome state of incompleted maleness it ap peared to be the basic form of life Maleness was itself the correction to achieve it something had to be added on male hormones One psychoendocrinologist tells a story of how he ex plained to a very religious friend that the Adam and Eve story in Genesis was unlikely that all biological evidence now available suggested that if one sex arose from the side of the other it would have had to have been Adam who came from Eve Isnt God wonderful retorted his friend When He created the sexes He even did it the hard way Later work of Josts and a variety of other studies have now demonstrated that testos terone must not only be present in utero in order for normal male differentiation to occur it must be present dur ing a sensitive critical pe riod A male rabbit fetus castrated by the 19th day after conception will develop a completely female internal duct system and female genitalia If castrated on day 24 however when the crucial phase is over its develop ment will be completely male Similarly a male rat cas trated in utero this can now be done using chemical meth ods will differentiate in a female directionwith a va ginal pouch unfused scrotal tissues and a miniaturizea penis which is indistinguish able from a clitoris If castra tion is delayed until the criti cal period has passed how everin this species several days before birththe rat will be irreversibly male In females the presence of testosterone during the sensi tive phase is as dramatic as its absence in males A fe male rat receiving injections of male hormone during the critical period will become virilized develop maleap pearing genitalia grow at an increased maletype rate lose her reproductive cycle and become sterile The same hormone doses given 10 days after birth will achieve none of these effects HORMONESthe right concentrations at the right timesare decisive to normal sexual differentiation In the middle fifties the group of re searchers working with the great pioneer in hormones ana behavior Dr William C Young who died in 1965 be gan to wonder Was it pos sible that fetal hormones also had some determining effect upon the type of sexual be havior that would be shown much later on at puberty What actually caused males to show masculine sexual re sponses during mating and females to display feminine responses It had always been assumed that the reason in each case was genetic A genetic male simply looked like a male and was expected to behave like one But if prenatal hormones could feminize his genitalia and masculinize those of the female could they also affect the two complementary sets of behavior and the type of sexual responses each would show In a nowclassic experi ment Young and his col leagues demonstrated that a female guinea pig which had been virilized during prenatal life through testosterone shots to the mother would when given male hormones at puberty resilond with startl ing amounts of male behavior In subsequent work Dr Arnold A Gerall showed that such females would not only mount other females and dis play pelvic thrusting but granted that genital develop ment had been sufficiently anomalous even intromission and ejaculation In contrast even when given high doses of estrogens the capacity for showing normal female be haviorsuch as the lordotic response typical in female rats and guinea pigs in which the back is deeply arched and the genitals raised and pre sented to the malewas dramatically diminished It was as if during the period of prenatal life some inner be havioral dial had been set at male Experimental studies of the past 10 years have now estab lished that at least in lower animals there are sensitive neural tissues which like the primitive gonad are bisexual in potential These tissues located in the hypothalamic region at the base of the brain differentiate during fetal development to produce an unequivocally male or female brain that is they become imprinted during pre natal life to mediate either masculine or feminine mating behavior at puberty Again the key to what happens is testosterone If it is present the female pattern will be suppressed and the male tissues will become organized for the steady release or gonadotropins at puberty and for male sexual responses during reproductive behavior If on the other hand testo sterone is absent in uterine life the sensitive brain areas will differentiate as female They will become programea for the cyclical release of pituitary hormones at puber ty and for female sexual re sponses during mating Might homosexuality in the male be tied to a lessthan adequate supply of testoster one during the critical period when brain tissues are dif ferentiating and becoming programed for the display of later sexual behavior A number of researchers in trigued by a vast animal literature on the subject have recently begun looking for a possible correlation be tween homosexual behavior and the actions of fetal hormones In a British report pub lished last fall it was found that a group of homosexual males had lower levels of testosterone in their urine than did a comparison group of heterosexual males and that a group of lesbian wo men had higher testosterone in urinary samples than did a control group of female heterosexuals This past year in an in vestigation carried out at the Masters and Johnson research institute in St Louis the blood plasma testosterone values and sperm counts of 30 young homosexual college students were carefully ana lyzed It was found that among the 15 men in the group who were totally or almost totally homosexual testosterone readings were much lower than they were among the other half of the men who had definite hetero sexual proclivities also Sperm scores were also astonishing ly lower among exclusively homosexual males There ap peared interestingly enough to be no great difference either tin hormone levels or sperm counts when the bi sexual males were compared with a control group of heterosexuals According to the director of this research project Dr Robert C Kolodny the important question to be studied now is whether dim inished testosterone supply is somehow a result of homo sexual behavioror whether it reflects an endocrine make up that is simply different from that of heterosexuals in the first place A fascinating addendum to the recent research on hu man homosexualityand cer tainly food for speculation is the work of Dr Ingeborg Ward of Villanova University In an experiment reported in the January issue of Science Dr Ward demonstrated that severe stress to a mother rat during pregnancy can block the normal behavioral devel opment of her male offspring and in effect demasculinize them DR WARD trained as a psychologist proceeded in this experiment by placing the rat motherstobe periodical ly into clear plastic tubes The tubes from which it was impossible to escape were then illuminated from above by implacable glaring lights The animals responded with every sign of distress urina tion defecation hair stand ing on end Rats fear these lights so greatly that initially when they were too bright several of the animals died Other pregnant females kept in a nearby vivarium were not placed under stress and served as control animals After birth some of the male pups from the stressed mothers and some from the unstressed mothers were sub jected to further adversities they were placed in ice cube trays which were shaken periodically on a vibrating metal rack When the male offspring all reached the age of puberty 90 days in the rat they were paired with females in heat Those males which had been stressed prenatally showed low degrees of masculine re sponse and little sexual in terest as did males which were both prenatally and postnatally stressed They mated far less frequently than did the group which had been subjected to stress only after birth or those which had not been stressed at all All of the rats where then castrated Some 10 days later they were given injections of estrogen which were fol lowed up with shots of pro gesterone The males were then paired with stud male partners In this situation those pups which had been stressed in utero displayed striking amounts of female sexual behavior including the lordotic arch The same high degree of feminine receptivity could not be elicited from males stressed after birth or those not stressed at all It is Dr Wards belief that the nonmasculine behavior Shown by the prenatally stressed pups resulted from abnormal neural tissueim printing during the critical period of fetal development In response to high degrees of environmental stress she explains the pituitary began stimulating increased produc tion of the adrenal stress hormones Included among these is a weak male sex hormone androstenedione AD As a side effect of this situation the testes also slowed down their production and release of the far more potent testosterone The weaker but more plentiful AD then competed with the more powerful tes tosterone theorizes Dr Ward for control of the name chemi cal resting sites within the sensitive neural tissuesand the weaker AD won out The net result was that testoster one was unable to do its nor mal job of programing the brain she says The tissues developed under the influence of the weaker hormone and thus the animals were unable to differentiate as normally functioning males Dr Ward is now trying to determine whether male rats will become feminized simply by being given large doses of AD prenatally But at present the ingenious experiment de scribed above stands as the sole demonstration that by manipulating the prenatal en vironment one can obtain ex actly the same awesome alterations in male and fe male behavior as have been obtained previously only through direct manipulations of the fetal hormones ONE cannot of course gen eralize from rats to humans And the psychoendocrinolog ical journals are as full of cautions about this tempta tion as the old temperance tracts once were about the dangers of drink Neverthe less as one researcher re marked privately We do In fact work with the implicit assumption that what is found to be true in one species will hold true up and down the phylogenetic scale Its usually an exception when one discovers a physiological mechanism in one species and then finds it absentor total ly reversedin others After all arent we making the same sorts of assumptions when we test out our drugs on rats The presumption is then that the higher animals in cluding monkeys apes and human beings are like the rat and the guinea pig not psychosexually neutral at birth That they are even be fore the onset of learning and social experience pro gramed or predisposed by early hormonal influences to acquire specific either mas culine or feminine patterns of behavior In a study carried out in the late nineteensixties by Dr Robert W Goy it wan demonstrated that female rhesus monkeys exposed to male sex hormones during prenatal development would later behave in more male like than femalelike fash ion Dr Goy working at the Oregon Regional Primate Re search Center injected a group of expectant monkey mothers with periodic doses of testosterone The result was not surprisingly a gen eration of female offspring whose genitalia were male in appearance These female pseudohermaphrodites were separated from their mothers at birth and henceforth so cialized only with their age mates Goy carefully studied the behavior of the virilized fe males as they grew into childhood It had already been well established through the famous monkey studies or Dr Harry Harlow and others that the play behavior or juvenile male monkeys was measurably different from that of the young females and that these differences were not taught by the parent monkeys because they mani fested themselves even when the juveniles had no contact whatsoever with the older generation The young males for example showed much more social threat behavior they initiated play more often than did the young females and they engaged in rough andtumble and pursuit play to a far greater degree The males also withdrew less from threats and approaches made by others and they engaged in more sexual play including the frequent mounting which was in effect a game in which the future sexual role was being rehearsed The impressive thing about Goys experimentally mas culinized females was that they too behaved in all of these ways They displayed the elevated levels of energy and activity commonly seen in young male monkeys In fact their play behavior was much more similar to that of the male than to anything normally encountered in the behavior of the juvenile fe male In a 1967 study carried out at the Psychohormonal Re search Unit of Johns Hopkins Medical School the same un usually high levels of energy and activity were found in a group of 10 young girls who had been accidentally mas culinized in utero This re search investigation was car ried out by Dr Anke Ehr hardt working in collabora tion with the Psychohormonal Units wellknown director Dr John Money The 10 young females taking part had all been virilized as a result of what was essentially a medical mishap Their mothers were given progestin a syn thetic hormone during preg nancy in order to prevent unwanted abortion It was not known at the timedur ing the 1950sthat certain progestins have a masculaniz ing effect on the developing female fetus Nine of the 10 girls had been born with malelike genitalia including an enlarged clitoris and a fused empty scrotum They received surgical correction early in life and development proceeded normally from that point onward psychosexual development carefully evalu ated by Dr Ehrhardt in ex tensive tests and interviews was certainly within the nor mal female range also But it did seem to point toward some interesting questions about what the influence of those masculinizing fetal hor mons had been Of the 10 girls ranging in age from almost 4 to almost 15 nine were outandout tomboys They preferred trucks guns and other boys toys to dolls They loved being outdoors climbing trees playing football and baseball They preferred being with boys to being with other girls they wore boys cloth ing styles and were more or less indifferent  some were actively opposedto skirts and more feminine modes of dress All displayed a high frequency of selfassertion and self  reliance some of them to such an extent that their mothers were concerned about their behavior My daughter acts like a boy complained one woman It might be because of the hor mones She is the opposite from me I was the dainty type Another family was having problems because their fetally virilized daughter was far better in sports than was her older brother Says Dr Ehrhardt who is now an assistant research professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the New York State University at Buffalo The girls were consistently less interested in dollplaying than were a control group of 10 girls who were matched with them in every possible wayage race socioeconom ic level IQ etc Also the control girls did a great deal of bridefantasying and in volved themselves frequently in those sorts of games which are actually childhood rehear sals of the future maternal and wifely roles In contrast the fetally masculinized girls tended to fantasize about fu ture careers In studies which she and Dr Money have done on girls suffering from adrenogenital syndrome notes Dr Ehrhardt the same tomboyish element and highenergy level regular ly appear Adrenogenital syn drome is a genetically trans mitted condition which causes masculinization of the female fetus during prenatal develop ment The condition is due briefly to an error in metabo lism which causes the adre nals to become overactive and produce too many hormones including too many male hor mones It is now possible to stabilize this dysfunction with cortisone so that overproduc tion of male hormones in the adrenogenital girl can be stopped postnatally and her genitals can be surgically feminized Still psychosexual development of these girls similarly to the progestin induced masculinized girls is toward the more malelike end of the normal female spectrumhigh degrees of activity expressed in more masculine kinds of behavior IN assessing which behav iors were to be called mas culine and which were to be called feminine Drs Ehr hardt and Money relied on criteria such as energy ex penditure much higher in boys toy and sports prefer ences career ambitions ma ternalism girls are usually fascinated by infants and in fant care boys are usually not and several other items including body image cloth ing choice etc In statistical analyses of responses of large groups of boys and girls sexrelated male and female clusters about these items do reliably emerge Nevertheless isnt it pos sible I asked Dr Ehrhardt who is a fairhaired pretty Germanborn woman in her early 30s that these sex differences are merely arti facts of our culture Most psychiatrists and psycholog ists and of course most Wo mens Liberationists believe that they result primarily from social experience That is a small female child is taught very early or learns by imitation those feminine ways in which she is expected to behaveand responds by doing it I would agree she an swered that the most power ful factors in the shaping of gender identity are probably experiential and social In other words the primary thing is whether a person is called and thought of and calls himself or herself male of female This is of course fun damental to identity But within the broad spectrums of behavior which we call either masculine or feminine there are certainly very wide variations You can have on the one hand a woman who is totally domestic and ma ternal and on the other a person who is uninterested in children and wants only a career My speculation would be that there is a fetal hor monal history in both these cases disposing the individ ual in one direction or the other In other words what Im suggesting is that there may very well be normal fe male hormone correlates to the variations of normal fe male behavior The main message of most of this work both with animals and with humans she added is that hormones before birth may have an or ganizing effect upon behavior that will appear only much laterthat social environment is the mold in which basic tendencies already present will be shaped and formed The idea is that testosterone by its presence or absence sets some kind of behavioral potential and that postnatal experiences are actually act ing upon a physiologically biased substrate One very strange factor emerging from Dr Ehrhardts study of the 10 progestin virilized girls was that their IQs were all unusually high Six of them had IQs above 130 thus in a random sample in which one would normally expect to see this elevated value in 22 per cent of cases it appeared in 60 per cent In an earlier study of 70 adrenogenital girls and boys carried out by Drs Money and V Lewis the same pe culiar incidence of high IQ was encountered In a group where it would have been expected 25 per cent of those tested would have IQs above 110 it was found that there was an actual observed frequency of 60 per cent hav ing IQs above that value DOES this make you think I asked Dr Ehrhardt that boys who are normally exposed to more masculinizing hormones in utero would be expected to be ipso facto brighter than girls I dont think boys are brighter she answered quick ly But again female and male intelligences do tend to cluster statistically around different sets of Abilities Boys appear to do better in mathe matics and more abstract kinds of intellectual function ing while girls score much higher in verbal capabilities She paused I would be will ing to allow that chemical in fluences in prenatal life might increase the level of energy and activity and that they might have some enhancing effect upon intellectual ca pacities In a recent British publica tion Antenatal Progesterone and Intelligence by Dr Katherina Dalton the very same phenomenon appeared Dr Dalton studied a group of boys and girls whose moth ers had been given progeste rone during pregnancy Pro gesterone a female hormone is similar to the progestihs but has no masculinizing side effects All of the progeste rone offspring studied by Dr Dalton both male and female progressed better and faster than a comparison control group of children They stood earlier walked earlier re ceived significantly better grades in academic subjects verbal reasoning English etc Moreover the more of the hormone their mothers had received the earlier they walked and the better they did in school Thus according to Dr Ehr hardt the intelligenceenhanc ing effect if it proves to be definitely there may have nothing to do with the mas culinizing effect The kids in Dr Daltons study showed an increase in IQ without be coming virilized So what were seeing may just be due to some general chemical in fluence of these hormones As far as Im concerned the whole question of the connec tion between intelligence and prenatal hormones is definite ly a wideopen one

Lobbying on Abortion Increases at Capitol,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/08/archives/lobbying-on-abortion-increases-at-capitol.html,With rallies impassioned speeches angry political threats and a flood of telegrams let ters and telephone calls the forces for and against abortion have laid siege to the Legis lature in recent days hoping to influence the climactic vote on repeal retention or modifica tion of the states liberalized abortion law Urged on by the prospect of a close vote the intensified battle of the abortion lobbies has revived all the fierce emo tions and arguments that pre ceded the 1970 passage of the present law which permits a woman to have an abortion on demand until the 24th week of pregnancy But unlike the situation in 1970 the lobbying initiative along with grassroots organ ization and support  has been assumed by abortion oppon ents with defenders of the ex isting law mustering strength only in the last two weeks as the growing strength of their opponents became clear 3 Options on Abortion Issue As the current session draws to a close legislators will have three options on the abortion issues to retain the present law to approve a measure sup ported by Governor Rockefell er that would permit abortions only until the 18th week of pregnancy or to repeal the ex isting law and restore the 19th century statute permitting abor tions only when a mothers life is imperiled Governor Rockefeller has pledged to veto the repeal bill sponsored by Assemblyman Ed ward F Crawford Republican Conservative of Oswego if it is passed but this threat has not deterred supporters of the measure The major forces favoring re peal or at least modification of the present law are the Roman Catholic Church whose diocesan newspapers across the state have hammered away at the issue in recent weeks and more than 50 largely autono mous righttolife groups whose leaders claim a following of 200000 people The major torces opposing repeal or modification comprise 50 to 60 statewide groups mostly established organiza tions that lobbied intensively and effectively in the 1970 leg islative fight but that have been late getting into the fray this year The opponents of repeal in clude numerous womens civic civil rights and religious organi zations among them the New York State Council of Churches the New York Federation of Reform Synagogues the Na tional Organization of Women the New York State Womens Caucus the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and the New York Civil Liberties Union Neither side has had a great deal of financing Assemblyman Albert H Blumenthal the Man hattan Democrat who spon sored and helped draft the present law and who has been a key figure in regrouping the proabortion forces of two years ago indicated yesterday that individuals and individual groups had financed their own lobbying efforts Collections for example have been taken up on buses that daily carry demonstrators to the Capitol steps in Albany 10000 Spent on Mailings Edward J Golden state chairman of the New York Right to Life Committee said in an interview that the state committee and the 50 county groups operated on contribu tions membership donations and the receipts of fundraising sales of baked goods and home made clothing He said the state organization had spent about 10000 on mailings this year Mr Golden a 38yearold father of six children whose home in Troy is the state com mittee office said the rightto life groups emerged from fan tastic grassroots sentiment in the months following enact ment of the 1970 liberalized abortion law He said that 95 per cent of the membership was inarticu late in the political sense and that the great bulk had never been to the Capitol building Theyre homebodies and theyre effective he said of followers who have besieged the Capitol daily in recent weeks to put pressure on wav ering legislators particularly freshmen in both the Assembly and Senate who did not vote on the 1970 bill Tactics Demonstrative The lobbying tactics of both sides in the abortion fight have been demonstrative  rallies speeches efforts to buttonhole legislators outside their cham bers or offices  as opposed to the more subtle activities of professional lobbyists who know the lawmakers on a first name basis and press their points over lunch These people really harass the legislators one Capitol ob server noted They get into arguments with them and threaten all kinds of political reprisals Lobbying on both sides of the issueas well as nofault automobile insurance and cable TV measuresgot so intense last Thursday that Assembly Speaker Perry B Duryea barred all lobbyists from the chamber Righttolife groups have openly threatened primary fights in this election year for legislators who vote against re peal The combination of elec tion pressures and few major issues in an economyminded legislative session gave abor tion opponents an opportunity this year that was not open year ago Literature Distributed More than a month ago abor tion opponents began mustering forces for a major drive against the present law In addition to publicity in diocesan newspa pers Roman Catholic parishes organized committees distrib uted literature on the issue and on how to contact legislators and in some cases provided facilities for righttolife allies The headquarters of New York Citys Metropolitan Right toLife Committee for example is in an office provided by the Archdiocese of New York at 33 East 50th Street next door to the chancery offices The chairman of the commit tee Prof Robert M Byrn of the Fordham University law school acknowledged that the space was being provided rent free but denied that the right tolife movement was a strictly Roman Catholic effort He said the organization had the sup port of Orthodox Jews Luther ans and other religious groups and was broader than denomi national labels indicate The antiabortion movement which had been gaining steady momentum was given a major lift on Saturday when President Nixon enunciated his support of repeal in a letter to Cardinal Cooke Efforts Intensified Over the last two weeks largely in response to the gathering strength of repeal forces opponents of any change in the existing law have intensified efforts to make their feelings known to lawmakers by letter telegram telephone and in person In recent days several bus loads of people have appeared on the Capitol steps each day to urge legislators to stand firm in the face of efforts to repeal or modify the law More than 500 women including Mrs John V Lindsay demon strated there last Thursday In New York on Saturday more than 1500 persons marched on the East Side and attended a rally at Union Square  where the crowd swelled to 2000to hear the wife of the Mayor and Repre sentatives Bella S Abzug and Shirley Chisholm denounce re peal efforts A number of public officials including Consumer Affairs Commissioner Bess Myerson and Health Services Adminis trator Gordon Chase also have spoken out for retention of the present statute
ABORTION DISPUTE INSTATE ACCENTED BY NIXON'S LETTER,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/08/archives/abortion-dispute-in-state-accented-by-nixons-letter-both-sides.html,Leaders of the two sides in the renewed abortion law con troversy agreed yesterday that the repeal campaign was with in a few votes of success in the Assembly and that Presi dent Nixons intervention had intensified the issue consider ably Eventual repeal is still considered unlikely for Gover nor Rockefeller repeatedly has vowed to veto any measure repealing the twoyearold lib eralized law that might pass the two houses An override of a veto is considered even less likely because of a shortage of votes and of remaining time in the legislative session 1970 Debate Recalled Despite this outlook the two sides expect the same hard fought close and even teary eyed climax as occurred in the 1970 debate because of a vari ety of factors including heavy grassroots and church pres sures the coming elections and now the Presidents un usual entry into the debate The present law permits elective abortions up to the 24th week of pregnancy and Governor Rockefeller has pro posed a compromise measure His measure to cut the limit to 18 weeks is considered more likely to be enacted than the repeal bill The Legislature is returning to Albany for another attempt at adjournment keeping its tra dition of crowding most major items into the final days Among the issues still to be finished are nofault auto insurance New York Citys request for fiscal aid cable television con trols the state supplemental budget and the proposed mora torium on expansion of off track betting Looks to Letter for Help The sponsor of the repeal bill Assemblyman Edward F Crawford RepublicanConserv ative of Oswego said he felt the action by President Nixon who on Saturday stepped into the state legislative fight and sent a surprise letter to Car dinal Cooke enunciating his support for repeal of the abor tion law might clinch success in the Assembly And he said he hopes it may lead to a change in position by the Gov ernor who is chairman of Mr Nixons reelection campaign in the state A leading opponent of repeal Albert H Blumenthal Man hattan DemocratLiberal said the letter marked the first time that an attempt had been made to make the issue a purely partisan matter Mr Blumenthal the deputy Democratic minority leader in the Assembly charged that a brassknuckle political fight was under way with conserva tive support being sought by the President nationally and by Lieutenant Governor Malcolm Wilson within the state Mr Wilson a Republican and Roman Catholic who has con sistently opposed liberalization of the abortion law over the years said that Mr Blumen thals assertion was totally untrue and that he had re mained on the sidelines In particular Mr Wilson denied Mr Blumenthals charge that the Lieutenant Governor had been quietly encouraging several righttolife primary election challenges to incum bent Republicans including one being faced by Assembly Speaker Perry B Duryea the Montauk Republican who is considered Mr Wilsons chief competitor as the next GOP gubernatorial candidate Mr Crawford said he hoped the debate would occur today but there was a chance it might be put off until tomorrow A leader of the proliberaliza tion faction Assemblywoman Constance E Cook Republican Liberal of Ithaca said that if the debate were put off it would probably be done by the leader ship to get past the final filing day for primary challenge pe tition  today and so lessen the pressures on five or six question mark candidates Mr Blumenthal said he thought the big question now was whether Assembly Repub licans might feel obliged to fol low the Presidents lead as the deciding factor In the past the two abortion factions have in cluded a nonpartisan mix of members from both sides of the aisle he said Mrs Cook estimated that the main effect of the Presidents letter would be to rally anti repeal antiNixon forces and help the liberalization faction The prorepeal contingent was at peak strength even before the letter she said and Mr Crawford continues to be about three votes short of the 76 he needs according to Mrs Cooks count Im amazed that the Presi dent signed that letter Mrs Cook said Hes completely misjudged popular feeling on this Mr Crawford denying the President hoped for political gain asserted The President is quite a political animal and he knows theres a large body of opinion in and outside the state who feel differently He could lose as much as he gains Mr Blumenthal however contends the President has been trying to nail down the con servative and Roman Catholic vote by emphasizing the bus ing parochial aid and abortion issues all three of which have occasion of conflict in this years legislative session The mix of conscience and political pressures involved in the issue even if it never gets beyond the Governors desk could end some politicians ca reers Mr Duryea is considered more than safe in his primary challenge But observers feel that he wants to avoid the situation of two years ago when the issue was so close that he had to cast the tie breaking 76th vote in favor of liberalized abortion after a weeping upstate Democrat George Michaels stunned the chamber by keeping the bill alive and voting yes As he predicted during the debate Mr Michaels was de feated in his bid for reelection having been denied his partys endorsement Last year the repeal bill stayed bottled up in the Rules Committee controlled by the leadership This year however the righttolife pressures were such that the bill was kept in the Codes Committee and an antiabortion Democrat Thomas Brown of Albany threatened to embarrass the members of the GOP repeal faction by forcing them to vote for his motion to discharge the bill from committee Normally motions to dis charge lose on party votes But various Republicans would have had to support Mr Brown or risk constituents anger Mr Blumenthal said he tried to head off Mr Brown and failed And so the committee let the bill out
Mr. Nixon's Intervention,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/08/archives/mr-nixons-intervention.html,President Nixons dismaying interference in the legis lative process of this state in an effort to force repeal of the abortion reform law was a blatant misuse of his high position Perhaps the subject of that law should be a Federal concern but in the Presidents own words this is a matter for state decision outside Federal jurisdiction Yet he has proclaimed his strong opposition to the law at the very moment when the question of its retention or repeal is before the State Legislature What is equally hard to justify Mr Nixon chose to make his strange intervention by way of a letter to Cardinal Cooke which the archdiocese was free to make public Those pressing for repeal he said had his ad miration sympathy and support Historians should find it hard to locate a parallel instance of a President openly working through a particular church to influence the action of a state government This newspaper has opposed Governor Rockefellers proposed modification of the present lawa law which President Nixons own Commission on Population and the American Future recently extolled as a model for the nation But the Governor deserves commendation for reaffirming his intention to veto outright repeal in spite of Mr Nixons obvious desire to the contrary No Governor can afford to allow his Legislature and his own office to be openly pressured by a President in this waynot even when the President is playing for political advantage and the Governor is state campaign chairman for his reelection
THE 1972 CAPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/09/archives/humphrey-sees-upset-today-over-mcgovern-in-nebraska.html,OMAHA May 8  Senator Hubert H Humphrey is trying to upset Senator George McGovern in tomorrows Presidential preference primary in this state Nebraska one of two states holding Presidential primaries tomorrow has 11 Democrats on its preferential ballot West Virginia the other state has a preferential contest involving only Senator Humphrey and Gov George C Wallace of Alabama Though Nebraska offers only 22 delegates the Minnesota Senator clearly sees a chance among the states conservative Democrats to bring about an embarrassing upset Appeal to Center The result has been a heavy lastminute appeal to what Senator Humphrey calls the vital progressive center of the Democratic party Mr Humphreys effort has transformed Nebraskas primary from a private preserve of Senator McGoverns into a battleground It has also triggered a defensive response from Senator McGovern who wants it known in Nebraska that he is no wildeyed radical During a last busy day of campaigning for both men Senator McGovern spoke to about 250 people at the Glenn Berg Farm in Hastings aided by former Gov Frank Morrison Mr Morrison introduced the Primaries at a Glance Nebraska West Virginia Nebraska and West Virginia will conduct primary elections today the 13th and 14th of 23 that will have a bearing

strength from South Omaha He was state cochairman of Senator Edmund S Muskies campaign which has collapsed He has refused to join either side instead concentrating his efforts on helping another State Senator Terry Carpenter of Scottsbluff win the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate The question to be answered at the polls between 8 AM and 8 PM tomorrow central daylight time is whether the lastminute appeal to conservative Democrats can overcome the ninemonth lead achieved with intensive organizational work by Senator McGoverns legion of young campaigners Voters Canvassed The South Dakota Senators workers have canvassed voters heavily and know who will vote for their man They plan to make sure that that vote gets out tomorrow Senator Humphreys camp can meet that challenge only with broad appeals to all Democrats William R Riggs national staff coordinator for Senator Humphrey said the race was getting closer and closer He said recorded telephone messages for Senator Humphrey had gone to 40000 households in the Omaha area 10000 in the Lincoln area and to all the Democrats in Scotts bluff In the last four days a series of Humphrey television spot

Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/09/archives/to-protect-the-unborn.html,To the Editor I must express my dismay at the consistent advocacy in the most laudatory terms which The Times has given to the liberalized abortion law in New York State Those of us who oppose abortion cannot view it as a problem of conscience to be left to the woman and her doctor because this simplistically ignores the rights of another human being at least potential who is unable to express or defend his right to life We are not attempting to force our decision on other persons but we cannot ignore societys obligation to protect the right to life of all its citizens including the unborn We can then look only with horror at The Times vaunting of the number of abortions which have occurred in New York during the last yearhowever sanitary and safe the conditions may have been under which these unborn children were killed Sister THERESE AQUINAS ROCHE Convent Station N J May 3 1972

Governor Reported Irked By Nixon's Abortion Views,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/09/archives/governor-reported-irked-by-nixons-abortion-views-rockefeller.html,ALBANY May 8  Governor Rockefeller was reliably reported today to be angered by President Nixons intervention in the issue of elective abortions now pending in the Legislature One of the highest elected Republican officials in the state described Mr Rockefeller as very upset about the Presidents action The Governors office said that despite the Presidents announced support for repeal of the states liberal abortion law Mr Rockefeller would veto the repeal if it was approved by the Legislature Relations between the Governor and the President which had improved greatly in the last several months with Mr Rockefeller agreeing to serve as the Presidents campaign manager in the state now seem strained at least on this one issue The Assembly was expected to debate the repeal legislation tomorrow Evidence of the Governors pique was clear in the statement his office issued in response to requests for comments on the Presidents action We are referring all calls to the White House on this Mr Nixon intervened in the state issue in a letter to Cardinal Cooke The letter made public Saturday made clear the Presidents support for repeal of the New York law which permits elective abortions through the 24th week of pregnancy The day before the letter was made public Mr Nixon had rejected recommendations for liberalized abortion laws made by the Commission of Population Growth which he appointed The chairman of the commission is John D Rockefeller Jr the Governors older brother The Republican legislative leaders here declined to comment on the Presidents action while the Democratic leaders castigated it In Washington the states two men in the Senate Senator James L Buckley ConservativeRepublican and Senator Jacob K Javits Republican differed on the issue Mr Buckley said he supported Mr Nixons position and Senator Javits supported Mr Rockefeller In the White House Deputy Press Secretary Gerald L Warren said the Presidents comment on the New York abortion law was in response to a letter Mr Nixon received from Cardinal Cooke But in New York Msgr Eugene Clark director of communications for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York said the Cardinals letter dated April 4 did not ask the President to comment on the issue in New York State It had nothing to do with the controversy in Albany Monsignor Clark said Cardinal Cooke has not solicited any support from the President The Catholic hierarchy and scores of groups of Catholic laymen are the principal proponents of repeal of the law Effect Not Clear Exactly how the Presidents mixing in in the controversy on the side of the antiabortion forces would affect the issue in the Legislature was not clear But opponents of repeal felt their cause had been hurt by the Presidents action and that the repeal might be approved in the Assembly tomorrow and then by the Senate The Governors proposal that the legal abortion period be shortened to 18 weeks was apparently being held in abeyance until action on the repeal measure was completed the Governors suggestion was considered a possible compromise But the Democratic minority leader in the Senate Joseph Zaretzki of Manhattan said today that the President plunged into a very delicate negotiating process and ruined any chance we had of reaching a compromise The Assembly minority leader Stanley Steingut of Brooklyn said the President has abused the prestige of his office with an unsolicited and unwarranted expression of opinion Mr Steingut also called the Presidents action a distasteful Presidential ploy Senator Buckley said he wanted to associate himself wholeheartedly with the President in his rejection of the population commission recommendations for more liberalized birth control laws such as New Yorks I share with the President the belief that it is philosophically and biologically impossible to consider an unborn child as other than a distinct human being with an individual right to life Mr Buckley said Javits Affirms View Of Mr Nixons action in the Albany dispute the Senator said The Presidents politically courageous stand will provide further assurance that other states will not seek to emulate New York without the most thoughtful consideration of the implications of abortion on demand Senator Javits said that the states existing abortion law was a significant step forward in dealing with the human problems of our state and that he could not reverse that view now The Senator said he supported the Governors position including the proposal for an 18week abortion period The halls of the Capitol were sporadically crowded with clusters of abortion adversaries seeking to argue with legislators and sometimes each other One of the sponsors of the abortion law in the Assembly Mrs Constance E Cook RepublicanLiberal of Ithaca listened to the argu ments of the groups outside the Assembly chamber but was interrupted so often that she left without being heard fully She opposes repeal As the Assembly worked in its chamber where the abortion activists were not allowed outside a chunky matronly woman in favor of repeal scolded a man with a proabortion slogan on his lapel One more remark from you buddy the woman said and youll be laying on the floor Im talking on a onetoone basis There was no knockdown
Assembly Votes to Repeal Liberalized Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/10/archives/assembly-votes-to-repeal-liberalized-abortion-law-measure-passes-79.html,ALBANY May 9After nearly six arduous hours of speeches the Assembly voted tonight 79 to 68 to repeal the liberalized abortion law it barely passed in agonizing debate two years ago The bill would replace the present law which permits a woman to have an abortion on demand up until the 24th week of pregnancy with the former statute allowing an abortion only when the wornans life was imperiled The vote came after several weeks of intense lobbying by socalled right the life groups and amid charges that it was let out of committee in an electionyear attempt to appeal to voters on a highly charged and emotional issue Numerous references were made by opponents of the repeal measure about politics particularly about President Nixons letter to Cardinal Cooke saying he favored abolishing the liberalized law The bill now goes to the Senate A spokesman for the Senate majority leader Earl W Brydges Republican of Niagara Falls said the bill would be debated there even though Governor Rockefeller has repeatedly said in recent weeks that he would veto a total repeal of the current law Persons close to the issue predicted that the bill restoring the stringent abortion law had a good chance of passing in the Senate A spokesman for Mr Rockefeller said tonight that the Governor had not changed his position and that he still favored a modification of the present law to limit elective abortions to 18 weeks of pregnancy Legislation to that effect is pending in both houses The Assembly by a narrow margin76 to 73passed the liberalized law two years ago after wrenching debate Since its enactment many Roman Catholics and righttolife groups in every corner of the state have lobbied for its repeal and have pursued legislators in their home districts who voted for the present law In recent weeks the halls of the Capitol were clogged with opponents of the abortion law and only in the last week or so have groups favoring the present statute mobilized their forces There were at least six switches in votes compared with the 1970 vote Five Assemblymen who voted for the liberalized law two years ago and who voted tonight for restoration of the 100yearold statute were Peter R Biondo Westchester Republican William L Burns Suffolk Republican Gordon W Burrows Westchester Republican Armando Montano Bronx Democrat and Chester J Straub Brooklyn Democrat Assemblyman Manuel Ramos Bronx Democrat voted against the liberalized law but tonight he voted against restoring the old statute Visitors Absent Assembly debate today began at 140 PM in a chamber cleared of visitors and becalmed because of the absence of the usual background hubbub of chatting lawmakers pursuing private conversations The first speaker was Assemblyman Edward F Crawford Republican of Oswego and sponsor of the bill to restore the statute that had been the states law governing abortions for more than 100 years After mentioning the emotions generated by the issue in an election year Mr Crawford a thin precise man said No member should suffer defeat if he follows the dictates of his conscience In remarks that punctuated much of the discourse of those favoring return to the old stringent law Mr Crawford said Abortion in this state is nothing less than legal murder of unborn infants Speaker Perry B Duryea ruled out amendments proposed by two Democrats to Mr Crawfords bill saying they were not germane His rulings were sustained by the Republican majority WideRanging Discussion Then one by one the scheduled list of 41 members who had asked to speak rose and discussed the complexities surrounding the abortion issue Their comments covered sensitive areas of law religion politics philosophy individual morality womens rights and the profound question of when life begins In a sense it was really not a debate since the usual questioning of one lawmaker by another was conspicuously absent and speeches were not interrupted A key figure in the abortion issue Assemblywoman Constance E Cook the Ithaca Republican who shepherded the liberalized law through the Assembly two years ago noted that at that time the bill was brought out to the floor because it was clear it would pass in the Senate and be accepted by the Governor In an allusion to Mr Rockefellers repeated remarks in the last week or two that he would veto a bill abolishing totally the 1970 law Mrs Cook said we are now engaged in a purely political activity in the midst of the primary season and Im absolutely sure the public is way smarter than some supporters of repeal might think Whether or Where The issue Mrs Cook said was not whether there would still be abortions if the repeal bill passed but wherein the hospital or a motel room The liberalized law she said has meant for women a freedom from fear that none of you gentlemen will ever know Mrs Cook said she spoke against the measure to restore the old law as the only person in the Legislature who has borne a child as the mother of two very wanted very beloved children Assemblyman Thomas W Brown Democrat of Albany denied that the Crawford bill was a political issue saying it transcended politics It is moral it is a question of how we view life Mr Brown said adding that man had gone from primordial slime to the air conditioned nightmares of 1972 Assemblyman Albert H Blumenthal Manhattan Democrat who years ago began the push for abortion reform said there was no basis in law or fact for discussing this issue of abortion in terms of murder Citing comments by President Nixon and others opposing the states present law Mr Blumenthal said the issue was indeed political and when you take your morality and put it on the floor of this Legislature its political Why does this Legislature keep entering my bedroom and the bedroom of every couple in this state Mr Blumenthal asked Why cant you stay out of peoples personal business One of the stanchest foes of the liberalized law Assembly man Nell W Kelleher Republican of Troy displayed an aborted fetus preserved in jar and said that an unborn child feels cold feels heat feels paindont kid me you know life is there Citing the estimated 300000 to 500000 abortions performed under the new law Mr Kelleher said We have become the nations No 1 abortion mill There is a new saying he as serted Go to Nevada to get rid of your money go to New York to get rid of your baby Passage of the current law Mr Kelleher said opened the doors to euthanasia Another supporter of the Crawford bill Assemblyman Dominick L Di Carlo Brooklyn Republican raised the question of when life began Can we tear a child apart limb from limb because of an accident of fate that he has not yet been born he said He asked why supporters of abortion had not enacted a humane abortion statute to minimize pain to the fetus during an abortion Ill tell you why he said because it would mean thinking that its more than a wart John A Esposito Queens Republican said Unless you sustain this billthe Crawford bill you will be playing the euthansia overture In the name of God and humanity I urge you to pass this bill Other speakers against the Crawford bill cited statistics since enactment of the new abortion law showing a decline in infant mortality maternal mortality and outofwedlock births The assembly minority leader Stanley Steingut of Brooklyn said he voted for the liberlized law two years ago with great trepidation but was still convinced that religion morals or philosophy could not be legislated G Oliver Koppell a Bronx Democrat referred to President Nixons letter to Cardinal Cooke and said the man who put into jeopardy the lives of every citizen of this world by his actions in Vietnam cannot come and talk to me of life

Appellate Court Stays Ruling On Abortion Law in Connecticut,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/10/archives/appellate-court-stays-ruling-on-abortion-law-in-connecticut.html,Connecticut was granted a temporary stay yesterday of a Federal court ruling that held the states 112yearold abortion control laws unconstitutional The stay issued by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals here lifted the state at least for a while out of the morass of legal uncertainty it had been left in on April 18 when a threejudge constitutional court in Hartford declared the old abortion laws in Connecticut unconstitutional It also made it unnecessary for Connecticuts General Assembly to hold a special session to pass a new law on abortion that might satisfy the Federal courts Gov Thomas J Meskill had said to the General Assembly at its closing session last Wednesday night that he might have to call it back if the state did not get the stay it was seeking Old Woman With Hatpin When the law was declared unconstitutional Mr Meskill a Roman Catholic warned physicians not to hasten to decide on their fees for abortions because the state still had murder laws The Governor said he regarded abortion as murder whether performed by a surgeon or by an old woman with a hatpin in a dirty alley Chief Judge Henry J Friendly of the Circuit Court of Ap peals noted that there were cases from several states involving abortion laws pending before the United States Supreme Court The Connecticut Attorney Generals office said it would be back before the District Court in Hartford today with Judge Friendlys stay although the step may be only a preliminary to the states way up to the United States Supreme Court In arguing for a stay Daniel R Schaefer assistant Attorney general of Connecticut said the lower courts ruling had left the state without any valid laws concerning abortion creating confusion among physicians and legal authorities The appellate courts ruling involves an effort to expedite an appeal to the United States Supreme Court In the District Courts ruling last month the law was declared unconstitutional but no injunction was served barring the state from utilizing the law Because of this there was some question whether an appeal of the ruling could be taken directly to the Supreme Court The appeals court then has asked the special threejudge court to reconsider issuing an injunction With an injunction issued the state would be able to take its appeal directly to the United States Supreme Court for a decision on the constitutionality of the law
"ABORTION REPEAL PASSED BY SENATE, SENT TO GOVERNOR",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/11/archives/abortion-repeal-passed-by-senate-sent-to-governor-veto-expected-on.html,ALBANY May 10By a vote of 30 to 27 the Senate gave final legislative approval to a bill repealing New Yorks twoyearold liberalized abortion law and reinstating the old statute permitting abortions only to save the life of the woman The bill which was passed by the Assembly late yesterday now goes to Governor Rockefeller He has said repeatedly that he will veto it A spokesman for the Governor reaffirmed after the vote today that he would veto the bill in effect leaving the current law still in force and almost assuring that the debate would continue at the next session of the Legislature In other actions here the Assembly approved and sent to the Senate a bill that would permit the City University to acquire the Bronx campus of New York University and to authorize the merger of the NYU Engineering School with the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn Clocks Are Stopped The Assembly recessed for the evening shortly after 730 and the Senate soon after a supper break Clocks in both chambers had been stopped yesterday as scheduled 2 PM adjournment time pessed with many major items still to be considered The New York State Catholic Committee which speaks for Roman Catholic dioceses across the state Urged the Governor not to act hastily on the abortion bill Bishop Edwin A Broderick of Albany chairman of the committee urged that executive action on the bill be taken only after a time of mature study during which the general public in the state may add their voices to the issue Cardinal Cooke Archbishop of New York also called on the Governor not to veto the bill and urged him to recognize the will of the majority of our elected representatives just as he recognized the will of a bare majority two years ago The vote on the highly controversial issue came after more than seven hours of dehate the longest thus far this session An amendment offered by Senator Murray Schwartz Queens Democrat to place the entire issue of abortion before the voters in a November referendum was ruled not germane to the intent of the repeal bill Senator Harrison Goldin Bronx Democrat who voted against repeal said the issue was political in part and that enactment of the repeal measure would be carefully scrutinized by women the young voter the alert young man the older peopleyou will be hearing from them In closing the debate the minority leader Joseph Zaretzki said that since the Governor had said he would veto the bill proponents of repeal should instead support a bill modifying the current law to permit elective abortions until the 18th week of pregnancy Do the practical thing Mr Zaretzki urged Enactrhent of the repeal measure in light of the Governors stand would be a vain act as you welt know he declared The Senate majority leader Earl W Brydges Republican of Niagara Falls an opponent of the liberalized law said it is extremely difficult for me to speak on the subject Mr Brydges who is retiring from politics said he was disturbed at the things which have been going on in thp hospitals and clinics With every fiber of my being he said his voice breaking I cry out against the continuation of this statute on the books of the State of New York Speaking of unborn infants he said If ever a group needed a special pleader if ever a group needed a special guardIan its this group which obviously cannot speak for itself Mr Brydges said afterwards that the bill proposed by the Governor reducing to 18 weeks the period during which an abortion would be permitted would not be brought to the floor during this session Only one Senator Paul P E Bookson Manhattan Democrat switched his vote from 1970 Mr Bookson whose district was carved up by reapportionment which gave him a part of Brooklyn where he is relatively unknown had voted for the liberalizing law in 1970 but today he voted for the repealer Justification Cited The bill states that an abortional act is justifiable when committed upon a female by a duly licensed physician acting under a reasonable belief that such is necessary to preserve the life of such female The bill also calls an abortion justifiable if a woman performs the act upon herself upon the advice of a duly licensed physician that such is necessary to preserve her life or if she believes that a person performing the abortion is a duly licensed physician During more than seven hours of oftenemotional debate proponents of repeal decried abortion as murder and the deliberate killings of a human being Senator Jamses H Donovan Republican of Chadwicks who was the principal sponsor of the repeal bill called abortions the barbaric slaughter of innocents He said the more than 350000 abortions performed in New York City alone meant that we are exterminating one human life every three minutes round the clock New Yorks newest and most profitable business must be put out of existence in this state he said Abortion is not a victimless crime because the victim is the Jiving unborn infant During his speech Senator Donovan held up pictures of aborted fetuses and then had packets of the photographs bearing the notation what the unborn would like every legislator to know placed on each Senators desk This is lobbying during debate shouted Senator Joseph L Galiber Bronx Democrat Who authorized these pictures to be distributed After ruffled feelings were soothed the debate which had begun shortly before noon continued well into the early eve ning A Scientific Point Advocates of the present law which permits abortion on demand up to the 24th week of pregnancy argued that there was no way of determining scientifically at what point fetus could be considered a human being This is not a human being said Senator Roy M Goodman Manhattan republican It is a series of organisms which may eventually become a human being Mortality Rates Cited Senator Goodman said that because of the present law infant and maternal mortality rates had dropped sharply during the two years it has been in effect This has sharply etched the fact that the 1970 law was a lifegiving law he declared Opponents of repeal said that the Roman Catholic Church had organized a skillful hardhitting campaign to win repeal of the law Senator Manfred Ohrenstein Manhattan Democrat said he deplored the intrusion of religious beliefs into the issue You have no right to come to the floor of this body and ask us to enact into law church doctrine Senator Ohrenstcin said The church is seeking a confrontation here Early in the debate Senator Emanuel R Gold Queens Democrat had the Senate pages distribute wire coathangers to the other Senators Coathangers are often used in illegal abortions to scratch the internal wall of the uterus and cause the pregnancy to be terminated During the afternoon the Senate galleries were emptied of visitors as Capitol police searched the chamber for a bomb which a telephone caller said had been placed in the building The vote came after weeks of intense lobbying by righttolife groups that sought repeal and from womens liberation groups that advocated keeping the current Taw and in some cases even striking any abortion law from the books

Population Rebuff …,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/11/archives/population-rebuff-.html,Three years ago in a bold message to Congress President Nixon called for the expansion of family planning services in the United States and for the creation a commission to study the impact of population growth on the nation One of the most serious challenges to human destiny in the last third of this century will be the growth the population the President said Whether mans response to that challenge will be a cause for pride or for despair in the year 2000 will depend very much on what we do today Last March a distinguished Commission on Population Growth headed by John D Rockefeller 3d authorized by Congress and appointed by Mr Nixon offered sweeping response to the challenge the President had posited In a detailed threepart report the commission proposed that this country move toward zero population growth in order to preserve and enhance the quality of American life It also urged that the continuing migration out of rural areas be diverted from larger cities to smaller more manageable urban areas New educational programs in population problems and human sexuality were recommended along with improved maternal and child health programs increased research on fertility control more subsidized family planning programs and liberalized abortion laws Last week President Nixon gave this thoughtful report the back of his hand Although he said the report would be of great value in assisting governments at all levels of public policy the President did not indicate what provisions he found valuable nor did he suggest any actions his Administration might take in order to carry out its suggestions Instead he curtly dismissed two key recommendations in a way that appeared to ignore the conclusions carefully formulated in two years of study Thus Mr Nixon attacked the proposal for liberalized abortion laws as an unacceptable means of population control Yet the commission specifically prefixed this recommendation with an admonition of its own that abortion not be considered a primary means of fertility control Its argument was that abortion should be a matter of individual free choice a right the President indicated he supported in another context In a separate statement Mr Nixon went out of his way to attack New York States abortion law which his commission had cited as a model for the nation As the President observed the Population Commissions report raises questions involving moral judgments about which reasonable men will disagree But a report that addresses one of the most serious challenges human destiny in the last third of this century surely deserves a more reasoned and positive response from the Chief Executive who ordered it
News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/11/archives/aftermath-of-2-primaries-california-really-counts.html,OMAHA May 10After next Tuesday Senators Hubert H Humphrey and George McGovern plan to spend almost full time on the West Coast chiefly in California The reason is plain Nothing that happened in yesterdays primaries in West Virginia and here in Nebraska and nothing that is likely to happen in next Tuesdays balloting in Maryland and Michiganwill tellyery much about who is go ing to win the Democratic Presidential nomination And Californias June 6 will because 271 delegates will go to the winner The West Virginia results with Mr Humphrey defeating Gov George C Wallace almost exactly 2 to 1 demonstrated that the Alabama segregationist can after all make a bad primary showing somewhere After weeks of collecting more votes than anyone thought possible he got just what the professionals had guessedonethirdin West Virginia a border state whose population includes only 4 per cent blacks Just how sweeping Mr Humphreys victory there was will not be known until the delegate votes are counted and it can be seen whether he converted his popular strength into convention strength In any event it seems unlikely that West Virginia will help the Minnesotan much against Governor Wallace on Tuesday in Maryland and Michigan The Nebraska picture was more complex and more interesting involving as it did the two prime contenders for the nomination in their last intensive combat before the California battle If the Ohio primary last week constituted a standoff where Mr Humphrey the favorite narrowly avoided embarrassment then Nebraska constithted a standoff where Mr McGovern the favorite avoided embarrassment by only a slightly larger margin Won by 6 Points The South Dakotan won the preferential primary by 6 percentage points but trailed Mr Humphrey in delegates late today 10 to 12 No delegate votes had been tabulated however in Lancaster County Lincoln the states second largest county and Mr McGoverns strongest When they have been counted it appears possible that Mr McGovern could end up with a margin as large as 14 to 8 That would add up to a clear victory and it will be noted by McGovern partisans that Nebraska is a conservative state that gave Richard M Nixon his biggest percentages both in 1960 and 1968 But it is also true that Mr McGovern campaigned harder and organized more diligently here and that his home state lies right across Nebraskas northern border By those lights his victory was hardly dazzling with a helterskelter lastminute effort Senator Humphrey came close Referring to John F Kennedys success in disposing of the Catholic issue Frank Mankiewicz Mr McGoverns chief strategist said in Washington this morning Nebraska may well have been for Senator McGovern what West Virginia was for President Kennedy in 1960 It laid to rest some of the ugly charges that were made against him The Humphrey camp made an effort in the state to portray Mr McGovern as an advocate of legalized marijuana of more lenient abortion laws and of instant amnesty for draft resistersor alternately as a man who had once advocated such measures and now was trying to back down On Saturday Donald Knowles the Douglas County Omaha Attorney a key Humphrey backer accused Mr McGovern of talking out of both sides of his mouth Yesterday Kenneth P ODonnell a troubleshooter on the Humphrey national staff said McGoverns changing the abortion bit the marijuana bit and the amnesty bit Mr Mankiewicz and Gary Hart Mr McGoverns campaign director both argued that such tactics did not work Charges Hurt In the sense that Mr McGovern won they were right but the charges obviously hurt particularly in conservative urban Catholic areas of the kind the South Dakotan has been trying to convert He lost nearly 2 to 1 in Catholic south Omahas four wards Yet he carried Stanton and Curving Counties which have large German Catholic concentrations as well as Butler Saunders and Saline Counties the Catholic Bohemian Alps A big antiMcGovern vote in Cass and Sarpy Counties adjacent to Strategic Air Command Headquarters at Offut Air Force Base may have resulted from fears that his plans to cut the military budget would force closure of the base Mr Mankiewicz suggested that Mr McGoverns opponents would try next to picture him as an economic radical by at tacking his proposals for tax reform Mr Humphrey said in an interview last week that he would countenance no attacks but that he expected Mr McGoverns programs to be much more carefully examined now that he is taken seriously by everyone Mr McGovern will be far less subject to damage if he is viewed as a leftist in the remaining primaries he plans to contestMichigan Oregon New Jersey and California But a lingering radical image could hurt his efforts to swing uncommitted delegates behind him at the convention The biggest plus for Senator McGovern here was the demonstration thathe could appeal to farmers and rural folk He carried 63 of the 82 counties that might reasonably be called rural In Guide Rock Webster Countya grainfarming community of mixed ethnic origins he polled 50 per cent of the vote to Mr Humphreys 30 per cent There was no real index as to the effect of President Nixons announcement Monday night of the mining of North Vietnamese harbors Mr McGoverns polls and canvassing on Sunday and Monday before Mr Nixons speech had shown him with about a 5 per cent bulge which is about what he got The turnout in antiwar Lincoln site of the University of Nebraska was a little larger than expected but not enough so to demonstrate any great surge of McGovern strength

Nixon Aides Explain Aims Of Letter on Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/11/archives/nixon-aides-explain-aims-of-letter-on-abortion-law-white-house.html,WASHINGTON May 10A high White House official said today that President Nixon had not intendedintentionally or accidentallyto embarrass Governor Rockefeller by voicing his support for efforts to repeal New Yorks liberal abortion law In a letter last weekend to Cardinal Cooke who has spearheaded the Archdiocese of New Yorks campaign to repeal the abortion law Mr Nixon said that while the abortion issue lay outside the scope of Federal jurisdiction he wished to associate himself personally with Cardinal Cookes opposition to the law The President also called the repeal campaign a noble endeavor Sloppy Staff Work The letter released by the archidiocese on Saturday brought an immediate public outcry that Mr Nixon had improperly intervened in a local issue and according to sources had deeply wounded the Governor who has consistently opposed repeal Mr Rockefeller is chairman of the New York campaign committee to reelect the President and has recently voiced warm support for the President on a variety of issues In an interview today John D Ehrlichman the Presidents top adviser on domestic affairs said he had approved the letter on the condition that it remain private He said that someone else in the Presidents entouragewhom he did not identifyhad authorized the archdiocese to release the letter He called this decision a mistake and described it as sloppy staff work Similar recriminations were voiced elsewhere in the Administration One staff member close to Harry S Dent a key White House political adviser said no effort had been made to solicit Mr Dents opinion about the possible consequences of the letter The aide described the decision to permit the release of the letter as someones overzealous attempt to dramatize the Presidents views on abortion to New Yorks Catholic voters without regard to the sensitivities or position of the Governor In addition it could not be established that the White House had checked the letter with the Committee to Reelect the President whose chairman is John N Mitchell the former Attorney General Some sources inside the committee thought that such a check had not been conducted The New York State abortion law permits a woman to have an abortion on demand through the 24th week of pregnancy Mr Rockefeller has proposed that the legal abortion period be shortened to 18 weeks but he has said that he would veto any attempt at repeal of the abortion law What irritated some Nixon aides was the fact that the Presidents views on abortion as well as other issues to which Catholics are sensitive had been wellpublicized before he sent the letter their view the letter or at least its release was therefore an unnecessary political gesture In reconstructing the events leading up to M Nixons letter White House officials said that Cardinal Cooke had first written the President on the subject on April 4 The Cardinal expressed his opposition to the recommendations of the population commission but did not the officials acknowledged solicit Mr Nixons personal intervention in the fight to repeal the New York law Mr Ehrlichman said that if there was a reply to the Cardinals letter it was only perfunctory A couple of weeks later Patrick J Buchanan a Presidential speechwriter noticed an article in The New York Daily NeWS that described the growing struggle in New York over the abortion law and Cardinal Cookes efforts to repeal it Mr Buchanan included parts of the article in the news summary he prepares for the President every morning and shortly thereafter found himself assigned to draft a more complete reply to the Cardinal ThiS draft in turn made its way through regular White House channels including Mr Ehrlichmans domestic council and was approved by the President Suspicions persisted in some quarters here that the President fully intended that the letter or at least its substance be made public knowledge and simply underestimated or dismissed the embarrassment this would cause the Governor But Mr Ehrlichman said that when he gave final approval to send a letter it was his understandingand presumably the Presidentsthat it was to remain a private correspondence
… Buckling at Albany,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/11/archives/-buckling-at-albany.html,The State Legislature at Albany has proved itself a patsy for the most vocal pressure groups Votes in both the State Senate and Assembly on separate but controversial issues followed the sentiment of the crowds in the galleries rather than the larger public interest In one vote the Assembly first and then the Senate approved repeal of abortion law reform in another the Senate buckled to the bidding of the triallawyer lobby and rejected genuine nofault automobile insurance What is perhaps most distressing about repeal of abortion law reform by the legislators is that no argument was considered this year that had not already been considered two years ago when reform was enacted and annually before that when reform was steadily gathering support And the case for the new law had in the meanwhile been materially strengthened by the markedly improved maternal health record During recent debate medical authorities produced official statistics showing a precipitous decline in the number of illegal and dangerously botched abortions These records showed further that increasing numbers of women from all income levels have been availing themselves of legal abortions now performed by reputable doctors in medically approved circumstances The reform law has compelled no woman to have an abortion it has merely given women at all economic levels the choice of having a safe legal abortion In the past those women of more modest financial means have too often been forced to bear unwanted children or to resort to backalley abortion mills at great risk to themselves To repeal abortion law reform would be to return to these economically discriminatory legally coercive darker days Despite President Nixons unfortunate interference Governor Rockefeller is still under obligation to carry out his pledge to veto any repeal measure Not only did lawyermembers of the State Senate reject nofault automobile insurance they also passed a wholly specious substitute in its place In a travesty of representative democracy lawyers on the floor bowed to those in the galleries Nofault automobile insurance making recoveries almost automatic for motorists who are involved in accidents gave way to a measure that permits lawsuits almost automatically as at present This reversal may keep trial lawyers in business but it keeps the price of insurance unnecessarily high Again Governor Rockefeller has opposed the enactment of anything except genuine nofault automobile insurance reform We trust he will veto any fraudulent substitute

Assembly Approves $47‐Million In Funds for Parochial Schools,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/12/archives/assembly-approves-47million-in-funds-for-parochial-schools.html,ALBANY May 11The Assembly gave final legislative approval today to an amended parochialschool aid bill that could provide as much as 47million in state funds for nonpublic schools across the state The bill would provide as much as 4million a year for maintenance and repairs of nonpublic school buildings 5million to 25million in tuitionassistance payments to lowincome families with children in parochial schools and 10million to 15million in income tax benefits to families whose gross income is less than 25000 a year and who pay at least 50 a year in tuition In addition it would provide up to 3million in aid to districts that have to enroll students front nonpublic schools that are forced to close and an indeterminate amount for acquisition by the public sector of nonpublic school buildings that are forced to close Without debate the Senate amended the bill it had passed last week to increase by about 14million the 33million it had authorized The amended bill was taken up immediately after in the early evening by the Assetnbly for the first time this session Attempt at Subsidy The latest attempt to skirt the strictures against state aid to parochial schools in the State Constitution was denounced by Assemblyman Albert H Blumenthal Democrat of Manhattan as a tax invitation for a treasury raid The bill was a device to provide a subsidy to parochial schools even though the courts have already declared similar devices illegal Mr Blumenthal declared Proponents of the measure said it was needed to avoid further closings of financially pressed parochial schools and prevent an inundation of students into the public school system In its original version the bill provided state funds for maintenance and repair of nonpublic school buildings and for reimbursement of lowincome families for tuition up to 50 a year for children in elementary schools and 100 for children in secondary schools It also provided for tax credits for families with children in nonpublic schools The amended version would add aid for public schools in areas where public schools would have to absorb students as a result of the closing of parochial schools and would permit local school districts to purchase parochial school buildings that had to be closed The amendments would further provide income tax exclusions for parents with adjusted gross incomes of less than 25000 It would cover parents who pay tuition of at least 50 a year for each of their children in nonpublic schools who do not receive the tuitionassistance payment provided for in the original bill Issue of Constitutionality The income tax exclusion would be deducted from the parents state income tax return each year and would amount to up to 1001 for each childup to threeenrolled in grades 1 through 12 The amount is reduced as income increases Families earning less than 9000 would be eligible for the full exclusionwhich would be about 50 for each child The amended version deletes references to tax credits which were thought to be unconstitutional The amended bill was said to be constitutional However opponents to state aid to nonpublic schools said that the courts would strike down the new bill The Governor is expected to sign the bill and court challenges are anticipated In 1970 and 1971 the Legislature passed and the Governor signed bills for nonpublic school aid that gave state money purportedly for teachers salaries and for administrative functions Both were struck down as unconstitutional by the courts The bill approved today was sought as a way to put money into the faltering parochial school system Other action here included the following CIVIL SERVICE RAISES Both houses palsed and sent to the Governor a bill providing for a 4 per cent pay raise for the 140000 members of the Civil Service Employes Union and for other state employes The bill also provides for raises for judges across the state and for commissioners of state agencies CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION The Assembly gave final legislative approval to a resolution calling upon Congress to convene a constitutional convention to delete restrictions in the Constitution against public aid to nonpublic schools Opponents of the measure warned that the entire Constitution could be for revision if twothirds of states approved the call for a convention Other opponents called the move a publicity effort to show the voter that something was being done about aid to parochial schools TRANSPORTATION BILL Attorney General Louis J Lefkowitz urged defeat of a bill permitting the New York State Thruway Authority to sell bonds for the reconditioning and preservation of state highways Mr Lefkowitz called the move a complete plan of indebtedness payable from tax monies but all cloaked under a public authority structure The bill was later approved and sent to the Senate ABORTION REPEAL Supporters of the abortion repeal bill passed yesterday by the Senate urged Governor Rockefeller to sign the bill into law The Governor has said that he would veto the measure restoring a 19thcentury statute that allows abortions only to save the life of the mother The current law which would remain in effect if the Governor vetoes the bill permits abortion on demand up to the 24th week of pregnancy In a highly unusual debate on the floor of the chamber Assemblyman J Edward Meyer denounced Assemblyman Blumenthal as a liar for stating that pressurein the threat of primary fightshad been levied against members of the Westchester delegation Mr Blumenthal said that one member of the delegation had told him of the pressure and that Mr Meyer changed his position on abortion repeal just before the debate and had accepted the endorsement of the Conservative party which threatened to field a candidate against him NYU BRONX CAMPUS The Senate gave final legislative approval to a bill authorizing the City University to purchase the Bronx Campus of New York University and to authorize the merger of the NYU Engineering School with the Polytechnic

Dacca Raising the Status of Women While Aiding Rape Victims,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/12/archives/dacca-raising-the-status-of-women-while-aiding-rape-victims.html,DACCA Bangladesh May 11Officially sponsored efforts to assist the thousands of victims of rape by Pakistani soldiers in Bangladesh are being expanded into a national program to advance the status of women generally In this conservative Moslem country women in orthodox families are traditionally secluded An organization called the National Board of the Bangladesh Womens Rehabilitation Program appointed recently by Prime Minister Sheik Mujibur Rahman has set up headquarters in Dacca for a nationwide training project to prepare village women for jobs 200000 Victims Reported Among the 1500 who have applied for job training here so far are many housewives who have never been out of their homes before and dont know what the outside world looks like according to the chairman of the National Board Justice K M Subhan of the Dacca High Court Most of the applicants Justice Subhan said in a recent interview come from homes where all the men were killed by Pakistani troops ACcording to official estimates at least 200000 Bengali women and girls were raped by Pakistani soldiers during ninemonth reign of terror aimed at putting down political dissddence The intervention of India led to the twoweek war in which the Pakistani province became the independent republic of Bangladesh There are reports circulating in Dacca that systematic rape was a policy of the occupying army The object according to these accounts was to produce a large number of children with non  Bengali fathers to dilute the prevailing Bengali nationalism The thousands of pregnancies resulting from the rapes created a very delicate and sensitive social problem in this overwhelmingly Moslem nation high Bangladesh official said recently Foreign specialists sent here by the International Planned Parenthood Federation and other agencies to perform abortions have found that few of those made pregnant by rape will come forward because they are reluctant to have their condition known Abortion Techniques Taught Dr Geoffrey Davis of the International Abortion Research and Training Center in London who has visited villages throughout the country to instruct physicians in abortion techniques says he heard of countless instances of suicide by pregnant girls and many cases in which unwanted babies were disposed of by drowning or other means Dr Davis an Australian made a conservative estimate that at least 5000 pregnancies caused by the rapes had been terminated by crude but effective indigenous methods He said that while gynecologic complications were common in such cases fatalities had been rare About 100 abortions were performed in the first month at the clinic opened by Dr Davis in Dacca under the auspices of the Planned Parenthood Federation An increasing nurn ber are being performed scientifically in 17 major outlying centers he said Many victims of rape from more affluent Bengali families have had abortions performed quietly in Calcutta it is said The number of babies that have been born and have survived is unknown since the families often keep the births secret Adoptions Hampered The abused women dont want their position to be advertised said Mrs Sultana Islam president of the Bangladesh Womens 2 Federation which is helping the rape victims who are referred to officially as war heroines The secrecy has hampered the efforts of International Social Service and other agencies that arrange the adoption of unfortunate children Widespread venereal infection sharply reduces the chance that children born of rape will be adopted fl according to Dr Davis Almost every rape victim tested had a venereal disease he said The abortion program will be ended by August the last month in which a birth can take place as a result of rape during the Pakistani regime Meanwhile advanced pregnancies are being terminated almost up to time of normal birth by a method developed in Britain about two years ago according to Dr Davis The technique involves severing the umbilical cord to cause the death of the fetus which is then stillborn naturally but faster easier and with less risk than in normal labor he said High Dowries Sought About 10000 former freedom fightersBengali guerrillas in the war against Pakistan  and others have responded to a plea by the Prime Minister for young men to marry the war heroines said Justice Subhan But the project has failed because of what he termed the fantastic demands of the wouldbe bridegrooms for dowries as well as the re luctance of the women to come forward Meanwhile the United Nations Childrens Emergency Fund has given several hundred sewing machines and about a million yards of cloth to get the rehabilitation program started with a sewing project It is in the Interest of the community to emancipate women from the household said Odert Von Schoultz a representative of the International Planned Parenthood Federation Mi Von Schoultz a Swede and his wife a feminist who prefers to be called Mrs Ana Maria her given names are advisers on the rehabilitation program Statistically it is proven that working women have fewer children said Mr Vor Schoultz In Bangladesh where the birth rate is three per cent if we dont make jobs for women we shall have to create more jobs for their sons

League of Women Voters Looks to Young,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/13/archives/league-of-women-voters-looks-to-young-league-of-women-voters-here.html,The problem that the League of Women Voters of New York City faces of course is to project its relevancy in a time of womens liberation says the president Nicky Leave out Mrs Arnold Hellerthe whole emphasis is women running on their own steam Heller There is for instance the fact that the average age of the leagues members here is 50 years old which makes it difficult for the league to attract young women fresh from college Still on the wall of the leagues office at 817 Broadway is a large art nouveauposter proclaimine the league It hangs next to a much older much smaller blueandgold needlepoint plaque that says League of Women Voters To the women who toil there the poster and plaque hanging near each other are symbols of the new and old league with the emphasis certainly on the new Broad Involvement And the new issues while perhaps not as exciting as those espoused by the womens liberation movement are surely relevant For beyond voter registration the league is now advocating such things as familyassistance legislation equalemployment opportunities ecology soil policing and liberal foreign trade policies There is a need for places to put people said Nicky Heller Thats not an easy issue but its important and its long range Nonpartisan doesnt mean nonpartisan on issues The league also watches government spending both here and in Albany and devotes many of its Facts  Issues reports to such problems as water pollution There are other groups the league feels working on the headline issues such as abortion laws More important even than the voting drives and the issues is the leagues role in teaching women how to be effective in organizing and in carrying out a mild sort of civic guerrilla warfare Cadre a Goal Indeed one of the leagues main functions is to turn out a cadre of women who know how to move government for as Nicky Heller said the feeling is that league memDetail of poster of The Woman Suffrage Party of Manhattan precursor of League of Women Voters bership should leave each member with the ability to be effective to realize that they have to work on a specific problem In short league members are supposed to infiltrate other organizations with their knowhow This goes back to the leagues beginnings in 1919 shortly after women won the right to vote We wanted to educate women on how to use the vote the president said But we quickly found out that not only did women not know how to use the vote neither did men You want to know what our biggest contribution is Its teaching people that theyve got to keep watching the government all the time to get it to do the right thing in the first place and then theyve got to keep watching to make sure it continues to do the right thing We tell people they have a role to play and in a country where only 45 per cent of the people voted in 1970 thats important We have a strong role to play in explaining to people that if they dont vote that means someone else votes twice The Leagrie of Women Voters of New York City has 3500 members iri 23 branch chapters in the city All but two of the branches represent geographic locations One of these two branches is made up of Spanishspeaking women and the other is for women who are working and must meet in the evening The organizations budget for the year is 140000 Most of the money comes from contributions with the remainder provided by dues which are 10 a year Nicky Heller is in the middle of a twoyear term as presidedth The position is full time but nonsalaried She is a graduate of Adelphi College class of 1946 and of the New York School of Social Work Columbia University where she received her masters degree in 1951 I remember being told in college Young ladies when you leave Adelphi the very first thing you must do is join the League of Women Voters she recalled From the time she first joined the league she said the organization has always been somewhat split between those members who want to move faster on issues and those who do not But generally the league has stuck to the proposition that its politital effectiveness comes from the fact that its opinion is informed The city league is now for instance conducting a study on the question of centrahzation or decentralization of city services The study may take a long time to complete but in the end it will be complete and from it the league will adopt positions that it will fight for in the City Council and in the State Legislature Much of the leagues prestige and influence has stemmed from the exactness and fairness of these league studies and from the fact that many citizens actually carry league recommendations on amendments into the voting booth on Election Day In the long run its much more fun to get up and rant and rave about things Nicky Heller said But if you dont do that with an awful lot of information behind your you dont get very far The league president is a small ebullient woman who skitters about the leagues office firing off orders gathering in reports speaking on the nearest available telephone Her husband a manufacturer and her three children all encourage her in her 9to5 work at the league and she would like to see the organization opened to men But last month

MESKILL SEEKING LAW ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/13/archives/meskill-seeking-law-on-abortion-calls-legislators-to-hartford-as.html,HARTFORD May 12  Gov Thomas J Meskill summoned the General Assembly today to a special session beginning next Tuesday to write an abortion law to replace the old one that has been struck down as unconstitutional The Governor acted on the emotioncharged issue almost as soon as he learned that Justice Thurgood Marshall of the United States Supreme Court had denied Connecticuts request for a stay of a lower courts ruling that the states 1860 abortion statute was unconstitutional I am very disappointed Governor Meskill said The state will have to look now to the General Assembly to give it a new law The General Assembly had adjourned on May 3 At that time the state was seeking a stay of the District Court ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Governor Meskill who is Roman Catholic said at the closing session of the Assembly with both chambers sitting together In the unhappy event that the motion is denied I will issue a call for a session This is too Important an issue to be left in limbo for a long period of time he said On Tuesday Connecticut was granted a temporary stay by the Circuit Court in New York altering the situation that had existed since April 18 when a threejudge District Court panel in Hartford ruled 2to1 that the old abortion law in Connecticut was unconstitutional The Hartford decision said among other things We conclude that the states interests are insufficient to take from a woman the decision after conception whether she will bear a child and that she as the appropriate decision maker must be free to choose Governor Meskili did not say today how he thought any new bill the General Assembly might pass would get around the principle laid down in that ruling The way is still open technically for the state to appeal to the full Supreme Court but the state could not expect its appeal to be heard until after the court returns from its summer recess Before then the Supreme Courts views should be known from two abortion cases that have been argued and are awaiting decision Six other abortion cases are pending In the brief that the states Attorney General Robert K Killian prepared for the Supreme Court it was argued that the unborn had the right to life and that the state could not function without legislation As a result of this decision the State of Connecticut is now without any effective legislation whatsoever to protect the life of an unborn child at any stage of its development the brief said of the District Court ruling Accordingly the rights and liabilities of the mother the unborn child physicians health institutions and other interested parties are in doubt and in jeopardy it added Governor Meskills views on abortion are well known in the state He regards it as murder whether performed by a surgeon or as he said by an old woman with a hatpin in a dirty alley His letter summoning the legislators to the special session was being delivered by state troopers tonight
GOVERNOR VETOES ABORTION REPEAL AS NOT JUSTIFIED,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/14/archives/governor-vetoes-abortion-repeal-as-not-justified-tells-legislature.html,ALBANY May 13  In a strong denunciation of the personal vilification and political coercion that surrounded the issue Governor Rockefeller fulfilled a pledge today and vetoed the Legislatures repeal of the states liberalized abortion law The Governors action meant that the current abortion law passed in 1970 which permits a woman to have an abortion on demand until the 24th week of pregnancy remains intact at least until next year In dooming the bill that would have abolished the current law and restored the Text of Governors message is printed on Page 62 states previous abortion statute which allowed an abortion only when a mothers life was jeopardized Mr Rockefeller said I can see no justification now for repealing this reform and thus condemning hundreds of thousands of women to the dark age once again The Legislature which adjourned last night was under heavy electionyear pressure in recent weeks from the Roman Catholic Church and right to life groups around the state to abolish the present law As the momentum to let a repeal bill be debated built up Mr Rockefeller attempted to head off the effort by announcing that he would veto a repealer but would sign a bill that modified the present law and permitted elective abortions until the 18th week of pregnancy Governor Is Disturbed But the antiabortion groups were not assuaged by this move and said that it was a numbers game and that the only measure they endorsed was legislation restoring the old statute Those who favored revocation of the current law received suppdrt last week when the Archdiocese of New York released the text of a letter President Nixon had sent Cardinal Cooke In the letter the President allied himself with opponents of the liberalized state law Mr Nixon said in the letter to the Cardinal that I would personally like to associate myself with the convictions you deeply feel and eloquently express Mr Rockefeller who is the Presidents reelection campaign chairman in the state was reported to have been disturbed by the release of the Presidents letter in light of his vow to veto a bill repealing the 1970 abortion law In midweek John D Ehrlichman the Presidents top adviser on domestic affairs attempted to smooth over the issue by saying that the letter was intended as private correspondence and that granting permission to the archdiocese to publicize the letter was a result of sloppy staff work Cardinal Cooke expressed his profound regret at the Governors veto In a statement issued by the chancery the Cardinal said Today is a day of great sorrow and regret for us and for so many men and women of goodwill in our state After so many hurdles and setbacks this week our Legislature came so close to restoring the principle of human life to the law of the State of New York It was encouraging to see the Legislature recognizing that a governments responsibility is to protect life not to allow its destruotion The White House said today there would be no comment on the veto In his veto message the Governor alluded to the electionyear pressure that was applied in obtaining the Legislatures approval7968 in the Assembly and 3027 in the Senateof the repeal of the 1970 law when he said I fully respect the moral convictions of both sides in this painfully sensitive controversy But the extremes of personal vilification and political coercion brought to bear on members of the Legislature raise serious doubts that the votes to repeal the reforms represented the will of a majority of the people of New York State 13 Hours of Debate When the abortion issue was debated for a total of 13 hours by both houses this week reports circulated in the Capitol that some of those who voted for repeal did so as an electionyear expediency and not because of personal abhorrence of the law According to the reports these legislators voted for repeal because they were confident of the Governors veto The debate in the legislature covered the entire emotional range surrounding the issue of abortioncertainly one of the touchiest issues that has come before the lawmakers The arguments ranged from unresolved questions about when human life actually begins to allegations that the Roman Catholic Church was trying to have its doctrines translated into state law In his veto message the Governor said that the very intensity of this debate has generated an emotional climate in which the truth about abortions and the present state abortion law have become distorted almost beyond recognition Reverting to the old state abortion law the Governor said would result in those who could afford abortions seeking them elsewhere while the poor would again be seeking abortions at a grave risk to life in backroom abortion mills Mr Rockefeller noted that the present law did not compel abortions but instead allowed persons who wanted them to obtain them under medically sound conditions I do not believe it right for one group to impose its vision of morality on an entire society the Governor said Nor he added is it just or practical for the state to attempt to dictate the innermost personal beliefs and conduct of its citizens
Leaders of Organized Labor Remain Largely Hostile to McGovern's Candidacy,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/14/archives/leaders-of-organized-labor-remain-largely-hostile-to-mcgoverns.html,WASHINGTON May 13Although Senator George McGovern of South Dakota is beginning to pick up scraps of support among trade union officials in his bid for the Democratic Presidential nomination the leadership of organized labor across the country remains largely hostile This hostility may not be inalterable A grudging reassessment of the Senator as a viable opponent for President Nixon has been acknowledged by some labor leaders following Mr McGoverns tough campaigning and unexpected successes in the primary elections thus far Heed is being taken of the fact that the Senator seems to have attracted some of the protest vote of the alienated blue collar workers who otherwise might have turned to Gov George C Wallace the Alabama segregationist Humphrey Preferred But talks with a crosssection of national and local union officials the last few days indicate that the labor leader shipfrom American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations head quarters here in Washington through the state and local levelsoverwhelmingly prefers Senator Hubert H Humphrey of Minnesota as the Democratic candidate and views Senator McGovern with coolness at best and often with suspicion George Meany the president of the AFLCIO has said he will support any Democrat except Governor Wallace against President Nixon But Mr Meanys aides indicate that he has little enthusiasm for Senator McGovern despite several personal peace overtures by the South Dakotan The political preferences of labor leaders do not necessarily influence the vote of rank and file workers But it is union leadership that supplies money and organization power to favored candidates So far the only head of a large national union to endorse Mr McGovern is A F Grospiron president of the Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers Union A few more highranking union chiefs have hinted they will soon come out for Mr McGovern including some of those who previously supported Senator Edmund S Muskie of Maine who has dropped out of the primaries Senator McGovern is favored by the handful of union leaders who have openly opposed the war in Vietnam But barring some unforeseen circumstance such as a landslide in the California primary Senator McGovern is not likely to pick up much more than the crumbs of labor leadership support left on Mr Muskies vacated table Frank Mankiewicz Mr McGoverns campaign director said in an interview that labor would get behind Mr McGovern after we win the nomination The talks with labor leaders indicate that this would be largely true but that the support would not be as wholehearted nor as widespread as it would be for Senator Humphrey Hostility Baffling Mr Mankiewicz also said that he was at a loss to understand the hostility of labor leaders particularly in view of evidence that workers are voting for Mr McGovern in the primaries But the reasons for labors antipathy to Senator McGovern as indicated in the talks with labor leaders make a formidably long list They include the following Labor leaders including Mr Meany have not forgotten or forgiven Mr McGoverns 1966 vote on an effort in the Senate to repeal section 14 b of the TaftHartley law the so called right to work section The union chiefs still insist Mr McGovern doublecrossed them by voting against a motion to end a filibuster against the repeal after promising to back labor on the vital issue of the right to a union shop Senator McGovern met with Mr Meany late last summer to express his regret over the 14 b vote and to say he wished he had never made such a mistake But so far 14 b is a black mark on his ledger Mr Humphrey is a known quantity to the labor leaders who regard him with trust and affection and have supported him for nearly a quarter of a century as a downtheline prolabor politician Mr McGovern while having a generally good labor record is still an unknown quantity and not neces sarity a reliable labor man On a showdown issue explained a high AFLCIO official we know that Hubert is money in the bank The labor leaders say they fear that Mr McGovern will polarize the Democratic party the way Senator Barry Goldwater did the Republicans in 1964 and lose the election so badly that he will carry with him to defeat local and state Democratic slates Labor relies heavily on these local governments for support on bread and butter issues Senator McGoverns clear position on ending the war in Vietnam brings him in direct conflict with Mr Meany and other labor leaders Mr Meany and many of his lieutenants remain relatively hawkish on the war being stanchly antiCommunist and supporting the President in his conduct of foreign affairs as a matter of patriotism Many labor leaders identify Senator McGovern with the New Left politics within the Democratic party that they insist played a major role in defeating Mr Humphrey in the 1968 election The people around him are the same ones that flocked to Eugene McCarthy four years ago complained one officer of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union a union traditionally liberal in its political preferences Labor also professes irritation at what they see as Mr McGoverns championing of New Left causes such as amnesty for draft evaders legalized abortion and easing of criminal penalties for marijuana offenders One highranking AFLCIO official commented that he personally agreed with Mr McGovern on these issues but they were not crucial and that by harping on them the South Dakotan was losing a lot of blue collar votes However Mr McGovern has contended strongly particularly in the Nebraska primary that his position has been misunderstood on these controversial issues A number of the labor leaders declared they were turned off by some of the young staff people surrounding Sena for McGovern describing them as arrogant elitist and zealots The union leader who had endorsed Senator Muskie related that he had been rebuffed by one of the young activists on Mr McGoverns staff when he offered his services after Mr Muskie announced his withdrawal from the primaries Some of the labor leaders said that they simply could not warm personally to Senator McGovern the way they do to Senator Humphrey Mr McGovern they say is too cold and preachy Mr Meany and other leaders were reported as virtually climbing the walls with rage after reading an interview in which Mr McGovern was quoted as saying that just as he had conceded he had I made a mistake on the 14 b vote so Mr Meany should ac knowledge that he had made a mistake in supporting the Vietnam war Mr Mankiewicz said that the remark had been made jocularly but the fact that AFLCIO headquarters reacted so strongly is perhaps an indication of how Mr McGovern is regarded there FenceMending Planned However Senator McGovern still hopes for a rapproachement with Mr Meany and other top leaders of organized labor Mr Mankiewicz said The South Dakotan will seek to mend his fences in meetings with the labor leaders although not necessarily at the summit Mr Mankiewicz declared Grounds for peace talks do exist The labor leaders give Senator McGovern good marks for his early attacks on President Nixons new economic program At AFLCIO headquarters Mr McGovern is praised for his clear stand on busing in contrast with what is regarded as waffling by Mr Humphrey on the issue I could go for McGovern said an AFLCIO official But first he has to prove to me he can win the election So far he hasnt
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/14/archives/on-this-issue-even-legislators-can-be-sincere-abortion.html,ALBANYLow politics and high emotions comingled in the Legislature last week on the highly volatile issue of abolishing the states liberalized abortion law Despite Governor Rockefellers repeated remarks that he would veto a total repeal of the law which permits a woman an elective abortion up to the 24th week of pregnancy the Senate and Assembly spent a total of 13 hours debating a repeal bill And then bowing to the pressure of socalled Right to Life groups as well as strong prods from the Roman Catholic hierarchy both Houses passed the repeal bill restoring the 19th century state law permitting an abortion only when a mothers life was jeopardized The biggest windfall that antiabortion legislators and groups received came last weekend when the Archdiocese of New York released a letter President Nixon sent to Cardinal Cook The President wrote that he was opposed to elective abortions and would personally like to associate myself with the convictions you deeply feel and eloquently express The Nixon letter caused more than a flutter in the Rockefeller administration The Governor who is the Presidents state campaign chairman for reelection and who later in the week went out West to sing Nixonian hosannas was reported to have been very upset by the unusual intrusion of the President in a state legislative fight The corridor pols in the Capitol mulled the whole incident over typical Nixon some said and not bad way to woo a large segment of Roman Catholic voters But what about the difficult position this put the Governor in Would he retrench Repeated inquiries of his press spokesman elicited the same response The Governor would veto a repealer Any questions on the Nixon letter were met with We are referring all calls to the White House on this Finally John D Ehrlichman the Presidents top adviser on domestic affairs spoke up Mr Nixon had not Intended intentionally or accidentally to embarrass Nelson Rockefeller Mr Ehrlichman said adding that the letter had been approved on the condition that it remain private Someone else in the Presidential retinueunnamed gave the archdiocese permission to make the Nixon missive public Mr Ehrlichman said and it was all written off to sloppy staff work Mr Ehrlichmans apologia had at least one desired effect according to gubernatorial sources Mr Rockefeller had been mollified On Tuesday the Assembly debated the bill for six hours in the glare of the TV lights The Senate devoted seven hours on Wednesday to a wide ranging discussion There were musings in both Houies over the profound question of when life begins Senate Majority Leader Earl W Brydges Niagara Falls Republican I dont know how to measure the beginning of life except at the point of conception I have no other bench mark Once we leave the concept of life beginning at the point of conception then we are lost at sea There were charges by opponents of repeal that the Legislature was being used by one religious group to inscribe its doctrines into law while other religious groups differed strongly Rochester Republican Senator Thomas Laverne I in good conscience and my moralityI could not recommend it [abortion] Thats my point of view and of my church and I agree with it But I cannot impose my view on everyone as a point of law There were arguments that repeal was another slap at the poor who could not hop a plane and fly somewhere where abortions were legal and so would be forced to have unwanted children or else resort to butchers Republican Assemblywoman Constance E Cook of Ithaca The issue is not whether we have abortion in this state but where we will have it in a hospital or a motel room It was pointed out repeatedly that the 1970 law does not mandate abortions and that for the maledominated Legislature to impose its will on women was just another glaring example of male chauvinism Democratic Assemblywoman Mary Anne Krupsak of Amsterdam Gentlemen you cannot become pregnant You cannot understand that You dont respect women or you would never introduce a bill of this sort On and on it wentwith some lawmakers illustrating their diatribes with coat hangers pictures of aborted fetuses and in one instance in the Assembly a jar containing the preserved remains of an abortion On Saturday returning from his West Coast campaigning for Mr Nixon the Governor did what he had said all along he would do He vetoed the abortion repealer Meanwhile the issue of abortion was heating up in neighboring Connecticdt Last month the United States District Court struck down the states ancient and restrictive antiabortion statute Last Friday Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marahall rejected request by the state to stay the lower courts ruling pending appeal As a result Connecticut was left with no abortion statute in force And so Gov Thomas J Meskill called the General Assembly into special session this Tuesday to write a new abortion law one he himself hopes will be as strong as the one the courts have struck down For Governor Meskill is a vehement opponent of liberalized abortion He considers abortion to be murder whether performed by a surgeon in a hospital or by an old woman with a hatpin in a dirty alley WILLIAM E FARRELL

She Reports East Brunswick News and Loves,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/14/archives/she-reports-east-brunswick-news-and-loves-it.html,EAST BRUNSWICKI live my job and love it This fact dawns on me every Tuesday night when leave the paper after putting in two 13hour days preceded by a Sunday of telephone calls that exasperate my family For what else but a love of what I am doing could account for the fact that there is still a bounce in my middleaged step late Tuesday night Working as the editor of a weekly newspaper is a ridiculous wonderful underpaid harassing satisfying job This is especially true if one writes about the town in Avhich she livesas I do in East Brunswick a community that has experienced every growing pain known to suburbia in its trek from a population of 5000 in 1950 to 36000 in 1972 With a projected population of 70000 by 1980 problems and stories Are everywhere I cannot in fact go out of the house without the possibility of stumbling on a story I cannot walk down my street without meeting someone who knows something fit to print In a local paper or drive down the nearest state highway without seeing something that will form the nucleus of A story Letter in a Bottle So fleveral weeks ago when my 12yearold had friends in for snacks I did not blink en eye when found a letter to the editor tucked in an empty Coke bottle on the kitchen table It was not unusual Letters to the editor have been handdelivered to me in the local health club sauna whipped out from under the towel draping the woman next to rne in the ladies room of a local restaurant pushed under the john stall by an unknown hand and in the municipal swimming pool damp but readable The letter from my daughters little friend read To the Editor Something should be done about the food at Churchill Junior High School The lunch ladies do not wear nets and me and my friends have found pieces of hair in our food It was printed on April 26 below a letter complaining about a lack of longrange planning Feedback from the school car pool told me that someone had brought the letter to the health class and hairnets were now being worn All feedback is not so innocuous or encouraging And so I have found it wise to be away from the house on Wednesdaypublication day and my day off I usually set that day aside for household errands but even a trip to the supermarket can be almost all business No Meat Bribe One recent Wednesday for instance I made my first story contact in front of the ketchup where I met a PTA member who asked if I would include a meeting notice in the papers community calendar Quickly she took an old checkout tape from her purse and wrote down the information I was putting her notice in my purse when the meat manager joined us He said he had something for me and disappeared into the meat department For one wild moment thought he was going to bribe me with a piece of meat for free publicity I was toying with the idea of holding out for a rib roast when he returned bearing a piece of paper On it was written Thats Saul there is there isnt anymore He explained that he was giving me this ending for my column without charge Fight Dicussed I thanked him tucked the paper in with the PTA notice turned around and bumped into our local councilwoman She started to talk about the latest fight against garden apartments East Brunswick people are very provincial once they move here from Jersey City Newark or New York they want to lock the township gates forever So the fight against multiple housing is a continuing one When she left I noticed I had been in the store 45 minutes And what did I have One PTA notice a new ending for my column assorted political tidbitsand a bottle of ketchup Being surrounded by the people you write about has other drawbacks  especially for ones children Ten years ago I came into this business with a column on how it felt to be 40 years old My child who was then in the second grade came home and announced that the kids had figured out that I was the oldest mother in the second grade Nothing has changed since then except the attitude of my children When they were in grade school my work was toler ated in junior high it was considered disgraceful in senior high it seems forgivable My youngest child is still in junior high By agreement with her I do not go into the school for stories  no matter who asks God Helps Us Even so last month when she was late reaching a study center and was stopped by an instructional aide East Brunswick schools are now in their paraprofessional period having passed through cross gradegrouping homogeneous grouping the new math movable classroom partitions and a variety of other meaningful innovations and asked if she was related to me I feel that it was a mark of my childs character she did not disown me Your mother the aide said well Im going to give you a slip for loitering [not getting to class before the bell rings] and then God help us all Actually she didnt have to call on Him for long ago I learned to stay clear of the schools unless I was planning an upbeat feature I do of course write extensively on schoolboard elections bond issues etc but teachers do not seem to get uptight about that This kind of job also presents a hazard to friendship Sooner or later a close friend writes a letter to the paper explaining that the editor is a nut It is usually harlddelivered by the friend who explains that she hopes you wont take it personally Cool is kept but by the time the second letter arrives one remembers how many glasses of Scotch this bosom companion swilled on the back porch last summer and its all downhill from there Friends also try to be helpful I remember one who took issue with my calling a council member an independent thinker She felt he was a dissonant thinker and told me so whenever we meton 15 different occasions Today I couldnt write of the Declaration of  Pressures of the Job The local political scene which receives a great deal of coverage in a local weekly can be a sticky business too especially when candidates whom you may not support are neighbors friends or your dentists brother And no large city political battle can get any more vitriolic than the one in suburbia The rule of thumb here is to accept that one can never be in a state of grace with elected officials except or a few minutes now and then The job itself brings hard relentless pressure of knowing one is responsible for the front page editorials features and in my case a weekly column Failing to get the story there is no Associated Press dispatch to bail one out There Is also the hairtearing knowledge that the big gest story of the year is probably going to break the day after the weekly is published that six out of seven days someone else is writing the news But if the scoop is not for the weekly its place is taken by a thoroughness that is equally rewarding The weekly editor can write the story comment on it in an editorial and dummy it if she wishes Because of the nature of the business her story will often be the story behind the facts And if she writes about her own town she has the chance to affect the place she calls home Make no mistake writing for a weekly is a serious business The writers of the Sentinel Publishing Company covering 11 towns circulation 80000 where I am an associate editor are a highly educated group of professionals During my 10 years at the paper I have never been censored I have written editorials on abortion reform planned parenthood the civil rights of blacks and women the need for lowcost housing and the sterility of our vacuumedpacked allwhite suburbs long before these issues were popular So what does it matter if someone calls me on Easter Day to ask for a story on the

Text of Abortion‐Bill Veto,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/14/archives/text-of-abortionbill-veto.html,ALBANY May 13Following is the text of Governor Rockefellers message to the Legislature vetoing repeal of the states liberalized abortion law The same strong reasons that ledline to recommend abortionlaw reform in my annual message  for 196869 and 1970 and to sign into law the reform that was ultimately adopted in 1970 now compel me to disapprove the bill just passed that would would repeal that reform The abortionlaw reform of 1970 grew out of the recommendations of an outstanding select citizens committee representative of all affected parties that I appointed in 1968 Under the distinguished leadership of retired Court of Appeals Judge Charles W Froessel the select committee found that the thenexisting 19thcentury neartotal prohibition against abortion was fostering hundreds of thousands of illegal and dangerous abortions It was discriminating against women of modest means who could not afford an abortion haven and the often frightened unwed confused young woman It was promoting hypocrisy and ultimately human tragedy Connecticut Case Cited I supported the majority recommendations of the Froessel committee throughout the public debate of this issue extending over three years until the Legislature acted to reform the states archaic abortion law I can see no justification now for repealing this reform and thus condemning hundreds of thousands of women to the dark age once again There is further the recent Federal court decision invalidating the Connecticut abortion law which is substantially the same as the prereform New York law The law of that case if upheld would clearly invalidate the old New York law as well were the repeal of abortion reform allowed to stand In such a circumstance this state would be left with no law on the subject at all I fully respect the moral convictions of both sides in this painfully sensitive controversy But the extremes of personal vilification and political coercion brought to bear on members of the Legislature raise serious doubts that the votes to repeal the reform has represented the will of a majority of the people of New York State Risk to Life Seen The very intensity of this debate has generated an emotional climate in which the truth about abortions and about the present state abortion law have become distorted almost beyond recognition The truth is that this repeal of the 1970 reform would not end abortions It would only end abortions under safe and supervised medical conditions The truth is that a safe abortion would remain the optional choice of the welltodo woman while the poor would again be seeking abortions at a grave risk to life in backroom abortion mills The truth is that under the present law no woman is compelled to undergo an abortion Those whose personal and religious principles forbid abortion are in no way compelled against their convictions under the present law Every woman has the right to make her own choice I do not believe it right for one group to impose its vision of morality on an entire society Neither is it just or practical for the state to attempt to dictate the innermost personal beliefs and conduct of its citizens The bill is disapproved
Mayor Assails Albany on Judgeships,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/14/archives/mayor-assails-albany-on-judgeships.html,Mayor Lindsay declared yesterday that he would refuse to put up city money to pay for eight new State Supreme Court justices whose positions were created by the State Legislature in its closing hours on Friday He called on Governor Rockefeller to veto what he called a pork barrel deal by the Republican leadership In a statement Mr Lindsay said the Legislature had created 30 new Supreme Court judgeships in the city in the last three years while rejecting proposals this year for court reform He quoted Chief Judge Stanley Fuld of the Court of Appeals as asserting six months ago that there was no need for more such judges The Mayor said the eight Supreme Court justices with their supporting staffs would cost 1120000 In city tax funds if they were used only in civil cases and 5600000 if they were all used in cruxal cases in which probation officers assistant district attorneys and Legal Aid Society counsel would have to be provided Court Action Possible If Governor Rockefeller signs the bill Mayor Lindsays attitude could lead to a court action to force the city to pay for its share of the new costs Michael J Dontzin counsel to the Mayor said the city had lost some such cases in whole and some only in part dating back at least to the administration of Mayor F H La Guardia and the city had oboyed the resulting court orders For instance Mayor La Guardia was blocked in an attempt to cut salaries of Supreme Court justices starting Nov 2 1939 despite his sworn plea of financial difficulties He was also forced to pay staff salaries fixed by Supreme Court justices in Brooklyn for the year starting July 1 1944 Involved in the Legislatures action would be creation of two new justices each in Manhattan the Bronx Brooklyn and Staten Island Each justice in the first three boroughs receives 40833 in salary a year while those on Staten Island receive 39100 of these totals 16000 is borne by the city and the est by the state Mr Dontzin estimated that with supporting staffs the cost of a justice in civil cases would be 140000 a year and in criminal cases 700000 exchiding in the criminal cases a state contribution to the cost of probation officers While seeking the new veto Mayor Lindsay commended Governor Rockefeller for already vetoing yesterday two other bills  one of which would have repealed the present elective abortion law while the other would have blocked construction of the controversial Forest Hills housing project But on the judgeship bill Mayor Lindsay who was spending part of the day at City Hall said I cannot and will not authorize the appropriation of city taxlevy monies He added that the annual costs he cited were not even considering capital costs for extra courtrooms and other facilities The Republican leadership the Mayors statement went on pushed through these additional state judges without pro viding the necessary funds to pay these costs in an action that only compounds the severe disregard shown by the Republican leadership for 8000000 New Yorkers They fail to provide the necessary state aid to meet the citys needs and then they impose additional costs upon us by forcing the city to pay for state judges who are part of a state system Backlogs Continue Despite 25 new Supreme Court Justices added three years ago and five more last year the Mayor said There have been evergrowing backlogs and delays in the disposition of felony cases in the State Supreme Court with the resulting overcrowding in the citys prisons This year he went on the Legislature rejected all proposals for better management of state courts better state court procedures and better methods for selecting state judges Mr Dontzin the Mayors counsel said the Legislature did appropriate 3million in state money for emergency processing of felony cases in New York City and that some of this might be used to pay for the new judges Otherwise he said it would take new legislation to reduce any city payment for the mandated judges The city now has 131 Supreme Court justices including those sitting in the Appellate Division Separately Mayor Lindsay hailed the Federal decision to enforce 1975 automobile antipollution standards and credited Corporation Counsel J Lee Rankin with presenting the major legal arguments He said the citys Air Resources Department had already operated cars meeting 75 to 90 per cent of the Federal goals
2 Crime Experts Differ on Prospect That Violence Will Decrease in U. S.,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/14/archives/2-crime-experts-differ-on-prospect-that-violence-will-decrease-in.html,PHILADELPHIAWhat are the chances of violence decreasing in America Prof Marvin E Wolfgang a criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania who is the newly elected president of the American Academy of Political and Social Science predicts that the chances are good Sir Leon Radzinowicz director of Cambridge Universitys Center for Studies in Criminology and Criminal Law begs to differ If our American friends were less optimistic about being able to reduce crime he said they would do more about having a decent system of criminal justice instead of waiting for the miracle that has not happened and will never happen The two experts met here for a discussion of law and order Professor Wolfgang is the former research director of the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence Sir Leon has served on royal commissions in Britain dealing with crime and punishment he is an adjunct professor at Columbia Universitys law school and has been teaching at other universities in this country There has been a deterioration of law and order in the last 15 or 20 yearsan increase in crime of at least 6 per cent and sometimes 10 per cent per year in the largest countries he said The tendency is always to think that law and order are threatened Sir Leon suggested but Professor Wolfgang insisted that during the past 20 years official crime rates have gone up and particularly rates for crimes of violence Both experts agreed that sophisticated professional crime has grown in importance We in England are wondering whether we should join the Common Market Sir Leon said But our criminals have joined the Common Market without any difficulty without any hesitation They are now collaborating in crime with colleagues in many countries More Participation of Women The two criminologists noted that crimes by women increased in recent years Its probably too early to speculate that womens liberation is a major explanation Professor Wolfgang said A lot of it is late adolescent and early female crime and much of that is an increase in drug use We witness a more intensive participation of women today in economic life Sir Leon noted They become more vulnerable to pressures and more tempted Professor Wolfgang suggested that one of the best indices of the progress of blacks in American society is an increase in their white collar crime Sir Leon recalled that he had recently visited a developing country and arrived just as a bank was being attacked When he saw the Minister of Justice he said Excellency it is a little embarrassing that the arrival of a criminologist has been synchronized with an attack on one of your leading banks Not at all the Minister replied We are very delighted It means that we are becoming civilized We still have a feudalistic system relative to the blacks Professor Wolfgang insisted It is the black crime rate that most people are concerned about it is the black crime rate that is high and it is blacks who are kept in a feudal social status It is blacks who are the victims of the social definers of crime and who are processed through our deficient criminal justice system Countries that solve their minority problems can still i have an increase of crime Sir Leon objected because crime does increase in countries where there are no blacks and no Puerto Ricans and therefore this cannot be the answer Professor Wolfgang predicted that in this country there will be a shift from crimes of violence to those of fraud and corruption With the rise of a consumer constituency he said we are becoming more sensitive to corporate crime and fraudulent behavior by big business Professor Wolfgang is an American and thereforelike his countrymenan optimist Sir Leon rejoined Sir Leon and Professor Wolfgang agreed that drugs loom too prominently in the popular conception as a cause of crime Drugs and crime should be seen as symptoms of deeper causes Sir Leon insisted and not as cause and effect The two men spoke of what Europeans call the dark numbers of crimewhich Americans refer to as hidden delinquency High proportions of the population in this country regardless of social status admit having committed offenses for which they have not been apprehended Professor Wolfgang noted In the United States crime index we speak of offenses known to the policehomicide forcible rape aggravated assault robbery burglary larceny over 50 and auto theft The proportion of arrests has been declining and now only about 18 per cent are cleared by arrest The dark figure always existed but it was not in the interest of administra tors to reveal it Sir Leon said This is a delicate issue People who believe in law an order will say that the most effective way to decrease the dark figure is to strengthen the powers of the police Yes if the police dont have enough powers make them stronger But more important than a higher or lower rate of crime is the standard of liberty and constitutionality Sir Leon said he did not believe it was possible to decrease crime but he argued that we can bring crime under better control be more enlightened about it more rational more efficient lest emotional Professor Wolfgang noted however that much of the increase in violent crime in this country coincided with an increase in the proportion of the population made up of late adolescents and young adults In the next decade the proportion should decline Suggested Improvements Sir Leon urged improved crime statistics to be published independently an efficient and constitutional police wellqualified judges and prosecutors decent courts and a reasonable case load He said I would restrict criminal law to its minimum Dont expand it It would be so much more effective if concentrated on things which matter The prison population of this country could easily be reduced 30 per cent with more probation more suspended sentences more fines The best reform of prisons whenever possibleis not to send anyone there But we must agree that the prison system is a necessity I would reorder my colleagues priorities Professor Wolfgang said A top priority has to be a more equitable distribution of wealth Then I would stress decriminalization Victimless crimes should be taken out of the penal code and criminal statutesabortions most drug violations gambling disorderly conduct connected with drunkenness Sir Leon rejoined Obviously criminal law is overextended But if you take things out of criminal law it doesnt mean that the problem is solved What can be done to insure greater rationality and less emotion in discussions and treatment of crime Replied Sir Leon I couldnt answer this question For this you must go and speak to a Manhattan psychoanalyst
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/14/archives/everything-now-is-a-warmup-for-california-primaries.html,DETROITMere is a seeming calm about the Democratic Presidential campaign but forces were gathering last week for a final roundprobably decisive possibly uglyas the primary course prepared to head west Michigan the most striking illustration of the calm has 132 convention delegates up for grabs in the primary here next Tuesday but nobody is grabbing very hard Ten rooms and seven workers was the description of the downtown headquarters of Senator Hubert H Humphrey of Minnesota who dropped into Detroit Friday for the first visit in nearly a month and quickly observed that it would be unimportant if he lost the primary Senator George McGovern of South Dakota spent all of seven hours in Michigan Thursday Theyre deferring to Gov George C Wallace of Alabama who thinks hes on the verge of his first victory in a Northern industrial state He also expects to do well on Tuesday in Maryland With the primary season barely past the halfway mark there seemed to be only one real headtohead McGovernHumphrey fight left for Californias 271 delegates the June 6 primary winner gets them all The Nebraska primary last week was won by Senator McGovern with 41 per cent of the vote to Senator Humphreys 35 And both men agree that everything prior to California was merely preliminary Pawing restlessly around Michigan Maryland and Washington last week the twoboth South Dakota natives and the closest personal friends among the big original field of Democratic candidatesstood in new and puzzling contrast George McGovern the loner was no longer a long shot but the captain of movement A shrewdly officered campaign was tapping new financial resources and in California a vast tide of young McGovern volunteers was beginning to roll over the most populated state in the union Hubert Humphrey the organization man seemed relatively alone He is supposed to be the candidate of voting blocs like blacks union men Jews and old folks But he does not ride his constituency so much as he drags it along by the main force of his personality The labor movement he complained last week has been almost helpless The spectacle of Mr Humphrey campaigning invites mockery He is like a rat in heat wrote Hunter S Thompson in the current Rolling Stone like an 80yearold woman who just discovered speed But in fact without the candidates adrenalin there would hardly be a Humphrey campaign The Gallup poll confirmed last week that Mr Humphrey was preferred 2 to 1 over Mr McGovern among county chairmen around the country yet the importance of his strength among regular Democratic organizations may be exaggerated In Oklahoma for example the presumption was that the party regulars running against McGovern slates in their precinct caucuses last Weekend leaned to Mr Humphrey But after the McGovern volunteers showed enough strength to name nearly half of the Oklahoma delegates uncommitted survivors were talking about leaning Mr McGoverns way at the Miami Beach convention New York is a different example Mr Humphrey has allied himself with the uncommitted delegate slates of the regular organizations but only because he did not have the time or money to field his own Where the regulars did not enter slates Mr Humphrey has defaulted all over the State of New York his prospects will be dimmed by the disadvantage that uncommitted slates always have against slates committed to a popular candidate Finally the looming presence of Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts would seem to confirm Mr Humphreys sense of being alone Mr Kennedy who insists he does not want to run has said that he will not intervene in the duel unless Mr McGovern seems to be in trouble This may he remembered as the period in which the nomination campaign got dirty The suggestion two weeks ago by Senator Henry M Jackson of Washington that Senator McGovern was the champion of amnesty abortion and marijuana did not seem to help Mr Jackson or hurt Mr McGovern in the Ohio primary But in Nebraska last week Mr Humphrey was working some of the same territory explaining on television that no matter where the other candidates stood he was against pot as a public man as a chemist and as a pharmacist In fact the Humphrey and McGovern positions on marijuanaopposing legalization but also opposing felony jail sentences for use or possession  are nearly identical Meanwhile on the fringe of the McGovern campaign there was talk of reviving the draft dodger smear that was used against Mr Humphrey in the West Virginia primary in 1960 If the Humphrey people tried to make McGovern a radical the muttering went the McGovern people would make it a campaign between a decorated World War II bomber pilot and a man who had never done military duty CHRISTOPHER LYDON
Connecticut Legislature to Get 3 Bills to Restrict Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/15/archives/connecticut-legislature-to-get-3-bills-to-restrict-abortions.html,HARTFORD May 14The Connecticut General Assembly summoned to a special session on Tuesday to write a new abortion law will be asked to pass a tough new measure based on the right of the unborn to life and to equal treatment under the law Only a few days after adjourning the Legislature was called back by Gov Thomas J Meskill to write a new law replacing the 112yearold abortion law that Federal courts had thrown out last month as unconstitutional At least three bills have been prepared for the Assembly and there was still no agreement tonight as to which will be introduced Their contents are not known precisely but all would make elective abortions illegal both for the mother of the unwanted child and the surgeon or other person performing the abortion Governor Meskill who is strongly in favor of a tough antiabortion measure argues that in tort law established by court cases the unborn child has a right to life This he says has been a factor in establishing damages and awards in automobile accidents for example Appearing on WTICTVs Face the State program tonight Governor Meskill said that as long as the right to life of the fetus was the central focus he could not agree with making exceptions in the case of rape or incest I think there are medical ways of preventing pregnancy within two hours after that situation takes place which dont violate anybodys moral beliefs he said
Rockefeller Vetoes …,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/15/archives/rockefeller-vetoes-.html,Rejecting an opportunity to ride a rising tide of conservative sentiment that swept along so many members of the State Legislature during its final weeks of deliberations Governor Rockefeller has now vetoed three of that sessions most backward measures The passage of each by lawmakers in a state legislative election year reflects extraordinary efforts by highly articulate pressure groups Strong support by members of his own party and an unusual letter from President Nixon in the case of one of the bills suggest the degree of conviction and independence the vetoes required Yet in the Governors view as in ours neither the highly emotional measure repealing this states model abortion reform law which elicited the Presidents sympathy nor the extremely controversial bill that would have effectively killed New York Citys Forest Hills housing project could be considered in the broad public interest The antibusing bill a reflection of the sentiment stirred up nationally by George Wallaces Presidential campaign was so broad in its terms that it threatened to block all school integration schemes for the coming year including rezoning Sound governmental principles argued for each of these vetoes The Governor merits credit for adhering to them The Governors veto message on the abortion reform repeal measure underscored what we have always considered to be the essential elements of this debate Safe abortion has always beenand would have continued beavailable to women of more than modest economic means The repeal bill again would have condemned women of less economic means to the backroom abortion mills Some elements of the Catholic Church conscientiously believe that all abortions are wrong Governor Rockefeller in his veto message showed respect for their beliefs no woman will be compelled to have an abortion But stressed that he does not believe it right for one group to impose its vision of morality on an entire society Those who shared his view among the legislative membership deserve support in the electoral campaign ahead because the antiabortion forces have made their impact felt at the polls and their near victory this time will doubtless only inspire them to renewed activity in the months ahead The citys scheme to erect three massive housing towers in the Forest Hills section of Queens does not involve religion but race it also involves concepts municipal planning and citystate relations Although he is not personally committed to scattersite housing Governor Rockefeller is willing to allow localities some leeway in working out their own housing problems Governor Rockefeller noted Mayor Lindsays commendable offer to meet some community objections to the project It is now up to the Mayor to fulfill this promise
…Albany Regresses,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/15/archives/-albany-regresses.html,The specter of a holdtheline state budget hovered over much of the floor debate at Albanythere was no money for new programsand this was essentially a noneconomic session of the State Legislature probably more so than in any recent year The reason for this was that a special session at the end of last year worked out a compromise tax package which fixed levels of state spending The compromise between moderate Republicans and Democrats also largely determined where spending would be trimmed and where it would not A more progressive tax structure came out of this compromise and such sensitive areas of spending as health care education and welfare were somewhat protected Having deserted conservatives of their own party in matters of the budget at the special session however moderate Republicans joined them at the regular session in a number of nonmoney matters Thus the session just adjourned saw the enactment not only of antibusing legislation abortion reform repeal and a bill to scuttle New York Citys Forest Hills housing project discussed above but also other backwardlooking measures For example despite repeated court decisions on the unconstitutionality of appropriating public funds for parochial schools the Legislature responded with still another parochial school assistance program Even a measure to restore the death penalty for crimes received serious consideration at this retrogressive session If bad measures passedand they didgood measures failed to pass and their failure is perhaps the sessions greatest disappointment In an austere year the Legislature refused to enact nonmoney programs clearly in the public interest Some programs died quietly in committee Others were killed with whoops and shouts on the floor An excellent nofault automobile insurance bill was detoured into oblivion by lawyermembers of the Legislature who by their sheer numbers were in the drivers seat Governor Rockefellers court reform program calling for a unified court system largely paid for by the state failed to receive a fair hearing It was introduced late and dispatched to an early defeat A bill providing for twocandidate runoff primaries for citywide offices in New York City was approved but other vital electoral reforms were not There seemed to be no real interest on the part of the majority Republicans to make it easy for the states newly enfranchised young voters to participate the electoral process at all The failure of legislators extend the period for registration and party enrollment will mean that many of this states young people cannot participate in next months Presidential primary Only a few positive measures made it through this years session A power plant siting bill that gives some consideration to environmental factors was enacted This bill should help ease the states power crisis A ready trial rule if implemented with adequate funds should speed the criminal justice system A needed environmental bond issue will be submitted to the voters The Federal equal rights amendment sought by women was ratified by this state New York City will be given an opportunity to study charter reform and perhaps to reshape its governmental structures by the establishment of a charter reform commission But thats about it Having adjourned the legislators will now take this pathetically inadequate record to the voters

today vetoed a bill passed by wide margins in both houses of the Legislature that would have imposed a moratorium on the compulsory assignment of schoolchildren for the sake of racial balance In a brief veto message Mr Rockefeller said that the bill enacted by the Legislature was similar to an antibusing bill it passed in 1969 which he signed That law was declared unconstitutional by the Federal courts a year later Like the 1969 statute the vetoed bill would have prohibited the State Education Commissioner and appointed school boards from ordering the busing of students to correct racial imbalance in schools 3d Veto in 2 Days The Governors action on the antibusing legislation was the third veto in two days of bills deemed major legislation by a majority of the states 207 lawmakers150 Assemblymen and 57 Senators Yesterday Mr Rockefeller vetoed as he had previously pledged a bill that would have abolished the states liberalized abortion law which permits elective abortions up to the 24th week of pregnancy and restored the old state statute permitting abortions only when a mothers life was endangered At the same time he vetoed legislation that would have killed the controversial lowincome housing project in Forest Hills Queens Political Tactic Seen Some politicians and legislative observers noting that the 1972 Legislature was one of the most lackluster in years said they felt that elartional issues such as abortion and antibusing had been dredged up in the last weeks of the session to seize the attention of voters in an election year and to divert them from the lack of accomplishments The legislative sessionthe states 195thwas adjourned late Friday night The busing moratorium legislation was felt by many to be a spurious issue since there is very little busing for integration in the state and what litut there is is primarily voluntary While claiming to have no absolute figures the State Education Department estimates that no more than 35000 students in the state are being bused to school for integration purposes In his veto message Mr Rockefeller referred to a letter from Attorney Gheral Louis J Lefkowitz recommending disapproval of the moratorium bill because of the 1970 Federal court ruling on the states earlier busing ban Speculation on Approval There is no difference in either substance or effect between the statute  which was held to be unconstitutional and the present bill the Attorney General said This act would also be clearly in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States he concluded When the moratorium bill passed the Senate by a vote of 40 to 16 and the Assembly by a vote of 99 to 44 there was speculation that the Governor might be receptive toward it This was based on a news conference Mr Rockefeller held on March 21 in which he said that President Nixons proposed national moratorium on courtordered busing as a tool for desegregating schools was an approach which seems to me is very constructive under the circumstances At the same conference the Governor said that the State Board of Regents the states highest educational policymaking body might have to review its commitment to busing as a means of achieving racial balance in the schools A short time afterward majority of the 15 Regents reaffirmed their support of the concept of busing Position on Nixon Proposals Sources in the Rockefeller administration said today that the Governors favorable remarks about the Presidents moratorium proposal had been made in the context of the deadlock on the issue that existed between the Senate and the House of Representatives The text of the Governors March 21 news conference here carries the following response from Mr Rockefeller when he was asked about his position on the Presidents tworear moratorium proposal The Presidents proposal it seems to me could well be the key to unlocking the deadlock which existed between the Senate and the House in Washington There was a very serious situation developing there with apparently no solution and what the President has proposed now looks as though it was the way to solving this deadlock between the two Houses of Congress In another veto action today Mr Rockefeller disapproved a bill that would have required each state agency to submit a statement to the Department of Environmental Conservation on the environmental impact of every program or project carried on by the agency Mr Rockefeller said that he sympathized with the intent of the legislation which was reAttested by Henry L Diamond the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation but that there were four reasons why it was illadvised Mr Rockefeller said that the bills requirements overlapped existing state and Federal requirements that it was drafted so that marathon litigation could ensue that it blurred responsibility among state agencies and that it would add costs at a time of protracted fiscal difficulty for the state

Home Medica Guide Distributed by Ginzburg Called Out of Date,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/18/archives/home-medical-guide-distributed-by-ginzburg-called-out-of-date.html,A home guide dated 1971 and offered as a bonus to advertisers to Ralph Ginzburgs consumer newsletter Moneysworth was actually written in Germany at least 20 years ago a search of records has revealed According to medical experts the Moneysworth Home Medical Advisor which nowhere indicates its true origin is filled with Outofdate information that in some ceases could endanger the health and lives of those who follow its advice With Gizburg currently serving a prisort term for sending pornographic material through the mail no one at Moneysworth would discuss the source of the medical book or how it was selected Nor would they say how many of the 800000 subscribers to Moneysworth had received copies of the widely advertised book The author of the book Dr Paul Kiihne was a German psychiatrist He had been dead for several years according to Verlat Praktisbhos Wissen the Berlin publisher who first issued the book in 1953 as Lebe Gesund Bleibe Gesund A British translation was published by Faber and Faber Ltd of London as Medicine for the Layman in 197 Some Occasional Changs Except foroccaslonal changes that appear in a different typeface and the logs of the umlaut in the authors name the book is identical to the 1957 British edition down to the use of the words nappy for diapers and knickers for panties The book is out of print in Germany and Britain but an American edition of the British book copyright 1960 by Fawcett Publications Inc is still in print and is being reissued by Fawcett this month The Fanttett beok a paperback called Home Medical ncyclopedia has been Americanized but since it has not been revised since 1960 it contains much the same outdated medical information as the Moneysworth version Fawcett says its book has been surprisingly successful and sold several hundred thousand copies over the years Unlike the Fawcett book which is dated 1960 and thus would not be expected to contain developments of the last 12 years the Moneysworth book has only the 1971 date On page 205 a line which in the British edition read But now in the year 1956  was changed in the Moneysworth book to read But now in the year 1971 Physicians who screened the Moneysworth book at The Timess request cited among other things its failure to mention the existence of such criti cal public health measures as the vaccines against polio measles mumps and rubella and the Pap smear for detecting cervical cancer The book discusses the possibility of developing a polio vaccine which in fact was first licensed in the United States 17 years ago The American Heart Assoelation noted that the section on preventing heart disease the nations number one killer says nothing about the critical roles of diet exercise body weight and blood pressure in warding off heart attacks The book also states that drugs are only temporarily successful when at all in treating high blood pressure an affliction of 30 to 40 million Americans that can nearly always be effectively treated with modern drugs The medical experts including a cardiologist and a cancer specialist said that failure to take advantage of such advances as the measles vaccine and drugs against high blood pressure could endanger the lives of millions of Americans Disputed by Research The books chapter on contraception discusses withdrawal vaginal douche and the rhythm method but not oral contraceptives or intrauterine devices The section on abortion says that nowadays many psychosomatic illnesses are attributed to the effects of abortion a statement disputed by research findings in the last 15 years In describing firstaid techniques the book depicts the old form of artificial respiration but says nothing of mouthtomouth rescuciaion The book also states contrary to current knowledge that no drug has any curative effect on cancer and it does not mention the lifesaving concentrates of clotting factor in discussing this treatment of hemophilia The book has also angered members of womens liberation groups who say it contains many sexist statements It says for example The woman must acquire staymg power and efficiency and the man must be sure of his mental and physical abilities And in another place it states It is not until after the second pregnancy that a womans complete mental and physical powers are at their highest Several women said they had protested to Moneysworth but were brushed off According to Dr Judith Weis a Rutgers University biologist and president of the Essex County N J chapter of the National Organization of Women the book is filled with descriptions of female biology that have long since been dismissed by science and society For example Dr Weis pointed out it describes the clitoris as an organ of immature feminine sexuality that does not play any decisive part in the orgasm of a mentally and sexually mature woman a notion long since discarded and finally disproved six years ago by Masters and Johnson With the exception of acknowledging the existence of a polio vaccine and mouthtomouth rescucitation the Fawcett book contains the same information described as outdated and sexist in the Moneysworth book In about half a dozen places however the Moneysworth book does take note of recent developments The changes are printed in a larger lighter typeface than the main body type of the book Most of the changes involve replacement of the phrase sexual perversion with sexual aberration and a depiction of such aberrations as not nearly so abnormal as the British book describes them The British publisher Faber and Faber told The Times that its book was fully protected by a valid copyright both in Britain and in the United States On the basis of this belief Fawcett has continued to pay royalties for exclusive rights to an American edition Although the Faber book was printed before Britain agreed to use the universal copyright notice the encircled C year of publication and publishers name that would guarantee its protection in this country a search by the United States Copyright Office revealed that the book was registered with them and is protected in the United States until June 1985 Ralph Day editor of Fawcett books inforthed by The Times of the similarity between his book and Moneysworths has been in touch with Mr Ginzburgs lawyers According to Mr Day the lawyers said their recollection was that Mr Ginzburg bought rights to the book from the authors widow with the knowledge and consent of the British publisher However Faber and Faber says it has never heard of Moneysworth and never gave anyone but Fawcett permission to publish the book
Times Study Finds Wallace Could Cut Votes for Nixon,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/18/archives/times-study-finds-wallace-could-cut-votes-for-nixon-times-study.html,The New York Timess primary election surveys indicate strongly that a thirdparty candidacy by Gov George C Wallace would be likely to cut far more sharply into President Nixons vote than into that of the Democratic nominee The survey findings contrast strikingly with the prevalent interpretation of the impact of an independent Wallace candidacy and while far from conclusive the findings raise anew the possibility that no candidate could muster an electoral majority next November These conclusions which had been suggested in an earlier survey were given striking support by the results of a crosssection survey of voters in Michigans Democratic primary Tuesday The survey was conducted by The New York Times and Daniel Yankelovich Inc Governor Wallace won impressive popularvote victories Tuesday in both the Michigan and Maryland primaries Technically he could expect a total of 113 convention votes from the two states but party maneuvering raised considerable doubt that he would get that many [Details on Page 36] In Michigan The Times survey found almost none of the Alabama Governors vote could be attributed to sudden sympathy over the attempt on his life Monday The Washington Post found the same to be true in a postelection survey in Maryland But while there may not have been a new sympathy vote The Timess Michigan survey gave strong evidence of an anger vote People who already favored Mr Wallace came to the polls so aroused on the day after he was shot that they pushed crime and violence well ahead even of busing as their major concern Mr Wallace won about half his total vote from independents and Republicans who are free in Michigan to vote on the Deinocratic ballot According to the survey these crossover voters accounted for nearly a third of the total vote in the Democratic primary It is the passion of these crossover voters that casts doubt on the conventional view that in the North Democrats would be hurt the most by thirdparty Wallace race According to this interpretation Mr Wallace would hurt Mr Nixon more in the South drawing away conservative voters but would hurt the Democratic nominee more in the North drawing away workingclass votes But conservative crossover voters surveyed in Michigan most of whom would vote for Mr Nixon in a twoway race find Mr Wallace so appealing that they would switch to him if he made the thirdparty race The same general result was found in The TimesYankelovitch survey of the March primary in Wisconsin which also permits crossover voters But the proportion of defections from the Nixon ranks was not so striking there Significant Bloc The potential defection rate in Michigan can be measured by comparing how Republicans and independents said they would vote in a twoway race and in a threeway race If the choice were limited to President Nixon or Senator Hubert H Humphrey these voters would favor the President 76 per cent to 15 per cent But if Mr Wallace runs as he did in 1968 as a thirdparty candidate 54 per cent of the crossover voters say they would support him Mr Nixons 76 per cent share of the crossover vote would plummet to 36 per cent Mr Humphrey would drop from 15 per cent to 6 per cent Meanwhile a Wallace candidacy would draw away approximately equal numbers of Democrats who otherwise would vote either for the President or for Senator Humphrey Thus in total the net loss to Mr Nixon would be substantially larger The results would be similar though somewhat less pronounced if Senator George Mcvovern is the candidate The crossover voters would still give Mr Wallace about half their votes the survey showed It was a crosssection survey of 411 persons in 41 scientifically selected Michigan precincts Voters were interviewed as they left their polling places Among other findings of the survey were the following Though busing to achieve school integration was outranked by crime on the list of important issues Michigan voters were passionate about the busing question More than half said they would oppose busing even if ordered by the courts Among Wallace voters alone nearly 8 in 10 said so Most voters said they did not consider Senator McGovern too radical Only a third agreed with the statement that he was too far out on such issues as abortion and marijuana Only a quarter said they believed he would cut defense spending too much The turnout of firsttime voters aged 1824 appeared moderate A strong majority of these voters supported Senator McGovern Senator Humphreys sluggish thirdplace finish appeared to stem importantly from his failure to maintain past strength among bluecollar voters Mr Wallace won almost twothirds of the vote in this category
IN THE NATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/18/archives/centripetal-politics.html,George McGovern now heads west as the Democratic leader in the number of delegates pledged to him He is the favorite in the virtually uncontested Oregon primary which ought to give him a good lift into the showdown California primary on June 6 Behind him in New York he leaves a good lead over Hubert Humphrey both as measured hi a poll by WCBS and in the opinion of professionals eying the delegate slates But paradoxically Mr McGovern may be heading into the most difficult phase of his campaign he has got where he is as a radical candidate but intense pressures will come down on him from now until the convention to move to the center There are a number of reasons why this should be so For one thing barring the quite real possibility that he may make a dramatic wheelchair appearance at the Democratic National Convention Gov George Wallace appears to have reached the highwater mark of his Presidential campaign His solid primary victories in Maryland and Michigan are the last really available to him and while his strength has proved remarkable it also has been selective and does not now appear sufficient to prevent the nomination of someone else at Miami Beach If that is so then despite the Wallace triumphs in Michigan and Maryland the Democratic Presidential campaign is neater being a twoman racebetween Senators Humphrey and McGovernthan ever before That is because probably nothing other than the shooting of Governor Wallace could so surely have removed the last possibility that Senator Edward M Kennedy might enter the contest or let himself be drafted Finally no one any longer dismisses Mr McGoverns wellorganized and Smartly conceived campaign Victory at Miami Beach is an obvious possibility for him therefore many supporters who want desperately to see him win the nomination will counsel concessions to win over the last holdouts Many Many doubters and opponents particularly as they may be forced to support or tolerate him will push him in the same direction after all they will argue a national campaign against Mr Nixon is a different matter from organizing delegate strength to win the Democratic nomination Already Mr McGovern has candidly conceded to interviewers that he will have to try to win the support of more party regulars and labor leaders which means moving in a more moderate direction Already too some powerful political pressures have pushed him in such a direction In Michigan for example where Mr Wallace was so strong in opposing pupil busing Mr McGovern appeared noticeably less outspoken in defense of busing than he had been elsewhere In the Nebraska campaign Mr McGovern had to spend the last week repeatedly denying that he favored legalized pot easy abortions everywhere and automatic amnesty for Vietnam draft resisters Even so these issuestermed the big three by members of his staffhelped Mr Humphrey to a nearupset Strong men quail at the thought of what Ridhard Nixon Murray Chotiner Lyn Nofziger and other Republican tacticians would do with those issues next fall Mr McGoverns new status as a serious contender is confirmed by the attention paid to him in the May 8 edition of the witty Republican scandal sheet Monday but it was of small comfort that its front page was given over to a cartoon depicting Mr McGovern as a duped ally of North Vietnam More seriously the conservative weekly National Review has just published a tough ninepage dissection of the controversial McGovern economic and defense policiesno doubt the first of many to be spawned by the possibility of a McGovern victory With the major California campaign beginning McGovern aides report heavy pressures by Humphrey men on the big three issues on Mr McGoverns labor record on his supposedly weak stance on the Middle East More will be heard too of the complaint raised by Senator Henry Jackson that Mr McGovern supported Henry Wallace a quartercentury ago George McGovern has shown himself a far more skilled political pro than most of his opponents expected but the dangers in these centripetal pressures are manifest If he remains too rigidly radical onthefence Democrats conditioned to believe in the power of the moderate center might turn to Mr Humphrey If Mr McGovern slips too far toward that elusive center he could diminish the ardor of many who not only admire his radical position but the straightforward way in which he has stated it and he could open himself to the charges of diehard opponents that he is a slippery opportunist after all And what if it turns outas the Democratic campaign so far seems to suggestthat there may not be much center left in this country

THE 1972 CAMPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/19/archives/mcclellan-in-toughest-campaign-arkansan-at-76-is-opposed-by-3-in.html,LITTLE ROCK Ark May 18 Senator John L McClellan at the age of 76 is in the toughest reelection fight of his 35year Congressional career The contest has produced the most pronounced swing toward Populism free of racism with angry antibigbusiness rhetoric and sharp demands for tax reform that Arkansas has seen since the early nineteenhundreds Tv o aggressive young challengers hope that the trend toward antiEstablishment reform Governors in the South will reach this year into the regions bastion of seniorityclad powerblessed Senators and remove Mr McClellan who has been in the Senate 30 years They are encouraged by the Democratic primary in North Carolina earlier this month in which Senator B Everett Jordan one of Mr McClellans longtime colleagues was forced into a runoff by Representative Nick Galifianakis In challenging Senator McClellan who has long been considered an Arkansas institution his opponents have fashioned a frontal assault on two of the most importantelements in oldstyle Southern Congressional politics First they have denounced the validity of the politics of public works a Southern mainstay since Reconstruction Second and perhaps more important they have sharply questioned the way Mr McClellan has used his vaunted power in the Senate They are telling the voters that more often than not he has used it to fatten what they term greedy corporations the big boys and the arrogant rich Brought Public Works The two challengers pressing these populist views are Representative David H Pryor 381 who first made a statewide reputation by opposing former Gov Orval E Faubus 12 years ago and Ted Boswell 39 an intellectually inclined lawyer with a gift for oratory who ran a strong but unsuccessful race for Governor in 1968 They and a third older candidate Foster Johnson will meet Senator McClellan in the Democratic primary May 30 With heightened interest in the campaign in recent days observers here are beginning to suspect that the three men may perform a political miracle and force Mr McCellan into a runoff election If that happens he might easily be defeated The senior Arkansas Senator became nationally famous in the nineteenfifties with his investigation into labor racketeering BUt in Arkansas he had long before begun to lay the foundation for a more valuable reputationthat of a Senator who could deliver impressive expensive public works projects for the home state The grandest of these damming and channeling the Arkansas River for navigation was completed only last year and Mr McClellan was accorded large share of the credit You can do more if you have this infuence and seniority he told 500 supporters at a rally and barbecue last week at El Dorado I can use It for you but I am the only one who can My successor couldnt use it for you That is all very well Mr Boswell and Mr Pryor are telling the voters but if the Senator has so much influence why they ask is Arkansas still 49th in per capita income 47th in perpupil spending for education and near the bottom of every other economic index Power and influence to a great extent is what has taken this nation down some wrong roads and made some people pretty sick and tired of what has happened in the country Mr Boswell said in a television interview Great power and influence is what got ITT [International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation] to negotiate an antitrust settlement at a horse track and at a cocktail party Mr Pryor for the last several weeks has been researching Mr McClellans 30year voting record in the Senate In a series of speeches he has charged that the Senator has voted consistently against Social Security and health benefits against veterans programs against food stamps against school lunch programs and against tax advantages for ordinary people while voting for tax advantages for the wealthy and corporations and for such things as the supersonic transport jet boondoggle Both Mr Pryor and Mr Boswell advocate sweeping tax re form to shift more of the burden to the wealthy and the corporations Mr Pryor has advocated overhauling the antitrust laws Both favor national health insurance program Mr Boswell has made Mr McClellans age an issue The Senator appears to be In good health He walks and jogs regularly Mr Pryor has accused the Senator of conflicts of interest Mr McClellan is on the board of several Arkansas banks The Arkansas Gazette disclosed a days ago that he was the partowner of a large parcel of land on the Mulberry River and that he supported a resolution asking the Army Corps of Engineers to study possible development of that river Both of the young challengers are about as liberal as liberal Democrats in other parts of the country That would have been most unlikely 10 years ago in Arkansas Both oppose segregated public schools Mr Boswell more vigorously However neither has been able to organize effectively among the swelling ranks of black voters to exploit Mr McClellans negative civil rights record Mr Boswell is somewhat more assertive than Mr Pryor For example he has long opposed the Vietnam war and he spoke out promptly against President Nixons mining of the ports of North Vietnam We have a President who speaks of the sanctity of life and opposes abortion he told a womens political caucus today but still sends hundreds of thousands of tons of bombs a day to Vietnam Mr Pryor opposes the bomb ing and advocates withdrawal from Indochina but he has re fused to criticize Mr Nixon for mining the ports His relative caution in this and other matters may pay off Political observers here believe that he has a slight edge over Mr Boswell for second place in the voting In addition Mr Pryor has been able to attract greatet campaign contributions Mr Boswell says his campaign has received only 30000 including 9000 of his own money Mr Pryor has reported gifts of 41000 Mr McClellan has not closed his campaign finances With support from bankers planters and big businessmen he clearly is far ahead in this category

THE 1972 CAMPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/20/archives/chavez-backs-mcgovern.html,SALEM Ore May 19Cesar Chavez the director of the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee and a leader among Californias MexicanAmericans endorsed Senator George McGoverns Presidential candidacy today The two men will appear together tomorrow in Phoenix The endorsement was made known today as Mr McGovern the only major candidate actively campaigning in Oregons Democratic Presidential primary on Tuesday traveled across the state with his eye constantly on neighboring California The Senator from South Dakota readily accepted a debate challenge made yesterday in California by his principal rival Senator Hubert H Humphrey of Minnesota He agreed to joint appearances on network television programs on the two Sundays before Californias primary on June 6 and to debate Mr Humphrey any place any time that he chooses The condidates will meet in debate format on onehour broadcasts of ABCs Issues and Answers and CBSs Face the Nation One will be May 28 and the second June 4 but the order has not been set In addition Senator McGovern challenged Mr Humphrey and his supporters to conduct the California campaign with restraint and to focus on the issues of the war and the economy He said that Eugene Wyman Mr Humphreys California finance director had distorted Mr McGoverns positions on such issues as abortion reform and drug control The political climate following the assassination attempt to Gov George C Wallace of Alabama makes it essential for candidates to help set the tone for reasoned public discourse Mr McGovern said last night in Portland where he made his first major address since the Governor was shot on Monday Mr McGovern said other candidates ought to join him in pledging to bend every effort to prevent either distortions inflammatory statements of any kind or personal attack by anyone associated with my campaign Today however he said that Mr Wyman appeared to be the sort of wealthy individual climbing through the kind of tax loopholes that I expect to reduce as President Campaign aides said that Mr McGovern would go to Phoenix tomorrow to meet with Mr Chavez who is fasting there in protest against enactment of an Arizona law restricting the organization of farm workers
Anti‐Abortion Bill Voted in Hartford,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/20/archives/antiabortion-bill-voted-in-hartford.html,HARTFORD May 19After a daylong public hearing of the General Assemblys Joint Public Health and Safety Committee a strict new abortion bill for Connecticut was approved by the committee 16 to 8 The bill favored by Governor Thomas J Meskill and almost all of the leadership in both legislative chambers will be reported out to the House of Representatives for a full debate on Monday and after a vote there to the Senate In an atmosphere that was sometimes serious and sometimes picniclike the Assemblys joint committee had istened to wideranging views that touched on human rights womens rights poverty and overpopulation The destruction of human life for the sake of convenience is an untenable suggestion said Francis J Collins a Brookfield Republican and the House minority leader in an appeal for the strict new law He said it was needed to replace the strict old law thrown out by Federal court last month as unconstitutional Mr Collins said he spoke for himself and for Governor Meskill who again called the special session of the General Assembly and who wants to make abortion illegal except to save the life of the expectant mother Senator Wilbur Smith black maverick Democrat from Hartford said the administration should support his bill one that would in effect make abortion a capital offense punishable by death and not by the five years imprisonment the Governor wants School Pupils Present Senator Smiths bill would declare that an unborn child is entitled not only to a right to life but to all the rights of a citizen He submitted another bill one he said was a more serious one that would allow a woman to elect to have an abortion within 24 weeks after conception The first bill was submitted to call the hand of those who sit in high public office and claim thatabortion is murder the Senator said The committee members sat at the speakers rostrum in the House The public filled the rest of the chamber sitting in the places of the 177 Representatives in the aisles and in the public galleries and they stood in the back of the hall and outside it There were priests and nuns doctors lawyers welfare workers expectant mothers and others School children with their teachers arrived and left in groups There was a steady crowd of perhaps 300 through the day mostly women Many of them were womens rightists to judge from the speeches they cheered from their straight hair and shift dresses and sandals Some young people performed a playlet on the floor of the Housee advocating abortion Others began chanting on behalf of free abortions Only when still others began to unfurl their banners did Senator Prete draw the line The other cochairman Representative Cohen pounded the gavel repeatedly and asked that the applause be limited if it could not be stopped Statute Dated from 1860 The state had been using an abortion statute that had been passed in 1860 a strict one that forbade aborions except to save the life of the woman The old statute was declared unconstitutional on April 18 by the Federal court here mainly on the ground that it denied women the right to decide When Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall denied Connecticut a stay of the lower courts judgment the Governor called the special session and through Mr Collins introduced a bill stating the intent of the Legislature to be to protect the life of an unborn child The Roman Catholic Bishops of Connecticut also called for a strict new law contending that the right to life for an unborn child was more fundamental than were all the rights he would acquire afterward He is human the bishops held His right to life is not just a religious right but basic human right and one that begins before birth From New York which has had a liberalized abortion law for two years evidence was introduced by Dr Alan Guttmacher national president of Planned Parenthood to show that a more liberal approach to abortion had saved the lives of many women who would have died from crude illegal abortions Presenting the other side from New York was State Senator James H Donovan who said that more than 300000 developing babies had been murdered in New York since the law was enacted The real question before this committee I think is not whether abortions will be performed said Catherine G Roraback one of the lawyers for Women vs Connecticut the organization that took Connecticuts abortion law to court and won For centuries women who needed abortions have gotten them Mrs Roraback said They will continue to do so The real question is who will perform them and how they will be done When women are forced by their circumstances to seek abortions they should be able to have them in dignity and safety
‘Out of Wedlock’,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/20/archives/out-of-wedlock.html,BERKELEY CalifWere grandparents again Our first grandson as yet unnamed 9 spounds 8 ounces made his grand entrance on the stage of the last half of the twentieth century at 517 PM Sunday July 11 I guess I could say all of the usualand tritethings that are said at a time like this a beautiful baby a bundle of joy the greatest child ever He is all of thatand more But there is something more serious rand important to be said This child born to our eldest daughter is to use the usual phrase born out of wedlock After they learned the child had been conceived his mother and father made the decision thoughtfully and deliberately not to marry The father a young man our daughter dated and liked very much while they were in the Army has acknowledged his paternity and the child will bear his name But the two young people decided against marriage feeling among other things that to get married just for the childs sake was not adequate grounds for a healthy marriage Our daughter squarely faced the various alternatives before her One by one she put them aside no abortion no giving the baby up for adoption She has determined to keep the child We tried to be as supportive as possible and to affirm her determination at first by longdistance telephone calls and again later when she came home During the past few weeks we have been going through the days of waiting with herthe days of expectation her discomfort in pregnancy the wondering if tonight would be the night We have tried in some small way to make up for the absence of a father during these hours We have shared in testing various names for sound and feelingand Irene sat up all night in the fathers room at the hospital Now she knows what thats like We debate over how to handle the situation as relates to friends and members of the church This was not something one would be expected to announce publicly and yet it was something that could not be hidden nor did we wish to do so We told some who are close to us we resisted the fear of embarrassment Now the child is here and we make the announcement of his birth with all the joy and pride we could possibly have This is our grandchild But more important this is a human life with all the rights and dignity to which every human being is entitled Of course we wish the circumstances might have been differentthis is the kind of thing one thinks happens only to other families But this time it happened in ours And so acknowledging the pain we feel we also realize that there are really no illegitimate children they have nothing to do with the circumstances of their birth illegitimate parents perhaps but not illegitimate children It is unfortunateeven tragicthat society attaches a stigma to a child for something for which he is not responsible And so while we know there will be special problems this grandchild is going to be received in our family with all the love and joy and happiness with which we would greet any grandchild There is a sense in which this child seems symbolic of our times There are increasing numbers of unwed mothers who are electing to keep their children I suspect we will see more of this as the years go by Surely the church and sincere Christians have an opportunity to demonstrate what love and acceptance meanto show that as Jesus made abundantly clear persons are more important than any moral principles we might profess In all of this I am proud of the manner in which our daughter has assumed responsibility for her actions of the love she has demonstratively evidenced for this child even before its birth and of the realistic and thoroughly human attitude she has nurtured within herself Apart from the additional reminder that Im getting older its great to be a grandfather once more

The ‘God Committee’,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/21/archives/the-god-committee.html,The baby is a mongoloid born with duodenal atresia an intestinal obstruction The parents professional people in Maryland refuse permission for the surgery that will enable the infant to survive deciding that it would be unfair to their two normal children to bring a mongoloid into the home Doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore seek help from the courts which in Maryland have the power to appoint a guardian who will authorize necessary medical care for a child when the parents wont A senior member of the judiciary advises them that the courts would not force the parentsor society7to bear the burden of rearing such a child Accordingly the babys bassinet is wheeled to a dark corner of the nursery where in 15 days it becomes dehydrated enough to die natural death AST October at a symposium on medical ethics sponsored by the Kennedy Foundation in Washington D C the panelists watched a film about the case above and were then asked to comment While careful not to condemn the parents who went through great agony over the decision the panelists generally agreed that it was wrong to let the infant die The childs right to as happy a life as was possible for a mongoloid most of the speakers felt far outweighed the parents right to be spared emotional suffering The ethical core of the Baltimore tragedy said Prof Paul A Freund of Harvard Law School was the failure of society to provide adequate programs and facilities to care for retarded children The panelists decision which has been widely discussed is already to champions of the rights of the retarded a little like what Brown v Board of Education was to civil righs activists But as one panel member social critic Michael Harrington kept insisting This is an easy case What if the defect had been much greater While many mongols 25 years ago died a natural death from duodenal atresia today we have surgery that is relatively simple and riskless to correct the defect once it is performed the baby is usually free of pain and further complications The child as many parents of mongols will attest can often grow into a happy family member and a usefulif limitedcitizen Nevertheless it is not uncommon for mongols with duodenal atresia to be allowed to die in a hospital nursery and the legal authorities rarely hear about it such decisions remain a wellkept secret between the parents and doctor Euthanasia in these cases is difficult to justify legally or as the Kennedy panelists agreed ethically But there are other more crippling infant deformities that pose more troublesome medical legal and moral dilemmas for parents doctors and society as new technology makes it possible to save defective newborns from potentially fatal complications What if a child born with a defect that was usually fatal a decade ago can now be kept alive but only at a cost of lifelong physical and emotional suffering to the child Should the physician perform what will probably be the first of many operations For the most part a conspiracy of silence and great hesitation still pervade most discussions among physicians of whenif everto withhold treatment from deformed infants Now a current debate over one of the most common structural birth defects called meningomyelocele has shattered that silence MENINGOMYELOCELE also called myelomeningocele spina bifida spina aperta or open spine is a malformation of the central nervous system In children born with this defectmany of those on March of Dimes posters have been crippled by itnot Only have some of the vertebrae failed to develop completely but the spinal cord has failed to form into a tube and send out the usual number of nerve fibers to the muscles Instead a flat cord protrudes from the surface of the body The cord is coated only with the thin membranes the meninges which usually cover the spinal cord and with incomplete skin The surface appearance may be just a small lumpor more commonly a raised oozing mass In almost 90 per cent of cases the defect occurs below the second lumbar vertebra in the small of the back The deficiency of nerve fibers in this area results in varying degrees of paralysis of legs bladder and bowels There is no way doctors can cure these paralyses They can only carry out a series of palliative procedures which will allow the children to approach norin Meningomyelocele a severe birth deformity also known as open spine poses lifeordeath issues To reduce the risk of death from meningitis and to make the infant easier to handle neurosurgeons can bury the deformed spinal cord beneath the surface of the skin To reduce the risk of death further retardation and further deformity from hydrocephalus a condition in which cerebrospinal fluid collects in the head they can insert a tube into the brain cavity to shunt the fluid past an obstruction To help the patient walk with the aid of braces orthopedists can perform numerous operations on hips and legs To reduce the risk of death from kidney disease and to try to cope with the social burdens of incontinence urologists can enlarge the bladder neck divert urine out of the side into a collection bag for girls and give boys other collection devices Three out of every thousand infants in the United Statesor 11000 babies a yearare born with this defect This is three times the number born with cystic fibrosis a third again as many as are born in the black population with sicklecell anemia and more than twice the number born with mongolism In the US the multidisciplinary care needed by children with meningomyelocele is provided primarily in centers supported by the National FoundationMarch of Dimes Until 10 years ago 80 per cent of those born with meningomyelocele died Today 75 per cent survive No miracle drug is responsible for this reversal Much of the responsibility rests on a group of physicians at the University of Sheffield in England who introduced the policy of routine immediate surgery in all such cases in the late nineteenfifties and publicized it in the early sixties Ironically whether to treat or not to treat the condition has now become a dilemma even to one of those Sheffield physicians Dr John Lorber LAST June the British pediatrician published a major paper on meningomyelocele in the prestigious journal De velopmental Medicine and Child Neurology Reviewing the human results of the Sheffield policy Dr Lorber concludes that it might have been wiser not to have saved many of the children Why did Dr Lorber have such an awesome change of mind At Sheffield infants born with open spine were given intensive treatment beginning with the first day of life Nonetheless when Dr Lorber reexamined the cases of 323 patients admitted between 1959 and 1963 and followed for 7 to 12 years he found that despite the enormous effort expended on them at most 7 per cent have less than grossly cripplingdisabilities and may be considered to have a quality of life not inconsistent with selfrespect earning capacity happiness and even marriage The next 20 per cent he reported are also of normal intelligence and some may be able to earn their living in sheltered employment but their lives are full of illness and operations Severely handicapped they are at a risk of sudden death from shunt complications or are likely to die of renal failure at an early age Another 14 per cent according to Dr Lorber are even more severely handicapped because they are retarded and will always be totally dependent on others The remaining 59 per cent were infants transferred from other hospitals to Sheffield soon after being born who were dead on arrival  The pendulum has now swung too far writes Dr John Lorber There are now many with dreadful handicaps who a short time ago would have died If all the most severe cases are treated adequate time cannot be devoted to those who would benefit most Dr Lorber tells of one normally intelligent girl who by age 9 had had 18 major operations Seven were revisions of her shunt performed when the nausea and headache of hydrocephalus recurred and two were extensive spinal column operations performed in an unsuccesful attempt to correct the extreme curvature of her spine Reviewing a second group of patients 201 youngsters who were first admitted more recently 1967 and 1968 Dr Lorber found that as a result of improved methods of treating hydrocephalus fewer of the infants died in early life Yet the proportions of those with serious intellectual or physical handicaps did not decrease From all this Dr Lorber draws a lesson Therapeutic efforts should be concentrated only on those who have the potential to benefit from treatment This rule can be applied with accuracy the day the child is born he claims From the Sheffield data it is clear that those who cannot benefit are newborns with extensive paralysis with severe hydrocephalus and with gross curvature of the spine or other congenital defects In the series of 201 infants says Dr Lorber had the 116 infants with those conditions been excluded we would not have excluded any who survived with no handicap or with only moderate handicap In a statement that is exceedingly bold for a medical journal Dr Lorber declares The pendulum has now swung too far there are now many with dreadful handicaps who a short time ago would have died If all the most severe cases are treated the pressure of work will be such that adequate time cannot be devoted to the less severely affected who would benefit WHAT then are the options faced by a physician when a baby is born with a severe form of meningomyelocele As doctors have defined them they are 1 to kill the newborn 2 to actively encourage the infant to die by neither treating it nor feeding it 3 to provide only supportive custodial care such as feeding but refuse to treat any of the inevitable complications either through surgery or with drugs or 4 to actively encourage the child to live by using all means at the physicians disposal To some physicians there is little choice The doctor must always intervene to save the child The pediatric surgeon on the original team of Sheffield physicians Dr R B Zachary argues in the British medical journal Lancet To leave a child without food is to kill it as deliberately and directly as if one was cutting its throat Even the prescribing of antibiotics for infection must now be considered as ordinary care While granting that most of the survivors who have had a severe meningomyelocele will remain severely handicapped Dr Zachary maintains that the infants should alwaysbe encouraged to live and begiven early vigorous treatment to reduce their handicaps to a minimum Another physician expressed serious concern about the future of a society which desperately tries to rid itself of all discomforts What are the implications over the long haul for a child with a mild imperfection in a society which doesnt tolerate any imperfection Dr Robert E Cooke pediatricianinchief_at Johns Hopkins Hospital asks And he goes on If you decide not to feed the abnormal child where do you stop How abnormal should an individual be before you knock him off Dr R S Illingworth professor of child health at Sheffield and his physician wife Cynthia acknowledge that the death of a deformed infant would often be a merciful release for his parents Sometimes his death would be a merciful release for the child himself Nonetheless they have warned that if pediatricians deliberately adopt the practice of withholding treatment in severely defective children sooner or later they will make an error in diagnosis Dr Kurt Glaser clinical director at Rosewood State Hospital in Baltimore thinks that caring for a child with meningomyelocele is immensely easier if the lesion on the back has been repaired this avoids the continual problem of drainage and infection he says Dr Glaser is another one of those strongly opposed to any attempt by the physician to decide who should live and who die I have very little trust in the human race We cannot allow the first inch in this process Dr Glaser who was once a refugee from Austria says There are other doctors however who support Dr Lorbers plea that only custodial care be given children with a poor prognosis Their contention is that once the first lifeprolonging operation is performed it becomes more and more difficult to refrain from another and still another medical procedure For pediatricians dealing so much with the beginnings of life Dr H DeV Heese a South African doctor writes it is perhaps even more difficult to accept death as an inevitable part of life It is extremely difficult to let nature take its course It is far easier to treat than not to treat Few have the guts to stand aside and say they wont intervene when the childs head starts to blow up says Dr DavidClark chairman of the department of neurology at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine Yet Dr Clark too believes this must be done He points out that physicians and surgeons who decide to operate on the deformed childs back head limbs and urinary tract do so in a relatively optimistic period when the child is young and growing Then they often lose contact with the child If they looked again when the child reaches 18 he argues they would not be so optimistic Chronic embittered depression is common in these patients with multiple handicaps and abundantly understandable states Dr Clark Some tell me they wish they Were dead Among others interviewed who suggest giving nothing but custodial care to a child with severe multiple handicaps are Dr Richard Behrman professor of pediatrics at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York who says I see very few good outcomes from disasters in neonates He cautions however that not acting maximally can have a negative effect on the nursing staff in an intensivecare unit where you are trying to condition them to act maximally FOR many doctors and parents the tough ethical problems would be solved if the infants handicaps could only be determined before birth To them the abortion issue is far less troubling than the question of withholding treatment With the technique of amniocentesis genetic scientists have achieved a high degree of accuracy in predicting mongoloid births By inserting a needle in the womb they withdraw some of the mothers amniotic fluid the fetal cells floating in the fluid are then grown in the laboratory and their chromosomes inspected for the telltale extra mongolism chromosome As yet the method is not feasible in the early stages of pregnancy when abortion is simpler and safer however Refined techniques of intrauterine diagnosis could one day also allow detection and abortion of the fetus with meningomyelocele Theoretically a number of detection mechanisms are possible Employing amniocentesis for example doctors may be able to determine whether meningeal cells from the abnormal sac are present in addition to nor mal skin cells Right now however scientists dont know if meningeal cells are in fact shed from the open lesion or if shed whether they can be differentiated from normal cells Who is to decide whether grossly defective infants should live or be killed be treated or put aside to await death The doctor The parents Review boards While in the large majority of cities the birth of a child with meningomyelocele cannot be predicted intrauterine diagnosis would be particularly helpful for the one part of the population known to be at risk Mothers who have already had one child with a central nervous system defect meningomyelocele hydrocephalus anencephaly no brainhave a greater chance of bearing another than mothers who have not In a study conducted during the past year by Bruce Frye III a medical student at Johns Hopkins parents of children with meningomyelocele were asked whether it would be best for a woman to have an abortion to prevent the birth of a child with a spinal defect Of the mothers who were not morally opposed to abortion seven out of eight responded Yes Physicians engaged in prenatal detection of birth defects give short shrift to those who would deny an abortion to a woman bearing a fetus identified as severely defective To say all abortions are the same is ridiculous says Dr Michael Kaback director of the TaySachs disease program at Hopkins Theres a big difference between a college girl who wants an abortion as the result of a big weekend and the woman who wants an abortion because she has had one defective child She wants to have a child but not one who will suffer miserablyand at great cost To Dr Kaback infanticide and abortion for a congenital disease are biologically the same Youre killing life Yet in psychological terms he maintains having an abortion is quite different for a woman from giving birth to a live child and knowing that the child has been killed I dont think that human con_ sciousness and psychology as it exists in our society today could tolerate euthanasia Yet 20 years ago he muses our society wouldnt have tolerated extensive abortion Our mores change But Catholics even a liberal like Dr Andre Hellegers the director of the Kennedy Institute for Human Reproduction and Bioethics at Georgetown University do not agree that mores change so quickly I dont equate contraception with abortion but a fetus is life says Dr Hellegers who as a member of the Papal Commission on birth control was among the majority who favored contraception If the reason for an abortion is abnormalcy in the fetus Hellegers says then you logically come to the destruction of extrauterine life Yet he does not agree with those who say there is a moral obligation to treat every case The church teaches that extraordinary means need not be taken to save a life he says THE touchiness in the medical literature regarding euthanasia is akin to the silence a decade ago on abortion Over a drink I could tell you that I would like to see laws allowing active euthanasia said one department head but for publication I cant Ironically one of the most eloquent opponents of laws allowing active euthanasia in infants is the physician who admits to having actively killed six deformed infants over the course of his long career The danger of active euthanasia is not to the aged or to the defective child this man argues but to the person who does it I will never rorget the German neuropathologist who was a guiding star in the field in my tudent days When investigation of Nazi scientific activities began he was visited by some of his prewar students wh6 wanted to know how he got such enormous numbers of defective brains to study At first he replied that it was not his business to know where the brains came from But then he was confronted with a let ter in which he told attendants at an institution how to inject and kill patients I knew him as a young man He couldnt have done that then The change happens slowly Many have killed patients once or twice But when you make it a regular activity and start making laws the results can only be bad Ive got to answer for the six I killed before a higher bar of justice and I would do it again in each case But I dont want any law or anyone telling me I must do this The protection of the law is not as valuable to me as being required by another kind of law A year ago an editorial in The Journal of the American Medical Association pointed out that if American medicine bears any relation to British euthanasia is being practiced to a wide extent In the face of unpalatable reality one can cry ethics like the boy who cried wolf too often The editorial noted that there is something of a paradox in physicians wanting things left the way they areaccepting the need on occasion to hasten the end but insisting there be no change in the law which classifies such action as murder Dr Horace Hodes chairman of the department of pediatrics at Mt Sinai Hospital in New York is one department head who maintains that present laws are stupid and need changing He refuses to take the law into his own hands or to teach others to do so maintaining that no one in a responsible position should go against the law lightly But he would like to see doctors make a big push for revisions An editorial in the May issue of The Journal of Pediatrics argues that if doctors are not going to treat a patient with severe meningomyelocele they should be allowed to shorten the agony for the patient and his family not through the hypocrisy of starvation or of waiting for infection but throughswift and painless means This was printed with another editorial contending that doctors should never kill just because they cant cure Many would like to see active intervention allowed in the severest cases These people do not make such recommendations lightly nor do they confuse such cases with those of infants born with some capacity to enjoy lifeas mongols Dr Louis Lasagna of the University of Rochester Medical School in his book Life Death and the Doctor argues eloquently for more and better services and facilities for the retarded particularly mongols In a chapter entitled Slaughter of the Innocents he bases much of what he says on his experience with his own beloved mongoloid child In an interview however Dr Lasagna called for positive intervention to put to death quickly anencephalic infants and those with TaySachs disease a genetic metabolic defect resulting in a vegetable existence and death by age 3 From the ethical standpoint active euthanasia can be most humane he said BUT who is to decide whether grossly defective infants should live or be killed treated or put aside to await death The doctor The parents Review boards Until now the debate has usually been only over the extent to which the parents should be included in the physicians decision The pros and cons of parental participation are discussed in a recent article by Dr J S Lawson in The Australian Pediatric Journal As parents have the responsibility of caring for these infants while they are dependent beings Dr Lawson writes it seems quite unreasonable that they should not be informed of the diagnosis and prognosis and allowed to express their feelings In the unusual situation when the parents insist that lifesaving measures be carried out says Dr Lawson the doctor would find it difficult not to do so Similarly if parents insist that lifesaving measures should not be carried out there will be considerable difficulty if the doctor does not agree For all cases in which the parents are uncertain of what to do Dr Lawson says they should not participate in the actual decision of whether or not to treat the infant for the following reasons They may make decisions contrary to their real beliefs because they may think their churCh relatives friends or doctor will not approve Most parents have no previous experience or training with which to face these problems Feelings of guilt may be aroused if they come to believe that they made the wrong decision After studying 20 sets of parents whose severely handicapped newborns needed medical intervention to survive Dr Lawson concluded that the great majority of them preferred their infant to die quickly and peacefully rather than live with their severe handicaps Because of guilt about these feelings however many of the parents wished to pass the responsibility for deciding their infants fate on to the physician Nine of the infants had meningomyelocele and nine were mongols with complications Dr Lawson is keenly aware however that among doctors too the decision to save a severely handicapped infant is based on matters of opinion and subconscious emotions Past experience religion so cial pressure from colleagues and from the hospital staff all color the physicians decision He therefore recommends that responsibility for these lifeanddeath decisions be shared by two or more senior physicians The Kennedy panelists discussing the mongoloid case at the beginning of this article went even further and called for new forums in which doctors would not be the sole professionals making the decisions Many of the physicians I interviewed also said they would welcome guidelines or review boards to help them decide ethical questions posed by the new medical technology But they do not want these boards to have any mandatory power Ive already lived through abortion committees said Dr Irving M Cushner associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Johns Hopkins and Im not happy with the way humans act when they get power in their hands They become very restrictive and impose their value systems on the person asking assistance To allow physicians to act in what they perceive as the most humane manner a change in the law that would allow but not require infanticide in certain extreme and defined instances may be desirable Of course a social consensus would be necessary before such a change occurs Ultimately the decision must remain in the hands of the physician whose patients life is at stake What a review board will do is to insure that the decision is not based just on that one physicians prejudices He will have the counsel of people with a wide variety of views to be sure he perceives the ethical dilemmas involved and to assist him in arriving at the best decision for the individual case At Hopkins a review board to advise its medical staff on ethics is already in operation The board consists of a pediatrician a surgeon a psychiatrist a clergyman and a lawyer Even before it started functioning the board had acquired an underground title The God Committee
Women Legislators Start to Challenge Male Colleagues',https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/22/archives/women-legislators-start-to-challenge-male-colleagues-power.html,POCONO MANOR Pa May 21Women who serve in state legislatures believe that they are generally more industrious more informed more ethical and more sexually pure and sober than their male colleagues but they still seldom reach leadership positions according to views expressed at a meeting of women legislators here They are beginning however to challenge their relatively powerless status inside the state houses In making their challenge they may soon have their hand strengthened by a significant increase in their numbers More women than ever before will apparently run this year for seats in state legislatures If any sizable number win they will reverse a long down trend in the number of women legislators which has reduced their numbers to fewer than 400 out of about 7700 state legislators Problem Carrying the Ball Views on the problems and potential of women legislators were exchanged here at a threeday meeting of 50 women legislators from both parties and 26 states The 50 were chosen as outstanding women legislators by the sponsor of the meeting the Center for the American Woman and Politics which is a division of the Eagleton Institute of Politics The institute is affiliated with Rutgers the State University of New Jersey The participants in the conference reached a consensus on many issues among them the following A woman legislator hurts her own standing with her male colleagues when she carries the ball on such womens issues as abortion divorce law reform or ratification of the equal rights amendment But most of the women nonetheless believe they must take the lead on such legislation because the men will not The radical womens liberation organization make life harder for a woman legislator by creating antagonism to any woman who asserts herself even in a moderate way It is too early to assess the political impact of such relatively new womens groups as the National Organization for Women and the National Womens Political Caucus neither of which tends to be closely tied to women who have actually won elections except in a few states There is still a lot of bias against women running for office If one has children and husband the voters tend to think she should stay home and take care of them If she is single an opponent is likely to campaign on his virtues as family man Sometimes this backfires The one group that may be more prowomen than usual is young people The young are more accepting of anything different from what theyve regarded as the Establishment said Representative Grace T Hamilton Democrat of Georgia It is harder for a woman to raise money to run for office than it is for a man and even if she raises enough to cover her campaign costs serving in the legislature is likely to cost her money because of the low salaries and need to maintain two residences for part of the year The strongest theme of the conference turned out to be the extent to which women are said to be discriminated against once they get elected At the outset of the various discussion groups most of the women said they were treated fairly receiving good committee assignments by the second term at the latest for example But as they exchanged experiences at this meeting more and more said that they were the victims of serious discrimination Senator Clara Weisenborn a Republican who has been in the Ohio Legislature for 18 years said that women are not privileged to know the mechanics that are going on in the inner circle because we are not committee chairmen She said the general lack of leadership positions for women was probably womens own fault because were not pushing She added There isnt a single solitary door in this world that will open without pushing Im going back home and Im going to turn the knob and push Successful efforts to give women greater positions of power were recounted by Nancy Brown Burkheimer of Maryland presidentelect of the National Order of Women Legislators and Representative Audrey Beck of Mansfield Conn In Maryland women legislators achieved the cochairmanship of a major committee and the chairmanship of a minor one when the women united in a womans caucus and demanded such positions In Connecticut the Democratic women presented a solid front and demanded that one of their number Agnes Sim ons be named assistant majority leader After a sixmonth fight they won What was seen as an equally serious problem with the lack of formal leadership posts was the nonparticipation by women legislators in nighttime social activities with their male colleagues It was agreed that serious legislative business is often transacted on these alleged social occasions Select Circle Stressed Jess Unruh the former Speaker of the California Assembly who was one of the speakers at the conference concurred in this evaluation If you are not in the small select social circle you have no input he said Almost all of those present agreed that because women legislators are seldom present for the evening events for which they say lobbyists often pay the women tend to vote more in the public interest and less for special interests The women legislators agreed that they tend to be much older than the menthe midfifties as against the midthirties  generally having raised their children at least to high school age before running for office Service in the legislature thus capped for most women a lifetime of service in community organization they said In addition it was agreed most have reasonably prosperous husbands who can support them For the male legislators the situation was said to be different They use the legislature as a stepping stone the women agreed Representative Janet Merritt Democrat of Georgia summed up the point this way You have a group of young aggressive lawyers who go [to the legislature] not to serve the people but to build up their law practice You have others not good who want to practice hankypanky The really good lawyers dont stay in politics or else they move on to higher office

CONNECTICUT BAN ON ABORTION GAINS,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/23/archives/connecticut-ban-on-abortion-gains-housepassed-bill-amended-to-cover.html,HARTFORD May 22  The Connecticut Senate approved bill tonight that would make abortion illegal except to save the life of the mother or in cases where pregnancy follows rape or incest The vote was 21 to 14 Earlier in the day the House of Representatives passed 120 to 49 a bill allowing abortions only to save the life of the mother and the Senate action in amending the measure raised grave doubts that the House would agree to the change when it takes it up again tomorrow morning Gov Thomas J Meskill had called this special session of the Legislature for last Tuesday to pass an abortion control bill for the state was without one The last law passed in 1860 was declared unconstitutional last month by a panel of three Federal judges in Hartford who said it denied women the fundamental right to decide whether they would bear children The vote on the Senate amendment alone was 22 to 13 If the House of Representatives accepts it tomorrow when it reconvenes there is a strong chance that Governor Meskill would veto the bill for he has said he is against making exceptions in an abortion law for rape and incest The House had voted down the same amendment by a margin of almost 3 to 1 in floor debate And House members watching the Senate debate last night predicted that their chamber would not change its position The amendment permits abortions during the first 20 weeks after conception in rape and incest cases it a panel of three doctors approves the operation The bill passed by the House differed from the old voided law only in its preamble It was drafted by the Governors advisers in the hope that it would get a strict new law past another constitutinal test The preamble reads in part The public policy of the state and the intent of the Legislature is to protect and preserve human life from the moment of conception According to people who had a hand in the drafting of the bill the hope of getting past the courts this time is hung on a single sentence in the separate opinion of Judge Jon O Newman one of the two District Court judges who ruled the old law unconstitutional on April 18 If the Connecticut Legislature had made a judgement on this issue and had enacted laws to accord such protection to the unborn child the constitutionality of such laws would pose a legal question of extreme difficulty Judge Newman wrote The rest of the new bill is like the old as brief and as strict and does the following It makes it illegal to have an abortion or to perform one or to advise a woman to have one It makes illegal the advertising or selling of medicines or devices to encourage a miscarriage or an abortion except to physicians or licensed hospitals IR allows physicians to perform abortions or encourage miscarriages only to preserve the physical life of the mother Called Atrocious Bill It is an atrocity an atrocious bill declared Jean Thornton a Glastonbury Republican who had fought longer and harder over the years to liberalize Connecticuts abortion law than any other lawmaker Are we once again going to hold our state up to ridicule above all others Mrs Thornton asked She sought to amend the bill to allow women to have abortions within the first 20 weeks after conception but the amendment was defeated 124 to 40 Other attempts on the floor of the House to head off the bill or to soften its terms by amendments were brushed aside easily In all nine amendments were offered Irving J Stolberg a New Haven Democrat could not even get his amendment considered He proposed that if it was to be declared the intent of the Legislature to protect unborn children then it could hardly continue to take the lives of those already born In other words Mr Stolberg said the new bill was tantamount to repealing capital punishment and would have to be reworded slightly to make that clear House Speaker William R Ratchford a Danbury Democrat ruled that Mr Stolbergs amendment was not germane and could not be debated or voted upon Women vs Connecticut had already said they would challenge Governor Meskills tough new law if he could get it through the Assembly They fought it through the courts last time and won If the women do not challenge the law the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union has indicated it would In the House Francis J Collins the minority leader and a Brookfield Republican who sponsored Governor Meskills bill pleaded for quick passage Mr Speaker he said we are not going to change one single vote by the speeches we make here today Carl R Ajello Jr the majority leader and a Democrat from Ansonia also pleaded for swift passage without a lot of hot and emotional debate It is a matter of conscience and of ones individual approach to this kind of legislation he said In proposing the amendment late in the debate tonight Senator William J Sullivan a lawyer and a Democrat from Waterbury said he was not sure he was doing the right thing I am from a district in Connecticut where abortions are death he said Waterbury is heavily Catholic and heavily industrial In the bill it says if the mother may die then kill the child the Senator added Thats what we say Mr President I say what about the 13yearold child who is abused Senator Sullivan said Do we kill the 13yearold girl Why not give her a chance to remove her shame
CONNECTICUT GETS STRICT ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/24/archives/connecticut-gets-strict-abortion-new-law-signed-by-meskill-after.html,HARTFORD May 23 Gov Thomas S Meskill signed tonight into law a measure passed earlier by the General Assembly that would allow an abortion only when the life of the expectant mother was threatened The Governor who had called the special session and who interceded today to gain passage of the stringent bill drove to the capital after attending a dinner in Danbury to sign the bill at 1015 PM The law took effect immediately All I can say is Im very happy and grateful Mr Meskill said I think the legislature did a great job The measure passed after the Senate in a day of hectic politiking among legislative leaders and others withdrew an amendment it had approved Monday night The amendment which was unacceptable to the House of Representatives would have permitted abortions within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy in cases of rape and incest The tough bill  which the House passed yesterday only to have it amended by the Senate  cleared the House for a second time this afternoon almost without debate The vote was 99 to 48 The bill then had to go back to the Senate again Where the upper chamber almost without debate and by a vote of 18 to 15 withdrew its amendment rather than force the whole issue to a conference committee in an effort to find a compromise A strict measure was virtually assured even though the stringent law that Connecticut had had since 1860 was struck down last month by a threejudge Federal Court in Hartford as unconstitutional The Governor a Roman Catholic who studied for the priesthood as a young man had called for a tough law when he summoned the Assembly back into the session that began last week Even if he had felt differently the majority of Connecticuts lawmakers probably would not have The state is heavily Roman Catholic and the residents of its heavily industrial areas are generally considered stanch foes of abortion by request Before the House met this afternoon to deal with the Senates amendment Governor Meskill sharply criticized the amendment at a news conference It amounts to abortion on demand he said A woman can merely claim she was raped or it was an incestuous relationship Everyone who wants an abortion will be reporting rape I dont believe that the Senators recognized the complete meaning of that amendment The Governors intervention had a strong impact although it built up gradually during the day The House minority leader Francis J Collins a Brookfield Republican and sponsor of the Governors bill telephoned Mr Meskill at his home last night from outside the Senate chamber to tell him that the bill passed by the House was heading for trouble in the Senate Firm Stand Taken They did not discuss the tactics they would use to undo the expected Senate action at least not in detail This morning Mr Collins telephoned the Governor again while both were in their offices in the Capitol to tell him he thought he could get a majority in the House to reject the Senate amendment and force the Upper chamber to reconsider I didnt really know Mr Collins said this afternoon after the House sent the bill back to the Senate It was just a gut feeling I had He and Carl R Ajello Jr the House majority leader and a] Democrat from Ansonia met with House Speaker William R Ratchford a Danbury Democrat in the latters office shortly before the House debate began They were joined by Senator J Edward Caldwell the Senates minority leader a Bridgeport Democrat and other legislators and the word began to spread that the advocates of astrict bill were going to stand firm Mr Ajello made the motion to repass the original bill Mr Collins supported it Brief protests were registered by Ruth Clark a Branford Republican and by Virginia Connolly a Simsbury Republican and then the vote was taken The debate in the Senate was delayed beyond its scheduled start at 4 PM while the legislators discussed with the leaders on both sides of the Senate how best to respond to the House action Senator William J Sullivan the Waterbury Democrat who fought to get the amendment into the abortion bill last night fought a losing battle this evening to keep it there If last night you voted for the amendment you must have felt very strongly for it he said pleading with the Senators to remember the need of a victim of rape or incest for an abortion Search your consciences and determine whether or not a 13yearold girl can protect herself from some monster he said The motion in the Senate was to recede from the position it had taken the night before The motion was adopted by 18 votes to 16in effect an acceptance of the strict bill passed by the House A group called Women vs Connecticut has already announced plans to challenge the new law in the courts It succeeded in getting the Federal Court to overturn the former tough law on the ground that the law deprived women of the tight to govern their own I bodies The new measure passed by the Assembly differs from the former law only in that its preamble emphasizes the right to life of the human fetus
British Experts Support Research on Aborted Fetuses,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/25/archives/british-experts-support-research-on-aborted-fetuses.html,LONDON May 24 AP British medical and legal ex perts have called on the Gov ernment to allow scientists to use human fetuses obtained in abortions for such projects as the search for a cancer cure But the experts stressed that such use of unborn babies should be strictly controlled and that there should be no commerce in fetuses The recommendation was made by team of physicians and lawyers headed by Sir John Peel former president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists The Government set up the panel two years ago to con sider the ethical medical so cial and legal implications of using fetuses for research after there had been reports that abortion clinics were selling fetuses for that purpose The experts reported that the contribution to the health and welfare of the entire popu lation from the use of fetuses and fetal material in research was so important that the de velopment of such research should continue subject to safe guards The report said that public concern had arisen partly from the suggestion that financial transactions were involved The experts said that charges were acceptable only if they do no more than meet the necessary casts incurred in administering these services The report added In no other circumstances should there be monetary exchange for fetuses fetal tissue or fetal ma terial The experts said that nothing should be done to a viable fetusone capable of independent lifeinconsistent with promoting its life They said that a pregnancy of 20 weeks corresponding to a weight of about one pound should be considered proof of viability and not the current legal figure of 28 weeks Research on nonviable fet uses the experts said should be limited to those weighing less than threequarters of a pound They recommended that all research be approved by a responsible committee and that all research on nonviable fetus es should be carried out only in departments directly related to hospitals No Guidelines in US Although a number of re search projects currently under way in the United States use fetuses obtained from abortions there are no national guidelines governing such research Nor are there any committees currently considering national guidelines according to the American Medical Association which noted that Britains abor tion law had been liberalized several years before abortion law reform became common in this country

Tough Abortion Law in Connecticut Is Attributed to Meskill and Catholics,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/25/archives/tough-abortion-law-in-connecticut-is-attributed-to-meskill-and.html,HARTFORD May 24In the aftermath of the signing of Connecticuts tough new abor tion bill a number of legisla tors attributed the measures quick and decisive passage to pressure from the Roman Cath olic Church and Gov Thomas J Meskill at a time when many members of the General As sembly had been caught off guard by the suddenness of the issue On Tuesday night the Gov ernor a Republican and Cath olic signed the bill after a weeklong special session by the Legislature was held to re place the states 112yearold antiabortion statutes which were declared unconstitutional last month by a panel of three Federal judges In a move to prevent another court case the new bill was drafted with a preamble noting that the intent of the Legisla ture is to protect and preserve human life from the moment of conception Many concerned over the is sue were surprised that the new bill which provides a maximum fiveyear sentence for any per son who advises or performs an illegal abortion is consider ably tougher than Connecti cuts former 19thcentury law specifying a twoyear maxi mum sentence for abortionists Session Called Unexpected According to the House ma jority leader Carl A Ajello Jr Democrat of Ansonia most of the legislators had expected that the abortion issue would be handled through a court ap peal and not by General As sembly action And when the matter was brought up in the crisis atmosphere of a special session many legislators chose to vote on the basis of past fears Mr Aiello suggested We were all sensitive to the issue from past experience and there simply was not enough time to recanvass our constit uencies he said These fears according to Mr Ajello and other legislators were buttressed by strong pres sure from the Catholic hier archy during the three weeks preceding the passage of

influence has re mained pronounced Connecticut has been slower than other larger neighboring states in modernizing its laws regulating interpersonal be havior It was only seven years lago after a Supreme Court de cision that the state allowed the sale and use of contracep tive devices Earlier this year the legislature finally erased from the books a law prohibit ing women from standing or sitting at a bar And pornog raphy battles flare up continu ously in parts of the state Theres no question what I would have had to contend with if I had voted against the abortion bill said Mr Ajello whose district is heavily Cath olic There are five Catholic churches in my area and they told their worshipers in no un certain terms what my position should be I never received so many post cards letters peti tions and phone calls Like others Mr Ajello was convinced as he said that the impetus for the bill as it was drafted came directly from the Hartford Archdiocese They didnt want any loopholes and there werent any Lobbyists Were Active Clergymen and lobbyists sup porting the church position also walked the colonnaded halls of the Capitol building to button hole fencesitting legislators throughout the special session During the final hours before the bills passage members of the Connecticut Citizens Right to Life Committee and the Con necticut Catholic Conference continued to press Senators who had voted in favor of a mild amendment to permit abortions in cases of rape and incest Six Senators eventually re versed their position on their own amendment to permit the original bill to pass the Senate 18 to 15 Advocates of abortion reform conceded that their own heavy lobbying was of little avail and they did not even bother to attend the final day of voting in the Capitol With the current political climate it was pretty much waste of time said Judy Robi son a spokeswoman for Wom en versus Connecticut the or ganization which brought the successful court suit against the abortion laws Other legislators discounting the influence of the lobbyists attributed their final support of the bill to the strong stand taken by Governor Meskill who had labeled abortion as murder on several occasions and had strongly hinted that he would veto even a bill with a provision for rape and incest because it would allegedly provide a large loophole One Republican legislator conceded that he had moved from a liberal position to sup port of the strict bill because he had been repeatedly tele phoned by the Governor In Hartford the Governor hands out all the goodies and when he really wants to put the pressure on it works he said A number of legislators also attributed their stand to the Uncertainties of an election further complicated by an on going legislative

Church and State,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/26/archives/church-and-state.html,There is growing support for the view that the wall of separation between church and state has outlived its usefulness In the absence of any threat to establish a state religion and in recognition of both the greater liberalization of churches and the new ecumenical spirit between the faiths the old Jeffersonian warning sounds quaint and obsolete to some political pragmatists In the light of such views the determined and skillful campaigns mounted by the Roman Catholic Church against New Yorks liberal abortion law and for the stringent abortion curbs just adopted in Connecticut merit careful analysis Both are uptodate reminders that the interests of organized religion and of secular government often remain as manifestly separate today as at the time of the nations birth It is clearly the rightindeed the purposeof any religious hierarchy to do its utmost to persuade mankind of the virtue and wisdom of its doctrine To that end religious leaders are dutybound to preach educate indoctrinate persuade and even to dictateso long those who are their voluntary adherents remain willing to give heed Nor is it improper for religious spokesmen to try to persuade legislators to espouse their views morality and to reflect them in their legislative actions Every public official moreover brings to his task his personal philosophy of life and moralsa philosophy in varying degree shaped by religion What is unacceptable because it is dangerous to a free society is the use of the states power to impose religious laws and doctrine When the state finances religious institutions it subsidizes the specific goals of those institutions which may be in conflict with the will of the peoples elected representatives Since money is power state subsidy will at the same time endanger the religious Institutions autonomy The state has no right to interfere with the Roman Catholic parochial schools instruction on such questions as birth control or abortion any more than with Christian Scientist teachings in opposition to medical treatment Nor has secular government any right to force any individual to abandon his or her moral objection to birth control or to overrule conscientious objections to war and killing None of this diminishes the importance of the continued existence of educational alternatives both religious and secular in a pluralistic society The nonpublic schools like the public ones are threatened by inflation and recession They must be given all possible benefits which will reduce the fiscal threat to their existence but within the confines of the constitutional protection of churchstate separation Such aid has long been provided indirectly through tax exemption It has been extended further by the Supreme Courts approval of aid to children for such purposes as school transportation nutrition health services and most recently even textbooks Additional support could be derived from a more extensive sharing of public school facilities and instruction by nonpublic school pupils But there is little doubt that the bulk of the extensive aid to parochial schools voted by the New York Legislature and signed into law by Governor Rockefeller represents the kind of state subsidy of religious institutions which leads to a dangerous entanglement of the institutions and fortunes of church and state Whatever the permissible extent of any action to ease the religious schools fiscal crisis may be realism demands acceptance of the fact that it will be peripheral Those who believe in the importance of religious schools will have to continue to bear the major burden of supporting them The alternative is to impose the states power on the church and to give the church doctrine the implied imprimatur of the state Such a course would jeopardize the freedom of church and state alike
MITCHELL CALLS N0.2 POST ‘OPEN’,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/26/archives/mitchell-calls-no-2-post-open-says-decision-on-agnew-will-be-made.html,WASHINGTON May 25 John N Mitchell manager of President Nixons reelection campaign said today that he regarded the selection of a Republican Vice Presidential nominee as an open question Asked whether Vice President Agnew would be chosen to run for another term or replaced by some other candidate the former Attorney General replied That decision would be made later down the line [Secretary of the Treasury John B Connally said that he thought he would vote for President Nixon in November but that he still considered himself a Democrat according to The Associated Press] Five months ago on a television interview President Nixon praised Mr Agnew as a man of dignity and courage and added I believe that he should stay on the team That is my thinking at this time He has not indicated publicly any contrary view A week ago the Vice President said it would be totally unrealistic to believe that the Republican National Convention would replace him with John B Connally the retiring Secretary of the Treasury a lifelong Democrat who has often been mentioned in speculation about the post Meeting with reporters over breakfast this morning Mr Mitchell said he understood how Mr Agnew had made such an assessment as a matter of practical party politics but that he did not entirely agree I wouldnt be quite so dogmatic about it the Presidents key political adviser said If an incumbent President decided he wanted to shift to a VicePresidential nominee of a different party hed find a way to do it Mr Mitchell did not indicate that he expected Mr Connally on the 1972 Nixon ticket however I dont believe he would be interested in it he said adding later apparently he just doesnt like to live in Washington In a broadranging discussion of Republican plans and prospects in this political year Mr Mitchell made these other points Senator George McGovern whom he regards as the leading Democratic Presidential contender will have a pretty difficult time in view of his record climbing out of left field into center and when his record is made known his base is going to shrink substantially Lawrence F OBrien the Democratic national chairman visited Gov George C Wallace of Alabama in the hospital Tuesday to enlist his support in a stopMcGovern coalition at the Democratic convention At the Democratic National Committee a spokesman for Mr OBrien said the Mitchell report was totally absurd and untrue because the chairman wants an open convention and will abide happily by its results There is no coalition against Mr McGovern or any other candidate President Nixon will receive the majority of Northern votes that would have gone to Mr Wallace if the Alabama Governor decides not to run on a thirdparty ticket A lot of Democratic House members may switch to the Republican party because of the disgust they have with the posture of the candidates in the Democratic party and their belief that the frontrunners if nominated are not going to help them get elected Despite his criticism of Senator McGovern Mr Mitchell refused to say that the South Dakotan would be the easiest Democrat for President Nixon to defeat He said that too many unresolved factors were involved such as a possible fourthparty leftwing challenge and the position of organized labor At the Capitol Senator Hugh Scott the Republican floor leader called Mr McGovern the acid abortion and amnesty  the tripleA  candidate He said the country needed more voter education to familiarize itself with the Democrats positions Mr Mitchell refused to estimate what the Republican national campaign would cost this year but he said that real spending by each party in 1968 had probably run about 100million and the GOP would be under that figure this time He would only say that the Republican campaign would commit all the money we can raise while staying within the new statutory limits for television radio and newspaper advertising The Nixon campaign manager discounted the economy and Vietnam as issues in the general election saying there wont be any bigswing issues except the Presidency and his record in office He expressed confidence that Mr Nixon could win on the issues of his own personality and record because he said the polls indicated that the public gives the President high ratings on dedication patriotism allegiance to the country and ability to handle the job

the final 10 days of the campaign Senator George McGovern of South Dakota appears to be leading Senator Hubert H Humphrey of Minnesota in the Democratic Presidential primary in California But the Humphrey forces expect that the wide exposure that is possible in three hourlong television confrontations between the two Senators will enable the Minnesotan to pull ahead to win the 271 votes at stake here on June 6 Remaining Primaries California New Jersey New Mexico South Dakota June New York June 20 Were counting on the debates said Eugene Wyman the Los Angeles lawyer who is one of Senator Humphreys main advisers and the leading figure in the California Humphrey campaign Senator Humphrey surprised many persons in both campaigns last night with his announcement that he would go to New Jersey next Thursday and Friday The announced purpose is to permit him to campaign personally with New Jersey delegates to the Democratic Nalional Convention Some of the Humphrey California advisers were openly critical of the change which will cost two days of campaigning just before Election Day Both candidates had minimal schedules as they prepared for tomorrows debate Senator Humphrey whose Gist birthday was today went to a strawberry festival The most important of the few Democratic newspapers in this state The Sacramento Bee endorsed Senator McGovern The editorialcarried also in the Fresno and Modesto Bee papersafter discussing problems that it felt had debilitated the national spirit and economy said More than any other candidate in recent history Senator McGovern has been refreshingly candid in how he proposes to solve these problems He is challenging old ideas which have failed and for this he deserves great credit Another Endorsement Last Sunday The Riverside PressEnterprise endorsed Senator McGovern The first of the joint television appearances will be tomorrow afternoon in Los Angeles where the two Senators will be questioned by a threemmber panel The hourlong program will be broadcast directly to the Eastern time zone at 6 PM and tape recordings of it will be released at appropriate hours in other time zones so that it will be broadcast on California stations three hours after it occurred Spokesmen for the Columbial Broadcasting System were not clear on the prease format that will be used on the program which will be an expanded version of the regular Face the Nation Various Points at Issue George Herman will moderate Panelists will be David Schumacher of CBS News and David S Broder of The Washington Post A freewheeling exchange will be sought a CBS spokesman said It appeared that the Senators would be free to comment on each others answers and even to ask each other questions In this format Senator Humphrey would be able to press the points that he has attempted to raise against Senator McGovern this weekquestions of their respective stands on budget cuts that would close defenseoriented plants in this state on abortion laws on marijuana laws and on amnesty for draft evaders Moreover Senator Humphrey has said that he felt this sort of appearance enabled him to show to best advantage But those California Democrats and reporters who were present in Chicago in 1968 when Senators McGovern Humphrey and Eugene J McCarthy of Minnesota appeared before that years California delegation remember that Senator McGovern was the star and Senator Humphrey made a poor showing Charles Kerch of San Diego who operates an advisory poll system that some political candidates use said he had found that in Southern California Senator Humphrey and Senator McGovern were in very close contention But in northern California he said Senator McGovern has a substantial lead Mr Kerchs system which he presents only as showing trends is based on interviews in shopping centers where voters are shown names on a card and asked which candidate they would support Mr Kerchs finding was that Mayor Sam Yorty of Los Angeles and Representative Shirley Chisholm of Brooklyn both have small followings while the support for Senator Edmund S Muskie of Maine has virtually disappeared In some areas known for their conservative outlook such as bluecollar sections on the east side of San Francisco Bay Mr Kerch found considerable support for Gov George C Wallace of Alabama Writein Difficult However supporters of Governor Wallace must write in his name which will be difficult in the various ways that votes are cast in this stateby machine by paper ballot marked with special pens that enable machine counting or by paper ballot Governor Wallaces national campaign staff has announced that it would not finance any writein campaign in California If his supporters here can raise the money for it a campaign may be carried on the staff

Representative Chisholm But except for Mayor Yorty and some activity by Mrs Chisholm the others have dropped out Former Senator McCarthys position has been somewhat ambiguous Ile has given a pro forma endorsement to Senator McGovern here but has continued to assert that he is himself a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination Mayor Yorty continues to issue statements and address

Federal Sterilization Program in Doubt,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/28/archives/federal-sterilization-program-in-doubt.html,OAK RIDGE Tenn May 26  Harold Sharp is not going to have any more children The Federal Government made that possible by furnishing him with a male sterilization operationa vasectomyearlier this year Every man should get one said Mr Sharp an unemployed father of four while standing in front of his trailer home Seems to me like poor people are having too many children When the Office of Economic Opportunity amended its rules to permit voluntary sterilization last year the assumption within the program was that if persons like Mr Sharp could be reached through a pilot project here in Anderson County then the poverty agency would soon open other sterilization programs around the country Mr Sharp and most of the 66 persons here who have already had the operation seem openly enthusiastic about the effect on their lives But the poverty agency has not opened up similar programs elsewhere  and the future of Governmentsponsored sterilization remains very much in doubt Reservations Voiced The OEOs director of health affairs Dr Leon Cooper has held back the distribution of printed guidelines that would have encouraged other OEO agencies to provide sterilizations Dr Cooper says he has reservations about costs and priorities of sterilization and says he wants to know more about the longrange effects However he denies the occasional suggestion from a few others in the program that the Nixon administration halted Government sterilization as part of the Presidents antiabortion stance I put the stop on said Dr Cooper This is not an administration decision They are two different things The pilot project here has also been criticized by a former key employe Bob Brooks who has charged that the local officials were more concerned with performing research than with giving services He contended that the hill people were unaware that personal information about them was being gathered There is open controversy within the agency Queries and modifications from Dr Coopers office have put additional pressure on the project to the extent that the local director Mrs Jeanette Smith has recently taken several weeks of sick leave Yet all concernedfrom Dr Cooper in Washington to Mrs Smith and Mr Brooks here in Oak Ridge and to their clients out in the countrysidepraise sterilization as one way to fight the birth rate and the cycle of poverty here in the hills That was the original concept when the OEO changed its rules a year ago dropping a ban on sterilizations after considerable field work by a young doctor in the Family Planning section Warren Hern The poverty agency then accepted a proposal for a pilot project by the Oak Ridge chapter of the Planned Parenthood Association of the Southern Mountains which flourishes here among the wives of Atomic Energy Commission scientists The project received a grant of 240773 to train some local residents as outreach workers who would discuss family planning with the hill people many of whom had little knowledge of the reproductive process All methods of contraception would be provided but the chief goal was to provide 150 vasectomies for men and 150 tubal ligations for women within two years All operations would be strictly voluntary after several counseling sessions While the program got rolling last fall Dr Hem wrote a set of guidelines that were to help other OEO projects that were expected to follow About 25000 copies of the guidelines were printed and prepared for distribution last fall Then Dr Cooper was brought in as director of health affairs which has jurisdiction over the familyplanning sector of the program Over all Effect Queried When I got oriented in January it seemed to me we had a lack of knowledge about the overall effect of this program Dr Cooper said this week I had no problems with the guidelines themselves with the substance But the guidelines were my last point of control Dr Cooper said that he had three key reservations about expanding the sterilization programs cost priorities and the longrange effect He explained Were paying anywhere from 15 to 150 for vasectomies and were paying 150 to 3001 for ligations Our programs are supposed to be ambulatory and careoriented We can provide the Pill or the IUD [intrauterine device] for around 75 a year We must weigh the cost impact Then we have to be concerned with program priorities We have many programs that are in great demand around the country We have to choose carefully Finally Dr Cooper indicated he wanted to know more about the longrange impact upon the clients since the operations are usually irreversible What is the psychological effect Dr Cooper asked How many people wish they hadnt done it I have the feeling that Anderson County is going to tell us that The administrators of the pilot project have tried to provied as much information as possible They have gathered medical histories from their clients pregnancy histories from the women and family information which has been tabulated by Tennessee Depart ment of Public Health computers The leaders also composed a field questionnaire that deals with the attitudes of the clients It was this portion of the information gathering process that particularly disturbed Mr Brooks a wiry 45yearold factory worker who is the leader of the field workers Mr Brooks who frequently cites his own rural heritage credits his vasectomy many years ago with a better standard of living and education for his two daughters who have been graduated from the University of Tennessee and his teenage son Mr Brooks has eagerly preached the value of small families and vasectomies to his friends in the hills But Mr Brooks says he became alarmed when he was instructed to take down all this personal information after informal interviews without disclosing that the material was being collected Mrs Smith the project director said that information had been collected because the funding agency needs to know what peoples attitudes are She said that clients were identified only by code and she stressed that the information was not available to other officials Mr Brookss resignation in April caused Dr Cooper to investigate his charges about the information I want to be certain that people know that this is part of a study Dr Cooper said But the fundamental thing is that they are not identified by name I dont have any other problems about the research Neither apparently do the clients in Anderson County Harold Sharp said he knew that information was being gathered on him from the interviews But he said he didnt careas long as the people were being helped He said his entire family life and his outlook had improved since his vasectomy You sit here on Saturday afternoon he said pointing to the trailer homes on the hillside and you see fourfourfour chidren I try to talk to other guys about my vasectomy I hope they listen

standing around in a daze having just achieved the greatest ambition of her lifea husband The two men decide that the groom should buy the product and then as a polite afterthought they turn to the bride and ask her what she thinks Oblivious to everything she replies I do THE New York Chapter of the National Organization for Women NYNOW has just filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission in Washington asking that it take the American Broadcasting Companys flagship station WABCTV of New York off the air The legal action is based on three grounds discrimination against women in employment failure to ascertain womens needs and interests in programing and violation of the FCC Fairness Doctrine which requires that both sides be presented in an issue of controversial public importance The petition asks formally for FCC denial of WABCTVs application for the renewal of the stations threeyear license to broadcast WABCTV is currently preparing an answer NOW believes the ABC network is equally guilty but the only legal way to get at it is through the local affiliate The Government may decide the case upon receipt of the answer or it may order hearings In the interim the station has requested a meeting to negotiate with NYNOW and NOW lawyers at the Center for Constitutional Rights a nonprofit group of attorneys who have volunteered their services Meanwhile the TV company declines public comment except to say that it believes it does not discriminate against women THE legal action results in part from NOWs monitoring of television programs during the course of a year and half At first the monitoring seemed to show that all TV programs portray women equallythat is in an equally bad light But in the overall studies conducted by more than 100 monitors WABCTV came out consideraily worse than other stations In news programs women in the movement are made to seem ridiculous snide remarks trailing after them like broken arrows In sports coverage of the Olympics when women won seven out of eight US medals reporter Doug Johnson led off his 40second story with Thank heaven for little girls The little girls remained anonymousalthough rest assured the women in Clifford Irvings life were covered in loving and lengthy detail In public affairs programs womens needs and issuesdivorce and alimony the Equal Rights Amendment childcare centers the earnings gap abortionare for the most ignored Compared with its rival the printed word television is an ostrich A generalized contempt for women is implicit in the entire pattern of programing From The Courtship of Eddies Father to The Young Lawyers women are domestic drudges and office ancillaries dependent on men emotionally and economically their extraordinary incompetence exceeded only by their monumental stupidity Decisionmaking positions of power and leadership authority and status in the communitythese are the province of men only Nowhere is this more evident than in commercials As part of its challenge NYNOW did a study of 1241 commercials Almost all of them showed women inside the home In 426 per cent they were involved in household tasks in 375 per cent they were domestic adjuncts to men and in 167 per cent they were sex objects That doesnt leave very many and a lot of commercials dont even have people in them Only 03 per cent showed women as autonomous people leading independent lives of their own The majority of commercials sell either domestic or cosmetic products and in these of course women are the stars Above and beyond their consumer function to keep the economy breathing they play two stock rolesthe housewifemother or the sex object In both they are viewed solely in their relation to men Biologically the wife mother is there to serve the species socially her purpose is to serve men children and animals Psychologically shes an obsessive compulsive Her life alternates between the kitchen and the bedroom persecuting the germs guarding the wax on

definition of a wife Honey heres your laundry the new bride says brightly Did I wash it right Her husband registers his approval and she is fulfilled He noticed she says euphorically im a wife THIS sort of thing may seem absurdly funny to those of us who fancy ourselves above it but when it goes on day after day and well into the night endlessly repeating the same unnerving message to 40 million viewers its not so funny anymore Last year a Good Housekeeping Survey reported more than third of all respondents have on occasion been so offended by a commercial that theyve turned it off Our own monitors most of whom were not feminists found 40 per cent of the commercials objectionable Watching commercials is like being blasted by some casually malevolent propaganda machine dedicated to the humiliation of women The woman in the Anacin commercial doesnt even have a headache to call her own She takes Anacin to stay on her feet longer in order to serve her family No headache is going to make me explode at my husband she says gritting her teeth and vibrating with pain The point isnt that Anacin will make her feel better but that it will spare her husband No wonder the man in the Geritol ad is complacent The product has given his wife the energy to take care of the baby go to a school meeting shop for groceries and cook dinner Through it all she has still managed to stay attractive for him My wife I think Ill keep her he Who wouldnt In most ads womens lives are dreary Its the men children and even the family dog who have the fun while women do the work In 544 per cent

daughter would be helping are on deck enjoying themselves sailing Fleisclunans Margarine uses the same theme This time the husband and son are out playing ball while Mom is in the kitchen worrying about their eating habits She doesnt get a vacation either She unpacks in the hotel room while her husband complains about how he cant sleep  and she stops unpacking to get him some Nytol Theres something inherently illogical in all this A womans main goal is supposed to be to catch a man but once shes got him she spends her life in the kitchen Maybe she ought to rethink her goals The television industry perhaps feels it has a vested interest in encouraging a conventional role for women Keep women in the kitchen and you wont have to hire them or worry about raising their pay According to a Time magazine article If women workers got as much as men wage costs would rise by some 109billion  more than all pretax corporate profits last year Women who are seen engaging in mad dusting contests with Endust provide their own justification for not being hired much less being paid decent wages  incompetence and Mack of intelligence Even in their traditional roles as housewives women are put down In a Head and Shoulders Shampoo commercial a touching blind devotion is exhibited by Michaels wife whose thinking apparatus seems to have dried up and flaked away since her marriage Her delivery is naively sincere When I met Michael she confides he was using Head and Shoulders When we dont have three tubes I have to run out to the store to get that third tube She laughs It works she says staring out with big brown blank eyes Michael says it works But Michaels wife has no credibility Females rarely do Her small voice is followed by a male voiceover the voice of authority which confers the stamp of approval on the product Male authority is a builtin assumption and it teaches women to look up to men as experts 893 per cent of the voiceovers are male The consumers who might normally be expected to know something about the products they use are not granted even that slight margin of knowledge Women never tell men what to do but men are forever telling women what to do And how to do it Even in their own private beauty realm women arent quite with it Im all thumbs the helpless woman in the Revlon Fabuliner ad says It wont skip It wont run The male voiceover keeps telling her with decreasing patience that no matter how clumsy and inept she is she just cant mess herself up because it draws a perfect line every time She finally learns the lesson and repeats with slow dawning comprehension It draws a perfect line every She really ought to haul off and sock him but the need for male approval implicit in 339 per cent of these commercials stops her Women who have been traditionally dependent on the approval of men in order to Survive are frequently made to play the fool as the price Submissiveness is one way It shows up in 243 per cent of commercials Take the Maxwell House Coffee ad with Danny and Doubting Thomas The one thing she doesnt doubt is male superiority As she rattles away with her spiel she says something he doesnt likeTest my Instant Maxwell House Coffee  and he pounces Hold it young lady he says in mock sternness having supervised her performance from the sidelines Its her commercial but he just cant resist taking over And she lets him Our coffee she asks meekly divining his purpose on the spot And smiles And smiles Women smile a lot It goes with the shuffle Even more devastating is the newMrCleanwithleamon commercial which features a marionettelike woman whose strings are pulled by an avuncular voiceover Nice nose he says touching it presumptuously As if he had clicked a switch her face lights up with a huge grin Thanks she says gratefully Lets test it he saysan order not a question  and she acquiesces cheerfully and obediently like a child Even with all of her previous odorsniffing experience she guesses wrong But he is there to tell her the right answer while she listens wideeyed and respectful CANT these pursuits be presented with dignity Tak n by itself there neednt e anything degrading abo housework or caring for a family Advertising agencies claim that they are in business to sell products and that their primary responsibility is to the client In other words if the manufacturers who advertise on television decide they wont approve any ads showing women driving station wagons then the agency wont create any such ads Last year we met with the market research people at BBDO to convince them that they had some social responsibility toward the public in the area of imagemaking They disagreed At any rate in most commercials the image of woman is an inferior one and image makers have made housework a pejorative word When men do the same work as women the work is upgraded because they earn money at it In two separate scenes Campbells Vegetable Soup shows a male chef and a housewife She is the family cook but cooking is his profession The implication is that even a lowly housewife can make as good a bowl of soup as a professional cook Yet not even the few professional women whose lives definitely do not revolve around the stove escape In a Dove commercial a professional actress is shown handwashing the dirty dinner dishes of 150 people The important thing is not that she is an actress but that she is a female and females wash dishes Her career her real work is valueless Eve Arden is actually in the kitchen demonstrating Roast n Boast but you dont see Durward Kirby who represents Ivory Liquid washing the dishes with it As a man all he has to do is hand down the word His identity and status are conferred on the product A woman who has none derives hers from the product People tend to imitate the roles they see to become what is expected of them When they are given only one socially acceptable choice it inhibits them from choosing freely what they want to be For the millions of women painfully breaking out of their traditional roles the persistent television stereotypes are like a knock on the head telling them to stay in line The psychological damage is immeasurable Feedback a WBAI series about television discussed the problem Societies develop images about themselves their purposes and their objectives The system of such images forms a societys mythology and governs its actions thoughts and attitudes The passive viewer lets the TV image subvert his own and the viewer is removed from the possibility of alternatives The big concern of ad agencies is something they call the reality of the market place Bill Ballard a Madison Avenue copywriter says Ads are a reflection of society as the people who are responsible for advertising see it But most ads reflect only one aspect of the life of the middleclass housewife There are other realities The lifestyle and problems of working women43 per cent of adult womenare virtually ignored on commercials They are still perceived primarily in their relationship to men as wives who happen to be working The working woman crops up occasionally still close to the hearth as in the Reynolds Aluminum ad wrapping a quick gourmet dinner that cooks itself while she dresses for the dinner party she and her husband are giving Reynolds hasnt yet got to the point where the husband who also works shares orperish the thought takes full responsibility for the dinner In fact television takes a positively reactionary moral stance toward women On the rare occasions when they are let out of the house they are generally chaperoned as if all were Victorian virgins They dont do anything aloneIn commercials they never buy airplane tickets or travel by themselves If they use a camera there is always a man taking pictures alongside them If they go to a restaurant they are accompanied by their family If they smoke the tobacco is offered to them by a man LOOKING at these capsule dramatizations of male fantasies you would never know that 42 per cent of the first million Mustangs Old were bought by women Ads for cars banks and insurance were only 32 per cent of daytime commercials as opposed to 191 per cent in prime time when the men are home These sexsegregated ads are saying in effect that women are incapable of making important decisions alone Important decisions are decisions that cost a lot of money In the bank ads women who do use banks do so for frivolous reasonsthe checks are pretty or you dont have to bother about your balance because the bank will cover your overdraft anyway As for cars woman by herself neither buys them nor has them serviced and she is rarely shown behind the wheel If she is with her husband he is driving Goodyear Tires has a stacked commercial showing a man driving along happily on a sunny day and woman driving in the pouring rain at night worried and nervous Despite the fact that insurance tables show that women have fewer accidents than men the woman is still imagined as the mechanically inept hairbrain who manages to run over a suitcase twice in the middle of her own driverway Just as women are barred from the world of money and power so men are revealed as incompetent on the domestic scene Since the things men do are socially and economically more valuable than the things women do a man is not supposed to know his way around the house Theres something wrong with him if he can cope If he is in the kitchen he is usually filling in sloppily while his wife is out performing another of her sex functionshaving a baby Comet which features Jane Withers as Josephine the Plumber has a sink piled high with a weeks worth of filthy pots which the man asks her to clean for him He wouldnt dare ask a male plumber to scrub those pots Josephine who looks more like a nurse than a plumber is a fraud All she ever does is clean sinks you never see her actually take on a leaking faucet With all the work she has to do and with the small amount of intelligence allotted to her the woman who will always be a Maxwell housewife certainly doesnt need an education Education anyway is for the purpose of getting a job to earn more money and money along with mental activity is male territory All of the ads for educational opportunities and careers invite only men to participateexcept for one the US Auto Club Driving School There is a special division for women students the male voiceover says patronizingly Women are some strange subspecies whose coordination is questionable at best FOR women selfbetterment has nothing to do with education or training Rather it is generally synonymous with sex appeal and the pitch is to fear a veiled threat that women wont be acceptable to men Skinny Dip Cologne has a woman rejected by a group of men until she splashes on the scent Then they welcome her It is assumed that men are naturally acceptable to women because they are men They may occasionally have to rinse their mouths with Listerine or spray their unruly locks with Command but the object is polygamous fun not the serious business of monogamy For a woman anything goes As a physical entity she commands no more respect than she does as an economic entity Maybe less Consider the Playtex bra ad in which a woman wearing the bra runs into a male friend who had ignored her charms in the past The man his popping eyes fastened on her chest says in disbelief Is it really you We all know what Fly Me really means and why all the men in the office cluster around the Olivetti Girl She is a plaything a sex object With the typewriter fixing up all the errors she will have more time to entertain her bosses Two brains are better than one says Olivetti but she doesnt really need a brain at all In the marketplace of television women are just another commodity peddling their wares like the model in the ShopRite pantyhose commercial who becomes the product She sits there in the grocery cart like a big doll smiling her legs in one of the classic cheesecake positions waiting to be picked and bought Theres no denying that sex sells but its safe to say that the male broadcasting oligarchy would be revolted at the sight of men perpetually displaying their bodies It would strike them as obscene But it hasnt occurred to them to consider whether female sex symbol selling not only a product but herself strikes women as obscene Maybe the best consciousnessraiser would be to turn the ads around in a kind of reverse degradation and show men slinking around in tight bikinis being ogled by appraising female eyes or eating spoonfuls of Light n Lively in the reducing salon while the camera panned slowly up their legs Minute by minute you become a man again a condescending female voiceover would tell him as he soaked in the tub with his Softique Only 22 per cent of all commercials are for male personalcare products And the image of the mate is quite different from that of the female He is rarely seen inside the home In more than 70 per cent of the ads men are engaged in a wide range of activities from politics to fishing and the advertisers approach to them is both serious and informativein a word adult Provocative poses are out The man in the Proteen 29 commercial barely glances in the mirror as he talks merely a quick check for neatness and grooming There isnt a hint that he is prettying up for a woman or that he is in love with his own image Theres a brisk snappy efficiency about him in contrast to the helpless woman in the Twice As Nice Shampoo commercial who turns down her date because she cant do a thing with her hair A magic man materializes to tell her what to do but the Proteen 29 man already knows and hes telling us Women are forever put under the microscope singled out for male scrutiny Virginia Woolf noticed it looking through the titles in the British Museum and seeing all the books about women written by men Things havent changed that much since 1928 A womans anatomy is fair game A mans sex is unmentionable Even in the health ads Blue Cross Blue Shield talks about the pap test never about prostate trouble But if biology is destiny for one sex then it has to be destiny for the other too It is taken for granted that men perspire but women are victims of their own bodies Emotions make a woman different from a man the male voiceover insinuates but hes got it all backward If the female body were the norm for the whole human raceand the fact that the fetus starts out as a female strongly suggests that it isthe reasoning would be quite the opposite Men who are frequently shown engaging in strenuous sweaty activities are the ones who need a special deodorant It depends on whether you consider excessive perspiration to be normal But womens needs are measured against the normal standard of male needs and where those needs diverge it is the woman not the man who is judged to be lacking or peculiar or delicate or inferior Her own standards dont apply Indeed it isnt recognized that she has any This subhuman creature defective mentally and physically has been endowed by men with a hypothetical need for extra iron a gentler laxative a thinner cigarette a smaller car presumably so she can park it alongside a mans without denting his fender But now the final blow She is the victim of an ancient taboo a primal flaw in her sex It makes you feel fresh and it lasts all day one woman tells another in one commercial Women obsessed with cleanliness are unclean themselves There are similar genital products for men but theyre not advertised on television In fact in adagency product categories male deodorants are listed under cosmetics and female deodorants under hygiene This idea goes all the way back to the prejudices of the men who wrote Leviticus a book of the Bible which reflects primitive beliefs that women during their menstrual periods are unclean and must be isolated from other members of the group Leviticus took it one step furtherwomen were also unclean after they had borne a child and anyone who went near them risked defilement This is tantamount to telling black people that their skin color is naturally dirty No advertiser in his right mind would think of doing that but its all right to say it to women The message is sadistic And some of the products may be dangerous They contain talc which is under Government investigation as a possible cancer producing agent IT is naive to expect spontaneous changes The National Association of Broadcasters code the Ten Commandments of the industry says thou shalt not violate the sanctity of marriage and the value of the home No other lifestyle is valid Marriage home and children are televisions hottestselling items In todays overpopulated polluted world this value is open to question Ellen Peck author of The Baby Trap accuses broadcasters of a pronatalist bias in their programing which she feels discourages womens career aspirations She suggests that television is the only medium that has access on a scale large enough to educate the public about these social issues But discussion of this and other socially pressing problems according to the industrys own guidelines is in bad taste It is precisely this lack of information and lack of choices that motivated the NYNOW challenge The sad thing is that products can be sold without insulting people Last year Clairol received an oldhat award from NOW for its sexist advertising Its new ad demonstrates what new habits of thought can do One woman is shown as a jockey another is congratulated by her husband and child on receiving her college diploma a third is working competently and with aplomb in a professional capacity All of them are away from home If the corporate mind of Clairol a bastion of genteel sexism can do it so can everyone else
TV Mailbag; ‘What Do the Soaps Have to Do to Win Your Approval?’,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/28/archives/-what-do-the-soaps-have-to-do-to-win-your-approval.html,To THE EDITOR As the creatorwriter of both One Life To Live and All My Children two soap operas of which Terry Ann Knopf was particularly critical in her May 7 article The Good Women Still Drink Sherryin which she hurled the indictment that the soaps have yet to come to grips with reality in any meaningful way  I am impelled to a counterindictment Ms Knopf has either failed in a reporters primary function of thoroughly researching her subject in regard to the above mentioned programs or she has deliberately ignored some basic facts about them in order to write a slanted story She first accused All My Children of not presenting the character of Amy Tyler in the role of a peace activist as she had been described in an ABC press release Ms Knopf added that after the show had been on for well over a month Amy had participated in exactly one demonstration and that was offcamera Since the program is live on tape within the four walls of a studio  with a tight cast budget  showing a peace demonstration on camera would of necessity have made for a very poor turnput of activist sympathizers However Amys work for peace her fight for an end to the war in Vietnam included not only offcamera demonstrations  many more than one  but membership in other groups working for the same goad as she among them Mothers Work For Peace And these groups and Amys participation in them were talked about  and fought aboutday after day Yes Amy was written out of All My Children after six months because Rosemary Prinz who played the part had prior commitments and we were still hoping at the time that she would return to the show But after Amys departure we spent spent weeks dramatizing the return of an escaped prisoner of war and his reunion with his family The character Paul talked freely of the horrors of that war of the men still in POW camps and the families suffering by their absence After that the character of Philip was drafted much against his wishes and is now serving with a MEDIVAC unit in Vietnam from where he writes letters describing the suffering he Is seeing daily Was it to this that Ms Knopf was referring when she said All too often attempts made in the general direction of relevance have been halfhearted and not very effective Another of Ms Knopfs pontifical pronouncements declares The fact is that tokenism and television are synonymous truly significant steps have yet to be taken Blacks and other minority members are still grossly underrepresented on all the networks While I would certainly agree that there should be more use of minority groups on television is Ms Knopf unaware that One Life To Live has had a racially integrated cast and stories since its premiere almost four years ago While she was culling The New York Times files did she miss the article written in 1964 by that excellent black actress Ellen Holly one of the leads in our show on the subject of her part and the other black members of the One Life cast and the positive effects she felt these stories were having  with both blacks and whites  on a nationwide levle Did Ms Knopf also fail to read The New York Times of Sunday Aug 2 1970 when almost the entire television page was given to Beatrice Bergs article Real Life Comes To One Life to Live  in which she detailed our onlocation shooting of unwritten and unrehearsed group therapy sessions with eight reallife teenage exdrug addicts at New Yorks Odyssey House Rehabilitation Center The piece went on to explain that segments of these sessions were inserted into shows over the entire summer with the sole hope of getting across to the youth of America and their elders a message about drugs from other youths who had been there and knew what it was like Ms Bergs main point was that what these young people said about themselves and their own lives was very real and meaningful Yet Ms Knopf dismisses our efforts and Ms Bergs opinion with the deprecating The subject of drugs has recently been introduced but is being handled with excessive caution One wonders just what would one have to do to win Ms Knopfs approbation The American Broadcasting Company never expected to get extra rating points from the Odyssey House sequence yet it agreed to pay the very large overbudget amount required for the extensive onlocation shooting because it felt the need of the public service we were furnishing and that a serial could perform this service in a way that might be more effective than any other form of entertainment  or certainly any type of preachment For that conviction and its action upon it does ABC deserve Ms Knopfs conclusion that the the networks presenting these shows still live in another world in which they have yet to fully appreciate their responsibilities Ms Knopf also states that the tendency is for good women on the soaps to have their pregnancies terminated while the bad ones go out and get an abortion Accordingly sweet virtuous Meredith Lard on ABCs One Life To Live had her pregnancy terminated due to a blood condition while Erica Kane Martin on All My Children  a spoiled selfish manipulative woman who didnt want her child  had an abortion The same principle helps explain why the good women on soaps drink sherry while the baddies lean toward the hard stuff like Scotch or vodka My next question is what was Ms Knopf drinking while watching those programs Meredith Lord did not have a termination abortion miscarriage dilation and curet tage or anything else one wants to call it she had a full ninemonth pregnancy And while Erica Martin did have an abortion the term was used interchangeably with termination and a very strong point was made by the doctors on the show that abortions are legal easy to obtain and often advisable When Ms Knopf addresses herself to the matter of censorship of soap operas concluding the result is that terms like venereal disease and slept with are not used I begin to feel like a cross between Kafkas Joseph K and Alice at the Mad Hatters tea party For over eight months on One Life we have had discussions among three doctors a black Congressman a newspaper publisher his editor and writers and housewives and other cast members on the endemic proportions of venereal disease and all its ramifications with never a euphemism employed We then went on to have a young reporter on the program supposedly write an article for the local newspaper which was discussed at length and then about eight weeks ago this article was offered to the public free of charge by simply writing in for it The title embodies the very term Ms Knopf says is taboo Venereal Disease A Fact We Must Face And In writing that piece I did extensive research particularly with the Venereal Disease Branch of the Public Health Service for Disease Control in Atlanta Ga and within the context of the article we gave the bureaus address for anyone wishing to get further information as to how they might set up some type of educational program in their community To date over six thousand requests for the article have been received by ABC which again footed the bill for the printing and postage connected with this public service  and I have a letter from Dr J D Millar Chief of the Venereal Disease Branch commending us for a remarkable demonstration of the ability of daytime tele vision drama to come to grips realistically with pressing social problems According to William Schwartz educational consultant for the bureau letters from all over the country are now coming to his desk in a steady stream as a result of the One Life article At the end of her piece Ms Knopf says no doubt these criticisms leveled at the soaps will be greeted in some quarters with dismay But the issue is not my soap right or wrong or love it or leave it As soap addicts we like our soaps and take them seriously We merely want to see them improved Dismay falls far short of describing what this readerwriter feels To me the issue is that unquestionably Ms Knopf has an inalienable right to her own low opinions of our programs and an equal right to express them but to present those opinions as fact and to withhold  either out of ignorance or by design documented information on the credit side of the ledger is a shocking flagrant abuse of the reportorial standards maintained by a newspaper of The New York Timess stature AGNES NIXON Rosemont Pa Terry Ann Knopf replies Given Ms Nixons involvement in the more creative aspects of television I am especially dismayed by her remarks insofar as they reveal qualities all too commonly found among network officials  defensiveness and a lack of critical perspective Despite her vigorous defense of Amys peace activities on All My Children the shows attempt at social activism in this area was at best superficial One also wonders why  given Ms Nixons and ABCs presumed commitment to presenting the peace issue  another actress wasnt found to replace Rosemary Prinz Replacements for departing actors and actresses are a common I commend the use of an integrated cast on One Life to Live and yes I did read the piece by Ellen Holly But since Ms Nixon proudly cites her as one of the shows leads I think it interesting to note that Ms Holly according to one recent article is a mixture of African French English and Shinnecock Indian  lightskinned straightlooking and straightthinking the kind of person mentioned in my article as most palatable to white America The larger point I made concerning the stigma attached to abortion on the soaps still tends to hold true On As The World Turns Lisa is a scheming tormented unhappy woman As befits her character on May 11 a doctor on the show initially diagnosed her illness as a butchered abortion The very same day  in fact a halfhour later on Love Is a Many Splendored Thing a friend of Iris Garrison a fine upstanding woman who is in the midst of a complicated pregnancy wondered aloud if the pregnanis going to be terminated I could go on in this vein trading quips with Ms Nixons quibbles But to do so would I think detract from the more disturbing aspects of her letter For despite the impression given by Ms Nixon my piece was not specifically about her two shows but about the state of the soaps in general as regards social relevance Her failure to examine my piece in terms of the basic issues raised represents a lamentable narrowness of view as well as an abdication of her responsibilities as a prominent figure in the television industry Are you Ms Nixon satisfied by the manner in which blacks and other minority groups are portrayed on the soaps generally How do you feel about the way women are presented Arent you bothered by the lack of strong male figures and the extent to which men have been emasculated by so many soap omen And finally as a writer yourself how do you feel about the amount of censorship with which you must contend These are the kinds of issues 1 attempted to deal with in my piece
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/28/archives/mcgovern-and-the-nations-resilient-political-center.html,To the Editor In his May 18 column Centripetal Politics Tom Wicker analyzes the dilemma which faces Senator McGovern as he heads into the stretch for the Democratic nomination Will he continue as the radical candidatea course which has paid off so far Or will he move to the center in an effort to translate his strong minority position into a majority nomination Mr Wicker concludes his analysis with the question And what if it turns outas the Democratic campaign so far seems to suggestthat there may not be too much center left in this country One must hope that the suggestion implicit in Mr Wickers final question proves to be unjustified The genius of the American political system has been the factat least since the Civil Warthat it has always drawn the Government toward the center With all their garish faults our national party conventions have served with rare exceptions to dilute the positions of the extremists within each party and to bring about nominations which have been basically centrist The consequence has been that national elections in the United States have generally revolved more around personalities and proposals for implementation than about dogmatic principles An additional consequence has been that when there has been a change of the party in power whether in the Congress or the executive the transition has been acceptable to the great majority of the electorate including most of those who voted the other way There is a view of course which wishes the circumstances were otherwise There are those for example who would prefer a party system where all who represent one Vietnam position were in one party and all who represent an opposite position were in the other For Vietnam one could substitute abortion or busing or tax reform or any one of a number of other explosive emotional issues But the result of that kind of political system however emotionally satisfying must ultimately be one or the other of two tragedies Either the political parties would divide upon a single great issue thereby risking the kind of polarization and confrontation we see today in Northern Ireland Or else the two parties would break down into multiparties as in some European countries resulting at the legislative level in government by coalition and at the executive level under our constitutional system in throwing the election of the President into the House of Representatives So I hope that the suggestion implicit in Mr Wickers question is proved wrong In free societies true progress can be accomplished only by national consensus and by definition consensus can only be found at the center This does not imply a static society The center can move one way or the other and over the years in our country it clearly has moved Moreover extreme views can have an influence on where and how the center moves But in the last analysis the national consensus if there is to be one must be at the center The greatness of our political system with all its imperfections has been that its mechanics have tended to unite the country rather than to divide it Let us hope that our people still want it that way OREN ROOT New York May 19 1972
THE 1972 CAMPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/28/archives/jobs-and-other-issues-stir-conflict-in-coast-primary.html,LOS ANGELES May 27The contest between Hubert H Humphrey and George McGovern for California has begun to have the feel of a national debate The crucial issue seems to be jobs and especially the size and shape of the Federal jayroll in a state that absorbs twice as much as the military budget about 10billion as secondranking Texas and eats up more than 1billion of the space budget every yearabout 30 per cent of the total The June 6 primary to between men who have changed significantly on issues they say are important and whose personalities and records would tend in any case to overwhelm their position papers Yet the state is vast enough the Presidential nomination is near enough and the field is finally small enough to give the sense of fundamental choices Senator Humphrey who backed the Federal loan guarantee to Lockheed last year and supports the space shuttle identifies directly with families threatened by further aerospace contractions Senator McGovern an advocate of cuts in defense and space outlays argues that the Lockheed loan only shored up an incompetent management that is now building a Britith powered TriStar jetliner that must compete with another Californiamade jumbo jet the McDonnellDouglas DC10 Earthbound transit projects would produce more jobs and have greater value than the space shuttle he says There are echoes of larger themes in the job debate as in each of the issue areas capsuled below A Numphiey corm selor Eugene Wyman says When we talk about Lockheed and the space shuttle were really saying who was really concerned about the workingman in California The application of Pentagon savings to peacetimejobs says Mr McGovern would put people to work not on projects of war and death but on the kind of enterprise that can improve life for all our people Defense For months Mr McGoverns 56page outline of a strippeddown military budget was nod dingly dismissed as an admirably concrete proposal barely worth debating because its sponsor had so little chance of executing it Now Senator Humphrey Is trying to publicize Mr McGoverns 326billion defense cut as a central issuea threat he says not only to national sedulity but also to the economic survival of California Nearly 30 per cent of the Pentagons research and development gets spent here Mr Humphrey notes and about 500000 Californians work at defenserelated jobs Mr McGovern proposes reducing active military manpower from 25 million to an allvolunteer force of 17 million bringing home more than half the 300000 American troops now In Europe slicing the aircraft carrier fleet from 15 to six abandoning work on the B1 bomber and the antimissile system and converting Minuteman missiles to multiple warheads Mr Humphrey says the McGovern proposals are unrelated to the realities of Soviet power and capabilities In the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 he noted President Kennedy deployed seven carriers in the Atlantie alone Mr McGoverns manpower levels he protested would be 60000 men lower than American forces in the summer before Pearl Harbor Foreign Policy Mr Humphrey now advocates American withdrawal from the Asian mainland but conditions it upon the release of American prisoners Mr McGovern believes Hanoi would free the prisoners as soon as the American forces pulled out Each promises an end of the war within 90 days of his inauguration Mr Humphrey would require some civilian service from draft resisters Mr McGovern offers the exiles unconditional amnesty after the war Both men deplored President Nixons mining of Haiphong harbor but approved his trip to Moscow Mr McGovern taket a sterner line than Mr Humphrey against allied dictatorships saying he would cut off military aid to the governments of Greece and Pakistan Mr Humphrey always a strong champion of Israel reminds voters and backers here that Mr McGovern like the Nixon Administration has urged Israel to withdraw from much of the Arab territory she captured in 1967 and once Mentioned that an internationalized Jerusalem Might be one way to end the ArabIsraeli contention over the Holy City Mr McGovern takes credit for helping push a hesitant Administration to sell aircraft to Israel He says that Israels annexations in 1967 were caused and apparently justified by the strategic vulnerability Of her temporary boundaries from 1948 Race and Minorities Both candidates have settled into positions in support of busing as a tool in the desegregation of schools Mr Humphrey says that the civil rights issue inthis campaign is his commitment over a quartercentury Mr McGovern uses his more impressive endorsements particularly those from Julian Bond Mrs Martin Luther King Jr and Cesar Chavez  to suggest that he Is more serious about change Taxes Mr McGovern presented last January a plan for redistribution of income that the Humphrey camp Is now labeling confiscatory for the rich and unfairly burdensome for upper income suburbanites Universal grants of 1000 per person would replace welfare in the welfare scheme The poor would pay no taxes Middleincome families wouldrepay the handout and then some on a progressive tax scale Families with income over 12000 would pay somewhat higher taxes than they do now Mr McGovern says his campaign against tax preferences would raise 6billion from a minimum tax on individual incomes over 50000 17billion from higher corporate taxes and an end of investment credits and accelerated depreciation and 5billion from the expropriation of inheritances beyond 500000 per heir Mr Humphrey reacts defensively recalling his early interest in tax reform but conceding that he never got results The burden of taxes must be eased for the lower and middleincome families he says without specifics Social Issues Mr McGovern says that nobody should go to jail for use or possession of marijuana Mr Humphrey stresses that his opponent also once proposed that a more promising route than outright prohibition might be to regulate marijuana along the same lines as alcohol Mr Humphrey says We dont know what its effects are and Im not about to equate it with alcohol But he does not want jail sentences for marijuana smokers either Mr Humphrey has promised a Cabinetlevel office of youth affairs and a new homefront volunteer corps to be called Americans for Domestic Development Mr McGovern has apparently convinced the womens rights movement of his broad sympathy but has avoided one of the central demands abortion reform which he says is an assignment for state legislatures He has promised a Cabinet seat for the first opening of the Supreme Court to women Mr Humphrey says he opposes abortion on demand and commits himself only to a female seat on the National Security Council Someone shouted What about women at a Humphrey rally in Sacramento the other day Mr Humphrey responded Im for you dear we need lots of em Economics and Labor The McGovern and Humphrey economic platforms concentrate on the unemployment problem and propose massive public employment as necessary to soothe it Mr McGovern tends to discount the evils of inflation and proposes automatic pension increases and bonds of guaranteed purchasing power to help hedge against it Mr Humphrey offers the more fervent rhetoric about the human agony of joblessness but Mr McGovern has the more specific plan a 10billion Federal investment in housing mass transit and pollution control Both candidates endorsed price controls before President Nixon imposed them but both have been critical of the lack of controls on corporate profits and unearned incomes Both men have sympathized with the union leaders who walked off the Pay Board and continue to protest price increases But Mr Humphrey is more intimately associated with the labor movement Mr Humphrey chides Mr McGovern for helping to block repeal of the

East Germany Seeking to Isolate Churches and Diminish Their Role,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/30/archives/east-germany-seeking-to-isolate-churches-and-diminish-their-role.html,BERLIN May 29  Conrad is very religious the eighthgrade teacher at an East Berlin school recorded in the semiannual report This remark barred the boys entrance into an East German high school excluding him from the higher education he and his parents had sought The father a Roman Catholic lay church official who recounted the incident to a Western visitor said he believed it was part of a Communist drive to isolate practicing Christians The children of parents active in Catholic or Protestant churches have increasingly encountered similar difficulties in public school Under a new general ruling apparently exercised with few exceptions the Communists are seeking to keep young Christians away from universities and other places of higher learning The situation accentuated since Erich Honecker moved to the seat of power as Communist party chief a year ago does not represent a fullscale revival of the bitter antichurch feuds of the early days in East Germany It is equally far away from the concept of a humanistic community embracing Communists and Christians alike that marked the latter years of Walter Ulbrichts reign A Diminished Role Mr Honecker instead is seeking to diminish the role of the churches through neglect or in what church officials have called a dryingout process through isolation of believers from the rest of the population Junge Welt the Communist youth paper advised a 17yearold girl to drop her romance with a 21yearold Catholic student The ideological gap between a nonbeliever and a Catholic too the article said is too wide to allow for friendship much less love Catholic church membership has remained steady at just under 15 million a small but closely knit minority in a population of 17 million The church has sought to stay aloof from political involvementaside from occasional protests such as a recent appeal by bishops against a law liberalizing abortions Matters are more complicated for the Protestants Once a pillar of strength in the heartland of Martin Luther the Protestant church has suffered not just from the onslaught of organized Communism but from a general decline in religious interest and commitment Membership Drops Church membership dropped from 70 per cent of the total population 10 years ago to about 60 per cent now with many Protestants hardly more than nominal Christians Yet the church is fighting hard against isolation For more than a year the Government and the Protestants have been in a clinch as one East German pastor called it over a state decree stipulating that all activities outside traditional religious services require advance approval by local authorities Such activities include concerts and other events in churches or community houses that might attract nonbelieving young but the decree also covers Bible study courses held for young Christians to prepare them for confirmation Pastors and congregations have steadfastly refused to register these activities with the local police authorities and as a result have had to pay as a church official said thousands of marks in fines Recently the Communists have theateneci disruption of Illegal events but church officials said they would stand by their conviction The decree requiring registration shows the trend to divorce the church from the rest of the community and turn it into an institution for priests a state of affairs unacceptable according to the understanding of the Reformation Bishop Hans Joachim Frankel of Gorlitz declared at a recent East German synod He said the church had ur gently requested that the East German Government lift the registration decree and end the difficulties for young Christians in obtaining an educetion How can such obstructions be put up at a time when we are all under the obligation to serve peace in Europe and the world he asked Protestant church leaders ht contrast with the Roman Catholic hierarchy have repeatedly made political statements most recently by praising the policy of relaxing relations between East and West
Study Shows Catholics Having Smaller Families,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/30/archives/study-shows-catholics-having-smaller-families-catholics-having.html,WASHINGTON May 29The first completed report of the 1970 National Fertility Study shows that Roman Catholic couples have sharply reduced the number of children they are having and intend to have The change is so marked that despite a tradition of large Catholic families their birth expectations are rapidly approaching those of nonCatholics There was a downward shift in the birth expectations of all groups from 1965 to 1970 according to the report a copy of which was obtained today But a far faster decline was found among Catholic parents For example the decline reported by Catholic women 20 to 24 years old was more than twice that of nonCatholic women in the same category The findings were paralleled by those for unwanted births that had already occurred From 1965 to 1970 the rate of unwanted births among nonCatholics fell by about a third Among Catholics the rate fell almost by half American couples the report concludes have changed their reproductive behavior radically over the course of the past five years adjusting their fertility goals sharply downward and increasing substantially their ability to stop childbearing at the wanted level In fact the report suggested the onceutopian goal of stabilizing the size of the American population is at last within reach Married Women Studied The National Fertility Study is a federally financed undertaking conducted in 1965 and again in 1970 by two Princeton demographers Norman B Ryder and Charles F Westoff The report obtained today submitted to the Presidential Commission on Population Growth and the American Future is their first formal analysis of the 1970 study It used a national sampling of married women under 45 years old to measure the number of children women wanted and the number they had borne but did not want Such birth expectation measures are not accurate when applied to individual women But when applied to all women the findings are regarded by experts as reliable indicators The finding that Catholic birth expectations are falling faster than those of nonCatholics was true for all age groups It was most striking for women aged 20 to 24 In 1970 nonCatholic women of these ages reported they wanted an average of 9 per cent fewer children than in 1965 The figure fell from 257 to 235 children But young Catholic women reported they wanted 20 per cent fewer children The figure for them fell from 345 to 275 children This rapid closing of the gap between the birth expectations of the two groups led the authors of the report to speak of a convergence of wanted fertility for Catholics and nonCatholics Their view is based on measurements of both birth expectations and unwanted births that have already occurred The latter is a complex index based on womenyears of exposure to the risk of pregnancy For Catholic women this index showed a drop of 45 per cent from 1965 to 1970 For nonCatholics the index went down only 32 per cent Higher College Rate The change was even more pronounced among Catholic women who had been to college Their rate plummeted by 57 per cent Meanwhile the already low rate among their nonCatholic counterparts barely changed The implication of these findings is that despite church strictures against birth control Catholic women increasingly are using unapproved forms of contraception We are now developing data that confirm this Mr Westoff said in an interview The data he said show that Catholics are becoming more and more like other parents in their use of the pill and other contraceptive devices The figures for children wanted represents a much lower total fertility rate figure since the study dealt only with married women If single women were taken into account the 235 child average for young nonCatholics would drop to about 219 This seemingly technical distinction has great symbolic importance A total fertility rate of 211 per family is what some authorities have styled the magic number At this rate the population has reached the replacement levelwhen there are just enough new babies to replace their parents and children who die before maturity If this level were reached and then maintained for about 70 years the United States would have achieved the goal of the Zero Population Growth movement The national fertility rate has never fallen as low as 211 children per family But the birth rate reported last week for March 1972 translates into total fertility figure of about 2136 the lowest ever May Go Below 2 Given current trends I think theres a very good chance we will not only drop to the replacement level but even go below it Mr Westoff said And if we do I would hope people react with some satisfaction rather than the apprehension and even hysteria we have seen in some other countries Demographers caution that over a period of decades the fertility rate is likely to veer up and down But over the shorter term Mr Westoff expects the low fertility level to continue Aside from the admittedly temporary depressing effects of the economy theres a whole list of things that are less temporary he said Among these factors are improved contraceptive technology increasing use of sterilization and legal abortion higher age at marriage a growing number of persons who remain single concern over the impact of population on the environment and the large and growing number of working wives The National Fertility Study is based on a probability sample of 5600 married women under 45 It is conducted by professors Ryder and Westoff at Princetons Office of Population Research under contract with the National Institutes of Health
Priest Hired as City Aide Ordered Back to Boston,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/31/archives/priest-hired-as-city-aide-ordered-back-to-boston.html,A 30yearold Boston priest who started work at City Hall as an urban fellow in Septemher 1970 and who was named assistant city administrator May 5 has been told by his archdiocese he is working without authorization of the church and lie should return to Boston for reassignment The priest the Rev Mark Corrigan said yesterday that he would appear before the personnel board of the Boston Archdiocese on Friday to argue against that finding The ruddyfaced baldish and jovial member of the Lindsay administration added however that he felt the matter was an internal one so far as the church was concerned and a personal one for him and declined further comment The Boston archdiocese says that approval for Father Corrigan to continue in his new 21900ayear job will have to come from the New York Archdiocese since the work is in New York The spokesman said the New York Archidioccse approved the employment of priests in civilian positions only if these dealt with the spiritual needs of the people citing work in hospitals and with drug addicts as examples When questioned whether a program for the aged such as the one Father Corrigan was concerned with as assistant city administrator would apply she replied The church has its own programs for the aged New York View Given A spokesman for the New York archdiocese said We would not approve such work for one of our own priestsand therefore would not be in a position of granting approval to a priest from another diocese The spokesman added that the work was rejected on the ground that it did not come under the heading of priestly ministrations which are con cerned with spiritual needs of the people In June 1969 when his urban fellowship ended Father Corrigan asked the New York Archdiocese for permission to take a job as an assistant to Mayor Lindsays press secretary The chancery on Madison Avenue said it was not granted But Father Corrigan had said there had been no obiection Last month the New York Archdiocese notified Archbish op Humberto Sousa Medeiros of Boston that it was not approving Father Corrigans con tinued employment as a civilian aide in the Lindsay administration No reason was given for the long interval between the request submitted in June 1971 and the formal notification to the Boston Archdiocese The question of Father Corrigans employment came up early this month when he announced publicly his full support of the Mayors effort to retain New York States liberalized abortion law Charging church leaders with using harsh insensitive and inflammatory language on condemning abortions Father Corrigan said To hear the 350000 people in this state who have had abortions called murderers is an incredibly insensitive approach to something that is theologically questionable And restricting the rights of individuals in such an area he said is contrary to the spirit of the gospels and the foundations of our Govern ment Stand Made Clear The Boston priest made it clear that he would not advise anyone to have an abortion but under no circumstances would he condemn abortions as mur1 der The archdioceses reply to these statements was given yesterday by Msgr Hugh Curran of the Family Life Bureau of the chancery Unfortgnately he said Father Corrigans statement misses the main point of op position to abortion on demand The church has always recog nized the distinction between the sin and the sinner At the heart of this matter is any citizens obligation to speak out in public debate against the withdrawal of the protection of the law from innocent human life Father Corrigan said his dis pute with the church over abortion had not sparked the adverse reaction to his continuation as a mayoral aide He said Cardinal Cooke had refused approval for his work in New York in advance of his statements on abortion Cardinal Cooke doesnt want me here Father Corrigan said He doesnt feel my work with the city is a viable valid form of priestly ministry I happen to feel that it is In announcing Father Corrigans appointment to his present post Mayor Lindsay said the priest would direct the newly established Bureau of Special Programs and would serve as chief press officer for Deputy Mayor Edward A Morrison The Bureau of Special Programs includes the Mayors Office of the Aging the Office for Volunteers the Urban Corps and the New York City Urban Fellowship Program Deputy Mayor Morrison declared yesterday that Father Corrigan was a most qualified and highly competent administrator Father Corrigan came to New York City in September 1970 on an urban fellowship approved by the late Richard CarIdinal Cushing He was ordained in 1967 after attending Holy Cross College in Worcester Mass and completing his studies at St Johns Seminary College in Boston He served as a parish priest for two years In 1969 he was assigned by the Archdiocese of Boston to an experimental min istry and was appointed a teacher in the Boston public school system In 1970 Fathers Corrigan received a Master of Education degree in counseling psychology

Rockefeller Warmtoldea Of a Fusion Mayor Here,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/01/archives/rockefeller-warm-to-idea-of-a-fusion-mayor-here-in-interview.html,Governor Rockefeller said yesterday that Democratic and Republican leaders should con sider uniting behind a oneterm fusion candidate for Mayor of New York City next year In a wideranging interview at his office at 22 West 55th Street Mr Rockefeller was asked about a fusion candidate proposal advanced by Meade H Esposito the Brooklyn Dem ocratic leader to foil any third term bid by Mayor Lindsay The Governor replied Various people have talked about this and I think that one cant dismiss it out of hand think that has to be considered particularly after what has been going on in this last deba cle with the City Council the Board of Estimate the Mayor This was a reference to the continuing fight at City Hall over the proposed new city budget Other items discussed by the Governor during the interview included the following A terse denial that he was losing control of the state gov ernment and was a lame duck Governorcharges that were made when the Legislature re jected some of his major pro posals this year such as no fault automobile insurance and court reform An admission that the states options in circumventing the constitutional strictures against state aid to parochial schools were getting pretty restricted because of recent court decisions An announcement as the Presidents state chairman for reelection that he would soon set up the apparatus to cam paign for Mr Nixon and pledge that well really do job Confirmation that he de liberately had worked with the Democratic minorities of both houses during the legislative session because he did not wish to pay the price of upstate conservative Republican sup port for his tax package Concerned About City A sizable portion of the inter view dealt with the city Mr Rockefeller whose longsim mering feud with Mayor Lind say broke into the open last January when he criticized the Mayor in his State of the State message was asked if he would become involved in the citys mayoral race next year Its a little far away he said I am deeply concerned about the future of the city How this thing will shape up do not know In responding to questions about Mr Espositos recent call for a fusion mayoral candidate Mr Rockefeller had a few barbs of his own for the Mayor Referring to the tug of war at City Hall over the proposed new budget the Governor said You know its interesting this tremendous fight and all of a sudden its disappeared in the press and I saw the Mayor had gone off on a vacation But I didnt see what had happened Have they got a budget Asked if he would oppose a possible renomination of the Mayor Mr Rockefeller said Well if he was the fusion candidate then thered be no problem with it Then the Governor added I dont want to cross any bridges ahead but I cant at this par ticular moment imagine that hed be necessarily the first choice City Management Criticized Asked about a recent report by State Controller Arthur Levitt in which state auditors reported widespread under utilization of employe time in city government and in which they declared that the Mayors budget had many areas where expenditures could be cur tailed without the diminution of service the Governor said I didnt need the report to have a feel Id gotten reports from all of my departments re lating to the city This intelligence Mr Rocke feller went on closely cor roborates the findings of the state auditors The Governor despite re ports that the 1972 Legislature was lackluster and devoid of innovation insisted that posi tive steps had been taken at the Albany session within the confines of the states fiscal situation He offered as examples en actment of a proposed 115 billion environment bond issue subject to a referendum in November and bond authoriza tions for the Urban Develop ment Corporation and the Housing Finance Administra tion as well as the creation of a Transit Construction Fund in New York City with a 250 million bond capacity The Governor said that in securing a 15month tax pack age of 407million during special legislative session on state finances he had averted chaos in the regular session He said he had decided to deal with the Democratic mi norities in both houses on his fiscal plan and to ignore con servative upstate Republicans particularly from the Syracuse area because I just didnt want to be held up by the conditions which might have been imposed to get the vote I dont think we would have gotten it anyhow No Problem on Control In denying reports that he was losing control in his party and the Legislature and that in his 14th year as Governor he was a lame duck Mr Rocke feller said I found no problem this year on this He added that the defeat of one of his priority programs nofault automobile insurance had come about because of in tensb personal pressure on in dividual lawmakers It was impossible for me to counteract that personal pressure on those individuals he said The Governor on the heels of the Legislatures adjourn ment May 12 vetoed three bills that had generated intense emo tion One would have repealed the liberalized abortion law an other would have killed the lowincome housing project in Forest Hills Queens and the third would have banned busing for integration purposes The vetoes sparked talk that Mr Rockefeller was moving from a conservative to a liberal posture but the Governor dis missed such talk today This label business he said is no more than a con venience Abortion Fight Deplored On the repeal of the liberal ized abortion law which he unsuccessfully had tried to keep from going to the floors of both legislative houses for debate the Governor said of his veto This is a political year dont want to see good legisla tors knocked off over an issue which to me was totally irrele vant in view of the fact that I was going to veto it anyhow Asked if the busing morato rium bill was nothing more than politicking since there is no compulsory courtordered busing in the state he replied Thats right and also the bill had been declared unconstitu tional by the courts previously Alluding to the fact that two state laws that provided funds for parochial schools had been declared unconstitutional by Federal courts this year and to the latest attempt to funnel funds in the form of tax deduc tions for parochial school par ents the Governor said Well do the best to admin ister it unless sections of it are declared unconstitutional This latest state effort is al ready under court challenge the Governor said and the fields getting pretty restricted

Forest Hills Project: The Political Side.,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/04/archives/forest-hills-project-the-political-side-the-battle-of-forest-hills.html,The headquarters where State Senator Emanuel It Goldirimslis campaign for reelection is fourroom rabbit Warren on Main Streit in Hew Gardens Boxes of position papers and green and orange balloons fill the tables mid closets shopping bags crowd into walking space and colored maps of Queens Assembly and election districts eat up much of the wall space But from this cluster of parephernalia Me Gold is quick to fish out a single piece of orange paper It is a copy of newspaper article announcing Mayor Lindsays selection of Mario M Cuomo a lawyer to search for a compromise in the controversy over the lowincome tiousing project in Forest Hills While his foes brand Senator Gold a supporter of the housing the article credits him with having prompted the Mayor to abandon his previoua absolute opposition to any change in the proposed three 24story towers of public housing This does it Senator Gold said as he Waved the orange paper Hes a oneissue candidate and this kills his only iseue The he is Jerry Birbach an angry lijoreat Hills homeowner who wants to parlay his leadership in the fight against the housing project into a victory over Senator Gold in the Demoroatic primary on June 20 Whether all the community groups opposed to the project will help Mr Birbach in his new fight is not known For instance the Queen Jewish Community Council which claims a membership of 75000 of the estimated total lof 300000 Jews in Queens is bitterly against the project But its president Seymour Samuels said Were aligned with Mr Birbach as far as opposition to the project is concerned and thats where it ends Nonetheless if Mr Birbachs campaign has been left issueless as Senator Gold says it has then Mr Gokl might be spending more time at shik warm weather flobbies of boating and fishing in Long Island Sound Mr Gold Senator Golds recreation away Jrom his Manhattan law practice has been superseded by a struggle to placate a resentful eletnentin the new 13th Senatorial District where his potenial constituents are split into two distinct geographic and political areas The first group is dominated by Jewish residents of Kew Gardens Hills Forest Hills and Rego Park who voted for MrGOld on Election Days past They first sent him to the Legislature in early 1970 in a special election to fill the Assembly seat vacated by Moses H Weinstein when he became a State Supreme Court justice That fall he won a full term overwhelmingly But he served only until October 1971 when Queens Democratic leaders designated him for the seat vacated in the old 10th Senatorial District by Seymour R Thaler who like Justice Weinstein was headed toward the bench Mr Gold won in a special election by a 4to1 margin But he had little time to relish the landslide for soon after it the storm broke over the housing project Mr Birbach led residents in a highly vocal fight against the complex and Senator Gold was accused by some residents of having stayed on the sidelines To stop the erosion of his support Senator Gold has turned from a refusal to oppose the project and has begun insisting on a compromise At the same time Birbach headquarters working with computer printouts of names addresses and telephone numbers of registered Democrats has poured appeals for support into thousands of private houses and apartments around the project site at 62d Drive and 108th Street near the Long Island Expressway The thrust is aimed at a rough triangular section in Senator Golds old districts with the three sides bounded by Flushing MeadowsCorona Park on the west the Long Island Expressway on the north and Queens Boulevard on the southwest A successful Birbach attack here could be decisive for in the the second district area of the 13th District Senator Gold is largely unknown The second area is north of Forest Hills and Rego Park and it includes Corona Elmhurst and a corner of Jackson Heights These communities have large numbers of Irish and Italian residents who voted heavily for Mario Procaccino in the fiveman Democratic mayoral primary In this years Legislature the Assemblymen who represent the northern section voted for repeal of the states liberal abortion law and for the socalled busing moratorium bill that would have blocked the compulsory assignment of schoolchildren for the sake of racial balance The Governor vetoed both bills Senator Gold voted against both these measures However he has argued repeatedly that he is stanchly against forcing busing adding that the Senate in a voice vote rejected his amendment that the moratorium bill expressly bar forced busing which it did not To help introduce himself to the Irish and Italians voters Senator Gold has mailed positional papers jointly with State Senator Nicholas Ferraro who lost a piece of his district in reapportionment to the new

The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/04/archives/the-panic-as-you-approach-zero-population.html,WASHINGTON Zero population growth has long been an earnest if Utopian goal of many Americans concerned about the quantity of national resources and the quality of national But in the closing days of May came two strong signs that for the first time In history the nation may actually have reached the threshold of the ZPG Utopia And with that possibility came the realization that even this form of Eden may harbor its own kind of serpent The signs of change National birth statistics for the first quarter of 1972 showed that births had dropped sharply even from the already declining 1971 rate The drop is so great in fact that the total fertility ratea sophisticated demograVhic measurementis now virtually at the replacement level This is the milestone level which maintained over decades would bring a population of stable size The authoritative National Fertility Study indicated an even more lasting decline than the shortterm quarterly birth figures In just five years the study reported American women have markedly reduced their estimates of the number of children they intend to hive in the future The most pronounced decline was among Catholic women deSpite their traditiom of large families The findings so pressed the studys authors that they abandoned their otherwise technical prose to conchicleAmerican couples have changed their reproductive behavior radically stabilization of population size is within renal All this was gOod news indeed to the groviing and varied core of citizens concerned about population They range from professors to publicists and their contributions range from technical research to distributing buMper strips that read Trouble Parking Support Planned Parenthood They are the first to recognize that reaching the threshold to ZPGii not the same as no growth For the populatiOn to stabilize firmly very low fertility rates would have to persist for perhaps 70 years No authority believes that is even imaginable The demographic magic number the replacement levelis 211 That is the number of children Women must bear on the average to replace themselves their huabailds single people and young girls who die before they reach childbearing age Yes experts acknowledge the current rate may be under 214 the lowest in history But for perspeCtiVe they caution one need only examine the abrupt fluctuations in recent American rates 1937223 children 1947427 1957 177 196717257 At the same time no one Is ready to dismiss the present lowfertility trend as a fragile fad It is Just strong as the social iorcei that explain it and these appear entrenched the accelerating use of contraception abortion and sterilization more single people and later tnadiage swelling interest in womens liberation and More working Wives Anoreasing contern for overcrowding and pressine on the environment These forces irecnot likely soon to diminish And thus it becomes realistic to anticipiteIitleast several years in which the fertility rate grazesand even drops belowthe stabilitation level If that happens Americans may conclude fervor that 211 is no Magic number at ail and that the ZPG Utopia is flaWed That is exactly what has happened elsewhere Country after country has awakened with shock to the fact that its fertility rate has fallen below the replacement level Sometimes governments have reacted so sharply that they have destroyed not merely the serpent but the potential Eden as well Generally low fertility excites three principal fears One is economic stagnation Most authorities dismiss that fear out of hand If a family has fewer Mouths to feed it has more to spend for sailboats or second homes A stronger fear Is that as the number of people in eitoh age group starts to equalize the population would grow older Now half the population is under 28 In a stationary population the median age will be 38 It would not take long for impatient young people to recall such soniber dicta as the French writers view that a stationary population is population of old people ruminating over old ideas in old houses Thi third feat is Psychological and it is the strongest When in the DepressionEuropean countries dropped below the replacement level Cabinet Ministers and bartenders alike loudly bewailed the declines as signs of decadence and the end of grandeur Patriotism thauvinism  demanded In 1969 a Japanese Government study_noting that the fertility rate had dropped below the replacement level for nine out of 11 yearsurged a small increase in fertility Accordinge study by Princeton demographer Teitelbaum the mess media reacted passionatelyfor Seeing Imminent national decline and clamoring return to high fertility And the Government has since entertained a program of Mum cial allowances for children The most striking modern example comes from Rurriania In late196 after the fertility rate hadlallen below replacement  for five straight years the reaction come ike a thunder clap State Decree No770 drastiCally limited abortions restricted divorce banned importation of contraceptives and increased taxes on the single and child In exactly nine months the results were evident In September of 1967 there were three times the number of births as in the preceding December The immediate effect was severe Newspapers reported three pregnant women to one hospital bed The longrange effecton schooli jobs housing will come later If as appears likely theAmerican fertility rate should now hover around or below the replacement level such experiences offer a clear lessonthe name of the serpent Is panic JACK ROSENTHAL

Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/05/archives/church-state-and-public-policy.html,To the Editor The progression of thought in your very interesting May 26 editorial Church and State flows with irresistible logic up to a point But at that point I am afraid the logic breaks down and rhetoric takes its place You observe that religious leaders have a right and a duty to expoUnd their point of view and to attempt to persuade others of its rightness You acknowledge that it is not improper for churches to seek to convince legislators of the correctness of their views so that they will be embodied in legislation You reCognize further that every public official brings with him to office a set of values which might loosely be termed religious But then in a sudden leap of alarmism it is dangerous to a free society you cite the Impropriety of the use of the states power to impose religious laws and doctrine Granted the improprietyno one would deny ithow does the abuse to which you advert relate to the premises you have so carefully and correctly stated Quite simply it does not relate and the reference to imposition by the state of religious laws and doctrine is no more than a straw man No one including the leadership of the Roman Catholic Church is suggesting that governmental power be used to impose denominational beliefs and practices on the tIopulace To suggest otherwise merely obscures an already complex issue Many religious groups in our society exercise their right to speak to public issues and seek to influence legislation in line with what they conceive to be sound public policy In doing so however they are not attempting to enlist the authority of the state to enforce creedal positions They are seeking rather to make operative through the political process their convictions as to what will best realize the good of society Many other groups besides churches do the same Legislators judges public officials and ultimately the people make the final determination whether to accept or reject as public policy the positions they advance The danger in your argument is its implicit suggestion that whenever the social consensus as articulated in law coincides with a religiously based view of man and society we are thereby in a situation where the states power [is used] to impose religious laws and doctrine The absurdity of this becomes apparent when one considers that carried to its logical extreme it leads to the conclusion that because a religious group regards say reckless driving as immoral the state should do nothing to prevent or punish reckless driving otherwise it is using its power to impose religious doctrine This may be an extreme example but no more extreme than the position expressed in your editorial To be sure the state should not take orders from the churches but neither should it so wall itself off from them that religiously inspired views alone among the many expressions of ideology and opinion in our society are refused a hearing and denied embodiment in law and public policy even when they are judged by democratic consensus to be in the best interests of society Separation of church and state as much desired by the churches as by the state is not served by denying religiously based beliefs a role in the formation of public policy precisely because they are religiously based RUSSELL SHAW Director United States Catholic Conference Washington May 26 1972

Influenza Virus Is Found to Affect Fetus,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/06/archives/influenza-virus-is-found-to-affect-fetus.html,Two British researchers have reported evidence that influenza infections in pregnancy may not be as harmless as doctors have previously be lieved The researchers said in a medical journal that influenza infections in pregnant women can lead to a small increase in the risk of the babys sub sequent development of childhood cancers such as leukemia and Hodgkins disease The investigators emphasized that no cancers developed among more than 99 per cent of the children born to Mothers with influenza infections during pregnancy What they found was that the cancer cases occurred in 04 per cent of such children nine times the expected incidence Their report appears in the current issue of the British Medical Journal On the basis of the findings the journal editors said that there was no justification for abortions in mothers who experience influenza during pregnancy They also pointed out that available vaccines against influenza offer protection that is far from complete and that any reduction in the risk of subsequent leukemia would be very small Other Viruses Cited In the past doctori have known that rubella german measles infections during pregnancy can cause a wide variety of disorders to the fetuscataracts heart and bone defects mental retardation and deafness Researchers have also found that viruses such as vaccinia which is used to immunize against smallpox could damage fetuses However the influenza virus has not been suspect None of the viruses have been suspected of causing a cancer in offspring Now it seems that influenza in pregnancy may not be as harmless as has been thought the journal editors said Accordingly they said that doctors should now add influenza to rubella as an illness which should wherever possible be kept away from pregnant women The doctors specifically referred to infections with influenza virus such as Asian flu which causes an illness chap acterized by abrupt onset of fever chills headache muscle aches sniffles and sore throat Influenza which lasts a few days generally occurs in winter epidemics The researchers did not mean the flu a generic name often used to describe any infection that produces similar symptoms such as colds or intestinal upsets Scores of viruses other than influenza can cause such nonspecific symptoms LongTerm Study The basis for the editorial warning stems from a scientific report of what is believed to be the first longterm followup study of relationships between maternal infections and childhood cancers The study began in 1958 The reason the link was not discovered earlier the journal editors said is because previous studies had not covered such a long followup period12 years The report is by Jean Fedrick and Dr Eva D Alberman Miss Fedrick is a research epiderni ologist at Oxford University and Dr Alberman is at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine They studied the records of 17418 babies who were born during the week March 39 1958 A total of 16750 babies were alive four weeks later The researchers found that 12 cases of cancer developed among the 14791 children born to mothers who did not have influenza during their pregnancy whereas 8 cases affected the 1959 infants born to mothers who were known to have had influenza The researchers said there was a remote possibility that the results could have been caused by drugs that the mothers took during pregnancy Last year doctors at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston discovered that stilbestrol therapy during pregnancy could cause vaginal cancers in daughters when they became teenagers or older
Birth Control Study Says Many Rely on Unimproved Methods,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/06/archives/birth-control-study-says-many-rely-on-unimproved-methods.html,WASHINGTON June 5Despite the rapid spread of sophosticated methods a quarter of all women who want to limit the size of their families still rely on less effective means of contraception according to a major family planning study published today As a result the study showed many of these womenparticularly poorer womenhave significantly more children than they want creating additional burdens on their families and on social welfare programs Overall the study estimated that up to 13 million women need help in improving their contraceptive practices The study was issued by the Presidential Commission on Population Growth and the American Future It was conducted for the commission by Frederick S Jaffe research director of the Planned ParenthoodWorld Population the major national family planning organization A major theme of the report was the rapid change during the nineteensixties in family planning methods Formerly it was said families relied principally on methods distributed through drugstores without a physicians prescription Now however increasing numbers have turned to newer more effective methods such as oral contraceptives abortion and sterilization all of which require professional medical attention This shift has enabled many families to control fertility better An earlier study by Mr Jaffe reported that poor women had a million fewer babies in the nineteensixties than they would otherwise have borne But the new study reported serious flaws in the present doctororiented emphasis inchiding the following Many women out of ignorance still place too much confidence in the drugstore methods and do not seek doctors assistance in obtaining more effectivemethods Access to these methods is more difficult for poorer women who often do not have a family doctor Lowerincome women especially have been increasingly well served by new Federal and private programs and clinics The total number of patients increased from less than 200000 10 years ago to nearly 2 million now but still some 80 per cent of lowincome families are not served Even women who do have doctors are often embarrassed to raise the subject of contraception Many doctors meanwhile inhibited by fear of offending patients religious beliefs or sense of propriety are also reluctant to initiate the subject The result is an unfortunate impasse Remedying these defects the study said could have major benefits both for individual families and for society A major recommendation of the study is that actual Federal funding for family planning services be approximately doubled Present plans project an annual total cost of about 400million But appropriations now total only about 155million Mr Jaffe estimated that state local and private spending could account for only about 50million of the difference In his conclusions Mr Jaffe explicitly rejected any policy that is not based on the desires of individual parents A program to prevent parents from having wanted children would violate constitutional and human rights if confined to lowincome persons it would also be discriminatory he said But his analysis showed that increasingly all womenwhether rich or poor black or whitewant families of about the same size The difference is that women of higher income are better able to control their fertility
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/06/archives/abortion-birth-control-and-an-ignored-issue-ethics.html,To the Editor The lack of any discussion about the ethical implications of the Rockefeller Commissions recommendations concerning abortion sterilization and the disseminating of contraceptives to all individuals regardless of age is disturbing to those of us parents who know that our children have great potential for ideals sacrifice and belief in God If the ethical principles we have followed in the past are puritanical outmoded or out of touch with the timesthen let us say so But let us at least try to develop some consistent new ethical approaches and not pretend that individual morality no longer matters to the moral fiber of our nation In the past for example we instituted laws to prevent children from entering into a lifetime contract of marriage until they reached a certain agethe age of consent Those who engage in sexual acts with children below that age are guilty of statutory rape Yet the commission report never discusses the implications of its recommendations for statutory rape laws As the report is written with the omission of age restrictions teenagers can sign away their ability to reproduce before they can even legally contract marriage The Times pays little attention to the implications of the complex abortion issues as treated in the commission report It seems to approve of the commissions statement that abortion is not to be considered a primary means of fertility control But if there is nothing ethically wrong with abortion one may well ask why there is anything wrong with considering it a primary means of fertility controlprovided the woman feels so inclined and prefers it to contraceptive methods The commission also fails to distinguish between unwanted and unplanned births and unwanted children Clearly our society has long allowed the woman to discontinue a responsibility for the developing human organism when that organism has reached a stage of development at which this responsibility can be transferred to another Adoptive agencies all over the United States have long waiting lists of prospective parents eager for a child But there are no babies to adopt Every baby in the United States being aborted because of a belief that the infant is unwanted is being denied life on the basis of an untruth Unfortunately proponents of abortion including the Rockefeller Foundation fail completely to consider adoption as possible and more ethical option to abortion One of the arguments for abortion is the concept that a womans body is private property to be used as she wishes without interference from society Believers in the private property concept could equally well feel that there should not be laws prohibiting prostitution But should we assume therefore that prostitution an acceptable even an ethical activity Our increasing ability to create prolong and terminate life demands the creation of an ethical framework for our decisions Many distinguished doctors scientists lawyers ethicists and moralists at Johns Hopkins Harvard Georgetown the University of California and other universities and institutions are beginning to engage in such studies More than 100 of them including six Nobel Prize winners have signed their names to a position paper known as the Timber lawn Statement which calls for systematic investigation into the relationships between medicine and ethics Should we not reach a better understanding of these ethical issues before accepting such recommendations for contraception sterilization and abortion as advocated by the Rockefeller Commission It is not good enough to have the commissions report avoid the ethical implications of its recommendations And it is not good enough to have prestigious newspapers like The Times support the recommendations of the Rockefeller Report while sweeping its unresolved issues under the rug EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER Washington May 30 1972

M‘GOVERN WEIGHS COMPROMISE STEP,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/09/archives/mgovern-weighs-compromise-step-says-hes-willing-to-modify-economic.html,LOS ANGELES June 8 Senator George McGovern whose reform pledges have helped to carry him to a commanding lead in the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination appears ready to alter some specifics of his economic proposals in a bid to unite the Democratic party behind his candidacy In a long breakfast interview here yesterday a few hours after Mr McGovern finished first in primaries in California and three other states he expressed a willingness to make some minor adjustments in his programs without altering their basic thrust Ive always thought that was a pragmatist that would not compromise on essential principles but that I know how to build a political coalition that will win the Senator from South Dakota told a group of New York Times correspondents Im not out to prove that my convictions are so fanatical that Im so rigid on everything that I do that I cannot function within a political system he said [Senator Edmund S Muskie all but ignored since he withdrew from the Presidential competition six weeks ago talked Thursday with Senator McGovern and Senator Hubert HHumphrey in separate meetings in Washington Page 18] Mr McGovern said that it may have been a mistake to specify 1000 as the amount that his welfare reform plan Could provide to every American He described a tax reform bill submitted in Congress last week by two leading Democrats as superior to his own tax reform suggestions He acknowledged that he deliberately tried to play down the school busing issue in the Michigan primary campaign last month because there was no chance for an educational campaign to win support for his tolerant attitude toward busing As he ate eggs Benedict and drank coffee in the Hollywood Room of the Wilshire Hyatt House Hotel Mr McGovern created the impression of a candidate whose flexibility on the details of his platform was increasing as the possibility of winning the chance to implement the reforms became more plausible Mr McGovern said that his willingness in the primaries to describe a whole range of alternative programs rather than simply to attack President Nixon was both a strength and a weakness of his candidacy Priorities for Youth Young voters who formed the main work force of his campaign want a candidate who really knows where hed like to see the country go Mr McGovern said They dont worry about all these little details about how much every aspect of the program is going to cost he continued They know those things are estimates What theyre interested in are the general priorities youre setting for the country At the same time the Senator said a candidate who takes I positive positions runs the risk of coming under attack He contended that his leading Democratic rival Senator Hubert H Humphrey of Minnesota had distorted my record in the California campaign He said he expected similar tactics to be employed by the Republicans if he becomes the Democratic nominee Mr McGovern said that he thought it would be possible to win in November without actively courting the regular Democratic leaders and labor union officials against whose candidates he has been running But he indicated that he would devote much of the month remaining until the Democratic National Convention meeting with leaders of the party establishment because their cooperation would make it easier to win the Presidency He sought to minimize however the risk that his image as a reformer outside the Democratic mainstream would be altered by his attempts to make peace with party regulars I think now the anxiety on the part of my supporters centers on whether we can really put together a broad enough base to win in November Mr McGovern asserted They want to defeat Nixon The Senator contended that even the most committed idealists working on his behalf were asking Is it all going to be lost or are we really going to be able to make this move right through to the White House Thus he added the idealists would understand and would welcome any success I have in reaching a better relationship with the party regulars Mr McGovern emphasized a number of times that he was not going to compromise on things I have deep convictions about But he said that he had told a group of Democratic Governors in Houston on Monday that he might make some minor adjustments on how we phrase it when he argues for his income redistribution plan in the future The South Dakotan proposed in January that the Government give a cash grant each year to every man woman and child in the country as a replacement for the present welfare mess The money would be taxable so that the Government would get some of it back from wealthier recipients while providing a basic income for the impoverished Mr McGovern carefully stated during the campaign that one suggestion was to give each person 1000 But his repeated use of that figure and his defense of it when Senator Humphrey charged in California that the plan was unrealistic and likely to cost at least 51billion left many persons with the impression that Mr McGovern was committed to that amount Better Definition Sought I dont think its misleading the Senator said in response to a question I think we used it for illustrative purposes We had to have some figure that would illustrate the impact of the program It may have been a mistake to even use an illustration We might have just said that were for an adequate income maintenance program and were going to provide supplements to the income of working people up to a certain level and also to those who have no other income Asked whether he might eventually offer more specific details of the proposal Mr McGovern replied that he was not sure how specific it will be but maybe we can define the objectives more succinctly in terms that are more easily grasped Similarly after months of declaring that he would close 28billion worth of Federal tax loopholes to provide funds for domestic programs while making the tax system more equitable Mr McGovern said that he now believed there was an even better way to deal with the problem of loopholes He referred to the proposal by Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana and RepresentatiVe Wilbur D Mills of Arkansas to repeal gradually 54 special provisions of the tax bill beginning in 1974 and then force Congress to reconsider the justification for each special provision Such a plan if it gave the President the option of a veto over each tax concession reinstated by the Congress would incorporate all the things we proposed and go considerably beyond that Senator McGovern said Mr McGovern told his interviewers that he would try to deflame the issue of school busing which he said President Nixon had inflamed with a very cynically maneuvered political ploy urging a Congressional moratorium of court orders requiring extensive busing to desegregate schools The Senator did not express comparable willingness to tackle the issue of abortion which he has consistently said was a state matter He said that as President he would reverse Mr Nixons order to military hospitals to abandon liberalized abortion rules but would otherwise do nothing to implement his personal view that it should be up to the family and the doctor whether an abortion is warranted But Im not going around preaching that as a major part of the McGovern campaign because I think its irrelevant Mr McGovern added I mean its sort of like asking me my theory of the virgin birth of Christ

McGovern's Route to the Top,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/11/archives/mcgoverns-route-to-the-top-how-mcgovern-rose-to-the-top-in-primary.html,WASHINGTON June 10I honestly dont think there has been a major surprise in the last two years said Gary Hart the 14yearold manager of Senator George McGoverns Presidential campaign speaking calmly of a revolution in Democratic party politics that caught almost everyone else unawares He suffered one dark moment last January Mr Hart confessed Watching the virtual parade of Democratic leaders to endorse Senator Edmund S Muskie he had looked ahead to the first primary and pictured himself and Joe Grandmaison his New Hampshire coordinator standing alone on a street corner passing out leaflets as the candidate drove his own car around to the states college campuses But depression passed quickly and only three days after Mr McGoverns remarkably strong secondplace showing in the March 7 New Hampshire primary Mr Hart finished a reconnaissance of Florida and declared unemotionally Its all over Ed Muskie has got to get off the ground here and he isnt doing it John Lindsay has got to get off the ground and he isnt doing it either That means the race through the rest of the primaries is going to be us against Hubert Humphrey and that means were going to win George McGoverns candidacy was still being widely discounted three months ago when the feeling of anticlimax settled on Mr Hart Even now the blossoming of George McGoverna baldish former minister and rural radical who campaigned for a full year without exceeding 5 per cent in the Democratic preference polls and is now on the verge of winning the nominationis generally considered mysteriHow did he do it Some of the critical elements in the emergence of this onetime 500to1 long shot were beyond his control including the acceleration of the war in Vietnam at the culmination of his allimportant drive in Wisconsin the heavy damage that Gov George C Wallace of Alabama inflicted on the Democratic establishment and Senator Hunphreys inroads against Senator Muskie But George McGovern who suspects that but for his own hesitation in 1967 he might be Presidents today had decided at all events to be prepared for opportunity this year And he was The most obvious of the ironies about Mr McGoverns unheralded triumph is that the candidate and his staff predicted almost all of itearly often and in detail It is also striking that the same professionals who laughingly dismissed his chances last winter say now that it has been a triumph of basic political skillsthe political equivalent of the late Vince Lombardis backtofundamentals football Went After Delegates McGovern understood something that Muskie and Humphrey didnt that the way you win conventions is to win delegates says Joseph Napolitan the political consultant and author He went after delegates in the nonprimary states In addition to grassroots organization he had the best commercials on televisionand more of them He mastered the mechanics The premises that Gary Hart outlined to disbelieving newsmen last summer where Senator Muskie waswidely thought to be unbeatablefor the Democratic nomination proved sound and relevant Jack English can talk to county chairmen till hell freezes over Mr Hart said of Mr Muskies chief delegate scout But Big Ed isnt going to excite those housewives and those students who spend nights and days organizing their neighborhoods Thats what wins primaries The main lines of the McGovern strategy were agreed upon at a meeting at the Senators Maryland farm on July 25 1970 and they were never significantly changed Announced Early Unlike Senator Humphrey who planned originally to enter the race late after his opponents had destroyed each other in the early primaries Mr McGovern knew he had to start early and announced formally on Jan 18 1971 A single winner would emerge from the primaries he thought and the real meaning of party reform in which he had played a large part was that the man with the best primary score could not be denied the nomination Primaries would be won by grassroots organization he and his staff decided not by familiarity and the endorsements of local officeholders and party officials as Senator Muskies managers seemed to expect nor by television as Mayor Lindsay planned Ours would have to be the best organization in the field Mr Hart said and its power should be decentralized  outside Washington and outside the capitals of each of the key primary states The vital primaries they decided two years ahead of time would be in New Hampshire Wisconsin Massachusetts Nebraska Oregon California and New York  Ohio would be added later and Oregon sub tractedbut not Florida where Mayor Lindsay gambled almost all to win only 7 per cent of the vote Unlike Senator Fred R Harris of Oklahoma who announced a populist candidacy but relied heavily on Wall Street backing Senator McGovern saw that a peoples campaign would have to find popular financing More than twothirds of his first 1million was solicited through the mail the average mail contribution was under 20 And unlike Senator Harold E Hughes of Iowa who called off an undeclared candidacy in July 1971 the McGovern campaign sensed that obscure Senators from small states had to move early and be prepared for months of adversity There would be no way to judge progress Mr McGovern believed and similarly no reason to give up until the public had had chance to express itself in the primaries More important than anything else friends and rivals all now agree he embraced two general feelings both larger than what is commonly meant by issuesa revulsion against the war in Vietnam and a vaguer longing for what he called fundamental change They were to attract volunteers and later voters beyond his most hopeful plans Shunned One Issue An opponent of the war as early as September 1963 he wearied of his reputation as a oneissue candidate and doubted publicly at times that the war would be an issue in 1972 Last August he announced that he would not talk of the war any more and asked newsmen to give attention to his economic ideas But the electric response of audiences around the country kept confirming the special passion about Vietnam and by September he was off again on a publicized trip to Saigon Senator Harris calls Mr McGoverns the best diganization of individual workers in the history of Presidential politics We have never seen a general election campaign like this one will bethat even tip proached a smidgin of this organizational work he said But the ability to implement the method flows from the substance Mr Harris said yesterday meaning Senator McGov erns unassailable position against the war Mr McGoverns specific ideas under the heading of change have tended to embarrass him His proposal for a 32billion defense cut by 1975 largely ignored when he issued it in January evidently cost him votes when Senator Humphrey hammered at its impact on jobs and security in the California primary He is now discounting if not actually changing his ambitious assault on tax loopholes his staff is also redrafting the 1000perperson welfare substitute that was the heart of his plan for the redistribution of income At the same time his association with a change translated in midMarch into an assertion that he was as fed up as anyone in America with the drift of affairs helped him touch many varieties of unhappiness including the anger of George Wallaces supporters Just as conveniently the strength of his identification with change and against the war covered a multitude of omissions and inconsistencies on concrete issues including most notably the matter of school busing for racial integration Early in the primary season he dismissed busing as number 92 on his list of issues at other times he endorsed busing But during the Michigan primary in May he hoped publicly that the courts would reconsider and reject the crossbusing of children between core cities and their suburbs He has also sought to dampen earlier impressions that he supported the legalization of marijuana and liberalized abortion laws but he does not seem to have suffered yet from charges of opportunism or inconsistency Muskies problem was that he was clearly seen as a guy with vague positions says bemused professional McGovern has been vaguely seen as a guy with clear positions Insiders were fooled about Mr McGoverns progress as well as outsiders Richard Leone a Princeton political scien tist signed on in 1969 as Mr McGoverns national political directorand helped target New Hampshire and Wisconsin as the key primaries But he quit in January 1970 and two years later joined Senator Muskie as he said the only one who could put it together Everybody said Ed Muskie was the obvious acceptable candidate someone a divided country could live with Mr Leone observed this weekend Basically what we found was that people didnt want somebody acceptable they wanted an alternative McGovern and Wallace were the only ones George McGovern became the candidate of circumstance noticed first he was a more but suddenly two things were substantial candidatea better campaigner thinker speaker organizer than people had thought he was and second when opportunity knocked he had the structure all ready A critical element in Mr McGoverns planning Mr Leone suspects was his memory of rejecting the invitation later grasped by Eugene J McCarthy to run against President Johnson in 1968 The one thing he was not going to do in 1972 was to wake up some day and say If only I had stayed with it might have been the nominee Mr Leone commented The genius of the McGovern campaign was understanding the you never know factor in Presidential politics It was not that they knew the scenario was going to work just the opposite they knew it was a long shot but they were going to be prepared Ohio was an extreme example of McGovern preparedness and of the daring and dedication it required The basic planning the recruitment of Robert McAlister a young political lawyer as state chairman and the mapping of county officers was done on Memorial Day weekend in the spring of 1971 It was if anything even more presumptuous for the national campaign staff to order an exhausting statewide signature drive to nominate delegate slates in January 1972 Mere survival of the campaign to the Ohio primitry in May seemed unlikely at that point and if perchance the campaign continued Ohio was almost certainly too big and expensive a state too much under the control of organized labor to risk a serious McGovern effort Reversed Decision Mr McAlister filed delegate slates in 22 of Ohios 23 Congressional districts anyway From October on a young organizer named Gayle Channing had been working 18 hours a day perfecting a reserve organization On the weekend after the Senators April 4 victory in the Wisconsin primary Washington headquarters decided that there would be virtually no Ohio campaign but on the following Tuesday April 11 with only three weeks to go Mr McAlister won a reversala commitment of 200000 and at least six days of the candidates time Virtually overnight the reserves were mobilized and 53 offices around the state were humming Mr McGoverns neartie in Ohio was a body blow to Hubert Humphreys claim of industrial support the beginning of the end of the campaign In Ohio and elsewhere Mr Humphrey complained that George McGovern had a years head start on him but he got little sympathy Hell said Mr Napolitan who had managed the Humphrey media in 1968 Hubert knew when the election was Mr McGoverns immovable standing around 5 per cent in the Democratic preference polls through 1971and he actually dipped to 3 per cent in one national poll during January 1972 would have crippled most candidates financially But the Senator had organized directmail appealscommon among conservatives but almost unprecedented on this scale among liberal Democrats That was producing 25000 a week even in the darkest days of last December The money situation was chronically desperate as in almost all campaigns but it was never threatening In addition to the steady mail flow now averaging 40000 a day handful of rich men had sworn that the campaign would not sink for lack of funds Max Palevsky who sold his electronics concern to the Xerox Corporation for close to 1billion gave more than 100000 to the McGovern campaign Henry Kimehnan a merchant and developer in the Virgin Islands gave substantially raised more and lent the campaign another 200000 at the start of the Wisconsin effort in midMarch The other key to financial survival was economy of operations Henry Kimelman likes to note that Robert F Kennedy spent over 8million in a campaign that lasted two and onehalf months in 1968 the same year that Eugene McCarthy spent 11million The twoyear McGovern campaign still operating out of a tiny hive of offices on Capitol Hill4000 square feet at 1200 a monthwill have cost less than 6million through the Miami Beach convention The more striking economy in contrast with those of this years Democratic rivals was the low cost for each delegate wonsomething under 4000 The sweep of Californias 271 delegates this week cost around 7000 for each convention vote but in the nonprimary states grassroots activity was getting delegates at less than 50 apiece Victory says Frank Mankiewicz the chief strategist will not necessarily prove that he and others knew what they were doing but that we knew the only way it could be done Our scenario worked because other things broke right mainly the weakness of other candidates Muskies lack of organization the fact that Humphrey and Muskie were competing for the same constituency and a lean one at that the fact that John Lindsay turned out to be a 1968 charisma candidate But had Mr Mankiewicz believed from the startwhich was for him the spring of 1971 that the McGovern effort would win Oh yeah he purred

high above the frozen stubble land of northern Kansas Snug in his orange shag compartment Hugh Hefner confidently surveyed his holdings and plumped down 280 for Marvin Gardens His secretary Bobbie Arnstein rolled next won second prize in a beauty contest and collected 10 Then it was my turn and with monopolies coalescing all around me I needed to deal Hefner and his girl friend Barbi Benton sitting side by side on the facing banquette had most of the attractive properties but I was wary of dealing with either of them Early in the game Barbi had lured me into a bad bargain giving her the pale blue Oriental Vermont Connecticut monopoly on which she was already building a Levittown of little green houses Then Hefner had persuaded me to take his Water Works which along with my Electric Company would give me 10 times the roll of the dice if anybody ever landed on one which they never did in exchange for my Short Line Railroad which along with the three other railroads he soon assembled gave him 200 every time somebody landed on one which they always did But now Hefner had Tennessee Avenue which I needed to go with my New York and St James For five minutes we haggled over our chicken bones until finally he induced me to part with Virginia Avenue and 700 Only as the Big Black Bunny made its final approach to Chicagos OHare Field did I realize that Id made my third mistake Hefners properties now sported not green row houses but phalanxes of big red hotels which marched the board like the coastline of Miami Beach And I was rounding Go heading right for them As the plane came to a halt in front of its hangar the issue was still in doubtthere were those who felt that Hefners resources were overextended and his cash supply dangerously lowbut from the sunshine yellow of Ventnor Avenue to the deep purple of St Charles Place the Hefner Empire looked well entrenched And so it is with Hefners terrestrial empire In recent years Playboy has erupted from a thriving but narrowly based magazineclub operation into a manifold leisure time industry which sprawls voluptuously across the game board of American life Hefner and his colleagues have made some bad movestwo illconceived television shows two abortive magazines Playboy Tours that led nowhereand some of their other ventures look shaky But with combination of cool calculation and brash audacity they

While extensive and diverse the Playboy Empire should not be compared with conglomerates like Italys IFI or Japans Mitsubishi which dump a potpourri of industries into one cauldron Playboy officials emphasize that their realm is a congeneric an organic grouping of parts which complement each other as in Monopoly where the key to success is the grouping of colorcoordinated properties Robert Preuss a softspoken but toughminded accountant who was Hefners college roommate and is now Playboys executive vice president and secondincommand says Dont confuse us with the guys who go out and buy sewingmachine company one week and a sparkplug firm the next Everything we do comes out of the Playboy idea the Playboy outlook There is even something called the Playboy Environment an idea that has been floating around the companys Chicago headquarters for years now A few years ago one executive envisioned it thus A man gets up in his Playboy trailer brushes his teeth with Playboy toothpaste puts on his Playboy suit  When I threw that at Bob Preuss he grimaced Yes weve been talking about a Playboy Environment but its not trailers and toothpaste Let me give you an idea what it might be though A man gets up in his Playboy townhouse at Lake Geneva calls a Playboy limousine to take him to the airport where he gets into a Playboy char tered plane flies to New York takes a Playboy limousine to a Playboy hotel in midtown Manhattan changes into his Playboy suit takes a Playboy ferry to a Playboy convention center on Randalls Island for his business meeting that night goes to a Playboy restaurant and then to Playboy theater where he sees Playboy movie Thats the Playboy Environment And while we dont have all those things yet we have many of them and were exploring the rest AS I listened Preusss vision seemed curiously chilling a world in which I knew I could never feel at home After our interview I went back to my room at the adjacent Playboy Towers hotel walking through the Playboy Walk a shoplined promenade that connects the 37story Playboy Building to the 300room hotel I showered and shaved then because it was a typical Chicago winter night with the wind howling in from Lake Michigan decided not to go out to dinner Instead I wandered downstairs for a drink at the Towers Bar a circular affair of burnished copper set in the middle of a dark lounge filled with brown Naugahyde couches and easy chairs After a couple of drinks went back through the Playboy Walk stopping at the 24houraday newsstand to pick up an evening paper and then using my temporary Playboy key went into the Playboy Club which nestles behind an 80foot expanse of bronze glass between the Playboy Building and the hotel I had dinner in the clubs VIP Room wandered upstairs to catch the show at the Penthouse had a nightcap in the Playmate Bar then went back through the Playboy Walk stopping this time at the Playboy Drugstore to pick up some toothpaste Crest not Playboy The next morning I had breakfast at the sidewalk cafe in the Walk then killed 10 minutes examining the Playboy products resting behind glass display cases earrings keychains tieclips cigarette lighters cocktail shakers billfolds golf balls putters parkas and pillows Then I took the elevator in the Playboy Building up to my first interview of the day scarcely aware that I had not been outside in 24 hours Later I came across a release which described the Playboy Centerthe term used to describe the Building hotel Club and Walkas a total leisuretime environment Whatever his press releases or his subordinates may say Hugh Hefner doesnt like the term What kind of a dream is that My dream isnt to create a Playboy Environment or even a whole series of Playboy Environments in which everybody would spend all their time because if I were another person out there I would find that terribly dull Hugh Hefner is brighter more sensitive and human than he is generally given credit for being He also has a keen sense of just how much the public will take You dont lay Playboy emblems on the guys shirts shorts wife dog and children the butter doesnt come shaped like a Playboy rabbit he once said And he is quick to sense the oppressive overtones of a term like the Playboy Environment He told me We dont want people to live inside our world all the time For one thing its much harder to create the true Playboy LifeStyle inside the necessarily artificial and commercial environment of a Playboy hotel resort or club than it is in your own apart Well if we call it the Playboy LifeStyle rather than the Playboy Environment Sure Id say that were trying to offer Americans an alternative lifestyle and some of the facilities and accouterments which will enable them to live it A LifeStyle Empire An industrial giant which conceives communicates and popularizes a way of life through its magazines books records and films and then provides many of the things needed to live that life Or an entertainment cartel which goes beyond simply selling fantasies as an escape from life but tries to sell those very fantasies as a way of life An intriguing idea Can it work THERE is at least one precedent the Walt Disney empire which began by presenting a fantasy world in films comic books records and television then licensed a whole line of Disney products Mickey Mouse watches and hubcaps Pluto snowshovels Peter Pan tea sets and Three Little Pigs toothbrush holders and finally built controlled environments in which young and old could temporarily live out those fantasies first Californias Disneyland then Walt Disney World which opened last year in Orlando Fla adding hotels restaurants and other facilities to create an environment around the project which would be in keeping with its character and purpose Disney explained before his death As Aubrey Menen the AngloIndian novelist remarked after visiting Disneyland The strongest desire an artist knows is to create a world of his own where everything is just as he imagines it Hefner and other Playboy officials recognize the Disney parallel For years they have referred to the Playboy Clubsand now the resort hotelsas Disneyland for adults The two men never met and their public stands were very different Disney was a Goldwater Republican Hefner a liberal Democrat But Hefner deeply admired Disney and his workshe paid a special visit to Disney World this springand he sees certain similarities in their careers starting with their common passion for cartooning Throughout his youth Hefner drew an autobiographical cartoon strip to this day he remains cartoon editor of Playboy and selects every cartoon in the magazine But the DisneyHefner parallel goes far deeper Both men were quintessential Midwesterners born in Chicago of farming heritage Disneys parents came from Kansas Hefners from Nebraska Playing out their boyhood fantasies in their productions both men somehow reflected the fantasies of millions of other Americans Of Tom Sawyers Island at Disneyland Disney once said I put in all the things I wanted to do as a kidand couldnt Hefner says The magazine is a projection of my own adolescent dreams and aspirations Both retained a childlike sense of wonder and make believe Disney waxed rhapsodic about the precious ageless absolutely primitive remnant of something in every worldracked human being which makes us play with childrens toys and laugh without selfconsciousness at silly things and sing in bathtubs Hefner urges his editors never to lose the magazines gee whiz quality Both were fascinated by toys Disney lavished hours on the miniature railroad in his back yard Hefner has a game room filled with pinball machines in each of his houses Both extravagantly admired and utilized the wonders of modern technology If Disney had any genius at all it was for the exploitation of technological innovation writes Richard Schickel in The Disney Version Hefner lives amid a profusion of electronic gadgetry and his magazine reflects this preoccupation Both were compulsive workers and meticulous perfectionists Disney fussed over every story point gag or animation in his films and over every detail in his construction projects for years Hefaer drove his editors crazy by personally supervising every phase of the magazine and he now inspects carpets lighting and drapes in his hotels and resorts Both project a cheerful comforting bland feeling about the world and their own place in it Disney once said I dont have any depressed moods and I dont want to have any Im happy just very very happy And Hefner I quite literally would not trade places with anybody on earth In The Decline of the WASP Peter Shrag draws another parallel He sees Hefner and Disney as the two great puritan entrepreneurs of culture in the 20th century the two extreme expressions of white AngloSaxon Protestant cultural values He has a point For while Hefner displays none of the antiSemitism which Schickel detects in Disney and although there are many Jews high in the Playboy organization the tone and feel of Hefners world is intensely WASP During our airborne Monopoly game Barbi Benton nee Barbara Klein sniffed something from the galley It smells like matzohball soup she cried Oh boy I havent smelled that in years Have you ever had matzohball soup Then she caught herself Oh but I know it cant be Its just Hefs fried Schrags real point is that Disney and Hefner exemplify the puritanical compulsion to order the world to control to clean up It is a keen insight For if Schickel is right when he talks of Disneys lifelong rage to order control and keep clean any environment he inhabited so is Schrag when he calls Hefner a compulsive sanitizer WHICH brings us to Sex For Disneys animals and Hefners women are intriguingly similar At first glance Mickey Mouse may have seemed a curious choice for a starring role in Disneys bright upbeat world After all mice are rodents dirty smelly denizens of the earths dark places But as Schickel notes in the mouse as he was conceived by Disney all conflict that the animals real nature might have caused was resolved by an act of creative will reality was simply ignored Mickey was a clean Playboys women are clean women Just as Disney sani tized his rodents so Hefner has sanitized his Playmates No warts wrinkles or other blemishesand no internal wrinkles quirks or complexitiesmar their ivory perfection Just as Disneys animals particularly his ubiquitous chipmunks squirrels and rabbits are always bouncy cuddly cute and innocent so are Hefners bunnies And if Disney makes his animals behave not the way animals really behave in nature but the way they would if they were human so Hefner makes his women look and behave not like real women but the way adolescent men in their fantasies want women to be A recent article in The Wall Street Journal said Playboy was in full flight from its origin as a girlie magazine This misses the point which is that Playboy was never really one of the girlies those garish pulps named Wink Snicker or Leer which distort women in another direction by decking them out in garter belts and suggestive looksFrom the start Playboy has shunned lingerie occasionally a girlish white nightgown or slip but never anything kinky In the early days when it was hard to get a decent girl to pose in the nude a few of the Playmates looked as though they might feel at home on a barstool in the Place Pigalle But Hefner has always sought the virginal cheerleader look the first Playmate was calledSweetheart of the Month and today there is no shortage of snub nosed cheerleaders stewardesses and nurseryschool teachers just dying to be Playmates You have to fight them off with a baseball bat says Dwight Hooker a Playboy photographer Occasionally Playboy encounters a case like that of Debbie Hanlon of Royal Oak Mich who had already been photographed as Aprils Playmate when she backed out because her parents both Jehovahs Witnesses objected A beautiful girl like her portrayed in the nude would be bound to give men unchristian thoughts her mother explained But the mother of Leslie Bianchini the January 1969 Playmate had a more typical reaction I had no negative feelings about it Our society is moving away from the old puritan values Magazines like Playboy are an accepted part of American Playboy still runs into occasional legal problems in outoftheway places like McAlester Okla Hattiesburg Miss and Salem Ore Some major companies still steadfastly refuse to advertise in the magazine among them airlines automobile manufacturers CocaCola and Gillette a Gillette spokesman says the company has reservations about its being an appropriate medium for our prod ucts The insurance industry is particularly leery about Playboy Michael Arlen a distinguished writer for The New Yorker Atlantic and many other magazines was recently told by one insurance company that they considered him uninsurable because he had written for Playboy Several Wall Street brokerage houses declined to underwrite the Playboy stock before Loeb Rhoades  Co finally consented And then objections were raised to the nude figure of Willy Rey the February 1971 Playmate which was to recline across the stock certificate Miss Reys red hair was coiled over her bosom to assuage the financial communitys sensibil BUT such scruples are rapidly melting away Witness this story out of Houston Tex Last fall Mrs Margaret McClean wrote a letter to The Houston Chronicle saying that her husband a postman had delivered copies of Playboy to George Garver the citys former school superintendent then waging a fight for reinstatement A man who reads Playboy should not have a position in the schools Mrs McClean wrote To a decent person Playboy magazine is one of the most immoral obscene and lewdtype publications and should not be found any place in a decent home and never near children It was an argument which might have been expected to arouse considerable support in a community hardly known for its liberalism Instead the mail which poured in to Houstons papers overwhelmingly defended Mr Garvers reading habits and condemned Mr McClean for violating postal regulations by revealing the contents of his mailbag He was promptly suspended and transferred to the vehiclemaintenance division A few months later after two new school board members were elected the board voted to rehire Mr Garver who showed up for his first day back on the job in a green Playboy tie dotted with hundreds of little rabbits But Playboys relentless respectability is perhaps best demonstrated by the glacial circumspection with which it has met the first even moderately serious challenge in 20 years Penthouse the Britishbased magazine which hasbeen publishing here for nearly three years now claims almost 165 million American readers still only a fraction of Playboys circulation but much closer than any other competitor has ever come No body in Hefnerland will admit for the record that they are worried but some will argue that Playboys well scrubbed wholesomeness is outmoded even downright dull compared with Penthouses Continental approach its European Penthouse Pets unairbrushed and uninhibited strike overtly erotic poses Partly in response to this challenge Playboy has eversoslowly begun to relax its standards In August 1969the very month Penthouse hit the stands herePlayboy offered its readers their first glimpse of pubic hair caught fleetingly in a strobelighted photo sequence of actress Paula Kelly It was a very carefully thoughtout experiment says one staffer We wanted to test the water Only 29 months later when fully satisfied that most of its readers were not offended did Playboy go all the way Last Januarys Playmate Marilyn Cole presented what a spokesman called the first pose in which a girl displayed all her charms for a full front But just so far and no farther We would be insane to tamper much more with a formula that has worked so well for us confided one Playboy editor And thus the new magazine scheduled to appear in September Ouian American adaptation of the immensely successfulFrench mens magazine Lui Although naturally no reference was made to Penthouse Hefners announcement this spring made clear that the new venture was designed to meet the Continental competition Oui will be written andedited for a sophisticated American audience willdiffer from Playboy in that itwill have a European accent The beauty of the projectis that it enables Playboy totake on the insolent challenger indirectly without risking its own prestige If it works fine if not Playboy will still be able to pose decorously her skirt hoisted few inches above the gutter IF Playboys publishing wing has made an ambivalent accommodation to the new sexual climate the clubs have been less successful in straddling their inherent contradictions Even in the priggish early sixties the Playboy Clubs didnt seem very sexy As a reporter for The Baltimore Sun I couldnt understand the outrage of the housewives who temporarily blocked a Playboy Club from opening there in 1961 After all Baltiwas the home of the famed Block one of the last bastions of American burlesque where some genuinely sexy women like Blaze Starr and Candy Barr nightly removed their clothes while some even less salubrious activities went on in the darkened booths around them How could Baltimore possibly be corrupted by a few dozen carefully screened young ladies who stayed tightly encased in their rigid corsets and werent even allowed to sit down with a customer much less make date with him Conceding that in less ribald communities the brushof a perfumed cottontailmight once have been pretty racy stuff such excitementcould not be expected to lastinto the Swinging Seventies When almost every Americancity now contains two orthree singles bars where any presentable fellow can findamiable companionship for the night what attraction does an untouchable bunny haveHefner concedes the problem but he argues that the restrictions on any establishment with a liquor license are intensified if your name is Playboy They gun for us on any little thing Moreover he says the look but dont touch principle was necessary because we wanted to attract a kind of girl who never worked in bars before Disney insisted that Disneyland be staffed by nice cleancut American kids to distinguish it from other amusement parks which he called dirty phony places run by toughlooking people Not surprisingly then the clubs are in trouble According to a recent Oppenheimer  Co analysis the 16 North American clubs excluding the highly profitable London gambling operation have shown a steady earnings decline since 1967 and lost 292000 in fiscal 1971 Playboy officials dispute this figure arguing that it doesnt count the 10 per cent taken off the top of all clubs gross revenue as a service charge This becomes an abstruse bookkeeping debate which cannot disguise a deep disappointment over the clubs performance of late The big losers have been the Los Angeles Detroit San Francisco Montreal and Phoenix clubs and only substantial profits from New York and Chicago have kept the overall balsheet One would normally expect some losing operations to be closed but here Playboy finds itself in a difficult position Since the 17 clubs are held out as the major inducement for purchase of the Playboy key lawyers fear a class suit by one of the 960000 keyholders if any club were dropped The only Playboy Club ever to fold was the abortive Philippine venture which lasted only months in 1964 Playboy officials offer several explanations for the problems of the domestic clubs First they say nightclubs in general have fared badly over the past decade Then most Playboy Clubs are located downtown in major cities where well heeled suburbanites are reluctant to venture at night Finally the officials concede Playboy was so busy in other areasthe magazines hotels TV showsthat they more or less forgot about the clubs and let them become old hat THE man chiefly responsible for the clubs as well as resorts and hotels is Arnold J Morton Playboys senior vice president A veteran Chicago restaurant and nightclub operator he admitted paying a 50000 bribe to the chairman of the New York State Liquor Authority in 1961 to get a license for the New York club Chunky baldish fasttalking nattily turnedout in a dark suit mod glasses and close trimmed mustache Morton has a miniature green felt putting green beside his desk and a putter is propped against the wall His office like those of other top Playboy executives is equipped with a sleek wall console containing a TV radio tape machine and five clocks set for No question about it weve got to contemporize Morton told me The clubs are pretty much what they were when we opened them in the sixties And these kids these days dont want to sit around and listen to some old saloon comic They want to move about be informal go where the action is Mortons 24yearold son Peter recently opened a strikingly successful mod hamburger place in London called the Great American Disaster and Morton says Ive learned something from him From now on Morton says the clubs will put more emphasis on good food fewer show rooms with standup comics or torch singers and more informal lounge acts or discotheque dancing more mobility large rooms with bars in the middle permitting guests to move around in a party time atmosphere Where population shifts have left clubs in a depressed back water clubs will be moved and often reduced in size The Los Angeles club is deserting the sinking Strip and moving into swinging new Century City the Phoenix club is leaving Phoenix altogether moving out to suburban Scottsdale There has even been a halfhearted attempt to capture a bit of the singles trade by handing out thousands of free Playmate keys to airline stewardesses although most of them dont frequent the clubs Yet right outside the new Chicago club the lobby bar of the Playboy Towers hotel is the most frenetic singles spot in town One bitterly cold Friday night in March I saw 300 young people lined up on the sidewalk waiting to get in Later that night I sat with a highranking Playboy executive in the clubs sedate Living Room Why I asked couldnt that bar be in here rather than out in the lobby Why couldnt you have at least one singles bar in every Playboy Club Wouldnt that help revive the clubs Well it might bring in some of those swingers but what would it do to our crowd in here Just look around you he said pointing to table after table filled with paunchy middleaged men digging at their steaks and baked potatoes Our statistics show that the average Playboy keyholder is 10 years older than the average Playboy reader Theyre in their late 30s or early 40s the AllisChalmers manager or the Colgate salesmen in on a business trip Look at them Theyre not in here after girls Theyre quite happy tohave a meal and a brew and ogle the bunnies a bit Sowhat would happen if youbrought all those swingers in here These guys would haveto start wondering Couldreally pick up that girl and if I could and if I actually gother home could I perform inbed Its a threat they dont want and I dont think wereever going to give it to them Titillation without threat Is that the secret of Playboyssuccess Rollo May the psychotherapist seems to think so In Love and Will he wrote that Playboy gets its dynamic from a repressedanxiety in American men thatunderlies even the fear of involvement This is the repressed anxiety about impotence Everything in the magazine is beautifully concocted to bolster the illusion of potency without ever putting it to the test or challenge Schickel notes that the mechanical alligator which rises out of the water during Disneylands Jungle Boat Ride thrills but never threatens Hefner has been credited with an important insight in anticipating assisting or actually initiating the American sexual revolution But perhaps his insight was of a different kind altogetherrecognizing the profound sexual anxiety in many American men and realizing that the road to success lay in indulging that anxiety not exacerbating it Certainly all the gossip about the swinging parties and sexual adventures of the Playboy world is vastly exaggerated At the five or six Playboy parties Ive attended in the last few months I rarely saw anyone so much as kissed A young woman who has worked at Playboy for several years told me sexually its one of the straightest places in town its about as swinging as IBM In fact so sensitive is Playboy about its racy reputation that at times it can be a trifle prudish At last falls Playboy Writers Convocation a woman who showed up with a writer who wasnt her husband was virtually ordered to wear the wifes name tag to avoid THE more time I spent in the Playboy empire this spring the less I felt that overt sex was central to it As I traveled from club to hotel to executive suite Playboy seemed to me to be symbolized less by the Gouda breasts overlapping those bunny corsets than by brown wood orange shag and bronze trim I came to recognize the Playboy look what the press releases call the clean contemporary look but always in warm earthy tones lots of dark textured oiled woods nubby fabrics in tan brown ochre mocha and orange leather or Naugahyde couches and chairs bronze accessories and lots of electronic devicesTV radio hifi tape machinesin sleek console units There is a Playboy look a Playboy texture which Punch captured beautifully in its parody issue last year when it advertised the Playboy Gearshift Emasculate your box with this zonetoughened obeliscal shaft and customized knob richlyveneered in warmtothetouch rhodium and teasingly topped with a cocktail olive in pullback soft leather poucn Hefner has always been preoccupied with the way things look When several Liberated Women invaded his mansion several years ago and pasted Liberation stickers all over the walls and paintings his first reaction was the stickers werent even well styled His emphasis on style is particularly evident in his own living quarters In the very first issue of Playboy Hefners editorial note said We like our apartment We enjoy mixing up cocktails and an hors doeuvre or two putting a little mood music on the phonograph and inviting in a female acquaintance for a quiet discussion on Picasso Nietzche jazz and sex Hefners apartment the Chicago Mansion became the Platonic ideal of the Playboy style echoed time and again in the magazines bachelor pad features The Mansion has been described so often it is hardly necessary to go through it again but two rooms in particular reflect the technological wonders which so engage Hefners and his readers fantasies One is the game room a subterranean haunt filled with a dozen pinball machines and other slots Hefners two favorites are Polo and Four Million BC unusually complex pinballs which shoot as many as three balls into play at once requiring a jugglers skill to keep them all banging the right counters Above each machine is a scoreboard with the top 10 scores Hefner tops all of them his Four Million BC score is a phenomenal 109460 Then there is the videotape chamber equipped with machines which can tape shows simultaneously on five channels Each week Hefner gets advance copies of TV Guide for both Chicago and Los Angeles and marks fifteen or twenty films in red ink These are videotaped by his staff and added to his collection of thousands for replaying any time of the day For years Hefner was a virtual recluse in the Chicago Mansion But in 1968 overworked tense down to 135pounds he felt that he had to pick his life up by itsbootstraps To this end hebought a 30room Tudor mansion on a sixacre estate inHolmby Hills a favorite residential quarter for the Los Angeles movie community Henow spends about half of eachmonth in Los Angeles where Barbi is normally ensconcedand the other half in Chicagowhere Karen Christy last Decembers Playmate ispermanent guest at the Mansion shuttling back and forth on the Big Black Bunny his custommade 55million DC9 Playboy Mansion West as it is sometimes called is more traditional and elegant than its Chicago counterpart It features Botticini marble floors a curving staircase of handcarved oak and an Aeolian pipe organ which plays Moonlight and Roses and Prelude in C sharp minor built into the living room wall In Chicago no daylight ever penetrates the Mansion but here Hefner lives much of his time in one of the worlds most elaborate backyards replete with an artificial lagoon two artificial waterfalls four flamingos condor and ostrich The day of our interview he received me in an orange terry cloth jump suit with a rabbit emblem above the pocket After feeding the Japanese carp in the lagoon and asking one of his 23 servants to retrieve the ducks who had strayed into a neighbors pool he squatted crosslegged on a green lounge chair and laughed almost contentedly People say Im afraid of the sun and fresh air Well they forget I was in Chicago where one doesnt get much of either Obviously I enjoy the outofdoors when I can control it My house is an extension of me and my personality Its a controlled environment which lets me do the things I like to do as efficiently as THE first effort to market a controlled Playboy environment for the general public came in 1964 with acquisition of what was to become the Playboy ClubHotel at Bunny Bay Jamaica It was very frankly a test project recalls Bob Preuss We wanted to know if business executives would choose a Playboy hotel for conventions Would your wife let you go to a Playboy hotel Would you take your wife and children to a Playboy hotel We chose Jamaica partly because it was far away and wouldnt get too much press attention If it failed wed close our tents and quietly steal away We dont But until the current tourist slump hit Jamaica and the rest of the Caribbean Playboy found the answer to all three questions was at least a modified yes Apparently Playboys sexual style was even more bland and reassuring than anyone had guessed The late AC Spectorsky for years editorial director of Playboy recalled being impressed by the charming way the bunnies played with the children in Jamaica lending them their rabbit ears and teaching them to swim Thus emboldened Playboy opened its second resort hotel at Lake Geneva Wis in 1968 Designed to attract weekend and tourist business from Chicago 90 miles away and Milwaukee 38 miles the 356room Lake Geneva hotel was far more elaborate than the Jamaica project two golf courses a lake stocked with bass a ski area with two chair lifts nine different dining and drinking spots And when Lake Geneva did well Playboy broke ground on a still more ambitious project the Great Gorge ClubHotel near McAfee N J More than twice the size of Lake Geneva 674 rooms and more than twice as costly over 30million it is the most elaborate version of the Playboy Environment yet realized EARLY in January I attended Great Gorges formal opening After a 52mile drive from midtown Manhattan I was waved through the gate by a uniformed guard normally Playboy resorts are open only to keyholders who must show their keys at the gate The hotel itself rising atop a snowy ridge was no surprise to a veteran observer of the Playboy look textured concrete stained redwood and bronze glass outside echoed inside by lots more redwood stained walnut fixtures stone walls a bronze fireplace That evening things got underway with cocktails in the Duke of York Ballroom several hundred invited guests circling a huge pyramid of hors doeuvres topped by a big ice bunny Then we went upstairs to the 700seat Penthouse nightclub for a filet mignon dinner and some old show tunes by Nancy Wilson Middle aged couples the women in floorlength evening gowns foxtrotted around the floor Hefner at a front table nodded his head to the heavy fifties beat Mike Murphy a Playboy publicity man suggested we drop down to a party at the indoor pool When we arrived a halfdozen bunnies in pastel suits were paddling about in the heated Jacuzzi giggling almost shyly at the male guests who stared back uncomfortably from poolside After a few drinks we drifted up to another party in the Living Room where I ran into Mayor Edgar Snook of Vernon Township which encompasses Great Gorge I asked him whether there had been much opposition to a Playboy hotel a few of the old folks raised a fuss at the start he told me But most everybody else liked it There was never much to do around herejust a couple of old gin mills where they play the organ Now we have a real attraction An attraction it is The next evening thousands of New Jerseyans poured into the hotel Jamming the dance floor in the futuristic Bunny Hutch Disco downing beer at the Playmate bar shopping for Playboy decals and paperweights in the arcade They came in familieshousewives with blond beehives piled on their heads grandmothers in print dresses swarms of snowsuited childrenscarcely noticing the occasional flustered bunny trying to fight her way through the jammed hallways Great Gorge has continuedto attract a heavy transient business and has picked upmany of the New Jersey conventions which used to go to Atlantic City But it is stillnot getting much tourist tradeand the hotel often stands nearly empty during the weekGreat Gorge is expected tolose well over 1million during calendar 1972 which willswell the hotel divisions already substantial losses 17million in fiscal 1971 Playboy officials concede that some of these losses mustbe blamed on poor management Henry Lorenzi was recently dismissed as director ofoperations for the hotels andclubs and no permanent replacement has yet beennamed Hotels are an entirelynew business for us and until recently people didnt believewe were serious about it says Bob Preuss At last they believe us which means we can go out and hire the top people we need Despite the losses to date some Wall Street analysts areoptimistic about Playboyshotel venture They note that heavy but anticipated startup costs account for most ofthe loss and that resort hotels are rarely profitable in theirearly stages With skilled management the analysts believe the hotel division could start showing profits by 1973 Banking on such a turnaround Playboy is already mapping further expansion It has nurchased about 500 acres on Spains Costa del Sol for possible resort development and has been negotiating for a hotel in Tangier It is also considering gambling casinos in France and Las Vegas and has been talking with the fourth richest man in Japan about a massive effort there involving hotels clubs and the magazine blitzing Japan with Playboy as one executive puts it But Playboys next step more likely will be into housing It has talked with Levitt about constructing apartment colonies for single people all over the country linked by a computerized reservation system so a guy say in our Santa Monica colony who wanted to move East could query the computer and get word that an apartment was available in Miami The negotiations ultimately broke down chiefly because the estimated financial return was too small but the scheme meshes so perfectly with Playboys other enterprises that it is certain to be revived Meanwhile Playboy is going ahead with plans for a less ambitious housing project on land it already owns at Lake Geneva Eventually seven villages with 300 houses each would be clustered near the hotel The houses priced at 25000 to 35000 are designed primarily as second homes for people in Chicago and other Midwestern cities Arnold Morton envisions a whole set of services for the homeowner Say youre a bachelor living in Chicago and youre going to drive up for a weekend with your girl You could call ahead and tell us when you planned to arrive and what youd like to eat and drink Wed send over a houseman to cook it for you put the martinis on ice light the candles even strum while dined IT is of course a vision straight from the magazine At times the corporate ad men make the pitch even more overt A brochure for Lake Geneva says More a luxurious country club than a hotel it is virtually a way of life The good life The kind youve read about in the pages of Playboy magazine There Is a delicate irony here For the editorial people at the magazine have long cultivated a cool disdain for the rest of the company Theyre restaurant and hotel men we dont have anything in common with them one editor told me Another editor took me to dinner one night at the Chicago Playboy Club a place he clearly entered as infrequently as possible When a bunny appeared and chirped Hi Im your bunny Bonnie the editor snapped sarcastically Far out And when Bunny Bonnie wrinkled up her nose cutely he growled I it He obviously Ea The magazine people have some justification for their pride Under the late Auguste Comte Spectorsky Playboy became an increasingly readable and interesting magazine The urbane New York sophisticate heading a staff of Midwestern naifs saw his role clearly marked out for him to eradicate Playboys dirty book image and turn it into a magazine people wouldnt be ashamed to say they read or wrote for Paying some of the highest writers rates in the business he largely succeeded Last falls mammoth Writers Convocation though sneered at by many was evidence of the class Spectorsky had sought so assiduously Any magazine which can boast writers like Michael Arlen John Cheever Harvey Cox James Dickey Bruce Jay Friedman Murray Kempton Larry King V S Pritchett Arthur Schlesinger Jr Calvin Trillin Kenneth Tynan Tom Wicker and Garry Wills clearly has class even if as its critics charge Playboy does not always get BUT along with Spectorskys achievement often went a defensiveness even a testy belligerence toward the Eastern literary establishment which looked down its nose at the magazine Arthur Kretchmer the bright young man who took over Spectorskys editorial functions after his death says he believes that era is over We have selfconfidence now In fact many months we think were publishing the best magazine in America Spec had to prove that Playboy was the kind of magazine JeanPaul Sartre gave interviews to We dont have to prove anything now Kretchmer says he will continue to emphasize serious nonfiction with socially progressive themesGarry Wills on the Berrigan trial Jack Newfield on Ted Kennedy Richard Rhodes on the destruction of the Evergladeswhich has appeared with increasing frequency in Playboy There are those who date this from the celebrated thwack on the back which a Chicago policeman gave Hefner during the 1968 disturbances in Chicago Hefner ridicules this suggestion and he is probably right One doesnt contract a social conscience overnight like the flu But clearly the magazine and its publisherhave come a long way from its first issue when it could proclaim Affairs of state will be out of our province We dont expect to solve any world problems or prove any great moral truths If we are able to give the American male a few extra laughs and a little diversion from the anxieties of the atomic age well feel Hefners revived social conscience is reflected in several areas Increasingly he makes his mansions available for fund raising efforts by liberaltoradical groupsamong them the American Civil Liberties Union and Jesse Jacksons Operation PUSH He has contributed 61000 to George McGoverns campaign and thousands more to Dan Walkers insurgent effort to become Governor of Illinois And the 18monthold Playboy Foundationin effect Playboys social action division has been channeling about 500000 a year into progressive even daring projects prison reform revision of marijuana laws improvements in military justice a study of wiretapping and electronic surveillance efforts by the AfroAmerican Patrolmans League to investigate and prosecute police brutality Under the imaginative direction of a young Chicago lawyer Burt Joseph the foundation has specialized in the campaign for sexual freedom abortion reform population control and repeal of laws which heavily penalize private sexual behavior such as fornication adultery and SKEPTICS abound Blacks note the paucity of black faces in even junior executive positions at Playboy the most prominent are an art director and the man who runs the mail room Women unimpressed by the magazines recent efforts to mollify the Womens Liberation Movement point to the March 1972 cover which showed woman in the shape of bottle with a Playboy corkscrew lying nearby But one hardly needs to question Hefners commitment to social change to ask whether this is the cumulative impact of his magazine For the best of Wills Wicker or Kempton is a thin slice folded into a massive sandwich of features and service articles on autos stereos fashion furnishings food and drink Its a hot summers day and youre poolside with friends Youve brought along your camera and sometime during the afternoon you decide to film the outdoor fun begins a piece on home videotape recorders featuring rigs which sell for 1295 and 1700 And gifts for Dad Dimensia III a combination stereo phonograph AMFM

heated swimming pools and saunas XKE Ferrari gran turismo Mazda RX2 Mercedes 600 And tips on how to sip an aperitif hit a forehand carve a goose buy a motorboat choose a Riesling select a coat of arms All this is served up in the glossy color photography and dazzling graphics which have made Playboy one of Americas most handsome magazines A lifelong film buff who has always been graphically oriented Hefner has produced a magazine which shimmers with the lush rewardsand even more extravagant fantasies  of American capitalism And long after articles on the Berrigans or air pollution are forgotten one suspects it is this which remains deeply imbedded in the readers psyche Hefner says a man shouldnt have to choose between enjoying life and having a social conscience looking out for yourself and other guys as well Certainly he shouldnt But in this world choices must be made and one wonders how the Playboy reader would choose THAT depends of course on just who the Playboy reader is And the future of the Playboy empire hinges on that question foras Preuss saysour greatest asset is our magazine audience which wants to he part of the Playboy world and to whom we can sell anything that we can convincingly associate with that world Every month Playboy runs a page in the magazine headlined What sort of man reads Playboy Some of the recent answers A robustyoung guy with a thirst for new adventures a guywith an eye for style As selective in the decor of his surroundings as he is in the friends he surrounds himself with A man who plays to win Whether its a game of chance or the game of romance he always knows just when to make the right move Playboy officials concede there is an element of hyperbole in this feature which is designed primarily to attract advertisers But the same kind of upbeat image emerges from Playboys description of what it considers the most reliable survey ever taken of its audience a psychographic profile of Playboy readers by Prof Douglas J Tigert of the University of Chicago Tigert found that 47 per cent of regular Playboy readers like to play poker as opposed to 22 per cent of nonreaders 55 per cent like sport cars as opposed to 16 per cent of nonreaders 34 per cent expect to be a top executive in the next 10 years as opposed to 10 per cent of nonreaders while only 16 per cent said I often wish for the good old days as opposed to 31 per cent of nonreaders He concluded that Playboy readers exhibit a zest for life and a strong liberal outlook and Playboy said the study showed its audience was made up of optimistic ambitious freewheeling freespending young Some striking statistics also come from the Simmons market research reports Of Playboys male readers twothirds arc in the 1834 age group 456 per cent earn over 15000 a year 44 per cent attended or graduated from college But there is another side too A Playboy staffer reports a very large percentage of letters to the Playboy Advisor and the Playboy Forum come from two places prisons and the armed forces That doesnt necessarily mean that the average Playboy reader is a lonely convict or soldier for these are precisely the men who have time to write letters But they may indeed be among those who identify most closely with the magazine For if any theme emerges from Playboy it is social mobilitythe opportunity to rise in the world learn the social graces buy the right goods bed the goodlooking women Perhaps for this reason Playboy seems to have a particular appeal among blacks About 60 per cent of the singles I saw crowding the Playboy Towers Bar in Chicago were black and similar scenes have been reported from several innercity Playboy Clubs Playboy officials sometimes leave the impression that Playboy decals get pasted chiefly on Porsches and Triumphs but the last five I saw were plastered all over a 62 Plymouth carrying the legend Black And Playboy reflects its readers anxieties in the way it zealously guards them against any reminder of their human frailties Howard Lederer vice president for media sales says Our policy prohibits any ad which would remind the reader of a problem he hasthat he may be balding or undersized too fat or too thin This means ban on advertising for acne cures trusses athletes foot powder diets body building studios hair restorers or evenhair lotions which unduly stress dandruff removal Significantly the ban extends to anything which would remind the reader that he is not as well educated or successful as he would like thus excluding most correspondence courses and industrial schools One law school course was accepted only after the ad copy was changed to make clear that the course was offered only as a supplement to a successful career Indeed Playboy often seems hung up on success Success is extraordinarily important to the company one Playboy official told The Wall Street Journal The Playboy image we talk so much about most of all is one of success I wonder if we could bear the stigma of a failure Of course there have been some major failures along the way but Playboy has quickly buried them Trump a satirical magazine which folded after only two issues in 1957 Show Business Illustrated which was dropped after eight issues in 1962 Playboys Penthouse and Playboy After Dark the two unsuccessful television shows Playboy has consistently rejected suggestions that it sponsor entries in auto races boat races airplane races or powder puff derbies in part because as Preuss puts it the odds against winning any given race are very slim and we dont want THERE are those who feel that the spectacular expansion of the Playboy empire within the past few years is an even greater gamble in which the chances of failure are frighteningly real These critics point to continuing managerial turmoil and structural disorder in the organization As long ago as 1961 a case study prepared by the Harvard Business School for use by its students portrayed a managerial muddle at Playboy Preuss was quoted as telling the researcher Im fighting hard to bring some business direction to the company but I think Im losing the battle This spring the theme was echoed by Stephen Byer a former Playboy vice president for marketing and author of Hefners Gonna Kill Me When He Reads This  In the book and a long interview the 29yearold Byer contended that the organization is full of incompetents promoted far over their heads and that the few able executives have been reduced to subservient yesmen There have been plenty of managerial problems Victor Lownes long a key executive in Chicago had a serious falling out with Hefner was fired and then rehired to head up Playboys London operation As long as Spectorsky lived there was a deep chasm between the editorial and clubhotel wings of the company often accompanied by fierce backbiting And for many years Hefner had great difficulty delegating authority which meant he often got involved in picayune matters ONE executive recalls meeting with Hefner on a critical problem several years ago Word had been left with Hefners secretary that they were not to be disturbed but midway through the meeting his administrative assistant Dick Rosenzweig knocked on the door saying Hef Hef Ive got to see you right away The executive recalls the rest as follows Dick said Hef you remember when we ran our first pubic hair on that black girl Paula Kelly you remember how much flak we got from black groups Well look at this and he handed Hefner a cartoon of a nudist colony in which the only pubic hair visible was on a black girl For two minutes there was absolute silence in that room as Hef pored over the cartoon Then ne looked up and intoned Tell Spec to rub out When Hefner did learn to delegate authority he often delegated it to the wrong people One Playboy veteran puts it this way We were a bunch of smalltown Midwest boys who started this whole thing Frankly when the success came we just couldnt believe it And I think we panicked a bit We felt we had to import some highpriced East Coast talent to show us how to manage a major corporation In recent years Playboy has recruited executives from places like Procter  Gamble Columbia Records TV Guide Time Inc and other major companies but many of them have not worked out One highranking executive lasted only three months after he turned out to be a chronic alcoholic Playboy is considering a suit against the executive talent agency which found him Steve Byer who was brought in to straighten things out only complicated them with what one executive calls an incredible reign of terror in which 40 to 50 people lost their jobs Byers replacement as marketing vice president is Robert Gutwillig a 40yearold refugee from New Yorks literary world where he wrote two novels and published many more as an executive with World and McGrawHill In his buttondown shirts narrow ties and gray flannels Gutwillig looks out of place at Playboy But he has displayed more energy in his first two years there than all the wide ties and mod shades around him Whirling back and forth between Chicago New York Washington and Europe he has been chiefly responsible for launching Playboys new foreign editions the Book Club the expanded Playboy Press hardcover line scores of new softcover books Playboy posters greeting cards and puzzles His virtuoso performance has left both resentment and awe in its wake One of Gutwilligs old New York acquaintances says You can go a long way in the publishing world on two things energy and ego Bobbys got of both The other day I was sitting with two Playboy people in Los Angeles when one of them noted that Hefner Preuss and Rosenzweig had all flown back to Chicago together recently on the Big Black Bunny I thought major corporations didnt let all their top executives fly together he said Thats right said the other but Hefners successor wasnt on that plane THAT may be rushing things a bit but certainly Gutwilligs style is ideally suited to Playboys new imperial age caught up with him one day in April as he was about to take off for Munich to iron out some problems in the German edition Riding to the airport in a Playboy limousine he began a monologue which would have dazzled a Wall Street security analyst I got tired of talking to myself in New York publishing nice little books for a few thousand people who all thought the way I did Here one can really talk to the country at large Playboys big asset is that it feeds off itself building one project on top of another meshing them together so they reinforceeach other Hef can do that better than anybody sinceDisney Weve gotten off ournarrow base Why limit ourselves to just one marketWeve got to find new markets And we will he said loping down the ramp toward his plane
Civil Liberties Hails 4 in Legislature for Vote Record,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/11/archives/civil-liberties-hails-4-in-legislature-for-vote-record.html,The New York Civil Liberties Union has given perfect marks to one Assemblyman and three State Senators for their voting records on civilliberties issues in the recent legislative session At the same time in its second annual civilliberties voting index of the State Legislature the union commended Governor Rockefeller for almost singlehandedly preventing the session from being true civilliberties disaster In the Assembly only one member Franz S J Leichter DemocratLiberal of Manhattan received a civilliberties rating of 100 per cent having voted what the union called right on all 14 Assembly rollcalls included in the index In the Senate three members each scored 100 per cent on 12 Senate rollcalls included in the index They were Emanuel R Gold DemocratLiberal of Queens Manfred Ohrenstein DemocratLiberal of Manhattan and Roy M Goodman RepublicanLiberal of Manhattan Four Assemblymen were tied for the unions lowest civilliberties rating 7 per centwith only one correct vote out of the 14 Assembly votes counted They were John T Gallagher RepublicanConservative of Queens Edward M Kinsella Republican of Solvay Edwyn E Mason Republican of Hobart and George E Van Cott Republican of Mount Vernon Two Senators Richard E Schermerhorn Republican of Newburgh and Ronald Stafford of Peru had the lowest civilliberties rating in the Senate 25 per cent each with three correct votes out of the 12 in that house Among the bills that the civilliberties organization had urged affirmative votes on were those for ending discrimination because of sex giving equal rights to women removing prohibitions on contraceptives and establishing various prison reforms Bills that were opposed were those for repealing the abortion law reinstating the death pen aity for murder stiffening obscenity laws curtailing busing of schoolchildren hampering integrated scattersite public housing empowering schools to withhold diplomas because of unsatisfactory character and citizenship giving aid to parochial schools extending student suspensions without a hearing permitting pretrial detention in certain drug cases and weakening speedy trial procedures Union Not Satisfied In a statement releasing the index Kenneth P Norwick legislative director of the New York Civil Liberties Union said Although the civilliberties record of the 1972 session of the Legislature is better than its 1971 record the Legislatures record on civil liberties issues is still far from satis factory In fact Governor Rockefeller by his courageous vetoes of the bills to repeal the preslent abortion law to impose moratorium on publicschool integration and to kill the inte grated scattersite housing project at Forest Hills almost singlehandedly prevented the session from being a true civilliberties disaster We commend the Governor for his enlightened actions on these bills and for his dramatically improved civil liberties rating The civilliberties organization gave Governor Rockefeller a 23 per cent rating in 1971 This years rating was 75 per cent
Television,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/11/archives/-tap-that-phone-said-firmjawed-chief-ironside.html,FOR years the content of television was judged primarily on its most explicit level An hour entertainment was either enjoyable or miserable A news special was either effective or ineffective The medium was simply a mechanism for distribution Success was verified in the audience ratings That Is still the basic mode of operation But increasingly the sea of electrons is being disturbed by new sometimes disruptive elements In one area primarily among artists there is the contention that TV may more than a system of distribution that its still untapped potential may be more than a mere extension theater Journalism movies or radio In another the critical focus is shifting to the content that is implicit in television programing to the values that are incorporated and transmitted perhaps mostly unconsciously Widespread public attention for instance is now being drawn to the violence content of television or the hardsell commercials packed tightly into childrens programs These elements have triggered studies and inquiries aimed at measuring the impact of content on TV audiences Statistics have been gathered and analyses have been submitted Theres only one catch The same set of statistics can be and are often used to produce completely conflicting sets of conclusions And the TV industry of course feeling threatened is spending considerable amounts of dollars to gather its own conclusions Direct confrontation Richard D Heffner maintains can be unproductive And as it happens Mr Heffner has just directed a TVcontent study himself With 240000 grant from the Ford Foundation and with Esther Kramer as associate director he has spent the put two years concentrating on those elements of proprograming that relate to the physical environment The project was inspired a few years ago he recalls by en episode of Ironside Chief Raymond Burr knew that the villain regularly used a certain public telephone Casually turning to an aide the chief ordered a tap to be put on the phone Mr Heffner observed to his two young sons that he thought the order was illegal One son however quickly replied that if the chief does it it must be all right As a communications medium Mr Heffner says television was transmitting information That information was implying certain values and those values he feels can be safely assumed were ultimately influencing behavior With a background in commercial and public television including at one time the position of general manager of Channel 13 Mr Heffner drew up a proposal for a study that would focus on one of three areas in TV content the environment drug abuse or criminal justice The Ford Foundationthough its Environmental not Television unitaccepted the environment proposal The Foundations own position according to Mrs Kramer that the main causes of pollution are behavioral not technological that technological solutions exist but behavioral awareness is lacking Last spring the project located in an apartment on Manhattans Riverside Drive monitored and taped a full week of programing on the three commercial networks In order to reduce the chances of unusual schedule disruptions the taping was done diagonally across the calendar Sunday one week Monday the need for period of seven weeks As a weight for the study shows that made the Top 10 were recorded in each the seven weeks With more than 400 hours finally recorded a small staff of coders using special questionnaires devised by Mr Heffner examined the programing for any materialrelated in any way to environmental concerns The coders found 570 instances of such material With each catalogued in a questionnaire consisting of 155 questions the project eventually reverted to a computer for storing data Of the 570 statements 131 were related to pollution 113 to transportation 107 to attitudes toward nature 93 to resources depletion 86 to population control and the rest to various general and miscellaneous categories In addition every sixth commercial on the tapes was analyzed and of the resulting 626 total third were environmentally relevant One of the final questions for the coder was whether the particular example being catalogued was beneficial to the environment detrimental or not clearly one or the other Perhaps surprisingly especially to selfappointed watchdogs who see nothing but evil motives on the television terrain well more than half of the statements were officially considered beneficial Some of these consisted of clear and explicit antipollution warnings notably regular signoff comments by Carol Burnett Jim Nabors and Glen Campbell Others were key elements in madeforTV movie plots Still others were more intangible such as the casual inclusion of subjects like birth control and abortion on All in the Family Mr Heffner points out that years ago a program he produced on homosexuality drew immediate and threatening objections from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York He retained the support of the network but not without moments of nervousness Today he maintains even more controversial matters are being inserted into ordinary programing and the nervousness has abated noticeably The effect on public values while still Immeasurable can hardly be disputed On the detrimental side the range of examples is also broad Pollution gags are standard items in the repertory of comedians and on entertainment series and talk shows complex issues tend to be oversimplified trivialized One obvious polluter is the automobile but possibly for obvious reasons TV virtually ignores mass transportation facilities and projects the private car a harmless extension of the human body Other examples are even more implicit from Lucy letting the water run while shes talking with her children to the naturelover who is depicted as a lovable and harmless eccentric Mr Heffner argues that each of these messages transmits a message and that the message could easily be more beneficial to society writers and directors were more conscious of its potential The basic ingredient is consciousness not censorship Perhaps The behaviorist theory about society is complex and not without its detractors One major environmental problem for instance is littering and explicit TV publicservice commercials have made little or no dent in the problem And probably no TV program even unconsciously has encouraged littering But Mr Heffner observing that some young people claim you are what you eat believes that we may become more and more what we see What he and his project have seen will no doubt be subject numerous interpretations The most significant point however is that television itself is being seen in a new way

Abortion Opponents Active,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/11/archives/abortion-opponents-active.html,EDISON  Last December months before a Federal court ruled that New Jerseys abortion law was unconstitutionally vague and an invasion of womens right to privacy the first office of Birthright in the state opened its doors Today the organization which helps women seeking an alternative to abortion has offices operating in six more cities  Freehold New Brunswick Neptune Atlantic City Newark and North Haledon Also Birthright alliances are being formed at Rider and Trenton State Colleges to counsel coeds It is as if women who would never get active before suddenly realized that now is the time to make a stand said Mrs Denise Cocciolone executive director of Birthright in the United States Mrs Cocciolone who heads the Woodbury office added Significantly we are getting many nonCatholics offering help now This makes us happy since we are nondenominational and want to reach as many people as possible She also announced that Birthright International which is a voluntary organization formed to assist and advise pregnant women considering abortion would hold its first convention starting next Friday in Atlantic City with Mrs Eunice Kennedy Shriver as the keynote speaker Basically a telephone counseling service each Birthright office averages 25 volunteer counselors and office staff with the newest office in Freehold listing 50 workers Financing comes from public and private donations with contributions coming from womens clubs and civic organizations Appeals are handled locally for each office and while several churches have printed our information in their Sunday bulletins we are not churchsponsored Mrs Cocciolone said All of the workers are trained volunteers with a backup file of medical legal psychological and social service people Sometimes office space is donated as the Atlantic City Birthright in an Episcopal facility and the North Haledon group centered in the Bethany Christian Home Social Services building Others rent office space as in Freehold or arrangements are made to house the service in a doctors office as in Neptune Each office averages 50 calls a week from girls distressed by pregnancy with an average of 20 girls coming in to the office for followup help Birthright says it will not refer a young woman to an abortionist The organization looks upon life as sacred and precious to both the baby and the mother and viewes abortion as destruction of the unborn child an expediency that does not solve the problem When a distressed woman calls Birthright she is told that her call will be in the strictest confidence The organization offers whatever help it can to aid the woman in carrying her child full term Sometimes the help is as simple as maternity clothes and baby furniture which are donated to Birthright at other times it means psychological and medical counseling Birthright arranges a private shelter for the girl usually in family homes of volunteers who will aid the caller through her pregnancy to delivery Referrals are also made to maternity homes social services and other agencies All we ask of volunteers is that they be loving receptive people free from judgment and morality meddling Mrs Cocciolone said They have to be able to face these concerned women and offer them an alternative to abortion Donations have come from religious groups as varied as the Dutch Reformed Church the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Atlantic City and a Mormon group in the Camden area A former Peace Corpsman and mother of two preschoolers sits quietly waiting for the phone to ring in the New Brunswick Birthright office She is Mrs Anne McCracken who had sat reading abortion news and developments for six months and had not paid much attention to the headlines Suddenly I realized here I am protesting wars and killing while 25000 babies were aborted in New York 30 miles away in three months the former teacher recalled What a death rate Convinced that abortion did not solve the problems of poverty or inadequate sex education Mrs McCracken accepted the Birthright post in New Brunswick It isnt enough to say abortion is the easy out and stop there she said There are alternatives The state should be concerned with helping victims of rape and incest the potentially defective child and the malformed child It should provide compulsory measles vaccine free and RH vaccine where needed Financial assistance for surgery in utero and ample counseling services for unwed mothers and mothers who cant face having an Another group active in opposing eased abortion standards is the states Right to Life Committee a Protestant Catholic and Jewish organization formed in 1968 Dr Edward Palmer director of the state committee is working toward an active legislative lobby to redefine the laws vagueness and provide protection for the unborn child Our lawyers are working with the State Attorney General on an appeal to the federal court decision but also for a prolife package of legislation Dr Palmer said That legislation would include bills to hit at the heart of the problem bills for mandatory Rubella vaccine prenatal care better housing in the state birth insurance he said adding The Right to Life Committee feels that abortions should be allowed only to save the life of the mother Membership in the committee is difficult to analyze The group has a mailing list of 7000 but some members say it has upwards of four times that number of members Financing like Birthright is through donations Methodist Lutheran orthodox Jews Dutch Reformed and Catholic churches have been active in furthering the Right to Life position Exactly onefourth of the executive board is nonCatholic but members are not asked their religion when they volunteer to help Professional people are used in lecturing and community panel discussions to bring the prolife stand before the people
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/12/archives/unwanted-pregnancy-and-ethics.html,To the Editor Eunice Kennedy Shriver in her letter published June 6 has made the claim that the ethical issues underlying abortion and birth control have been ignored by the Rockefeller Commission The NeW York Times and others who have long urged that such matters should be determined solely by the affected woman AS one who has fought for this latter resultI can agree with her that ethical issues are indeed central to these matters and that individual morality no longer matters to the moral fiber of our nation Nevertheless the application of ethical principles and morality compels support for the conclusion that a woman who is the victim of a compulsory pregnancy is being subjected to unethical conduct It must again be stated that the use of contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and the termination of unwanted pregnancies do not involve the destruction of any person except in the eyes of those whose churches believe otherwise To say that womans body is private property hardly does justice to an ethical concept One can hardly be viewed as human in any sense unless one has absolute control over ones body and ones mind To subject a human body to outside control is the most grave injury one can do to another person Normally we reserve this as punishment for crime or in the case of conscriptees where the continued existence of the nation is at stake Obviously neither consideration warrants imposing compulsory pregnancies on women An ethical concern with life should take as its starting point the obligation to insure that each living person shall be able to conduct his life in safety and in the manner he chooses consistent only with his obligation not to injure other living human beings Ethics cannot be said to exist in the absence of individual freedom That ethics also includes a responsibility to other human beings goes without saying But such responsibilities do not include and cannot be discharged by destroAng anothers freedom The views I am expressing do not require any woman to undergo an abortion or to practice measures of birth control Quite the contrary they simply make it possible for women to follow their own consciences on such matters If their consciences lead them to believe that every pregnancy must come to term such is their absolute right and no one should interfere with that decision If however their consciences lead them to a contrary result their right to act upon that belief should be equally inviolate This is in the essence of the ethical position which underlies the humane abortion law of New York IVAN SHAPIRO President N Y Society for Ethical Culture New York June 6 1972
High‐Ranking State Legislators Facing Challenges in Primaries,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/14/archives/highranking-state-legislators-facing-challenges-in-primaries.html,A number of highranking State Senators and Assemblymen of both major parties are facing primary battles on issues ranging from their positions on abortion to charges by challengers that they are too freespending In two other instances legislative leaders have succeeded in quashing their opposition leaving them unopposed in the primary and considerably enhancing their chances for reelection in November In the Senate the announcement by Majority Leader Earl W Brydges Republican of Niagara Falls that he would not seek reelection has spawned a fiveman Republican primary and a twoman Democratic primary None of the Republicans Wilfred G Miles Curtis L Lyman Richard M Nelson Lloyd H Paterson or H William Feder has been officially endorsed by either the Niagara County Republican organization or by Brydges Niagara Treasurer Favored But the favorite political sources report is Mr Paterson currently the Niagara County Treasurer The two Democrats seeking nomination in the traditionally Republican district are James A McGinnis and James Milne who has served as an assistant counsel to Mr Brydges in the Legislature In the Assembly two longtime incumbents on the powerful Ways and Means Committee which handles all legislation with fiscal implications are being challenged in their districts The chairman of Ways and Means Assemblyman Willis H Stephens Republican of Brewster and now in his 20th year in the Legislature is being challenged by C William Rich the Putnam County Clerk Mr Rich who has Conservative party backing is charging Mr Stephens with being in the vanguard of runaway state spending and of being party to a state budget that contains fat Assemblyman Alexander Chananau a Bronx Democrat who is the ranking minority party member on the Ways and Means Committee is being challenged in the 82d Assembly District by three Democrats Mr Chananau who is seeking his 11th term in the Assembly is being challenged by Thomas P McElwain an assistant principal of a Roman Catholic school for voting in 1970 for the states liberalized abortion law and for voting this year against a repeal of that law The liberalized law permits elective abortions until the 24th week of pregnancy The Assemblymans other challengers Gilbert Goldman and Louis O Schwartz are attempting to siphon votes from Mr Chananau by criticizing his legislative record and by charging that he has done very little to curb the urban blight that is permeating his district Another Democrat in a leadership position with a challenger in the primary is the Assemblys deputy minority leader Albert H Blumenthal who is seeking a sixth term Woman Seeking Seat Mr Blumenthals opponent in the 69th Assembly District is Mrs Natalie Becker a 39yearold planner with the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons Mrs Becker has accused Mr Blumenthal of having betrayed reform principles and of putting personal political goals before the reeds of the West Side community he represents Mr Blumenthal a legislator regarded for his skills as a lawmaker by members of both parties in Albany is campaigning on his record and stressing that he is one of the few members of the minority who can push a bill through the Legislature He is regarded as a potential mayoral contender next year Another influential legislator with a primary battle is Senator Thomas Laverne Republican of Rochester and chairman of the Senate Education Committee one of the more important standing committees Mr Laverne is opposed by Gordon J DeHond a member of the Rochester school board who among other things is criticizing the Senator for sponsoring an alternative to nofault automobile insurance legislation that critics said was oriented toward preserving the present fault or tort system and thus was of little value to the consumer Assembly Speaker Perry B Duryea Republican of Montauk L I is one of the two leaders who managed to quash his opposition He was being challenged in his Suffolk County district by William R OLeary a oneissue candidate who opposed the Speaker for casting one of the decisive Assembly votes in 1970 in favor of the states liberalized abortion law Mr OLeary campaigned against Mr Duryea who is considered to be a leading Republican contender for Governor with the support of right to life groups seeking restoration of the states old abortion law which permitted abortions only when a mothers life was in jeopardy Supporters of Mr Duryea succeeded in having Mr OLeary removed from the ballot for filing an inadequate number of valid petitions Yesterday Mr OI earys appeal was rejected in State Supreme Court thus leaving Mr Duryea unopposed in the primary Other Primary Races The second instance involved Senate Minority Leader Joseph Zaretzki Democrat of Manhattan who was being challenged until recently by Assemblyman Stephen S Gottlieb However Mr Gottlieb withdrew from the race and shortly thereafter received a 31325ayear appointment from Governor Rockefeller to the State Liquor Authority The move was regarded by many politicians as a re ward from the Governor on behalf of Mr Zaretzki who has frequently been allied with him Other legislative primary races in New York City that have not attracted wide attention include these A contest in the 23d Senate District in Brooklyn between the incumbent Senator William J Giordano a regular Democrat and Miss Carol Bellamy who has the backing of reform Democratic groups The only woman in the city seeking a seat in the Senate where there are no women at present Miss Bellamy is supported by a variety of womens groups and is given an even chance of besting Mr Giordano In Corona Queens Mrs Lillian Manasseri one of those who fought the citys condem nation of 69 homes for a proposed high school is running in the Democratic primary against the incumbent Assemblyman Joseph F Lisa A race between Jerry Birbach president of the Forest Hills Residents Association and leader of the opposition to lowincome public housing in Forest Hills and the incumbent Democratic Senator Emanuel Gold A threeway Democratic primary in the 62d Assembly District in lower Manhattan in which former Patrolman John Bal and Stanley Chin lawyer are seeking to oust Assemblyman Louis F De Salvio who has completed 32 years in Albany A contest between Assemblyman Richard N Gottfried 25yearold law student completing his first term in the Legislature and Daniel Greer a 31yearold lawyer on Manhattans West Side There is also a fourway Democratic primary in the Ninth Senate District which in cludes part of Queens and part of Nassau County There is no incumbent in the district And there is a Republican and Democratic primary in the newly created 38th Senate District which takes in part of Rockland and Westchester Counties
They Joined Their Men in Canadian Exile,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/14/archives/they-joined-their-men-in-canadian-exile.html,MONTREALLike their husbands and boyfriends American women in exile here seem to be caught up in an emotional debate about whether they are copping out or being true to their principles by remaining in Canada Everybody thinks were just waiting up here with our track shoes on ready to run back But many of us dont ever want to go back Susan Lloyd wife of American draftdodger living in Montreal Canada is no paradise Im not happy here and dont intend to stay Rita Noguchi girlfriend of an American draftdodger There is one major difference of course The women do not need an amnesty bill passed by the United States Congress to travel south of the border They can come and go as they please and they do But the men as draft dodgers and deserters face sentences up to 10 years in prison and 10000 in fines if theyre caught in their native land Some women return to the United States shortly after they arrive here leaving behind them a broken marriage or relationship The first three months here are really traumatic for couples because of all the uncertainties said 25yearold wife of a draft dodger who has been in Montreal a year For those women who stay and qualify as landed immigrants legal resident aliens life is in some ways easier and in other ways more difficult than it is for their men American women generally have less trouble finding jobs especially as waitresses secretaries and domestic workers than their men do But the unpleasant side is the discrimination that many of the women say they feel in predominantly French Roman Catholic Quebec  an oppression they believe is greater than they encountered in the United States Problems of Women There are a lot of male chauvinist pigs on the street said Rita Noguchi not her real name a 22yearold biology student and underground abortion counselor abortion is illegal in Canada from Salt Lake City who came to Montreal two years ago with her boyfriend shortly after he got his draft notice In America the men just look but here they physically touch you which freaks me out Other women who were interviewed mentioned not being able to enter taverns in Montreal low salaries in comparison with those of men in the same jobs a feeling that they were nothing but chattel and the fact that until recently they couldnt sit on juries or sign themselves in or out of hospitals Miss Noguchi whose father is a JapaneseAmerican cook became active in the Montreal womens movement after undergoing an illegal abortion here last August She said she regarded her time in Canada as a vacation and that she especially missed being involved in the American antiwar movement I feel sort of like a copout here she said while her boyfriend Shem who collects 28 a week in welfare drank beer in a back room of their apartment with two vociferous French separatists There are no estimates as to how many American women have followed their men to Canada The number of male fugitives has been estimated at anywhere from 10000 to 100000 depending on whether youre talking to someone from the United States or Canadian Government they tend towards the low side or an antiwar group they tend towards the high side Most of the Americans are clustered in Montreal Toronto Ottawa and Vancouver The great majority of them are white Because of the troop withdrawals and a general slowing down of the Vietnam war the flow of young refugees to Canada has decreased considerably In 1969 about 20 draft dodgers and deserters a day sought refuge in Montreal according to Susan Lloyd 25 whose draftresisting husband Richard Gooding is a counselor at the American Refugee Service the only group presently working with American expatriates in Montreal Today she said the number has slowed to between 20 and 40 in a fourmonth period What were getting now is a lot more women said Miss Lloyd she uses her maiden name at the insistence of her husband while sitting in the office of the ARS hostel which provides food shelter clothing and counseling for newlyarrived young men and their families There are about 1 women to every man coming up here to immigrate Some she said were probably looking for husbands others for the promised land She estimated that the total number of Americans in selfexile and living in Montreal were 7000 men women and children Miss Lloyd who has long dark hair and wears fashionable granny glasses described herself as a typical Sally Sorority when she was a student at Purdue University After graduating in 1969 she left her home in Munster Ind and came east to teach history in Greenwich Conn where she met Mr Gooding who was then living under ground in New York City They eloped on June 23 1970 hid out for awhile in her parents summer cottage in Indiana and finally drove their Volkswagen crammed with their personal belongings to Montreal in August 1970 We just got tired of the constant fear of getting caught she said FBI men had been to visit our families and they told my father they could arrest him if they wanted to for aiding and abetting us The Goodings qualified as landed immigrants and Susan went to work as a dental assistant Now three months pregnant she recently quit her job to do volunteer work at the ARS hostel and to try to be admitted to a Montreal nursing school this fall Ill have my baby during the Christmas break she said crossing her fingers hopefully And since Canada has socialized medicine the only medical expense will be 8 a day for semiprivate room Its unbelievable isnt it Leaving the Door Open Unlike her husband Miss Lloyd has no plans to become a Canadian citizen As a landed immigrant she has all of the rights of a Canadian citizen except the vote and to travel with Canadian passport I know that Rich and I will never go back she said firmly but if something happens to Rich and I had kids Id like to know that I would be able to go back with them If I were Canadian citizen Id have to be put on the huge waiting list of Canadians waiting to get into the United States The couple lives on Mr Goodings 100aweek salary in his new job as director of Release a family counseling program in Montreal They live in a 6room 90amonth apartment in a pleasant residential area of the city and spend their free time taking Government sponsored French lessons attending movies rooting for the Montreal Canadiens hockey team and tossing a Frisbee in parks Those couples who plan to return to the United States tend to live around McGill University in midtown Montreal and spend their time with other Americans Those who plan to stay in Canada spread out all over the city according to Miss Lloyd learn French and make point of cultivating Canadian friends This is not always easy Many Canadians are hostile to American refugees because Americans are getting jobs or going on welfare at a time when unemployment has been running as high as 25 per cent in Quebec They also resent the fact that some of the Americans have gotten involved with the French Separatist movement while others have been arrested for drug violations robbery and shoplifting And of course many Canadian veterans of World War II view the draft dodgers and deserters as cowards Is living in exile a romantic experience a la Ernest Hemingway Three American women who were sitting around a table sipping coffee in a house on Montreals outskirts shook their heads vigorously Then Linda a 26yearold blonde woman from Pittsburgh and another who concealed her identity who moved into a commune with eight other people after she broke up with her boyfriend deserter from the Marine Corps said There is a certain kind of paranoid excitement at first There are so many uncertainties especially about whether you will get a job [After being jobless for 18 months she is now working as an aide in an afterschool program] But no it is not romantic The women laughed sarcastically when asked if they were homesick for anything in the United States The only thing I miss is Peter Pan Peanut Butter said Mrs David Gower 21 of Dayton Ohio who married her college sweetheart in 1970 to help him qualify as a landed immigrant in Montreal after his draft lottery number came up No 130 Now a student at Loyola of Montreal and a parttime clerktypist Kathy Gower has grown to regret her hasty marriage Its scary to have a husband she said tugging on her long brown hair Its such a responsibility In our situation its a case of two people liking each other more than they love each other The various amnesty proposals are much discussed among the women and those who want to return to the states with their men generally favor an unconditional amnesty Those who plan to stay in Canada tend to share the view of Mrs Hilari Anderson 25 of Levittown L I a University of Wisconsin graduate who is now working as 7000ayear librarian to support her husband Tim who fled the draft and is presently unemployed I think amnesty is a politically created thing she said Its sort of like the American politicians are mad because the brain drain went the other way and now they want the white educated middleclass kids to come home But the ones who really need amnestythe deserters who generally arent so welleducatedarent even being considered for it Dr Dana Burke 29 a physician who is doing research in immunology at McGill University is somewhat unusual among the wives She calls herself a secondtime refugee She fled her native Czechoslovakia in 1966 and the United States in 1969 with her draftresisting husband Dr Donald Burke now a resident in surgery at Jewish General Hospital here Both earn only half as much money as they did in the United States I want to go back [to New York] because he wants to go back the fine featured Woman said sitting in the couples apartment on St Louis Square But I would probably be just as happy if we stayed here I dont feel that much a part of either countryI think of myself more as an international person But even when a woman does pick one country over the other and becomes chauvinistic about it there really isnt that much noticeable difference in the daytoday living according to Susan Lloyd Bell runs our phone system too she said somewhat resignedly and Pepsi Cola and Coke are the top pop drinks here and IBM is big up here too So when you get right down to it things are really pretty much the same
Bank Expansion Upstate Is Scrutinized,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/15/archives/bank-expansion-upstate-is-scrutinized-upstate-banks-are-scrutinized.html,Harry W Albright Jr the newly appointed State Superintendent of Banks is determined to hold expansion upstate by the four largest retail banking concerns in New York City to a measured pace The four companiesFirst National City Corporation Chase Manhattan Corporation Manufacturers Hanover Corporation and the Chemical New York Corporation  in recent weeks have been announcing proposed upstate acquisitions at the rate of roughly one a week In a long interview the other day Mr Albright said that he was concerned lest the law permitting statewide branch banking which is not due to go into effect until January 1976 become the target of the sort of political backlash that hit the states liberalized abortion law this year The State Legislature passed a bill repealing the abortion statute but it was vetoed by Governor Rockefeller Mr Albright who was appointed to his post in late April following the Governors ouster of his predecessor William T Dentzer Jr argued in effect that if the major New York City banks moved too rapidly upstate this could lead to pressure to limit or repeal the planned expansion of blanch banking In his first address as bank ing chief Mr Albright is expected to tell the New York State Bankers Association today that the one policy I am willing and indeed anxious to make known  even at this early time in my new office is to create the regulatory climate which will permit us to preserve the integrity of the Bank Redistricting Act in its present form and as it now stands despite the problems that this transition period poses to all of us The State bankers group is holding its annual convention today and tomorrow at the Hotel Monmouth in Spring Lake N1 A portion of Mr Albrights prepared remarks was obtained from a banking source Mr Albrights views as expressed up until now do not represent a significant departure from those of Mr Dentzer The first real test of the presence or absence of differences between the two bankers said yesterday would come when Mr Albright ruled on requests for reconsideration of three bank acquisitions that Mr Dentzer denied  involving banks in Nanuet Montgomery and Chester NY The Charter New York Corporation is seeking to acquire the former bank and the Bankers Trust New York Corporation the latter two Mr Albrights views were considered significant by bankers who were queried yesterday in part because of the circumstances that surrounded his coming to office Governor Rockefeller is reliably reported to have asked for Mr Dentzers resignation because of complaints that the former banking supervisor had been too restrictive in limiting the expansion of certain upstatebased bankholding companies notably Lincoln First Banks Inc The new banking superintendents views showed clearly in two decisions that he handed down last week In one case in which he approved the application of the First National City Corporation to acquire the tiny National Exchange Bank of Castleton onHudson Mr Albright obtained from Citicorp that it would open no more than one new branch for this bank prior to July 1973 and thereafter no more than two branches per year until July 1973 and then not more than one additional branch until January 1976 when unlimited statewide branching will go into effect Mr Denzters policy had been to allow up to three new branches a year for newlyacI quired bankholding company units such as this Acquisition Condition The new Citicorp subsidiary assuming its acquisition is approved by the Federal Reserve and not challenged by the Justice Department is to be a national bank and thus outside the normal jurisdiction of the state But by making the agree ment on branching a condition of the acquisition Mr Albright was able to influence its future behavior By contrast In tree other decision  which approved the acquisition of the Highland National Bank of Newburgh N Y by the United Bank Corporation of New York a mediumsized Albanybased holding company Mr Albright imposed no re strictions on future branching and indicated that none would be required In his First National City decision after noting the large number of branches that the big New York City banking companies could theoretically open by 1976 Mr Albright said the same restrictions should be applied to future acquisitions by the largest banking companies in the upstate markets Holding the rate of new branches down to no more than two per year  which is the same as the statutory standard that would apply should these holding companies seek to charter new banks rather than acquire existing ones  Mr Albright said would provide for systematic and orderly transition in the banking structures

sizable blocs of delegates at Democratic conventions in four mountain states and in Connecticut North Dakota and Puerto Rico this weekend Experienced Democratic professionals at the conventions and in Washington though still perturbed by Mr McGoverns economic proposals which some of them consider radical and illconceived were prepared to concede him the partys Presidential nomination Some aides to Senators Edmund S Muskie of Maine and Hubert H Humphrey of Minnesota while maintaining publicly that they still expected the South Dakotan to fall short said privately that the two were remaining in the race mainly in the hope of persuading Mr McGovern to moderate some of his positions and thus foster party unity Mr McGovern moved his delegatevote total to 109155 at the seven weekend meetings The mountain states where he scored successes were Colorado Montana Utah and Idaho More Votes Coming In tomorrows New York primary Mr McGovern is expected to gain at least 200 of the 248 delegates to he elected Next weekend he is expected to gain 24 more votes among the 30 to be allotted by the New York State Democratic Committee two more when Nebraska chooses its national committee members and eight at the Delaware convention Some new commitments  formerly uncommitted delegates and from supporters of Mr Muskie are expected after New York balloting But even without those Mr McGovern should have 1325 votes184 short of the 1509 needed for nominationwhen the long and complex delegate selection process ends on Saturday The McGovern staff has identified 165 delegates whose votes they expect to win before the Democratic convention opens in Miami Beach on July 10 three weeks from today Only a failure of monumental proportions in New York is likely to prevent them from apthat With 324 delegates still to be selected the latest New York Times tabulation shows the following totals of committed delegate votes  The tabulation includes changes in the Louisiana delegation which was repollea last week as well as a number of other changes including the switch of two Muskie delegates to Mr McGovern The delegates were Mrs Dagrnar Vidal the national committeewoman from Iowa and Thomas Cassidy 39yearold lawyer from Peoria Ill At the Colorado convention in the Currigan Exhibition Hall in Denver the McGovern forces clearly had their eyes more on November than July Having won 17 of the states 27 district delegates they were in a position to choose allnine atlarge delegates Gary Hart Mr McGoverns national campaign manager who is from Denver told a McGovern caucus We can use all the delegates we can get but its your decision Hoping to keep the good will of supporters of other candidates for the general election the McGovern backers took only seven atlarge seats and allotted one to Mr Humphrey and one to an uncommitted group Statewide Mr McGovern won 24 delegates Mr Humphrey six and Mrs Chisholm of Brooklyn one with five uncommitted but leaning to Mr Muskie or Mr Humphrey Montana Democrats meeting in Helena chose 20 delegates with 17 votes145 for Mr McGovern and 25 uncommitted The McGovern forces agreed to let one of their delegates Mrs Geraldine Travis of Great Falls vote for Mrs Chisholm on the first ballot if they did not need her vote Senator Lee Metcalf a Muskie supporter was unable to win election as a delegate He will go to Miami Beach as an alternate instead In Utah Mr McGovern won 11 of 19 delegates the eight remaining were undecided Gov Calvin L Hampton and Senator Frank E Moss both Muskie supporters are among the technically uncommitted of the others two are believed to leah to Mr McGovern and four are genuinely undecided The convention held in Salt Lake City produced one extremely close race Charles Nabors Jr an associate professor at the University of Utah who headed the Mc Govern effort in the state lost by seven votes to an uncommitted delegate A recount is scheduled this week Following the proportional division of local caucuses on April 17 Idaho Democrats meeting at Sun Valley gave seven votes to Mr McGovern three to Mr Muskie two to Mrs Chisholm and one to Mr Humphrey four are uncommitted With the help of Senator Frank Church McGovern tacticians hope to win over two or three of the undecided votes Trouble in North Dakota In North Dakota Mr McGovern fared less well than expected Democratic leaders there felt that the delegates who met at Fargo were frightened by the platform approved last weekend in neighboring Minnesota which contained planks calling for liberalized abortion laws immediate amnesty for deserters and full tights for homosexuals Mr McGoverns chances suffered as a consequence Mr McGovern who had exIpected to win 10 votes won 77 42 went to Mr Humphrey and 21 stayed uncommitted In Connecticut Mr McGovem appeared to emerge from the state convention at Hartford with 22 solid votes The rest were split among Mr Muskie with five Mr Humphrey with one Mr Mills with one and an uncomitted block led by John M Bailey the party chairman with 22 We have reasonably firm commitments from five other people a McGovern source said and if John comes along in Miami Beach which I think he will we should get something like 40 of the 51 votes on the first ballot Puerto Ricos convention allotted the commonwealths seven votes as follows Mr McGovern five Mr Humphrey 05 and

The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/25/archives/they-came-a-long-way-tuesday-n-y-primary.html,Women got the vote in 1920 but they have got little in politics since They have been the gofers the stamp smashers and the matronly party co leaders or vicechairmen who were strictly window dressing to be intro duced at party functions as the real boss with appropriate snickers from the real boss and the audience But times are changing That was evident in last weeks New York Democratic primary re turns Some cases in point Thirtyyearold Elizabeth Holtzman toppled one of the giants of New York and national politics Repre sentative Emanuel Celler the 84year old chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Family Court Judge Nanette Dem bitz handily won an uphill battle for one of three Democratic nominations for the State Court of Appeals the states highest court She was the first woman nominated by a major party for the court Two other women also pulled up sets to win State Senate nominations and very likely election in November to that male bastion which hasnt had a woman member since 1965 when Constance B Motley now a Federal District judge left the Senate after her election as Manhattan Borough President True it was not all roses for wo mens lib Tuesday Representative Bella S Abzug was resoundingly de feated by a 21 margin by Repre sentative William F Ryan She chalked up her defeat to what she called the false issue that she should have run against someone other than the ultraliberal Mr Ryan There were of course some primary contests in the city that were strictly male Congressman Jonathan Bingham was pitted against his old friend and fellow liberal Congressman James Scheuer in the Bronx a race that re sulted from some judicious redistrict ing by the Republicancontrolled State Legislature Mr Bingham emerged the winner by about 4000 votes out of the 44500 cast And in Brooklyn 68 yearold 15term Congressman John Rooney one of the conservative Dem ocratic powers in the House of Repre sentatives faced his stiffest challenge from liberal Allard Lowenstein the man who started the Dump Johnson move in 1968 and whose youthful and enthusiastic supporters swarmed through the area When all the votes were counted Mr Rooney won by just over 1000 votes out of the 28500 cast But Mr Lowenstein charging that there were rampant irregularities at the polling places and that its clear on the face of it that the election was stolen was considering two possible courses to challenge the results and or to run in the fall against Mr Roo ney as the Liberal candidatehe al ready has that partys nomination There were also no cries of male chauvinism from three other notable female losers last Tuesday Repre sentative Shirley Chisholm and two militant feminists who were delegate candidates pledged to her Presiden tial candidacy Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan were buried in the George McGovern landslide just like a lot of other candidates male and female Many politicians agreed that the very fact that Mrs Chisholm could get this far with her miniPresidential candidacy and that about half the delegates elected Tuesday were wo men is a big plus for the feminine mystique in politics But the biggest plus was Miss Holtz man Two years ago she had won as a reform candidate for district leader in Flatbush Now she has won na tional attention by defeatingby 562 votes out of 35000 votesone of the most powerful men in Congress a politician whose name was practically synonymous with civil rights legisla tion in the turbulent 50s and 60s and a man who was already 54 when she was born She had run a classic grass roots campaign pounding the pavements the subway stairs and the shopping centers attacking Mr Celler for not even having an office in his district and for mixing his law business with government business Womans lib was only a peripheral issue although Miss Holtzman attacked her opponent for opposing the equal rights for women constitutional amendment The venerable Mr Celler also ran a classic campaign of sortsclassic for losers He brushed off his op ponent obviously didnt take her very seriously and went on with business as usual Even after he lost he talked about continuing the fightpossibly by appealing the primary results or by running as the Liberal party nom inee in November But in that over whemingly Democratic district vot ers generally act like other party levers have germs so running as a Liberal does not represent a very promising course for Mr Celler Miss Holtzmans election would maintain the presont complement of two women in the 39member New York delegation to Congress Mrs Chisholm a realist about her Presi dential candidacy didnt burn any bridges behind her She was renomi nated for Congress in her Bedford Stuyvesant district at the same time that she was winning only four of the states 278 Democratic Presidential delegates also in her district Less certain is the ultimate fate of 58yearold Judge Dembitz who with out Liberal endorsement faces a stiff fight along with two other Democratic Court of Appeals nominees Supreme Court Justice Bernard Meyer of Nas sau and Appellate Division Justice Lawrence Cooke of Monticello against a three man Republican slate But she won a stiff fight Tuesday largely with a newspaper and radio advertis ing campaign that emphasized the endorsement of her reform candidacy by scores of top Democrats Mean while her male rivals in the fourway race for three nominations were re lying largely on the regular Demo cratic organization vote which be comes more of a myth every primary The regulars in Brooklyn and Queens also took it on the chin from two other women both lawyers Karen S Burstein 29 running in the Ninth Senatorial district which straddles the NasauQueens boundary took ad vantage of a split among Queens Dem ocrats to win handily There had been no incumbent in the newly reappor tioned district In Brooklyn 30year old Carol Bellamy narrowly defeated State Senator William Giordano a conservative and opponent of legalized abortion in a district which became more liberal with reapportionment Both women are favored to win in November Still another woman As semblywoman Mary Ann Krupsak of Amsterdam who is running for the State Senate in central New York has a fair chance of joining them in the chamber The message of the primary wont be lost on slatemakers in next years mayoral contest and the gubernatorial fray the following year One woman Bess Meyerson the citys Consumer Affairs commissioner is already running most

Legislative Notes: No‐Fault Coverage Begins at End of Year,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/25/archives/legislative-notes-nofault-coverage-begins-at-end-of-year.html,TRENTONBeginning Jan 1 any New Jersey motor ist injured in an automobile accident will be guaranteed unlimited reimbursement for medical expenses no matter who caused the accident Drivers can also count on payments of up to 100 a week for a year as a sub stitute for loss of earnings and up to 12 a day for necessary domestic services And should the motorist die the survivors will get 1000 for  expenses All this at a guaranteed cut in premiums of 15 per cent These are the chief fea tures of the nofault insur ance bill signed by Governor  last week It is a compromise law designed to placate trial lawyers who feared a nofault system would cut deeply in to their main source of fees and the insurance companies and citizens groups who wanted a law that would go further toward cutting in surance costs The new insurance will be mandatory and no one will be permitted to drive with out it thus guaranteeing all motorists protection against the cost of injuries requir ing expensive treatment or  convalescence Of the 4 million motor vehicles registered in New Jersey 400000 now lack in surance Insured motorists can now purchase protection against uninsured drivers for 5 a year The uninsured drivers pay 50 a year into a state Unsatisfied Claims and Judgment Fund out of which victims of accidents caused by uninsured vehicles receive compensation In 1971 the fund paid out a total of 6million to vic tims of uninsured vehicles With adoption of the nofault law such a payment is ex pected to be cut in half pre sumably to cover uninsured outofstae cars However since the drivers of the currently uninsured vehicles are considered bad insurance risks the laws requirement that they obtain insurance is expected in fu tore years to generally in crease insurance rates Under the nofault law in return for the new protection motorists will give up their right to sue for painand suffering damages if their medical bills are less than 200 or if their injuries are in the category of sprains bruises cuts and muscle tears State Insurance Depart ment executives estimate that the program will re duce pain  and  suffering claims by almost 70 per cent If all goes well they say motorists could wind up with premium reductions as high as 21 per cent some of which may be offset by ris ins rates New Jersey is the seventh state to enact nofault But only Massachusetts Florida and Connecticut along with New Jersey  limits on painandsuffering recovery The issue of painand suffering claims is the center of a legislative controversy and the fierce lobbying that ensued in Trenton while the bill was before the Legisla ture The lawyers lobby fought relentlessly to prevent the insurance companies from persuading the Legislature to ban painandsuffering claims if medical bills were less than 500 Mr Cahills interest cutting clown auto insurance costs goes back to his days in Con gress where he was known as something of an expert on the subject In signing the bill he said This law is a social neces sity We can no longer op erate without protection from catastrophic injury This is a major bill and a great accomplishment The Governor said that despite the creation of more judgeships and the construc tion of more courtrooms dur ing his administration court calendars were increasingly jammed by the flow of minor negligence cases involving claims of under 3000 Legislative leaders sympa thetic to Governor Cahills ambitious taxreform pro gram are quick to admit they have all the controversy they need right now What they do not need they say is any more bills that might tend to inflame the passions of their col leagues So two bills designed to do precisely that have emerged from committee One would ban abortions except where the mothers life was endangered The other would permit public employes to strike The strike bill was released after hundreds of public school teachers demon strated in front of the State House and then jammed cor ridors buttonholing every legislator within earshot The powerful teacher or ganizations are determined to bring the bill to a vote dur ing the special session but Speaker Thomas H Kean Republican of Livingston who alone has the power to put the bill up for a vote says he will resist the pres sure in the interests of focus ing on the tax package Several teachers have been sentenced to jail terms as a result of the leading roles they have played in strikes New Jerseys ancient abor tion law has been struck down by a Federal court which found it vague to the point of meaninglessness As a result there is no law on the books now spe cifically dealing with abor tion The strike bill would per mit legal walkouts as long as the courts fail to define the strike as a clear and present danger to public health and safety Also the employes would have to es tablish that they made a genuine attempt at mediation Richard W DeKorte of Franklin Lakes the Republi can leader in the Assembly has come up with a novel way to break the kind of deadlock that tied up the lower house for weeks at the beginning of this session He has suggested that the next time neither party has sufficient votes to organize one or the other houses of the Legislature that the party polling the highest number of votes in the pre ceding legislative election be given authority to organize There was one small flaw in Mr DeKortes reasoning the Democrats polled more votes than the Republicans in 1971
Court Bars Trial of Army Over Civilian Surveillance,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/27/archives/court-bars-trial-of-army-over-civilian-surveillance-court-bars.html,WASHINGTON June 26  The Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 today that the courts would not consider the constitutional ity of the Armys surveillance of civilian political activities in suits contending that military surveillance was discouraging criticism of the Government The control of such surveil lance must be left to Congress and the executive branch the majority held unless individ uals can show that they have been harmed in some specific objective way by having been watched by Army agents The decision prompted an un usual effort to disqualify a Su preme Court Justice Aryeh Neier executive direc tor of the American Civil Lib erties Union which represented the plaintiffs who had sought to challenge the Armys surveil lance announced that the ACLU would seek a rehear ing Mr Neier said that his or ganization would assert that Justice William H Rehnquist should be disqualified from the case because he appeared as an advocate for the Justice De partment when he testified as an Assistant Attorney General before a Senate subcommittee on the issue of Army surveil lance Justice Rehnquist voted for the Government today Without him the court would have split 4 to 4 thus letting stand a lower courts decision that the Army must stand trial on the charges that its surveil lance was dampening public political expression Today the majority dismissed the suit declaring that the creation of such general sub jective fears in the population did not create a controversy that could be litigated in court It said that this was especially so in cases brought by political activitist whose very litigation showed that they were not chilled The decision was by an in creasingly familiar Nixon maj ority of President Nixons four appointees plus Justice Byron R White It aborted a judicial inquiry of the Armys activities that had been ordered by a lower court The majority ouinion by Chief Justice Warren E Burger said that to permit such a trial would make Federal courts vir tually continuing monitors of the widsom and soundness of executive action The Court disposed of all but 14 of its remaining cases today and a final decision session was scheduled for Thursday morn ing After that the Court will adjourn until Oct 2 Abortion Test Put Off An expected major decision on the constitutionality of anti abortion laws was put off until the next term of Court Before the Court got its full comple ment of nine members it had heard arguments on cases alleging that two typical anti abortion statutesin Texas and Georgiaviolated the rights of women to control their repro ductive processes and of physi cians to practice their profes sion freely By holding reargu ments the full Court can de cide these cases The court also ordered re arguments in three obscenity cases and agreed to review three more The move will give the conservative Nixon Court an opportunity for a broad review of the permissive obscenity rulings of the Warren Court As a result of these rulings the police were generally for bidden to suppress sexually ex plicit material as long as it was made available only to adults who wished to see it Now the Supreme Court will decide if this national standard should be abandoned to permit each locality to enforce its own standard if the Federal laws against shipping and importing pornography should be applied to persons who want material for their own use and if the Constitution permits commer cial movie theaters and adult bookstores to offer sexually oriented material as long as juveniles are barred In other rulings today the Court did the following It held without dissent that a statesupported college may not deny official recognition to students who wish to form a chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society merely be cause the universitys president finds the radical SDS philos ophy abhorrent and fears that the local chapter will foment disorder The opinion by Justice Lewis F Powell Jr said that F Don James the president of Central Connecticut State College in New Britain Conn had violat ed the students First Amend ment rights of free expression when he banned the chapter because of the philosophy and disruptive history of the na tional group Justice Powell said that the lower court could order the college to recognize the chapter if its members would pledge to obey reason able campus rules It unanimously declared un constitional city ordinances of Chicago and Rockford Ill that banned all picketing within 150 feet of a public school except for picketing in a labor dispute The laws had been invoked to demonstrations by antisegrega gation protesters Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote the courts opinion which held that such laws discriminate uncon stitutionally between those who wish to protest labor conditions and those who want to demon strate about other issues It ruled 5 to 4 with all four Nixon appointees dissenting that witnesses cannot be com pelled to testify before a Fed eral grand jury until the Gov ernment shows that they were riot called as a result of in formation overheard on illegal listening devices The decision was based upon a provision of the 1968 Federal law that gave law enforcement officials the authority to wiretap with court permission The law also pro vided that no illegally obtained information or information de veloped from it could be re ceived in evidence before a grand jury The opinion by Justice Wil liam J Brennan Jr sustained a lower courts reversal of civil contempt convictions of Sister Jogues Egan and a former nun Anne Walsh who refused to testify before a grand jury in vestigating the alleged plot to kidnap Henry A Kissinger President Nixons national se curity adviser The Government argued that such a ruling would bog down grand jury in quiries by requiring tedious searching through wiretap transcripts before questioning could begin It declined to consider dis missal of charges against Anthony J Russo Jr codefend ant with Dr Daniel Ellsberg in the forthcoming conspiracy trial for alleged theft and disclosure of the classified Pentagon papers The Court acted in a brief order without giving an opinion The Army surveillance case followed revelations that some 1000 Army intelligence agents in 300 offices across the coun try had kept tabs on such di verse civilian activities as civil rights community action church and Earth Day Army officials explained that the surveillance had begun after the Army had been called in to help deal with urban un rest and officers decided that it was necessary to compile files of potential trouble  makers Under Congressional pressure the Army announced that had stopped its surveillance of purely civilian matters and had destroyed many of its dossiers on civilians Injunction Sought by 13 The Armys announcement was challenged as insufficient in the ACLU suit filed by Arlo Tatum executive director of the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors and 12 other individuals and groups who said they were targets of the Armys surveillance They sought an injunction to prevent further surveillance and to re quire the destruction of all of the dossiers which were said to have been stored in com puters A Federal District judge threw out the suit on the ground that no real harm to the plaintiffs had been alleged The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia overturned this decision and ordered a trial to determine if the Armys surveillance had violated the First Amendment by cowing some people into not criticising the Government Today the majority opinion took a narrow view of some re cent Supreme Court decisions that had given citizens wide standing to challenge Govern ment actions in court Chief Justice Burger held that no case or controversy was raised for a court to decide when plaintiffs alleged only that governmental policies threatened subjectively to af fect them or others Senator Sam J Ervin Jr of North Carolina who argued as a friend of the court on behalf of Mr Tatum chaired a sub committee hearing on March 9 1971 in which Mr Rehnquist mentioned the Tatum suit Mr Rehnquist implied that it had little merit and said specifically that the Army surveillance while unwise did not raise First Amendment problems Asked today to comment on Justice Rehnquists participa tion in the decision Senator Ervin said the temptation to do so is strong but that throughout his public carrer I have refrained from comment ing on anybody personally To win a rehearing the CLU would need a majority vote This would apparently re quire the concurrence of the four dissenters todayJustices William O Douglas William J Brennan Jr Potter Stewart and Thurgood Marshall  plus one of the members of the majority Chief Justice Burger or Jus tices Harry A Blackmun White or Powell Solicitor General Erwin N

Committee of the Demo cratic National Convention ap proved today an education plank that calls for continued use of busing to achieve school desegregation It also tentatively approved a foreign policy plank that says that if the Democratic nominee wins the Presidency his first or der of business after inaugura tion should be the immediate and complete withdrawal of all US forces in Indochina Mean time the party would support the drive by some Democratic Senators calling for withdrawal by Oct 1 The busing and Vietnam pro posals had the approval of rep resentatives of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota who is now widely expected to be the partys Presidential can didate Todays action assures that both issues will go to the floor of the convention which opens in Miami Beach July 10 Mem bers committed to Gov George C Wallace of Alabama joined by a sprinkling of other dele gates served notice that they would file minority reports A Wallace proposal opposing forced busing was defeated today 78 to 16 The members then voted 70 to 27 for the statement sup porting busing as one tool for achieving desegregation in areas where segregation has been legally imposed In another action the com mittee voted to make it party policy to deconcentrate shared monopolies such as auto steel and  industries which ad minister prices create unem ployment through restricted output and stifle technological innovation The vote was 57 to 36 The target of the provi sion was such corporations as General Motors and the Ford Motor Company Otherwise the 150member committee followed in most re

Mc Govern Extremes Rejected The most extreme proposals both from the Wallace members on the right and some Mc Govern members on the left were rejected The bulk of the McGovern members supported the moderate approach in an ef fort not to alienate the more traditional elements of the party One of the bitterest fights of the day concerned the nations military posture A compromise was finally reached that gave the forces of Senators McGov ern and Edmund S Muskie a pledge of reduced military budgets based on our present needs and commitments not past practices or force levels but mentioning no specific fig ures while forces of Governor Wallace Senators Hubert H Humphrey and Henry M Jack son won this sentence We propose a program of national defense which is both prudent and responsible which will retain the confidence of our allies and will be a deter rent to potential aggressors The committee was hammer ing out the platform in a crowd ed steamy ballroom of the May flower Hotel beginning at 9 AM and continuing into the night It was scheduled to com plete the document and receive all minority reports by tomor row night Several controversial pro posals gained approval includ ing recommendations for abo lition of the Electoral College and popular election of the President for ending the senior ity system in Congress and for public financing of election campaigns The

schoolchildren on the basis of their race and that sep arate but equal has no place in our public education system Eighteen years later the provi sion of integration is not a re ality We support the goal of de segregation as a means to achieve equal access to quality education for all our children There are many ways to deseg regate schools School attend ance lines may be withdrawn schools may be paired larger physical facilities may be built to serve larger more diverse enrollments magnet schools or educational parks may be used Transportation of students is another tool to accomplish de segregation It must continue to be available according to Su preme Court decisions to elim inate legally imposed segrega tion and improve the quality of education for all children It is considered likely that the Democratic nominee will have to run on that plank while the Republican platform is almost certain to contain a provision reflecting President Nixons opposition to busing to achieve desegregation Compromise Fails The approved language pre vailed over a similar but more equivocating compromise reached yesterday in the draft ing subcommittee That version contained this statement Quality education is the is suebusing is not Transporta tion of students is one of many tools available to achieve qual ity education Where it serves that goal we endorse it where it does not serve that goal we do not The Wallace resolution of fered by Fred Folsom of Ala bama calls for quality educa tion regardless of race but says that busing for desegregation should not be ordered over the objection of parents Several attempts by Wallace delegates and others to weak en the Vietnam proposal were beaten down The language says that any resolution of the war must include the return of all prisoners held by North Vietnam and other adversary forces and adds The majority of the Demo cratic Senators have called for full U S withdrawal by Oct 1 1972 We support that position If the war is not end ed before the next Democratic Administration takes office we pledge as the first order of business an immediate and complete withdrawal of all US forces in Indochina All U S military action in South east Asia will cease After the end of U S direct combat par ticipation military aid to the Saigon Government and else where in Indochina will be ter minated The U S will no longer seek to determine the political future of the nations of Indo china The issue is not whether we will depose the present Government rather when we will cease insisting it must be core of any political settle ment We will do what we can to foster an agreement on an acceptable political solution but we recognize that there are sharp limits to our ability to influence this process and to the importance of the outcome to our interest McGovern Aides Relieved Senator McGoverns aides were relieved at the outcome of todays action Last night a number of the McGovern delegates were grumbling that the emerging platform was not specific enough on the issues the Senator had enunciated in his campaign and did not con tain strong enough language on such things as the environ ment trusts taxes and wel fare But today many of them yielded to compromises that fell considerably short of a radical platform The commit tee defeated for example a proposal to offer a guaranteed income of 6500 for a family of four rather than about 3900 as offered by the draft ing committee After several warnings from the floor that we must not give the nominee a platform that will defeat him the most stringent popular stances such as one calling for the breaking up of the International Tele phone and Telegraph Corpora tion and other conglomerates were defeated Also beaten was an effort to write in a specific tax reform plan that went a long way toward redistribution of the wealth The atmosphere was one of considerable confusion and great divisions but the spirit with Mayor Kenneth A Gibson of Newark presiding in a folksy manner was one of at tempted compromise Some minor language on economics and labor unions offered by the Wallace dele gates found its way into the platform But on the large is sues the Wallace members were defeated repeatedly and prom ised to take their case to Miami Beach In another development the feminists Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem along with some other leaders of the Na tional Womens Political Cau cus denounced Senator Mc Govern for his refusal at a meeting with them yesterday to endorse a platform plank ad vocating repeal of all laws re stricting abortion At a news conference called by the caucus Mrs Friedan said that women may sit on their hands and not work in the Presidential campaign if Senator McGovern did not show more responsiveness to issues of interest to women

Democrats Assured Of a Platform Fight,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/28/archives/democrats-assured-of-a-platform-fight-democrats-assured-of-floor.html,WASHINGTON June 27A platform acceptable to Senator George McGovern and his two chief rivals for the Democratic Presidential nomination Senators Hubert H Humphrey and Edmund S Muskie was completed today for presentation to the partys national convention July 10 At the same time however a number of minority reports were filed with the Platform Committee assuring that the most controversial issues will be fought out on the floor of the convention in Miami Beach These issues include busing Vietnam tax reform abortion rights for homosexuals prayer in schools aid to Israel welfare and gun controls Members committed to Gov George C Wallace of Alabama will attempt to rewrite much of the document at the convention and a number of delegates on the left pledged to Senator McGovern will try to write in specific language rejected by the committee as divisive for the party The platform which serves as both a grab bag of proposals and a vehicle for Populist rhetoric was hammered out in five days of intense day and night sessions in which those who preferred a liberal but generally worded document prevailed It is a responsible liberal platform not an extreme one said Robert Nathan who was Senator Humphreys representative to the 150member committee The platform follows rather closely the stand of Senator McGovern on ending the Vietnam war on amnesty for men refusing to fight in that war and on busing to achieve school desegregation It also reflects his views on tax reform cuts in military spending and welfare reform but would not tie him down to specific figures Dakotan Sees a New Center I think it is going to be a splendid document Senator McGovern said at a news conference in San Antonio Tex this morning as the committee was completing its work Its a very forwardlooking platform The South Dakotan said the fact that the main provisions of the platform were so broadly supported within the committee indicated to him that there is a new center of the political spectrum to which the party should appeal in November Between midnight and 330 AM today the committee meeting in a ballroom of the Mayflower Hotel voted after long and heated debate against including proposals for legalized abortion and for protection of homosexuals in job opportunities and from harassment and arrest All evening long tension had mounted as the members anticipated a fight on the two issues with no one knowing how it would end Finally Flora Crater of Virginia offered a proposal that there should be no government interference with a womans right to control her reproductive life Shirley MacLeine the actress who is a McGovern supporter offered a substitute expressing the belief that a womans reproductive life was a matter between her and her doctor and anyone else she wished to consult but that the issue should not be subjected to the distortions that would occur in a Presidential campaign The MacLaine provision had the approval of Senator McGovern but there were fears that it too would be interpreted as proabortion We cant be known as the abortion party said William Coleman of West Virginia an official of the United Steelworkers of America who is committed to Mr Humphrey Cries arose from the floor that we are about to alienate 20 million Catholic votes as a large portion of the members lined up at the microphones to testify The MacLeine proposal carried by a show of hands but then was defeated 59 to 41 on a rollcall Mrs Craters stronger proposal was then defeated by a show of hands The sighs of relief were hardly over when the gay liberation plank hit the floor It too was opposed as spelling certain defeat for a Democratic candidate It was defeated 54 to 34 Later in the day after a few hours sleep the committee met anew and received 20 minority reports all of which were given the 10 per cent approval of the committee membership necessary to take them to the floor in Miami Beach The Wallace members filed minority reports that oppose busing for desegregation call for a constitutional amendment permitting prayer in schools support the rights of citizens to bear arms defend capital punishment oppose bureaucratic price controls and soften the section of the platform that calls for immediate withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam There were other minority reports against busing calling for more military assistance to Israel proposing a 6500 minimum in welfare payments writing in the abortion and gay liberation proposals defeated in the committee and on other matters Drafted by Subcommittee After voting not to strike Lyndon B Johnson from a list of distinguished Presidents in the preambleHe sent 500000 troops to Vietnam was the cry from some members the committee ended its work in a spirit of amity at 244 PM Mrs Annie L Gunter of Alabama a Wallace delegate heaped praise upon and pinned a Wallace button on Mayor Kenneth A Gibson of Newark who had presided for 20 hours without once losing his temper It was the first time anyone could remember that a national party platform had been written through participatory democracy In the past it was done largely through political leaders The participants were mostly littleknown people new to national politics One man wore a button proclaiming I am a Grass Root Participants included such newcomers as Jennifer Wilke of Alaska a tall young girl who said she was elected by youths and Eskimos The basic document which runs scores of pages was drafted by a 15member subcommittee with the assistance of representatives of the candidates and study groups set up within the committee It was heavily amended from the floor so that no one was sure precisely what the final version would contain It is being assembled and printed for distribution at the end of the week to all delegates to the convention along with texts of the minority reports Some of the more important provisions not previously disclosed include the following To those who for reasons of conscience refused to serve in this war and were prosecuted or sought refuge abroad we state our firm intention to declare an amnesty on an appropriate basis when the fighting has ceased and our troops and prisoners have returned We urge abolition of the draft Reduce US troop levels in Europe in close consultation with our Allies as part of a program to adjust the North Atlantic Treaty Organization American support for the repressive Greek military government must cease Public service employment must be examined to make the Government the employer of last resort and guarantee a job for all The Democratic party commits itself to make the Social Security tax progressive by raising substantially the ceiling on earned income To permit needed increases in social security benefits we will use general revenues as necessary to supplement payroll tax receipts To reduce the local property tax for all American families we support equalization of school spending and substantial increases in the Federal share of education costs and general revenue sharing The Nixon policy of intimidation of the media and Administration efforts to use Government power to block access to media by dissenters must end if free speech is to he preserved The Federal Government should establish a child advocacy agency to protect the rights of children Channel financial aid by a constitutional formula to children in nonpublic schools The block grant system of the Federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration which has produced ineffectiveness waste and corruption should be eliminated and funds should go directly to police departments and other agencies committed to change and improvement The document says that the Farm Act of 1970 should be replaced with one that includes loans and payments to farmers and effective supply management to raise family farm income to 100 per cent of parity It also says that the value added tax a national sales tax under consideration by the Nixon Administration should be opposed
Antiabortion Forces Demonstrate a Growing Influence in State Legislatures Across the Country,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/28/archives/antiabortion-forces-demonstrate-a-growing-influence-in-state.html,WASHINGTON June 27  Forces fighting the trend toward more liberal abortion laws which some states began implementing about five years ago are demonstrating a growing influence on state legislatures across the country In some states including California Florida Colorado and Hawaii antiabortion activity is aimed at rolling back liberalized laws already on the books In New York State the Legislatures repeal of the states twoyearold abortion lawallowing abortion on demand until the 24th week of pregnancywas vetoed last month by Governor Rockefeller who contended that the repeal was unjustified In other states including Connecticut Iowa Illinois Michigan Massachusetts and Pennsylvania the goal is to prevent liberal abortion bills from being passed A check in the capitals of these states indicates that in both cases pressure from a number of organized effortsparticularly a confederation of local committees called Right to Lifeare being felt and acknowledged by state officials Too Far Afield Complaints have been heard in Sacramento Calif for example that the antiabortion forces are going too far afield to the extent of opposing any type of birth control legislation One member of a committee considering a bill to stimulate distribution of birth control information said It sounds like a good bill but why have I gotten 3000 letters against it The National Right to Life Committee just ended its third annual convention in Philadelphia with a unanimous resolution in support of President Nixons public opposition to permissive abortion laws Michael Taylor the groups executive secretary said in an interview that groups were being set up to lobby with members of the Democratic partys Platform Committee to forestall any possible attempt by liberals to draft a proabortion plank in the partys 1972 platform The organization which Mr Taylor said had a chapter in nearly every state started around 1967 but really got going in 1969 when the proabortionists started their push for abortionondemand Earlier this month Mrs Sergeant Shriver addressed the national convention of BirthrightUSA in Atlantic City Founded in 1968 Birthright operates urban counseling centers where pregnant women are encouraged to shun abortion and have their babies A National Campaign Disputing that there is such a thing as an unwanted baby Mrs Shriver proposed a national campaign to be called One Million for Life for a million couples who want to adopt an infant to register with Birthright For every woman who is considering having an abortion Mrs Shriver told the delegates there is at least one family and probably many more who would be eager to adopt a baby and give it the chance to develop a life of grace and physical and emotional perfection Most of the antiabortion groups are grass roots organizations as described by an attorney representing them in one state and were formed in reaction to the move toward more liberal policies on abortion Legislators interviewed in the survey who had helped to loosen the laws in several states remarked that if the organizations had existed at the time with the strength they now demonstrate the measure probably would not have passed Membership tends to be heavily Roman Catholic along with some conservative elements of Protestants and Jews In California for example Catholics are the strongest single force reported a spokesman for Assemblyman Robert H Burke a Republican who has introduced a number of bills aimed at tightening Californias broadened rules But we are bending over backward to keep the religion angle out of it he said We dont want one religious conviction against another Generally the active membership of the individual groups is not large but observers on both sides of the controversy say they are able to muster participation by many thousands in a crisis campaign Visits and Demonstrations The members apply tactics that range from the traditional massmailings and personal visits to legislators to demonstrations and counterdemonstrations at state capitols Lobbying in the New York Assembly this spring became so intense that on one day the Speaker was provoked into barring all lobbyists from the chamber In New York the major antiabortion forces are the Roman Catholic Church and more than 50 Right to Life groups whose leaders say they have a following of 200000 people When it comes down to the wire according to Robert M Brake a former Florida legislator and now treasurer of the Miamiarea Right to Life Committee the Catholic archbishop generally has a letter read in the churches urging parishioners to call for defeat of the bill Political activity aimed at state legislators can be highly intense with some groups circulating legislators voting records throughout their districts State Senator Hugh Fowler a proabortion Republican in Colorado expressed a common theme that many legislators who would like to vote for easier abortions have been terrorized out of doing so We get inundated with mail and direct verbal threats of retaliation at the polls said Illinois Representative Bruce Douglas a Democrat of Chicago A bill he introduced that would have allowed abortions on demand within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy was killed in committee last year and he has no plans to try again this year Illinois Representative Leland H Rayson a Democrat who has sponsored abortion bills since 1967 has been the target of a special campaignto make an example of him he believes to prevent other legislators from voting for abortion reform A group called Illinois Citizens Concerned for Life flooded his district with literature bearing a picture captioned These are the remains of an aborted baby in a hospital bucket awaiting disposal and exhorting voters to prevent this needless killing  work for the defeat of Leland Rayson Mr Payson believes the tactic lost him enough votes in the primary to get him the bottom ballot position in the November election In any case other liberals in the Legisla ture said privately that they had given up on the abortion issue in the foreseeable future Its a hopeless cause here said one who did not want his name used In Michigan where a liberal reform proposition has qualified for listing on the November general election ballot a leader in favor of reform in the State House of Representatives attributed the political power of antiabortion forces to local organizations ability There isnt a week goes by that I dont hear from some of them on this issue Representative Richard J Allen said in an interview Theyve got the passionate voters who will swing on a sin gle issue he continued You can favor financial support for nonpublic schools and everything else but youre done if you cross over their line on abortion Mr Allen said the groups had a major role in the 1970 defeat of N Lorraine Beebe then Michigans only woman Senator and a leading figure in the abortion reform movement I had a therapeutic abortion 20 years ago she once recalled in an emotional speech during a Senate debate Mrs Beebe was defeated by 4700 votes out of 75000 cast by 22yearold David Plawecki who became the youngest State Senator in the country The major antiabortion force in Connecticut is the Roman Catholic Church which campaigned in a special session of the General Assembly last month and succeeded in putting a new antiabortion law on the state books soon after a United States District Court declared the states 112yearold abortion law unconstitutional The new law which was passed with vigorous prompting from Connecticuts Republican Governor Thomas J Meskill provides ar even tougher penalty for performing or advising an abortion than did the 19thcentury lawa maximum sentence of five years rather than two To prevent another court case the new Connecticut law includes a preamble stating that it is the intent of the Legislature to protect and preserve human life from the moment of conception In a similar move a few days ago the Massachusetts Legislature voted initial approval to a proposed constitutional amendment that would grant every child from the moment of conception the rights of all citizens State Representative David S Liederman argued that the amendment was dangerous because voting districts would have to be changed because fetuses would have to be counted as citizens The Pennsylvania House voted last week in favor of a bill to outlaw abortions except in cases where there was reasonable medical certainty that the woman would die without the operation The measure is awaiting further action in the State Senate Representative Martin P Mullen chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the Pennsylvania House has become known as St Martin the First for his diligence in furthering the legislative interests of the Catholic Church Last year he threatened to hold the state budget in his committee until the State Public Welfare Department stopped subsidizing abortions of women on relief But the department stood firm and Mr Mullen relented

Excerpts From Proposed Democratic Platform Adopted by Convention Committee,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/29/archives/excerpts-from-proposed-democratic-platform-adopted-by-convention.html,WASHINGTON June 28Following are excerpts from the Dem ocratic platform as adopted by the Democratic National Conventions Platform Committee The italicized Matter represents a summary of changes proposed in minority reports but not yet put in final written form New Directions 72 76 Skepticism and cynicism are wide spread in America The people are skep tical of platforms filled with political platitudesof promises made by oppor tunistic politicians The people are cynical about the idea that rosy future is just around the corner And is it any wonder that the people are skeptical and cynical of the whole political process Our traditions our history our Con stitution our laws all say that America belongs to its people But the people no longer believe it They feel that the Government is run for the privileged few rather than for the manyand they are right No political party no president no government can by itself restore a lost sense of faith No administration can provide solutions to all our problems What we can do is to recognize the doubts of Americans to speak to those doubts and to act to begin turning those doubts into hopes We believe in the rights of citizens to achieve to the limit of their talents and energies We are determined to remove barriers that limit citizens because they are black brown young or women be cause they never had the chance to gain an education because there was no pos sibility of being anything but what they were We believe in hard work as a fair measure of our own willingness to achieve We are determined that millions should not stand idle while work de mands to be done We are determined that the dole should not become a permanent way of life for any And we are determined that govern ment no longer tax the product of hard work more rigorously than it taxes in herited wealth or money that is gained simply by having money in the first place We believe that the law must apply equally to all and that it must be an instrument of justice We are determined that the citizen must be protected in his home and on his streets We are determined also that the or dinary citizen should not be imprisoned for a crime before we know whether he is guilty or not while those with the right friends and the right connections can break the law without ever facing the consequences of their actions We believe that war is a waste of human life We are determined to end forthwith a war which has cost 50000 American lives 150billion of our re sources that has divided us from each other drained our national will and in flicted incalculable damage to countless people We will end that war by a simple plan that need not be kept secret The imme diate total withdrawal of all Americans from Southeast Asia We believe in the right of an individ ual to speak think read write worship and live free of official intrusion We are determined that our Government must no longer tap the phones of law abiding citizens nor spy on those who have broken no law We are determined that never again shall Government seek to censor the newspapers and television We are de termined that the Government shall no longer mock the supreme law of the land while it stands helpless in the face of crime which makes our neighbor hoods and the communities less and less safe Perhaps most fundamentally we be lieve that government is the servant not the master of the people We are deter mined that government should not mean a force so huge so impersonal that the complaint of an ordinary citizen goes unheard That is not the kind of government America was created to build Our an cestors did not fight a revolution and sacrifice their lives against tyrants from abroad to leave us a government that does not know how to listen to its own people The Democratic party is proud of its past but we are honest enough to admit that we are part of the past and share in its mistakes We want in 1972 to begin the long and difficult task of re viewing existing programs revising them to make them work and finding new techniques to serve the public need We want to speak for and with the citizens of our country Our pledge is to be truthful to the people and to ourselves to tell you when we succeed but also when we fail or when we are not sure In 1976 when this nation celebrates its 200th anni versary we want to tell you simply that we have done our best to give the Government to those who formed it the people of America Every election is a choice In 1972 Americans must decide whether they want their country back again MINORITY VIEW Members pledged to Gov George C Wallace of Alabama filed a minority report to rewrite this section around the Wallace position Jobs Prices and Taxes The Nixon Administration has deliber ately driven people out of work in a heartless and ineffective effort to deal with inflation Ending the Nixon policy of creating unemployment is the first task of the Democratic party The current Nixon game plan includes a control structure which keeps work ers wages clown while executive salaries soar discourages productivity and dis tributes income away from those who need it and has produced no significant dent in inflation as prices for food clothes rent and basic necessities soar Full employmenta guaranteed job for allis the primary economic objec tive of the Democratic party The Dem ocratic party is committed to a job for every American who seeks work Only through full employment can we reduce the burden on working people We are determined to make economic security a matter of right This means a job with decent pay and good work ing conditions for everyone willing and able to work and an adequate income for those unable to work It means abolition of the present welfare system Millions of jobsreal jobs not make workneed to be provided Public serv ice employment must be greatly expand ed in order to make the Government the employer of last resort and guaran tee a job far all Large sections of our cities resemble bombedout Europe after World War II Children in Appalachia cannot go to school when the dirt road is a sea of mud Homes schools and clinics roads and mass transit systems need to be built Cleaning up our air and water will take skills and people in large numbers In the school the police department the welfare agency or the recreation program there are new careers to be developed to help insure that social services reach the people for whom they are intended It may cost more at least initially to create decent jobs than to perpetuate the handout system of present welfare But the returnin new public facilities and services in the dignity of bringing a paycheck home and in the taxes that will come back infar outweighs the cost of the investment The next Democratic Administration must end the present welfare system and replace it with an income security program which places cash assistance in an appropriate context with all of the measures outlined above adding up to an earned income approach to insure each family an income substantially more than the poverty level insuring standards of decency and health as of ficially defined in the area Federal income assistance will sup plement the income of working poor people and assure an adequate income for those unable to work With full em ployment and simpler fair administra tion total costs will go clown and with Federal financing the burden on local and state budgets will be eased The program will protect current benefit goals during the transitional period The system of income protection which replaces welfare must be a part of the full employment policy which as sures every American a job at a fair wage under conditions which make use of his ability and provide an oppor tunity for advancement President Nixons welfare reform HR I and its various amendments is not humane and does not meet the social and economic objectives that we believe in and it should be defeated It perpetuates the coercion of forced work requirements A first priority of a Democratic ad ministration must be eliminating the unfair bureaucratic Nixon wage and price controls When price rises threaten to or do get out of controlas they are now strong fair action must be taken to protect family income and savings The theme of that action should be swift tough measures to break the wageprice spiral and restore the economy In that kind of economic emergency Americas working people will support a truly fair stabilization program which affects profits investment earnings executive salaries and prices as well as wages The Nixon controls do not meet that standard They have forded the American worker who suffers most from inflation to pay the price of trying to end it In addition to stabilizing the economy we propose To develop automatic instruments protecting the livelihood of Americans who depend on fixed incomes such as savings bonds with purchasing power guarantees and costofliving escalators in government Social Security and in come support payments To create a system of recession insurance for states and localities to replace lost local revenues with Federal funds in economic downturns thereby avoiding reduction in public employ ment or public services To establish longerterm budget and fiscal planning and To create new mechanisms to stop unwarranted price increases in concen trated industries The Democratic party deplores the increasing concentration of economic power in fewer and fewer hands Five Per cent of the American people control 90 per cent of our productive national wealth Less than 1 per cent of all man ufacturers have 88 per cent of the prof its Less than 2 per cent of the popula tion now owns approximately 80 per cent of the nations personally held cor porate stock 90 per cent of the person ally held corporate bonds and nearly 100 per cent of the personally held mu nicipal bonds The rest of the populationincluding all working men and womenpay too much for essential products and services because of national policy and market distortions The Nixon Administrationwhich gave corporations the largest tax cut in American historyis considering a hid den national sales tax valueadded tax which would further shift the burden to the average wage earner and raise prices of virtually everything ordinary people buy It is cruel and unnecessary to pretend to relieve one bad tax the property tax by a new tax which is just as bad We oppose this priceraising unfair tax in any form Federal income tax The Democratic party believes that all unfair corporate and individual tax preferences should be removed The tax law is clogged with complicated provisions and special in terests such as percentage oil depletion and other favors for the oil industry special rates and rules for capital gains fast depreciation unrelated to useful life easytoabuse expenseaccount deduc tions and the ineffective minimum tax These hidden expenditures in the Federal budget are nothing more than billions of tax welfare aid for the wealthy the privileged and the cor porations We therefore endorse as a minimum step the MillsMansfield Tax Policy Re view Act of 1972 which would repeal virtually all tax preferences in the exist ing law over the period 19741976 as a means of compelling a systematic re view of their value to the nation We acknowledge that the original reasons for some of these tax prefer ences may remain valid but believe that none should escape close scrutiny and full public exposure The most unjusti fied of the tax loopholes should how ever be closed immediately without waiting for a review of the whole system Social Security tax The Democratic party commits itself to make the Social Security tax progressive by raising sub stantially the ceiling on earned income To permit needed increases in Social Security benefits we will use general revenues as necessary to supplement payroll tax receipts In this way we will support continued movement to ward general revenue financing for Social Security Property tax Greater fairness in tax ation at the Federal level will have little meaning for the vast majority of American households if the burden of inequitable local taxation is not reduced To reduce the local property tax for all American families we support equal ization of school spending and substan tial increases in the Federal share of education costs and general revenue sharing New forms of Federal financing as sistance to states and localities should be made contingent upon property tax reforms including equal treatment and full publication of assessment ratios MINORITY VIEW Wallace members filed a 14page mi nority report on jobs prices and taxes supporting organized labor and calling for government economy and tax re form Minority reports were also filed by representatives of the National Welfare Rights Organization seeking a guaran teed annual income of 6500 for a fam ily of four and more liberal policies for public housing tenants A further minor ity report was filed by liberals seeking a specific plan for tax reform Rights Power and Social Justice The new Democratic Administration should bring an end to the pattern of political persecution and investigation the use of high office as a pulpit for unfair attack and intimidation and the blatant efforts to control the poor and to keep them from acquiring additional economic security or political power The epidemic of wiretapping and electronic surveillance engaged in by the Nixon Administration and the use of grand juries for purposes of political intimidation must be ended The rule of law and the supremacy of the Consti tution as these concepts have tradi tionally been understood must be re stored We strongly object to secret com puter data banks on individuals Citi zens should have access to their own files that are maintained by private commercial firms and the right to insert corrective material Except in limited cases the same should apply to government files Col lection and maintenance by Federal agencies of dossiers on lawabiding citi zens because of their political views and statements must be stopped and files which never should have been opened should be destroyed We firmly reject the idea of a national computer data bank The Nixon policy of intimidation of the media and Administration efforts to use government power to block access to media by dissenters must end if free speech is to be preserved A Democratic Administration must be an open one with the fullest possible disclosure of information with an end to abuses of security classifications and executive privilege and with regular toplevel press conferences Americans should be free to make their own choice of life styles and pri vate habits without being subject to dis crimination or prosecution Right of Women Women historically have been denied a full voice in the evolution of the po litical and social institutions of this country The Democratic party pledges the following A priority effort to ratify the equal rights amendment Elimination of discrimination against women in public accommodations and public facilities public education and in all federally assisted programs and federally contracted employment Full endorsement of all Federal statutes and executive laws barring job discrimination on the basis of sex giving the Equal Employment Oppor tunities Commission adequate staff and resources and power to issue cease anddesist orders promptly Availability of maternity benefits to all working women temporary dis ability benefits should cover pregnancy childbirth miscarriage and recovery Elimination of all tax inequities that affect women and children such as higher taxes for single women Appointment of women to positions of top responsibility in all branches of the Federal Government to achieve an equitable ratio of women and men Such positions include Cabinet members agency and division heads and Supreme Court Justices inclusion of women ad visers in equitable ratios on all govern ment studies commissions and hearings Laws authorizing Federal grants on a matching basis for financing state commissions on the status of women In order to insure maintain and se cure the proper role and functions of youth in American government politics and society the Democratic party will endeavor to Lower the age of legal majority and consent to 18 Activily encourage and assist in the election of youth to Federal state and local offices Growing old in America for too many means neglect sickness despair and all too often poverty The Democratic party pledges to Increase Social Security to bring benefits into line with changes in the national standard of living Support legislation which allows beneficiaries to earn more income with out reduction of Social Security pay ments Lower retirement eligibility age to 60 in all Government pension programs Expand housing assistance to elderly America has a responsibility to offer to every American family the best in health care wherever they need it re gardless of income or where they live or any other factor To achieve this goal the next Democratic Administra tion should Establish a system of universal na tional health insurance which covers all Americans with a comprehensive set of benefits including preventive medicine mental and emotional disorders and complete protection against catas trophic costs and in which the rule of free choice for both provider and con sumer is protected The program should be federally financed and federally ad ministered Every American must know he can afford the cost of health care whether given in a hospital or a doc tors office Incorporate in the national health insurance system incentives and con trols to curb inflation in health care costs and to assure efficient delivery of all services MINORITY VIEW Wallace delegates submitted a minor ity report callinng for a constitutional amendment to permit prayer in public schools Minority reports were also filed sup porting legal abortions and opposing local and state laws and policies inter fering with employment of homosexuals and relations between consenting adults Cities Communities Counties and Environment The Nixon Administration has neither developed an effective urban growth policy designed to meet critical problems nor concerned itself with the needed re creation of the quality of life in our cities large and small The Democratic party pledges A national urban growth policy to promote a balance of population among cities suburbs small towns and rural areas while providing social and eco nomic opportunities for everyone Amer ica needs a logical urban growth policy instead of todays inadvertent chaotic and haphazard one that doesnt work An urban growth policy that truly deals with our tax and mortgage insurance and highway policies will require the use of Federal policies as leverage on private investment A policy on housingincluding low and middleincome housingthat will concentrate effort in areas where there are jobs transportation schools health care and commercial facilities Prob lems of overgrowth are not caused so much by land scarcity as by the wrong distribution of people and the inade quate servicing of their needs and The Democratic party pledges itself to change the disastrous policies of the Nixon Administration toward the cities and to reverse the steady process of decay and dissolution Under Republican leadership the Fed eral Housing Administration FHA has become the biggest slumlord in the country Some unsophisticated home buyers have purchased homes with FHA mortgage insurance or subsidies These consumers relying on FHA ap praisals to protect them often have been exploited by real estate specula tors and dishonest builders Unable to repair or maintain these houses the buyers often have no choice but to abandon them As a result the FHA will acquire a quartermillion of these abandoned houses at a cost to the taxpayers of billions of dollars To correct this inequity the Demo cratic party pledges To overhaul completely the FHA to make it a consumeroriented agency To use the full faith and credit of the Treasury to provide direct lowin terest loans to finance the construction and purchase of decent housing for the American people The party pledges to create a single transportation trust fund to replace the highway trust fund with such addi tion funds as necessary to meet our transportation crisis substantially from Federal resources This fund will allo cate monies for capital projects on a regional basis permitting each region to determine its own needs under guide lines that will insure a balanced trans portation system and adequate funding of mass transit facilities Education The next Democratic Administration should Support equalization in spending among school districts We support court decisions holding unconstitutional the disparities in school expenditures produced by dependence on local prop erty taxes We pledge equality of spend ing as a way to improve schools and to assure equality of access to good education for all children Increase Federal financial aid for elementary and secondary education to enhance achievement of quality educa tion anywhere by fully funding the programs passed by the Congress The Supreme Court of the United States in Brown v Board of Education established the constitutional principle that states may not discriminate be tween schoolchildren on the basis of their race and that separate but equal has no place in our public education system Eighteen years later the pro vision of integration is not a reality We support the goal of desegregation as a means to achieve equal access to quality education for all our children There are many ways to desegregate schools School attendance lines may be redrawn schools may be paired larger physical facilities may be built to serve larger more diverse enrollments mag net schools or educational parks may be used Transportation of students is another goal to accomplish desegrega tion It must continue to be available according to Supreme Court decisions to eliminate legally imposed segrega tion and improve the quality of educa tion for all children We should expand support of the arts and humanities by direct grants through the National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities whose policy should be to stimulate the widest variety of artistic and scholarly expression We should support longrange financ ing for public broadcasting insulated from political pressures We deplore the Nixon Administrations crude efforts to starve and muzzle public broadcasting which has become a vital supplement to commercial television MINORITY VIEW Wallace members filed a minority report opposing forced busing as a means of achieving school desegrega tion A milder antibusing minority pro vision was filed by members from Michigan and other states Crime Law and Justice Effective law enforcement requires tough planning and action This Admin istration has given us nothing but tough words Together with unequal law en forcement by police protecutors and judges the result is a turnstile sys tem of injustice where most of those who commit crime are not arrested most of those arrested are not prose cuted and many of those prosecuted are not convicted Under this Administration the con victions rate for Federal prosecutions has declined to onehalf its former level Tens of thousands of offenders simply never appear in court and are heard from again only when they commit an other crime This system does not deter crime It invites it It will be changed only when all levels of government act to return firmness and fairness to every part of the criminal justice system Fear of crime and firm action against it is not racism indeed the greatest victims of crime todaywhether of business fraud or of the narcotics plague are the people of the ghetto black and brown Fear now stalks their streets far more than it does the suburbs There must be laws to control the improper use of handguns Effective legislation must include a ban on sale of handguns known as Saturday night specials The blockgrant system of Law En forcement Assistance Administration which has produced ineffectiveness waste and corruption should be elim inated Funds should go directly to operating agencies that are committed to change and improvement in local law enforcement including agencies con cerned with research rehabilitation training and treatment MINORITY VIEW Wallace members filed minority re ports upholding the constitutional right of citizens to bear arms and supporting capital punishment Farming and Rural Life Administration policies have driven farm income as low as 67 per cent of parity unequaled since the Depression Between 50000 and 75000 farm families are driven off the land each year Hundreds of thousands of demoralized people are being forced into over crowded cities emptying the country side and bankrupting small business in rural towns and cities In place of these negative and harmful policies the Democratic party pledges itself to take positive and decisive action We will replace the 1970 Farm Act when it expires next year with a perma nent law to provide fair prices to family type farm and ranch operators This law will include loans and payments to farmers and effective supply manage ment to raise family farm income to 100 per cent of parity based on the 191014 ratios We will resist a price ceiling on agri Culture products until farm prices reach 110 per cent of parity based on the 191014 ratios and will conduct a con sumer education program to inform all Americans of the relationship between the prices of raw commodities and retail prices Foreign Policy The next Democratic Administration should End American participation in the war in Southeast Asia Reestablish control over military activities and reduce military spending where consistent with national security Defend Americas real interests and maintain our alliances neither playing world policeman nor abandoning old and good friends Not neglect Americas relations with small third world nations in placing reliance on great power relationships Return to Congress and to the peo ple a meaningful role in decision on peace and war and Make information public except when real national defense interests are involved We must insist that any resolution of the war include the return of all prisoners held by North Vietnam and other adversary forces and the fullest possible accounting for the missing With increasing lack of credibility the Nixon Administration has sought to use the prisoners of war as an excuse for its policies The majority of the Democratic Sen ators have called for full U S with drawal by Oct 1 1972 We support that position If the war is not ended before the next Democratic Administration takes office we pledge as the first order of business an immediate and complete withdrawal of all U S forces in Indo china All US military action in Southeast Asia will cease After the end of US direct combat participation military aid to the Saigon Government and else where in Indochina will be terminated The US will no longer seek to deter mine the political future of the nations of Indochina The issue is not whether we will depose the present South Viet namese Government rather when we will cease insisting that it must be the core of any political settlement We will do what we can to foster an agreement on a acceptable political solutionbut we recognize that there are sharp limits to our ability to influ ence this process and to the importance of the outcome to our interest Disengagement from this terrible war will not be a defeat for America It will not imply any weakness in Amer icas will or ability to protect its vital interests from attack On the contrary disengagement will enable us to heal domestic divisions and to end the dis tortion of our international priorities which the war has caused The Democratic party pledges itself to maintain adequate military forces for deterrence and effective support of our international position But we will also insist on the firm control of specific costs and projects that are essential to ensure that each defense dollar makes a real contribution to national security Specifically a Democratic Administra tion should Plan military budgets on the basis of our present needs and commitments not past practices or force levels Stress simplicity and effectiveness in new weapons and stop goldplating and duplication which threaten to spawn a new succession of costly military White elephants avoid commitment to new weapons unless and until it becomes clear that they are needed Reject calls to use the SALT agree ment as an excuse for wasteful and dangerous acceleration of our military spending Reduce overseas bases and forces and Rebuild the morale and military tra dition of our armed forces through creative programs to combat drug abuse racial tensions and eroded pride in service We urge abolition of the draft Disarmament and arms control The SALT agreement should be quickly rati fied and taken as a starting point for new agreements It must not be used as an excuse for new bargaining chip military programs or the new round of the arms race The United States must be unequivo cally committed to support of Israels right to exist within secure and de fensible boundaries The next Democratic Administration should Make and carry out a firm long term public commitment to provide Is rael with aircraft and other military equipment in the quantity and sophisti cation she needs to preserve her deter rent strength in the face of Soviet arsenaling of Arab threats of renewed war Seek to bring the parties into direct negotiations toward a permanent polit ical solution based on the necessity of agreement on secure and defensible na tional boundaries Maintain a political commitment and a military force in the area amply suf ficient to deter the Soviet Union from using military force in the area Recognize and support the estab lished status of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel with free access to all its holy places provided to all faiths As a sym bol of this stand the U S Embassy should be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and Our national commitment to liberal trade policies takes its toll when times are bad but yields its benefits when the economy

Every Day Was Ladies' Day,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/02/archives/every-day-was-ladies-day-every-day-was-ladies-day.html,THE pretty young woman on the screen is fend ing off a mans ad vances As he becomes more any ardent she knocks him to the ground and kicks him sharply and repeatedly in the groin Cheer from a 99 per cent facade audience Viva Andy Warhols most glamorous superstar is seated with Other actresses at a Symposium table Her wild Bacchante late 60s hairdo has settled down into a sedate schoolmarm knot at the nape of her neck and she confesses that it is difficult for her to talk about acting because marriage and motherhood have reduced her to a zom biea harried harassed housewife and mother Sym pathetic clucks are heard throughout the female audi ence and one young woman gets up and suggests that Viva try some joyous les bianism Laughter and cheers Viva later testifies that she has never in her life been able to accomplish anything without man An independent young woman factory worker in a Hungarian film dons her clothes after a casual sex encounter She turns to the young man still lolling on the bed bathed in afterglow and says So long youre a nice kid departing with a friendly wave Delighted giggles from the audience A Swedish film climaxes with a scene in which a beau tiful actress rises to make a thank you speech at a ban quet celebrating her sticcess ful tour Instead she an nounces that she is divorcing her husband who is basking happily beside her with no notion that she has ever con templated such a step Ap plause The scenes and the dis cussion were all part of the First International Festival of Womens Films held for 16 days last month at the Fifth Avenue Cinema an event that offered 14 narrative films three featurelength documentaries and about 100 shorts all by women It was organized and directed by Kristina Nordstrom who with two aides reviewed some 500 films by 300 filmmakers An 11member screening com mittee resigned several months earlier because of disagreements about the ob jectives of the festival Not all of the films in the festival were directly femi nist and not all had women as their subjects subjects ranged from camels to the problems of Algerian workers in France to the Black Pan thers to conceptual art However the films keyed to new feminist concepts creat ed the most excitement among the largely feminist audience at the festival This audience had a gut reaction to scenes like those described above in which women seemed to come out from under in the sexual war Women attending the daily film showings and forums ran the gamut of opinion from those concerned basical ly with eliminating job dis crimination in the movie in dustry to Gloria Steinem rad icals who feel that women must drastically restructure their personalities and life styles to the Marxistanar chists who believe that wom en must join the poor the blacks and other oppressed groups in makin a political revolution and should use films as a revolutionary tool A group of women critics at one of the forums agreed that it had taken them years to realize that they did not really want to be like the stereotypes they saw in Hol lywood movies  sex objects bitches aggressive castra tors passive idiots maso chists and losers Movies programed our dreams said Gloria Steinem calling for a new kind of film in which women are shown as strong compassionate beautiful However Village Voice critic Molly Haskell while not disagreeing with Ms Steinem was also interested in seeing films about women who are not so strong not so compassionate not so beautiful In addition she wanted to see movies about how women manage to han dle homes marriages and careers Jeanine Basinger a self confessed movie addict sud denly reverted to prelibera tionist consciousness and wistfully remarked that she would really like to see Mildred Pierce again I still feel that there is a mink and a revolver somewhere in my future The discussions and the films at the festival both sug gested that we are approach ing a new phase in dealing with what has always been at the heart of most movies the relationship between male and female Today the sophis ticated Bergman  Antonioni Fellini psychological film be gins to look as atavistic as the old Hollywood sexgod dess and soapopera films they replaced The current sexandviolence films may be merely a hype to keep things going until a more gripping sexual mythology emerges Women feature filmmakers who have chosen to step out side of conventional treat ments in dealing with women are working on as yet un processed psychic material and they tend to flounder and fudge But the fact that they are sensitized to the new currents made for some genuine electricity at the fes tival A case in point is Mai Zet terlings The Girls Start ing with a good idea a strong feminist passion firstrate technicians and performers Bibi Andersson Harriet An dersson and Gunnel Lind blom Zetterling coura geously tackles headon the problem of women flounder ing in an identity crisis and produces a very interesting failure The weaknesses of her film are built into the very structure of the work How does one make coherent drama out of people who in sist they will not be them selves yet cannot be other wise The Girls is about a group of actresses touring the provinces in Lysistrata They become seriously af fected by the feminist mes sage in the play and start acting out in life some of the rebellious impulses that have been stirred up At this point Zetterlings hands seem to fall off the steering wheel as her car is speeding along the superhighway The wom en cannot change the fact that in the core of their beings they are committed to their lives as wives mothers mis tresses They keep fantasizing abortive rebellions in which clad in full battle regalia of handsome boots furs and groovy glasses they mouth limp rhetoric about the rotten malecreated System filled with war and injustice Zetterlingss chief cine matic failurethe over reli ance on these fantasiesis a direct correlation of the womens essential unwilling ness to alter their lives When the heroine impulsively and dramatically announces her decision to get a divorce it is clear that the gesture con notes no serious change in her situation She has not transcended her selfpity and selfhatred nor has she de veloped the strength or skill to help remold the outside world A Czech filmmaker Vera Chytilova simplifies the ques tions raised by The Girls by contrasting the lives of two women a housewife and a champion gymnast In Something Different the gymnast is beautifully por trayed by Olympic Gold Medal winner Eva Bosakova who reveals the grueling discipline and pain involved in her work Her dedication is the kind that must go into any serious career it is an austere life with little time for personal pleasures The housewifes life seems easier on the surface but it is riddled with the nervous and emotional strain of hav ing to be subservient to the petty needs of others Her husband has lost interest in her and she seeks excitement in an outside romance which turns out to be a fiasco In the end her only triumph rests on holding her husband even though both of them are sick of the marriage It is interesting that the filmmaker takes it for granted that a demanding career precludes being a wifeandmother and that wifeandmother is al ways a slob role There is no insistence on combining the two as the reformist major ity of the feminist movement would do French filmmaker Nelly Kaplans A Very Curious Girl was a popular festival film but it presents a very limited view off the female problem It concerns the daughter of a gypsy in a small French town This little outcast is regaided as sexual prey to all of the men in the town as well as to the town lesbian But she is smart as well as pretty and learns to use her erotic power to her own advantage turning the tables on the town The movie is a somewhat amus ing but basically routine farce built on a sexual re venge fantasy The obverse of this film is Barbara Lodens Wanda whose heroine is a schlemiel with low selfesteem and mental limitations that make her the natural prey of men In the beginning of the film Loden seems to want to ex plore feminine passivity and masochism but she cops out of the challenge of turning this difficult material into effective dramatic use and converts the whole thing into an action film involving a police chase and bank rob bery By the end Wandas outlaw companion becomes the more interesting charac ter Both Wanda and A Very Curious Girl cop out to cinematic convention The most brilliant and com plex work in the festival was The Girl by a Hungarian Marta Meszaros It is a very deceptive film  small and quiet building its power like a Chekhov short story through exquisitely incisive and subtle details The girls life seen from the outside is a good one She is a strong independent factory worker clearly comfortable with her social status in the Socialist state She lives nicely has fashionable clothes loves to dance and has total personal freedom She takes her sexual encount ers as she pleases rejecting entanglements Slowly we learn that inside herself she is totally bereft suffering an alienation as deep as Camuss Stranger An illegitimate child she was raised in a decent staterun orphanage At the age of 24 she is possessed with a desire to find her parents particularly one senses her mother She finds hera sus picious hostile sensual so cially repressed peasant woman living in a remote mountain village The girl and the peasant woman study one another unbeliev ing for a long time across a picket fence The first impact of the meeting is for the girl like the impact of Darwins Origin of Species on a generation which could not take in the fact that man was descended from the apes Very little happens but that little is everything The girl can get nothing from her mother She cannot learn any thing about herself or what a womans life is all about She no longer wants to know about her father She meets him but she knows the past has no message for her There is no didacticism no ideology no rhetoric in this film It states a painful fact in purely visual termsthat the girl must recreate herself without guidelines from the past Until she does she is soulless and rudderless These films were only a few of the festival highlights There was Dorothy Arzners first talkie for Paramount The Wild Party with Clara Bow and Fredric March a romantic comedy which takes on a new interest when viewed as an illustration of the released sexuality of the flap per coed of the period Mad cen in Uniform made in Germany in 1931 and long re garded as the lesbian film today comes through as more Political than sexual  a powerful expression of rebel adolescent emotions rising to shatter a repressive authori tarian establishment Lina Wetmullers The Lizards which had its premiere at the festival is a highly polished study of young men stagnat ing in a sleepy southern Ital ian town It shows no special concern with feminine prob lems but in a couple of in cisive scenes  a frightened girl running crying through the deserted outskirts of the town and an old womans suicideit tells a great deal about wornens isolation and despair in a closed society Not unexpectedly some of the shorts made with an ex pressly womens liberation viewpoint were oppressively didactic but there was a great deal of interesting material in the films on abortion contra ception childbearing and the short studies about the lives of many different types of women The festival was clearly a landmark in terms of the womens liberation move ment The feminist audience was overwhelmingly re sponsive Mid talked enthu siastically of the festivals to come Certainly there is enough ferninine filmmaking talent around to produce a stimulating annual festival But the harsh economic fact is that the festival ran at a deficit It is possible that interest in feministoriented films will grow as the liberation move ment gathers momentum but it is doubtful whether they will ever produce long lines at the box office unless the movement produces the artist who can find the new dreams we all want to dream Her work will be nurtured in her womans view of the world but it will not be an exposition of feminist ideol ogy perhaps It will contain the wild extravagant fan tasies of the old Hollywood films Perhaps she will find the 1970s equivalent of that mink and that revolver

of dollars Such diarrheal illness is sec ond only to colds and other respiratory infections as the most common ailment affect ing Americans or sending them to doctors Diarrhea may be caused by a wide variety of diseases only some of which are due to in fections caused by bacteria and viruses The Bug Going Around The bug thats going around generally causes such symp toms as diarrhea nausea vom iting mild fever abdominal cramps headache and malaise that last for one or two days The ailment is distinguished from other diarrheaproducing diseases by generally occur ring in outbreaks that affect groups of people in a short period of time Then predict ably the outbreak vanishes Later but at an unpredictable interval another outbreak oc curs again Government scientific sleuths found the Norwalk agent and possibly five other ac complice viruses  in speci mens collected from patients affected by six outbreaks in scattered areas of the country in recent years The virus is so named because it was de tected from an outbreak that caused illness among elemen tary school children in Nor walk Ohio in 1968 In reporting on their work in the current issue of the An nals of Internal Medicine the institutes researchers said that so far they had been unable to grow the virus out of the body in test tubes in laboratories We Know Its There We know its there but we havent come up with it yet said Dr Raphael Dolin in a telephone interview from his laboratory in Bethesda Md But Dr Dolin Dr Neil R Blacklow and Dr Robert M Chanock the principal investi gators have enough clues to provide a composite picture of the elusive virus The Norwalk agent is a small naked virus  or one without a fatty covering  that is resistant to both acid and heat It most closely re sembles members of a group called parvoviruses which cause disease in animals but which have not been previously asso ciated with human illness Whether the virus is a new member of the parvovirus group or belongs to an entirely new family is not known We need to grow this agent and see what it is Dr Chan ock said He added This agent has to give us a signal that it is there Virologists detect such sig nals by examining changes such as in the morphology or shape of infected cells grown in test tubes by special stains called immunofluorescence and by examination under an elec tron microscope By other tests the researchers want to learns if the virus consists of ribo nucleaic acid or deoxyribonu cleic acid because presence of RNA or DNA is used to class ify viruses The scientists search to ident ify the Norwalk agent and its accomplices rests on the use of a newly developed viro logical technique that enables scientists to approximate the human intestine as closely as possible in the laboratory The technique relies on cells taken from the intestines of human fetuses obtained from therapeutic abortions in pri vate hospitals Dr Dolins team and a group In Britain inde pendently but simultaneously perfected the technique after other groups had tried unsuc cessfully to do it for five years The key to success was nothing very sophisticated Dr Dolin said but rather the result of diligence and patience Dr Dolin said that his team learned that it must begin preparing fetal specimens in the operat ing room immediately after an abortion and not several hours later Further Dr Dolin said the tissue is so fragile and fastidi ous that you must treat it delicately Cells Digestion The delicate lining of the human intestine is composed of microscopic sized hills and valleys called villi and crypts that contain the cells that help digest and absorb food The Norwalk agent does not grow in animals Dr Chan ock said Were limited by the fact that the only host [susceptible animal] is the nor mal human volunteer With the cooperation of re searchers at the University of Maryland and elsewhere the doctors have reproduced Nor walk agent illness in normal human volunteers at the na tional health institutes at Be thesda and at the Maryland House of Correction at Jessup From these experiments sci entists have learned that the agent produces immunity against a second attack for at least four and one half months but that it does not provide protection against any of the other agents tested so far The doctors have also dis covered that the Norwalk agent damages cells in the bowel and impairs digestion of food for up to one week after infection Then the body tot ally recovers Advanced Tests Planned Once the researchers get the virus to grow in test tubes they expect to develop tests to learn how great an impact the Norwalk agent has on American society and just what percentage of intestinal flu cases it causes We have no idea how many agents will be found when the picture is complete Dr Chan ock said but were about the same place that research on the common cold was 20 years ago In the interval virologists have developed a technique that uses cells from a fetal trachea or windpipe to grow many of the viruses that can cause the common cold The large number of such viruses helps explain why people get so many colds Because immunity to one cold virus does not protect against infections from another cold virus investigators have learned that a separate vac cine would be needed for pro tection against each cold virus For that reason researchers have abandoned the idea of developing a vaccine for pro tection against the common cold If the same situation holds true for intestinal flu as some doctors suspect then there may always be a bug that is going around
The Legends of George McGovern,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/02/archives/the-legends-of-george-mcgovern-true-believers-the-pure-hero-a-new.html,THE Rise of George McGovern is sure to be recorded in political history as one of the great triumphs of propaganda and myth making There is nothing evil or reprehensible in this tale of Prairie Virtue Triumphant and Political Establishments Cast Down Senator McGovern is a skillful ambitious politician who outfought and outmaneuvered his competitors He is also a capa ble public official who I think would make a good President Yet McGoverns ability to parlay a very few assets into a convincing bid for national political power is an astonishing accomplishment The can didate of the radical and militantly liberal Demo crats McGovern represents about onequarter of his party By June 6 when he won the California primary and rendered his New York primary victory a foregone conclusion an unofficial tabulation of the vote totals amassed in the primaries showed  Even if George Wallaces votes are left out it is clear that Democrats choosing among the three serious contenders cast more than half again as many votes for Hubert Humphrey and Edmund Muskie as they did for McGovern If this struggle for the nomination had been just another clash of rival personalities these statis tics would have no significance But McGovern is a candidate with a radical program on welfare tax reform redistribution of wealth and the mili tary budget He is associated in the public mind with the permissive lifestyle adopted by many young people His reputation as a radical figure considerably inflates the actual content of the programs that he advocates or that realis tically speaking he could put into effect if elected President Nevertheless this reputation is a politi cal fact In the minds of many businessmen his very name has become synonymous with that of Nicolai Lenin and his primary victories caused the stock market to decline McGovern makes many voters in his own party uneasy In an article in The New York Times on June 8 analyzing inter views with California voters after they left their voting place on primary day Jack Rosenthal re ported that 40 per cent of Humphrey Democrats would defect to Mr Nixon if McGovern is the nominee In short McGovern is a high risk candidate As McGoverns nomination has become increas ingly probable in recent weeks there have been two adverse reactions among Democratic party leaders and supporters The first reflects a general disagreement with some of McGoverns positions Senator Henry Jackson of Washington for exam ple is alarmed by McGoverns views on national defense while many big Democratic contributors are apprehensive about McGoverns tax proposals In a heterogeneous national party however some conflict is inevitable Of greater significance is the second more widespread reaction which is essen tially pragmatic Many Democrats who favor other candidates are not opposed in principle to soak therich taxes or a drastic cutback in the military budget which McGovern advocates But they seri ously doubt that raising these issues in an aggres sive provocative form is the best way to elect the President It is one thing for a candidate to outline the broad direction in which he thinks national policy should go but it is something else again to spell out how these changes are going to hit the pocketbooks of individual taxpayers and businesses as well as the hundreds of communities which have defense plants or military bases From a practical political viewpoint McGovern in my judgment has committed a major political blunder because his proposals have evoked dis tracting controversy when the Democrats ought to be focusing attention exclusively on the failures and weaknesses in the Nixon record McGovern has spent an alarming proportion of his time in recent weeks explaining and disclaiming part of his own program and reassuring large numbers of his fellow Democrats that he is not another Barry Goldwater bringing disaster to their state and local tickets in November For these pragmatic reasons many Democrats who abide by the conventional political wisdom believe that nominating McGovern is booking pass age on another sailing of the Titanic They are particularly distressed when they recall that the polls for three years have shown that a liberal Democrat with a moderate image would either de feat President Nixon or run neckandneck with him in a close race similar to the elections of 1960 and 1968 Although I understand this conventional atti tude I am not predicting that McGovern will lose What voters think in June is not necessarily what they will think in November Moreover McGovern has shown himself a resourceful and effective cam paigner But it is worth asking how the Democrats came to be in this precarious situation Did they really intend to go for broke with the riskiest pos sible nominee The answer to this question leads back to Mc Governs mythmaking capacities Politics is in large part the creation and manipulation of symbols What is actually happening is often less important than what appears to be happening The facts about yesterday may matter less than communicat ing a sense of momentum about what may happen tomorrow An event and particularly a Presidential primary result is measured with a rubber ruler and is made to mean as Humpty Dumpty in Through the Looking Glass said Whatever I choose it to mean Everybody is trying to instill selffulfilling prophecies in other peoples minds particularly the minds of the press Myths are not necessanly false On the contrary the most successful myths have a core of truth But they also have a vagueness a plasticity which enables them to accrete around that core successive layers of halftruth willful fantasy and pure illusion The Legend of George McGovern has the classic elementsthe True Believers the Pure Hero a New Vision a Plan to Capture the Dragon and the Long March to Triumph ORDINARILY a legend starts with a hero but in this instance the true believers created their own hero The true believers are the dedicated antiwar activists greatly augmented in voting power this year by the newly enfranchised 18to21yearolds Many of them have been marching and demonstrat ing against the war since 1965 Four years ago they embraced Eugene J McCarthy although baf fled at first by his philosophizing his diffident ways his poetic metaphors But he was in the field first and the totality of his antiVietnam commit ment could not be doubted McCarthy did not create the antiwar constituency it adopted him As his ads in 1968 said McCarthythe candidate the people found The peace Democrats however were split four years ago After he belatedly announced some rallied to Robert Kennedy because he looked so much like a winner Others felt Kennedys ambi tion and undisguised pragmatism He could call Dick Daley on the telephone tainted the purity of their own idealism In the intervening four years the activist view point won out McGovern with his dogged persist ence looked like a candidate who would work hard McCarthy despite his intermittent rounds of speechmaking disappointed his supporters by relinquishing his seat on the Foreign Relations Committee to a hawk and then retiring from the Senate altogether At a series of informal state caucuses last winter and spring the peace activists showed a cool ruthlessness in rejecting McCarthy and deciding to unite their strength behind Mc Govern If the socalled realists of the AFLCIO had shown as much coldblooded political compe tence as the supposedly fuzzyminded liberals and written off the other Minnesota Twin  Hubert Humphreyinstead of foolishly trying to resuscitate him the preconvention political scene might be considerably different McGovern won the loyalty of the peace activists because he was the earliest foe of the Vietnam war In October 1963 when President Kennedy had only sent several thousand U S military advisers McGovern a freshman Senator warned against the folly of military involvement in Viet nam This is the basis of his slogan McGovern Right From the Start Although he voted for the Gulf of Tonkin resolu tion in 1964 and against repealing it in 1966 McGovern had taken a strong position against the war by the following year During the subsequent years he focused so intensively on the war that he became known as a oneissue candidate That used to be regarded as a handicap but to win the support of the hardest workers in this years Democratic primaries it was very sound politics If it is interesting proof of his prescience Mc Governs early stand against the war still has only dubious relevance to the 1972 situation within the Democratic party After all dozens of Demo cratic Senatorsled by such pillars of the Senate Establishment as Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and Foreign Relations Committee Chairman J Wil liam Fulbrightare as much against the Vietnam war as George McGovern For at least two years every plausible contender for the Democratic Presi dential nomination with the exception of Washing tons Senator Henry Jackson has been for total U S withdrawal from Vietnam It would surprise many proMcGovern students to know that none of them is any more firmly against the war than Clark Clifford Washington superlawyer and Sena tor Muskies chief foreign affairs adviser Yet because McGovern was right on the war first he acquired an unshakable hold on the loyalty of the antiwar activists The Bible may recommend welcoming the prodigal son and the 11thhour laborer but the peace Democrats showed by their stony response to Muskie not to mention poor Humphrey that they have little warmth for con verts As true believers they wanted McGovern who had been with them toiling in the vineyard One wellknown Connecticut Democrat observed after months of futile missionary work on behalf of Muskie If another candidate with a centrist reputation ever asks me what he should do to win support among liberals Ill tell him Dont bother Youd just be wasting your time They wont even listen As the candidate of the peace activists McGov ern has the support not only of those who think the Vietnam war was a mistakea position which most Democrats and probably a majority of Amer icans have arrived at over the last three or four yearsbut of the much smaller group who think the war is a crime and would like to see Lyndon Johnson General Westmoreland and lesser figures put in the dock at an American version of the Nuremberg trials The intensity of their feelings makes them superb tireless canvassers but that same intensity helps explain why other Democratic politicians are now uneasy at the prospect of a McGovern nomination Passion in politics tends to elevate the emotional temperature of all the participants At the other extreme of American politics are the people who believe the Vietnam war would have been won long ago if Lyndon Johnson had done back in 196566 all that Mr Nixon has doneinvaded Cambodia mined the harbors bombed with few restrictionsand who are prepared to blame the liberals for staying Johnsons hand Before he was seriously wounded George Wallace had already begun to de velop this liberalstabinthe back theme about Vietnam Many Democratic politicians worry that a Wallace or an Agnew could call up far great er numbers of voters in re sponse to that rallying cry than George McGovern can with his attacks on the war These politicians may be right or they may be wrong but their nervousness about a campaign waged on the war issue is at least understand able As often happens in the struggle for a party nomina tion rival factions have man ufactured issues to distin guish the candidates and have considerably exaggerated such differences as do exist among them To his supporters Mc Govern is established as the pure unsullied hero the man of courage and conviction They see his rivals as stodgy compromisers and practition ers of the old politics Con versely in the eyes of his op ponents McGovern is now perceived as a dangerous radical Ask any voter which of the frequently mentioned Demo cratic candidates has the most liberal record and the odds are that he would answer McGovern Yet a compre hensive analysis of their life time Senate voting records published last December by Americans for Democratic Ac tion  who subsequently en dorsed McGovern overwhelm ingly  ranked Humphrey first with a 97 per cent liberal voting record Muskie second with 93 per cent and McGov ern third with 87 per cent If a few of his votes had been widely known last win ter and spring they might have caused McGovern some difficulty with student audi ences For example when the Selective Service law was be ing considered in 1967 Mc Govern voted against permit ting draft registrants to be represented by a lawyer at draft board hearings He voted against draft deferments for Peace Corps and Vista volun teers He voted against amend ments to prohibit the sending of draftees to Vietnam and to limit military service to 18 months In 1968 he voted to disqualify from Government employment for five years anyone convicted of a felony committed during a riot Like most members of Congress from rural areas he has usu ally voted against gun con trols On balance the discrepan cies between his record and those of Muskie and Hum phrey are unimportant They can be accounted for by the fact that before becoming a figure of Presidential rank McGovern was nursing the conservative constituency of South Dakota The truth is in George Wallaces famous phrase that on domestic is sues there is not a dimes worth of difference between McGovern Muskie and Hum phrey Even on the subject of militarism leaving aside the early record on Vietnam Mc Governs credentials are no better than those of Muskie or Humphrey Humphrey was the first chairman of the Sen ate disarmament subcommit tee one of the fathers of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty a critic of the antiballistic mis sile and probably the best informed man in the Senate on the intricacies of arms con trol Muskie who is currently the disarmament subcommit tee chairman voted against the ABM against the space shuttle and against the Lock heed loan Any one of the three if he became President would cut the military budgetYet by capturing the peace vote early by attacking his opponents as spokesmen of the Establishment and the old politics McGovern established the myth that if voters wanted a change in na tional priorities and a turn away from militarism then he was the inevitable choice FOR a new hero leading a crusade there has to be a New Politics This myth had its beginning in 1968 in the Mc Carthy campaign There was an upsurge of participation in politics by many people young and old who were not normally active Antiwar emotions found expression in the hardfought primaries In 1972 the same phenomenon has occurred The turnout in several of the primaries has been higher than ever before New party rules some of them drafted under Senator McGoverns leadership have opened precinct and dis trict caucuses to new faces If the increased participa tion is selfevident it is much less clear what is specifically new about this kind of politics Doortodoor canvassing tele phone calls to check voter sentiment and intensive ef forts to get ones known sup porters to the polls on pri mary day are the old tech niques of every functioning ward heeler In performing these basic political tasks the McGovern volunteers are doing what the Citizens for Eisenhower and the Volun teers for Stevenson did in the spirited campaign of 1952 In most states political machines fueled by patronage have been on the scrap heap for decades Successful candidates for municipal and state offices have operated outside of wornout party structures or captured them from within by mobilizing citizen manpower As soon as these familiar insurgent techniques began to pay off for him McGovern made it clear that the New Politics did not mean that he would refuse to deal with George Meany or Richard Daley or that he would seek to overthrow the exist ing Congressional leadership While waiting for the favor able returns from the Massa chusetts primary he told David Broder of The Washing ton Post on April 25 Some of the more rigid purists in my camp dont even want me to talk to those people but theyre just going to have to take me on my own terms Theyve got to understand that I am a politician and if I am going to be the leader of this country Ive got to have communications with all segments of the country Ive always felt at ease with party leaders myself and I think theyll find me compatible Having been in Congress myself for so long I would really lean over backwards to try and develop a close per sonal relationship with people like Carl Albert Wilbur Mills and Mike Mansfield and these other key people I think it can be done I know they have some nervousness over my advanced positions But they also know that Ive served in both the House and Senate over a period of years  and while I havent been a member of the inner club I havent offended a lot of people either and my guess is that on a mantoman basis I could sit down with anyone of them and deal These are sensible political comments by a politician who wants to win and to govern effectively What is striking about them is not their novel ty but their conventionality They could have been uttered by John F Kennedy in 1960 or by any of McGoverns rivals in 1972 Since the techniques are not new and the political ob jectives are not revolutionary the novelty of the New Poli tics may lie in the issues McGovern has raised At this point however the road be comes quite muddy In barn storming around college campuses in recent years McGovern has seemed to sug gest in extemporaneous re plies in question periods and news conferences that he favored the legalization of marijuana abortion on de mand and immediate amnes ty for military deserters and draft exiles Those same issueswhat came to be called the AMA questionshaunted Muskie in his every campus appear ance Thus at the University of Florida campus in Gaines ville last February proMc Govern students captured all the floor microphones and badgered Muskie on these questions for an angry 40 minutes Muskie doggedly but futilely explained that he fa vored a reduction of criminal penalties for marijuana use but not its legalization until research made clearer wheth er its use was for some per sons a step toward heroin ad diction He opposed abortion on demand insisting society must protect the right to life of the unborn child He op posed amnesty until the war was over and the problem could be calmly reviewed For these positions the pro McGovern forces pilloried Muskie Thus Verne Newton writing in The New Demo crat in its May 1972 issue attacked liberals who backed Muskie and asked Where can they point to one change they instituted in Muskies nonposition campaign What about amnesty abortion legalization of marijuana Muskies positions on all three still remain identical to Nix ons Then Hubert Humphrey in the later primaries began criticizing McGoverns opin ions on these issues With remarkable speed McGov ern bicycled away from what had been thought to be his opinions He made it clear that he is not for amnesty until the war is over that he favors the decriminaliza tion of marijuana but not its legalization and that the question of abortion should be left to a woman and her doctor to decide This last opinion reveals a certain con fusion in McGoverns mind since in most states the law does not permit a woman and her doctor to decide the mat ter and this is the whole point of the abortion contro versy But McGovern has be gun to dismiss the entire sub ject of abortion as hopelessly abstruse It is like asking me to comment on the Virgin Birth of Christ he told one interviewer in early June More substantial are Mc Governs complex proposals to redistribute wealth by drastically reordering the tax system and replacing welfare with a Minimum Income Grant of 1000 annually to every man woman and child a grant that would be entire ly recouped by the Federal tax collector from those in the upper and uppermiddle income brackets The changes McGovern has proposed would raise taxes substantially for corporations and for wealthy individuals  to some extent in fact for everyone earning over 12000 The need for tax reform is indisputable despite the protestations of former Treas ury Secretary John Connally that all is for the best in the best of all Internal Revenue Codes Politically McGovern has touched a live nerve in pressing the tax issue What is dubious is the wisdom of placing in the Congressional Record detailed proposals from his academic advisers which have not been simpli fied and made understand able for campaign pur poses A political speech is a cartoon not an etching Theodore Roosevelt used to say Having laid out too many etchings for his enemies to peruse McGovern has had to accept the awkward necessity of redrafting them and ex plaining them away His wel fare proposals have been sent back to a study group be cause the figures dont add up On May 22 McGovern took a fullpage ad in the Wall Street Journal to explain to businessmen what his tax proposals do not mean Simi lar revisions and explanations may yet be required for the alternative military budget that McGovern has set forth to reduce Pentagon spending by 30billion IN trying to accommodate his radical programs to his changed situation as his partys prospective nominee McGovern is following the exact opposite of the usual candidates course Ordinarily a candidate blurs the edges of issues sufficiently to retain his freedom to maneuver and to keep himself in the middle ground where dwells the great majority of voters Once he becomes the nominee he may sometimes assure the support of a particular bloc of voters by committing himself to a hard and fast position By contrast McGovern made ambitious de tailed proposals to prove his credibility when he was a lonely outsider striving to break through His supporters regarded those proposals as proof of his sincerity while everyone else ignored them As McGovern has moved closer to the nomination and the serious struggle to oust President Nixon his enthu siasm for these brave ventures in the New Politics has visibly waned With increasing frequency he stresses his conservative origins Let me say I come from the state of South Dakota We dont send wild eyed radicals to the U S Sen ate from South Dakota Yet a candidate shifting ground on the issues runs as many risks as one who tries to remake his personal image particularly if his strength derivesas McGoverns does from issues McGovern can back away from peripheral issues like abortion and mari juana but it is too late for him to abandon the broad out lines of his positions on tax reform income redistribution and the alternative military budget even if he wanted to do so which he shows no signs of doing What is novel in McGoverns politics turns out in the end to be the constituency he has cultivated and whose devotion has brought him to the thresh hold of the nomination He has captured the growth areas of American politics the young the huge academic andresearch complexes the better  educated independent minded voters His political problem now is to win the confidence of key groups in the old Democratic coalition blacks Jews blue collar workers of ethnic background Most Democratic politicians by the time they reach the Presidential level  Hubert Humphrey is the supreme ex amplehave spoken to so many NAACP conventions Israel Bond rallies and union conventions and marched in so many St Patricks Day and Pulaski Day parades that their standing with these voters is not in doubt McGovern by contrast is a comparative stranger In the brief time available before November he has to win them over by convincing party leaders union bosses and special interest group spokes men that although he is not one of them he is at least in the old political expression a man you can talk to This again is a matter of manipulating symbols and making the right gestures as well as engaging in intensive private persuasion of key people It does not however mean he should disavow his radical programs On the contrary his best strategy is to go for broke hoping that the tides of unrest and dissatisfaction in the country are powerful enough to carry him to vic tory Since the people I have called the true believers pro vide the dynamic of the Mc Govern effort he cannot af ford to dull their enthusiasm Notwithstanding their en thusiasm however no one should underestimate the dif ficulty of their political task Many Americans who want radical changes definitely do not want the kind of changes George McGovern has in mind This brings us to an other chapter in the McGovern legend The mythology of this political year asserts that McGovern can capture the terrible firebreathing dragon of American politics The dragon of course is the Wal lace vote that 14 per cent of the electorate that nearly held the balance of power in 1968 and that Richard Nixon ever since entering the White House has been ardently woo ing from the Supreme Court to the school bus stop AFTER McGovern and Wal lace both did well in the Wis consin and Pennsylvania pri maries the myth sprang up that they are rivals for the same alienated Imfedup vote McGovern encouraging this notion chided Muskie for attacking Wallace and his supporters headon He sug gested that what was needed was positive programs like his own to capture the Wal lace vote Many of the people around McGovern are veter ans of the Robert Kennedy campaign and remember how he seemed to appeal in In diana to both blacks and Wal laceite bluecollar workers Their hope that McGovern can show the same reconcil ing Kennedy appeal is a par ticularly cherished dream Of all the McGovern myths it has the least foundation in reality After analyzing interviews with primary voters in Florida Wisconsin and Pennsylvania The Timess redoubtable Mr Rosenthal reported on April 28 The widely accepted alienation interpretation of the 1972 Democratic pri maries is seriously misleading and probably false The typical McGovern and Wallace voters have almost nothing in common The interviews showed McGovern voters are strongly hostile to Mr Nixon while twothirds of the Wal lace voters like the President and his policies McGovern voters see the war as the most important issue while Wallace voters place it far lower on their list of con cerns putting a crackdown on crime drugs and welfare abuse as their highest objec tive Most McGovern voters favor a shift from military to civilian spending while fewer than onethird of Wallace voters favor cutting military spending Wherever McGovern has tried to compete directly with Wallace for votes he has been routed The only nation al Democrat to do well against Wallace in the primaries has been Humphrey He defeated him in Indiana and West Vir ginia and finished second in Florida and Maryland Although McGovern is prob ably the Democratic candidate least likely to capture the Wallace dragon the myth survives It is related to the final supremely ironic ele ment of the McGovern legend that goes like this Since McGovern swept the primaries he is the choice of the peo ple and the nomination of any other candidate would be undemocratic In re ality McGovern won a large portion of his delegates in the nonprimary states where his true believers demonstrated their skill in getting their peo ple to precinct and district meetings and their tenacity in sitting out their opponents until delegates were finally chosen at 2 or 3 AM IT is true that McGovern won a few of the primaries but it is also true that he lost a good many and that he care fully avoided more than a token effort in most of the states where his prospects were unpromising Indeed the counterquestion could be askedIs the man who was defeated by Muskie in New Hampshire and Illinois de feated by Humphrey in Penn sylvania and Ohio and de feated by Wallace in Florida Maryland and Michigan real ly the choice of the people In New Hampshire the McGovern forces discounted their defeat in advance They arbitrarily invented the crite rion that if they could hold Muskie below 50 per cent of the vote it would constitute a victory for them So suc cessfully did they propagate this myth that when Muskie defeated McGovern 46 per cent to 37 per cent many in terpreted it as a defeat Yet in any election a 9point spread is a large margin verg ing on a landslide McGovern never won any of the sub sequent contested primaries by so large a margin Signifi cantly the 50 cent crite rion was never heard of again after New Hampshire The Florida primary was a disaster for McGovern as he finished a distant sixth Here the McGovern ploy was sim ply denial It was never a state where we expected to do well the candidate ex plained That was perfectly true The mystery was why the other liberal Northern Democrats thought they would do well in a state which has gone Republican in four of the last five Presiden tial elections and which ex cept for the city of Miami has for decades sent one of the most reactionary Congres sional delegations to Wash ington By the simple but shrewd maneuver of denying that Florida was very im portant McGovern glossed over the fact that he trailed Wallace Humphrey Jackson Muskie and Lindsay Its the man who was defeated in New Hampshire Illinois Pennsylvania Ohio Florida Maryland and Michigan really the choice of the people Then came the McGovern debacle in Illinois The con trast between the differing interpretations placed on the Illinois and Wisconsin pri maries is instructive Illinois is a true weathervane state having voted for the winner in every national election since 1900 It is also twice as populous and therefore twice as electorally important as Wisconsin McGovern and Muskie entered rival slates of delegates in Illinois and spent approximately the same amount of time campaigning for their slates Both avoided challenging Mayor Richard Daley in Cook County The result was Muskie 62 dele gates McGovern 15 Two weeks later McGovern won the Wisconsin primary The state is highly favorably ground for him with its long antiwar tradition dating back to the LaFollettes and World War I and with thousands of students from the radicalized campus at the University of Wisconsin to serve as his shock troops In a crowded field he polled 30 per cent of the total a respectable but not an impressive or astonish ing showing According to a New York Times survey it the votes of Republicans who allowed to vote in the Democratic primary in Wisconsinwere subtracted McGovern would have fin ished in a deadheat with Humphrey This cloudy ambiguous victory following upon three successive drubbings was the first bit of substance for the myth of McGoverns vast popular appeal Wisconsin was clearly a defeat for Hum phrey who had reason to hope that he might win there It need not have been a setback for Muskie if he had been as astute as McGovern and picked a few states in which to concentrate his efforts In stead he set himself the im possible standard of trying to win or do well in the first nine primaries in the hopes of capturing the nomination early The significance of Mc Governs victory in Wisconsin was greatly magnified by the fact of Muskies defeat easily predictable though it was With the next two primaries in Massachusetts and Pennsyl vania falling on the same day April 25 the candidates had to choose where to invest their time Humphrey and Muskie wrote off Massachu setts and fought one another for Pennsylvania the much larger prize McGovern campaigned in tensively in Massachusetts He was again on favorable terrain and had no active op position from any of his major rivals In the closing days of the campaign he re ceived a politically potent en dorsement from members of the Kennedy family Against this background his Massa chusetts showing was sur prisingly weak He polled barely half the vote with the orphaned Muskie slate and minor candidates such as Representatives Shirley Chis holm and Wilbur Mills divid ing up the other half Yet the McGovern managers had poormouthed their chances so consistently in the pri maries up to that time and many of his supporters seemed so dazed that a peace candidate could win that Massachusetts was hailed as an astonishing victory It tempted McGovern to try his luck again in the in dustrial Middle West But in Ohio as in Illinois he again met defeat this time at the hands of Humphrey Two weeks later McGovern and Humphrey were both routed in Michigan by Wallace Since Ohio Michigan and Illinois are crucial states for any Democrat attempting to de feat Nixon the weak McGov ern showings in these states are gloomy Democratic por tents for November It was not until Nebraska that McGovern was able to defeat either Muskie or Hum phrey in a straight twoman contest in which both cam paigned But McGoverns nar row victory over Humphrey in Nebraska had its alarming aspect That was the first pri mary in which either of his major antagonists attacked McGovern and his programs aggressively and the attacks had effect Senator Jackson had earlier criticized McGov ern sharply but since Jack sons candidacy never got off the ground his criticisms had little impact Hostile circulars and advertisements in Nebras ka called attention to McGov erns purportedly liberal views on abortion and marijuana The primary returns showed a heavy antiMcGovern vote in the predominantly Catho lic wards of Omaha Senator Humphrey warned that Mc Governs plan for a drastic cut in the military budget would mean a loss of jobs in and around the Strategic Air Com mand base in Nebraska The returns showed an antiMc Govern vote in areas where most SAC employes live McGOVERN fought to counter these damaging at tacks in the California primary His success there was his one solid and reassuring achieve ment in a big state The is sue had been largely settled by the time the New York primary was held while Mc Governs victories in other states such as Rhode Island New Jersey South Dakota and Oregon were on the Mas sachusetts model that is his young gungho organization had no serious opposition For the first time McGovern was able to break through among black voters Though losing Los Angeles and Orange counties to Humphrey he did reasonably well among indus trial workers and strength ened the hopes of his man agers that he could indeed broaden his political base beyond the young the aca demics and the betteredu cated middleincome voters During the primaries re porters often quoted the amusing gibes of Frank Man kiewicz chief political co ordinator and press spokes man for McGovern One of Mankiewiczs literate witti cisms was directed against Muskie I am reminded of what Gertrude Stein said when she saw Oakland Cali

Mr. Nixon's Theology,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/03/archives/mr-nixons-theology.html,PRINCETON N J  When Richard Nixon assumed the Presidency in 1969 he diagnosed the malaise of this nation as a crisis of the spirit and he promised that his Administration would meet that crisis with an an swer of the spirit Since the inaugural Mr Nixon has done his utmost to meet this pledge He invariably at tempts to root his policies in the certainties of moral even religious conviction In his speeches and policy statements he regularly defends his decisions by an appeal to conscience Mr Nixons Theology Mr Nixon seems to believe that American culture is threatened by the erosion of traditional values and that it is his role as President to defend what he construes to be the nations Most cherished ideals On a number of occasions he has leaped to the defense of the beleaguered moral law particularly when he has felt a threat to those civil laws that have been erected as a dike against the tides of public decadence Even before the National Commis sion on Marijuana and Drug Abuse began its study Mr Nixon rejected the possibility of removing the crim inal penalties imposed against the private use of marijuana He called a special White House Conference on Drug Abuse inviting eighty of the nations religious leaders to join him in a national effort to solve this spir itual problem In a similar vein President Nixon categorically dismissed the report issued by the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography He rejected the sug gestion that laws pertaining to the sale of sexual materials to consent ing adults be relaxed and he labeled the commission report morally bank rupt To counter the trend toward repeal of abortion laws in a number of states Mr Nixon has invoked his religious training arguing that policy of abortion on demand repre sents a threht to the sanctity of human life Likewise he has tied his proposal for a work requirement in welfare reform to principles drawn from the puritan ethic of his parents And he vetoed recent legislation for a Federal system of daycare centers arguing that the widespread use of day care would weaken the American family and thus undermine the chief support of our moral and religious principles In foreign policy too President Nix ons characteristic appeal is to the conscience He defends his troubled Vietnamization program arguing that a withdrawal of support for the South Vietnamese regime would constitute a renunciation of our morality He has insisted upon the maintenance of a strong military presence around the world linking his views somewhat ironically to a Quaker concern for peace It will of course be argued that Mr Nixon has shaped these policies not so much by the dictates of con science as by the calculations of polit ical expediency Yet what appears as merely expedient to his opponents may at the same time be viewed as a legitimate expression of the public will Though Mr Nixons selfrighteous style often invites ad hominem crit icism his policies deserve a more reasoned reply for they do rest upon widely shared values in American society Mr Nixon represents a manifestation of the Protestant ethic so long a part of the American political scene His belief in hhrd work competitive indi vidual effort a Spartan life style patriotism and the nationalistic reli gion of his friend Billy Graham are not particularly unusual in American politicians But as presented by Mr Nixon these values seem particularly anachronistic and divisive Mr Nixons is a religion of a fading majority and he advances it as the solution to our problems at precisely the time when we are witnessing revival of the many religions of the nations minorities the Jesus move ment mysticism and the Catholic left to mention only a few Today we see a confusion of many religions rather than a consensus con cerning the nations destiny In the melee of this historical moment it will be difficult for any leader to evoke a sense of common purpose And yet an increasingly powerful brief can be made for a new constellation of values More and more the public is sensitive to the need for new forms of community as a necessary corrective to raw individualism and competition We are discovering the importance of creativity and social change as opposed to a blind devotion toward established institutions or careers We are alert to the interdependence of nations and cultures as opposed to chauvinist pride in the American way And we are recognizing the varied contributions of major world religions as a corrective to the exclusive claims of American civil religion Mr Nixon was correct at the time of his inaugural We do lace a crisit of the spirit The most important question of this decade may be whether we can find leaders who will unite the country around the most forward and comprehensive values rather than con tinuing to divide the country by defending the narrow moralisms of a dying ethic Hence in 1972 the crisis of the nation has become a political and personal crisis for Richard Nixon The tragedy of Mr Nixon is not that of an evil man who has abandoned the public trust but rather that of a moral man whose most cherished ideals are not commensurate with the realities of this time
Abortion Cases Creating Friction on High Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/05/archives/abortion-cases-creating-friction-on-high-court.html,WASHINGTON July 4The Supreme Courts decision to de lay its ruling on two abortion appeals until the next term has led to frictions within the Court and suggestions that Chief Jus tice Warren E Burger has over stepped his authority to pick which Justices will write which majority opinions The controversy centers on the Courts action June 26 de ferring until its next term any decision on two cases challeng ing the constitutionality of the antiabortion laws of Georgia and Texas As a result the appeals will he reargued before all nine Justices next term and decided by the full Court which has tended to be reluctant to strike down state criminal laws The appeals were initially argued and submitted for deci sion before the sevenmember bench which before the addi tion of Justices Lewis F Powell Jr and William H Rehnquist was notably more liberal in its decisions than the current nine member Court has been After the two cases were argued last December the Court appeared to line up in favor of striking down the laws either as an infringement on womens rights to control their bodies or on physicians rights to practice their profession freely By holding the cases for de cision by the full Court the re sult could bebut by no means necessarily will bechanged and the laws could be upheld The decision to reargue the cases reportedly was caused at least in part by Justice Harry A Blackmuns long delay in drafting the majority opinion He was assigned that task by Chief Justice Burger who ulti mately lined up as a dissenter The crux of the controversy is that Chief Justices have tra ditionally assigned majority opinions only when they were in the majority When they dis sent the senior Justice in the majority normally designates the Justice who shall write the Courts opinion William O Douglas the Courts senior member in serv ice was reportedly a member of the majority in favor of striking down the antiabortion laws He reportedly drafted but did not releasean opinion charging that Chief Justice Burger had improperly assumed the authority to assign which ultimately led up to the delay Justices who could be reached refused to comment on the internal court matter How ever the basic facts behind the controversy were confirmed from sources close to the Court When the Justices voted on the abortion cases on Dec 13 there was some uncertainty as to the lineup In addition to the constitutional issues the Court had to decide if Federal courts should interfere with the en forcement of state law in such cases Some sources have asserted that Justice Burger was in the minority with Justice Byron R White in a 5to2 division They say that the Chief Justice had previously asserted the author ity to assign majority opinions when he was in the minority and that he circulated an as signment sheet doing so in this case Another extremely wellplaced source insisted that Justice Burger had never asserted such an authority This source said that on that occasion and a few others the Chief Justice either voted tentatively with the ma jority and later decided to switch or that on confused and uncertain votes he mistakenly believed he was in the majority when he assigned the majority opinion It is known that Justice Blackmun who is a slow and meticulous opinion writer did not produce his opinion until some Justices thought it was too late for the dissenters to prepare their responses The Chief Justice requested a delay and Justice Blackmun agreed With Justices Powell Rehn quist and White agreeing this gave the necessary five votes to grant the delay One source suggested that other Justices who had favored striking down the abortion laws may have joined in granting the delay so that such an important question could be decided by the full court In any event if the same Justices who reportedly op posed the antiabortion laws this term hold firm after the rearguments the vote to strike them down will be at least 5 to 4 Justice Blackmun has not often voted against the Burger bloc but as a former counsel for the Mayo Clinic in Minne sota he developed a keen sensi tivity to the problems of doctors Justice Douglas as is his cus tom left the Court several weeks before the end of the term to go to his wilderness retreat in Goose Prairie Wash He reportedly left a dissent ing opinion to be filed if the Court decided to delay the cases detailing the behindthe scenes events that led up to the delay It was not filed and efforts to reach him there today were unsuccessful
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/07/archives/abortion-law-debate.html,To the Editor Marvin Kohl in his letter of June 28 performs a masterpiece of verbal open field running in evading issues on his way to his goal of justifying the New York abortion law He asserts that to minimize injustice and avoid unneces sary suffering are a higher moral calling than opposition to death However the use of terms like to minimize injustice and unnecessary suffering begs the question Some suffering because it is preferable to death is necessary to minimize injus tice Otherwise a mother would be justified in killing her noisy infant son to spare herself the unnecessary suffering of sleepless nights The trouble with such a conclusionas with Mr Kohls generalizationis that it disregards the existence of conflict ing interests A central issue in the abortion law debate is under what conceivable cir cumstances if any the human embryo should be protected against the power of the potential mother to kill it It is not totally dispositive of that issue as Mr Kohl seems to believe to carve out a definition of a human being that excludes an unborn human in fant Our laws protect even a dog in the street against some abuses ROBERT D HUGHES New York June 30 1972

Court of Appeals Upholds State's '70 Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/08/archives/court-of-appeals-upholds-states-70-abortion-law-rejects-5-to-2.html,The Court of Appeals yester day upheld New Yorks liberal ized abortion law rejecting by a 5to2 vote an argument that fetuses are legal entities with constitutional rights The decision by the court the states highest came in a case brought by Robert M Byrn a 40yearold bachelor and law professor at Fordham University Mr Byrn had argued that the 1970 state law that allows a woman to have an abortion on demand until the 24th week of pregnancy violated the 14th Amendment of the Constitu tion which holds in part that no state shall deprive any per son of life liberty or property without due process of law In other court actions yester day in New York the following rulings were announced The Court of Appeals up held construction of the citys controversial lowincome hous ing project in the Forest Hills section of Queens Acting State Supreme Court Justice Joseph A Martinis dis missed indictments charging three borrowers with fraud against the Municipal Loan Program for renovating slum housing here The majority opinion in the abortion case written by Judge Charles B Breitel said that unborn children have never been recognized as per sons in the law in the whole sense Judge Breitel wrote that while various religions and philosophies might regard a conceived child as a person it is not true however that the legal order necessarily cor responds to the natural order The Constitution does not confer or require legal person ality for the unborn his opin ion said adding that the Leg islature may or it may do something less as it does in limited abortion statutes and provide some protection far short of conferring legal per sonality In a concurring opinion Judge Matthew J Jasen said that the formidable task of resolving this issue is not for the courts Rather Judge Jasen said the extent to which fetal life should be protected is a value judgement not committed to the discretion of judges but repos ing rather in the representative branch of government The Constitution did not proscribe the action of the Legislature in passing the pres ent abortion law Judge Jasen wrote and since there is a re sponsible basis for it the valid ity of the statute should be sustained Dissenter Cites Cruelty The majority opinion pro voked an impassioned dissent from Judge Adrian P Burke The argument of the five judges he said was not only made by Nazi lawyers and judges at Nuremberg but also is ad vanced today by the Soviets in Eastern Europe The complete disregard for the fetuss right to life Judge Burke wrote is in keeping with the cruelties which ante dated the age of the lawmakers of Judaism and certainly is a return to the barbarism of the English people of the early cen turies Judge Burke also took issue with contentions that the law which has no residency require ment and is considered to be the most liberal in the country was necessary to afford women abortions in medically safe facilities rather than force them to socalled back alley abor tionists Examples of justice are more merciful than the un bounded exercise of pity for those few unfortunate pregnant women who fall into the hands of the few inexpert doctors Judge Burke wrote To over come this selfcreated problem by destroying hundreds of thousands of fetuses by state law is uncivilized The other dissenter Judge John F Scileppi said It is my firm moral and legal belief that life begins at conception To conclude otherwise is to contenance genocide and sub ject our population to what the majority so casually cate gorizes a legislative determina tion of policy Judge Scileppi said Our system of govern ment is rooted in the natural law and it is against those stric tures that our legislation as well as our Constitution must be judged The three other judges sup porting Judges Breitel and Ja sen in the majority opinion were Chief Judge Stanley H Fuld Judge James Gibson and Judge Francis Bergen The majority ruling upheld a decision in February in which an Appellate Division decision in Brooklyn affirmed the con stitutionality of the current abortion law by overturning a State Supreme Court ruling that could have halted abortions in municipal hospitals in New York City Last night Mr Byrn as spokesman for the New York Legal Defense and Education Fund for the Unborn said that the case is not over We are buoyed by the vig orous dissents in the Court of Appeals he said in a state ment we will appeal immedi ately to the Supreme Court of the United States The liberalized abortion law narrowly passed the Legisla ture in 1970 after intense and emotional debate It was signed by Governor Rockefeller who this Year vetoed a measure that passed both houses repealing the 1970 law The repeal bill would have restored the states old law which permitted abortions only when a mothers life was in jeopardy In voteing the repeal bill the Governor cited the personal vilification and political coer cion that surrounded the is sue in the Legislature and said that there had been no justifi cation for condemning hun dreds of thousands of women to the dark ages once again The staunchest opponent of the present abortion law is the Roman Catholic Church which has been helped by dozens of right to life groups around the state in seeking the laws repeal

Science,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/09/archives/a-new-eye-into-the-womb-ultrasonics.html,A 16yearold girl was experiencing a familiar modern dilemma She was unmarried and it appeared quite pregnant When she came to St Lukes Hos pital Center in New York City the girl was distraught She informed the examining physician Dr Lajos Von Micsky that her father a strict mor alist of the old school had taken her condition as a personal affront and thrown her out of the house but she insisted tearfully that she was a vir gin Dr Von Micsky placed the girl on the examining table and externally examined her abdomen with the rub bercoated tip of a long probe which was attached to an electronic console As the doctor gently moved the probe from spot to spot the screen out lined the shapes that represented the contents of the girls abdomen After about half an hour Dr Von Micsky told the girl the big news she was definitely not pregnant de spite her shape and despite the posi tive results of two standard immuno logical pregnancy tests taken earlier She was it appeared the victim of one of natures cruelest little jests a teratoma an ovarian tumor that can imitate the organs and tissues of a fetus outside the uterus Xrays which are generally shunned in the early months of pregnancy be cause of potential harm to the fetus soon verified the finding They ac tually showed that the tumor con tained fetal teeth cartilage and brain tissue  the result of some mysterious transformation of cells Eventually the cyst was found to be benign and was satisfactorily treated Dr Von Micsky associate clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University is one of the nations leading authorities in a new type of obstetrical diagnosis  the use of sound waves that vibrate so fast theyre inaudible to the human ear to sound out the womb What Dr Von Micsky did in the examina tion room at St Lukes was to scan the girls abdomen in the way a ships sonar man sweeps the bottom of the sea The harmless sound waves passed through the different tissues at speeds that depend on the density of the tissue As they collided with the dif ferent body masses they sent back echoes which were picked up by a tiny supersensitive microphone in the probe and turned into electrical signals on a television screen From the pattern of these echoes doctors can at a glance tell a lot about the organs and tissues  the location of the uterus for instance and whether there is anything in it They can pick up tumors and other abnormalities and even errant inter uterin devices which Xrays often miss In New York the ultrasonic busi ness has been given a boost by the states liberalized abortion law Both St Lukes and Downstate Medical Cen ter in Brooklyn which also has a busy ultrasound lab report they are en countering more and more pregnancy cases One reason suggests Nurse El len Cromb who supervises the Down state lab is that ultrasound can di agnose pregnancy 18 days after con ception compared to a minimum of 28 days by other methods It can also determine the length of gestation time with pinpoint accuracy and aid in determining the type of abortion needed Some of the other medical applica tions of ultrasound  Multiple births It can pick out twins as early as the eighth week of pregnancy 12 weeks for triplets as compared to the 20th week with X rays  Physical abnormailties It has proven its worth in the diagnosis of at least 40 different abnormal situations particularly those involving problems with the placenta Among them pla centa previa a condition in which the placenta appears ahead of the baby at turn and may cut off the supply of oxygen to the fetus before the doctor can do anything about it The doctor is better prepared with the early warning and precise infor mation provided by ultrasound  Research It enables science to look inside a world in large measure hith erto hidden from detailed medical ex amination Already the first basic curves of early development of the fetus have been obtained and the po sitions have been mapped with great precision In some cases such as those involving caeserian sections exact knowledge of the size location and stage of development can mean the difference between life and death of the fetus and the mother Perhaps the most fascinating diag nostic use of obstetrical ultrasound has been in the unmasking of false pregnancies known to medical man as pseudocyesis Dr Von Micsky re called one woman who essentially hypnotized herself into all the symp toms of pregnancy probably out of an intense desire to have a child Dr Von Micsky scanned her body with the probing sound and found a tiny nonpregnant uterus The lady was indignant and threatened to sue the hospital for spiriting away her baby As the doctor put it She conned her pituitary into pregnancy symptoms by putting the necessary hormones out of the gland but she couldnt the sound waves Dr Von Micsky who invents medi cal instruments when hes not deliv ering babies has a new ultrasonic device He says it will not only do all the obstetrical soundings but will also differentiate soft cancers in the body from normal tissue He believes his latest invention will be useful for example in screening females for ovar ian cancer in the very early stages  at a point where lives can be saved Mr Edson is a free lance writer who

McGovern Leaders Seek to Woo Delegation Foes,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/09/archives/mcgovern-leaders-seek-to-woo-delegation-foes.html,TRENTON  The bitter ness from the 1968 campaign remains The oldline regu lars and the new politicians of George McGovern view each other with deep dis trust The June 6 primary election campaign left wounds But with it all the dele gates that New Jersey sent off from Newark Airport to the Democratic convention today in Miami Beach have managed to avoid cutting each others throats On the surface relations have been reasonably friendly After the primary elec tion Senator McGovern was in command of 73 of New Jerseys 109 delegates Sena tor Hubert H Humphrey had won nine and the remaining 27 were uncommitted The McGovern forces were thus in a position to run roughshod over the 36 regu lars Accommodation the Word But they didnt because from the first Mrs Anne C Martindell the delegation chairman and Daniel M Horgan the McGovern floor leader and the director of the primary campaign real ized they had everything to gain by being nice They argued that the regu lars should get four of the 12 seats on the conventions standing committees allotted to New Jersey The regulars wound up with three They didnt like it but realized that things could have been worse Mr Horgan and Mrs Mar tindell went out of their way to court county leaders they had either defeated or forced to sit out the primary And there was very little gloating or crowing about de feating corrupt political ma chines and the like When Senator McGovern visited Atlantic City here late last month to ad dress the annual convention of the National Education As sociation he met not with his own delegates but with the county leaders and the labor leaders who had op posed him and who have yet to be shown that he can even come within 200000 votes of carrying the state The gettogether was rea sonably cordial and the can didate took pains to point out that he hag always been a party man  all the way back to the days when he spent his time almost single handedly building a Demo cratic organization in South Dakota McGovern Gain Reported Meanwhile Mr Horgan has been quietly talking with organization leaders and delegates and apparent ly with success because the national McGovern organiza tion now counts 11 ostensi bly uncommitted delegates in New Jersey as its own Mr Horgan believes that when it comes time for New Jersey to cast its votes on Wednesday George McGov ern will get 100 of them But Senator McGoverns inroads among the regulars stem mainly from his obvi ous strength and the con viction that his nomination is inevitable rather than from any meeting of the minds This view was reflected in a comment by Joel R Jacob son of South Orange who was elected on the organiza tion ticket in Essex County and has declared his alle giance to Senator McGovern The education director of the United Auto Workers in New Jersey and its chief lob byist Mr Jacobson has long been a member in good standing of organized labors left wing here But he feels he has little in common with the McGovern bloc Horgan and Mrs Martin dell are trying to work to ward an accommodation with the regulars because they are smart enough to know they cant twin without it Mr Jacobson said But I see absolutely no evidence that anyone else is moving with them I get the impression that they [the McGovern delegates] toler ate us  that when Im at a meeting with them Im there by their good suffer ance But then I tell myself What the hell why should I take it out on McGovern because of his people One McGovern supporter who asked that his name be withheld summed up the sit uation this way They [the McGovern delegates] simply have a different perception of themselves than the regu lars do The McGovern peo ple really believe that they are being open and fair and they dont realize that they are rubbing other people the wrong way If anything was responsible for the uneasy truce in New Jersey it was the fact that the McGovern delegates did not adopt formal positions the regulars couldnt live with In other states McGovern delegations  have endorsed abortion on demand legal ized marijuana and in Min nesota homosexual marriage There seems to be no ready reason why the Mc Govern delegates in New Jersey have steered clear of formal positions except per haps that the primary came so late there simply wasnt time for rounds of meetings One thing both camps agree on is that Senator Ed ward F Kennedy of Mas sachusetts would be by far the best choice Senator Mc Govern could make for a run ning mate Also there is surprisingly widespread agreement even in the McGovern camp that some efforts should be made to find a common ground with Gov George C Wallace of Alabama Martin Devoursney a Mc Govern delegate from Ridge field Park put it this way I think overtures should be made toward Wallace Like McGovern Wallace has tre mendous support among av erage people and like Mc Govern he is an antiEstab lishment guy They have that much in common And Wal lace represents millions of people You just cant cut that many people out Both camps will caucus to morrow at the delegations headquarters in Miami Beach the Sheraton Beach Motel The entire delegation will meet tomorrow afternoon

stands Frank Mankiewicz said its going to be a rollicking convention You know we can get some electric canes and whoopee cushions On Friday the air went out of the whoopee cushions and perhaps out of Mr McGoverns prospect for an easy firstballot nomination at the Demo cratic National Convention starting to morrow in Miami Beach The Supreme Court in a 6to3 verdict declared in effect that the Federal judiciary had no business interfering with the Demo crats rights to fight among themselves For nearly a century and a half the national political parties them selves have determined controversies regarding the seating of delegates to their conventions Chief Justice War ren E Burger wrote for the majority Its effect was a victory for the coa lition of rivals who combined late last month in thek conventions Credentials Committee to strip Senator McGovern of 151mbre than halfof the dele gates he had won in Californias winnertakeall primary And it was small consolation to him that the Su preme Court simultaneously let stand a Credentials Committee vote to un seat Mayor Richard J Daley and 58 uncommitted Chicago allies even though most of the Illinois replace ments were proMcGovern Technically the Supreme Court did not rule on the merits of the California or Illinois challenge The majority noting that the convention was about to begin and aware that its vacations had been interrupted by a rare recon vocation of the Court merely stayed the decision of the Court of Appeals That meant as Associate Justice Thur good Marshall pointed out in a sting ing dissent that the Supreme Court could still take up the issue after the convention and perhaps have no choice but to declare the convention null and void and to require that it be repeated The Court action was but the latest bizarre twist in the Democrats most protracted costly and unorthodox quadrennial attempt to settle on a Presidential candidate As the 5000 delegates and alternates and at least seven times as many influence seek ers journalists grifters prostitutes demonstrators and militiamen began their bivouac on The Beach the up shot was that Mr McGovern still loomed as the most likely winner when it all comes to a head on Wednesday But if so he would have to do it the hard waywith a show of strength tomorrow night sufficient to win back the disputed California delegates and to restore a sense of momentum to his candidacy It will take 1509 delegate votes to win the nomination and with out the 151 under question from Cali fornia Mr McGoverns sure total stood around 1340 Mr McGovern had already begun ap pealing to Senator Edmund S Muskie of Maine for support on the California issue before the Supreme Court acted But Mr Muskie was continuing to plead neutrality on the delegate chal lenge while his supporters worked with organized labor and the backers of Senator Hubert H Humphrey of Minnesota and Gov George C Wallace of Alabama to try to cripple the McGovern Candidacy The California thing as Senator McGovern referred to it had its sticky parliamentary aspects too The deci sive points could turn out to be The rulings by Lawrence F OBrien the party chairman on whether to hear the Illinois or the California challenge first  whether the 120 unchallenged McGovern delegates from California could vote on the Califor nia issue  and who indeed would be eligible to vote on efforts to over turn his own rulings The delegates upon whom Mr Mc Govern is counting to see him through these rough moments were elected in primaries or selected in party cau cuses under reform rules instigated by a party commission the Senator chaired The rules were intended to eliminate the aura of backroom deal ing One of the most intriguing and unanswered questions is how well these new Democratic deliberators will take to instructions from McGovern tacticians One certainty though is that there never has been a collection of dele gates like this one Fully eight in 10 of the 3016 delegates have never at tended a convention What is more the proportion of black delegates has nearly tripled to 15 per cent the womens share is up from 13 to 36 per cent and those under the age of 30 have soared from 4 to 22 per cent since the 1968 debacle in Chicago Another unanswered question is the identity of Mr McGoverns running mate He received private word last week that Senator Edward M Ken nedy of Massachusetts would prob ably be on a boat off Hyannisport and unreachable for a secondplace draft So the South Dakota Senator was said to be working from a list of such serious possibilities as Sen ators Frank Church of Idaho and Gay lord Nelson of Wisconsin or Govs Reuben Askew of Florida and Jimmy Carter of Georgia Senator Mike Gravel of Alaska and former Gov Endicott Peabody of Massachusetts were in Miami to seek nomination to the No 2 spot urging an open selection One option Mr McGovern was considering was to name three or four acceptable Vice Presidential choices and let the dele gates have a free reign on the selection But the name that was most promi nent in weekend chitchat was that of Senator Muskie His selection could appease antiMcGovern elements in the party and the unions and appeal to the Catholic and ethnic neighborhoods where a McGovern candidacy might need help Berl I Bernhard Mr Mus kies manager said he couldnt see it but went on to add that the Sen ator from Maine was under a lot of pressure from supporters to unite the party by joining the ticket if he did not somehow fall heir to the Pres idential nomination And Mr Man kiewicz said from the McGovern side that apart from Ted Kennedy the most harmonious choice would be Ed Muskie One matter of constant concern is the threat of the kind of violent dis ruption that characterized the Chicago gathering in 1968 A 24000 chainlink fence has been installed to shield the convention hall from demonstrators and 8000 National Guard and Federal troops are on alert at nearby military bases But the expectation was that peace would reign The Police thief here Rocky Pom erantz was welcoming a variety of Rolling Stones to town and helped to convince the City Council to set aside Flamingo Park as a campsite for dem onstrators Mayor Chuck Hall was carrying in his hip pocket the phone number for Jerry Rubin the Yippie leader The chances of any disorder thus were stronger inside the Miami Beach Convention Hall than outside Gov ernor Wallace is preparing to make a dramatic appearance at the convention in a wheelchairhe left the hospital last week two months after being shot by a wouldbe assassin His par tisans will be pushing for an antibusing plank in the platform Dissidents at the other end of the ideological spec trum will be urging platform planks supporting abortion reform legalized marijuana and homosexual marriage It has all the earmarks of a lively show

The Legal Problems,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/10/archives/the-legal-problems.html,Is it legal to prescribe contraception to one who is legally underage This is an immensely sensitive question subject to a wide divergence of legal interpretation Planned Parenthood and the Margaret Sanger Bureau are thoroughly convinced that they are acting within the law others are not so certain of their legal grounds An official at one institution that dispenses contraception to a large number of youngsters said In 80 per cent of the cases we do not have parental consent so what we are doing is clearly illegal Harriet Pilpel general counsel to both the local and na tional division of Planned Parenthood and a nationally rec ognized authority in the field says There is no such thing the law in this area You cant point to one law it is a net work of laws relating to the rights of minors If you put all the statutes court decisions and new constitutional rights of minors together you find that many minors are entitled to birth control under one theory or another And indeed as mattes stand now one could almost build a logical case for either side for the law is a tangled maze of conflicting and contradictory regulations and loop holes New York State has no specific law that deems it  legal to treat minors for contraception and pregnancy with out parental consent but its not as simple as that The state permits the sale of contraceptives by licensed pharmacists to anyone 16 years old or older but according to a statute still on the books intercourse under the age of 17 is consid ered statutory rape in most instances On June 2d Governor Rockefeller signed the  Jonas bill an amendment to the public health law The bill grants the right to any medical treatment without parental consent to any person 18 years or older and to anyone who is married or the parent of a child The bill further states that medical services may be given to persons of any age without consent of parent or guardian if in the physi cians judgment an emergency exists and an attempt to secure consent would create a dangerous delay The bill then apparently leaves to the doctor the burden of determining when and if a potential pregnancy is an emergency and critics think it is not liberal or specific enough Exceptions have always been made for emergency situa tions for emancipated minors those selfsupporting and living away from home and in many states for mature minors those who are deemed to understand the medical services they seek Neglect of the child has also been used as grounds for treatment without parental consent In some states some of these provisions are written into the law in others they are part of the common law tradition New York State which permits abortion for any female up to the 24th week of pregnancy makes no mention of age in its abortion law The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation allows abortion on request to all persons 17 or over and to all under 17 if in the opinion of the attending physician the seeking of parental consent would endanger the physical or mental health of the patient As for venereal disease a law was passed in 1970 in New York permitting the treatment of minors for venereal disease without parental consent
The Democrats Gather,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/10/archives/the-democrats-gather.html,As the Democrats begin their national convention in Miami Beach this evening the prospect is for the kind bonebruising struggle which party leaders had once hoped to avoid Efforts to block the nomination of Senator George McGovern hinge upon the disputed credentials of half the California delegation The Supreme Court would have settled this issue if it had allowed the proMcGovern ruling of the appellate court in the California case stand By granting a stay in the execution of the lower courts ruling however the Supreme Court in effect tossed the question back to the convention where it be longs placing the burden on the delegatei to come up with a fair solution Senator Edmund S Muskie could resolve the issue by urging his delegates to support the McGovern position    Even if Mr McGovern loses in his effort to reverse the California decision some uncommitted delegates and some of those pledged to vote for one or another of his opponents on the first ballot may drift to him as the balloting proceeds His opponents after all share only a diffuse antipathy to him The strength of the anti McGovern coalition may be subject to more erosion than that of Mr McGovern himself In addition to the central question of the Presidential nomination other important issues confront the Demo crats Although the members of the platform committee were impressively skillful in drawing up a document which blurs and softens many intraparty differences mutually antagonistic factions intend to press for changes in specific planks Contrary to their reputation as oneissue people wholly preoccupied with the Vietnam war many of the McGov ern delegates have advanced opinions on numerous other questions including legalization of marijuana homosexual rights abortion and welfare reform They are not likely to succeed in floor fights to radicalize the platform be cause the responsible McGovern leadership is not willing to widen the areas of disagreement between itself and more conservative Democrats    The convention will also consider a proposed Party Charter calling for a midterm convention devoted to the discussion of issues and a broadened more represen tative Democratic National Committee to work in behalf of the policies recommended There is much covert op position to this Charter from influential members of Congress who resent any intrusion on their own author ity to shape party policy on daytoday legislative mat ters The Charter is not likely to be defeated outright but efforts may be made to weaken or postpone it As the Democrats gather and begin to fight out the choice of their nominee and the character of their plat orm and rules the optimists see the dramatic reinvigora on of their party The pessimists apprehensively per  party splits and a possible debacle in November he evidence is not all in and what is in can be read either way But history would indicate that the Demo cratic party is an extraordinarily durable institution It survived even the Civil War and can sometimesas it did in 1948evolve victory out of its own stress and confusion

Today Many Teen‐Agers Are Learning About Contraception,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/10/archives/today-many-teenagers-are-learning-about-contraception.html,There was something strangely incongruousto a pair of over30 eyesabout the 13 young girls sitting crosslegged on the floor of the Margaret Sanger Research Bureau Dressed in blue jeans and T shirts with not a hint of such adult artifice as lipstick on their faces they munched Oreo cookies giggled whisperedand talked with unexpected maturity about their intrauterine devices their diaphragms their pill prescriptions They were among the 210 13 to 18yearolds currently enrolled in the Sanger Bureaus Teen Center one of a burgeon ing number of programs offered around the country to protect young girls from pregnancy and to make them more knowl edgeable than any previous generation about the construction and functions of their bodies Time was not too long ago when a girl courageous enough to seek birth control would resort to the subterfuge of an international spy often lying about her identity andor age sometimes forging her mothers signature on documents of consent Now the climate has changed and in the last four years a variety of public and private institutions have not only swung their doors open to her but are offering her specialized guidance in separate youth clinics geared to cope sympathetic ally with the particular physical and emotional needs of youth And new facilities are being established all the time While public opinion and indeed hospitals and medical and psychiatric authorities are far from accepting the idea that sexual activity in a girl barely out of elementary school is desirable behavior the belief that protection is more crucial to that girl than proselytizing is spreading from hospital to hospital and clinic to clinic Special Programs for TeenAgers Planned Parenthood of New York City the local arm of the pioneer in the birth control crusade organized special programs in 1968 for teenagers who had not given birth because as Alfred Moran executive vice president explained We recognized the volume of pregnancies in adolescents and found ourselves providing contraceptives to youngsters who had given birth We were in effect saying Well be glad to provide the protection if you buy the ticket of admission one pregnancy And we were beginning to receive many requests from teenagers for birth control Last year 38 per cent of Planned Parenthoods 15359 new patients were 19 years old or less The 56yearold Margaret Sanger Research Bureau a loosely affiliated branch of Planned ParenthoodWorld Population which has long served the young took the same step in February 1971 Young people traditionally came here said Dr Mary E Lane clinical director of the bureaus contraception service and medical director of its Teen Center There was never any written law that we could not serve them We realized though that they were lying and we wanted to establish a situation of openness between the client and institution so we would better know what kind of person we were dealing with The need she pointed out was corroborated by statistics Over 70 per cent of our new patients some 3000 a year were unmarried and at least 15 per cent were under 18 And so it was too at Montefiore Hospital Mount Sinai and Metropolitan Hospitals and New York University Medical CenterBellevue Hospital and other hospitals In addition the New York City Health Department serves teenagers at its 18 clinics and has separate programs for the young at three of those centers All told there are believed to be about 90 family planning clinics in the city and although not all have separate teenage programs Ive never heard of any one turning a teenager away said Dr Edwin Daily director of the health depart ments Maternity and Infant Care and Family Planning Project All the organizations espouse the belief that the young girl is subject to dangers in pregnancy not risked by the adult and anxieties not shared by her mother Mount Sinai has divided its program into two divisions the comprehensive Adolescent Health Care Unit encompasses birth control in its Family Life Program which currently has 375 teenage participants from all over the city and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecologys Adolescent Guid ance Clinic which serves girls 17 and under who are pregnant Those who elect to have abortions may do so if they have parental consent while those who decide to have their babies are given intensive psychological and medical support before during and after the birth There are now more than 125 girls in this unit which serves primarily East Harlem and Bronx residents The upper age boundary for participation in the Sanger Teen Center is 18in most organizations it is 19and in none of the institutions surveyed is there a minimum age require ment We simply feel its immoral for a 12yearold as well as older teenagers] to become pregnant Dr Lane said Many doctors question the thesis that the age of sexual activity has dropped Nobody knows that said Dr Iris Litt assistant director of the Department of Pediatrics Division of Adolescent Medicine at Montefiore Hospital We may have the statistics now but we have no statistics for the past Some teenagers view the question of age a bit differ ently A 15yearold attending the Sanger rap session ob served When I started sleeping with boys last year it was a big scandal in my class [then the ninth grade] Now all the ninth graders are doing it A 13yearold once told Martha Drexler the centers social worker I cant believe Im the youngest one here With some variations mostly in the schedule of revisits for medical checkups the procedure at the Sanger Bureau is typical When a girl calls for information she is invited to the Thursday rap session Sometime during the afternoon she will be given a physical examination by Dr Lane or Dr Emilie Ongcapin Th exam includes blood tests urin alysis breast examination and tests for cervical cancer syphillis and gonorrhea Depending on the method of con traception chosen the girl may receive it that day or return at a future date in which case she is given condoms and foam to serve in the interim Boyfriends are invited not only to attend the rap session but subject to the girls approval to witness the pelvic exam One girl whose boyfriend had watched recalled He made me feel so much better He held my hand and I was glad he cared enough to be there Asked for his reaction the young man answered shyly It was interesting After the choice of contraception has been determined Lucrezia Funghini a young nurse usually dressed in overalls or jeans We dont have white hair or white uniforms to scare anyone off Dr Lane said carefully explains the proper use of the method While the rap session is considered a mainstay in the treatment of a young girl all the programs also offer indi vidual counseling by doctors nurses social workers health educators trained volunteers and when necessary psychol ogists and psychiatrists Montefiore HospitalMedical Center incorporated gyne cological care into its Division of Adolescent Medicine four years ago but only introduced the group sessions two months ago I used to give the orientation but it was less effective because of the lack of interaction Dr Litt explained Listening to others helps them bring up their fears One girl will mention something then another will say I have that problem but I was afraid to ask The Sanger Bureau holds its rap sessions on Thursdays for newcomers and returnees and Wednesdays for revisits only Five new girls had been expected on a recent Thursday but none showed up They probably used the rain as an excuse said Martha Drexler Most of them are terrified at first and theyll latch on to any reason not to come The teenagers have a facade of tremendous confidence but underneath theyre usually jelly Because the 13 girls and two boys present had heard it before Miss Drexler abbreviated her talk on anatomy and how each method blocks conception Holding a plastic replica of the female reproductive system she showed how to insert each device and when she came to the diaphragm remarked We dont give applicators with the diaphragm Thats a cop out You have to be in touch with your body The freewheeling discussion that followed included such topics as the merits of the various methods in most clinics at least 50 per cent of the teenagers choose the pill generally because it is considered the most reliable and how to cope when a mother discovers a diaphragm They also talked about premiscuity There is no such thing said one girl You learn something new from each experience Promiscuity is not believed to be prevalent among the young They may be having sex frequently Twentyone per cent [of the Mount Sinai patients] have been having it more than once a week but most are not promiscuous said Dr Joan E Morgenthau director of Mount Sinais adolescent services About 70 per cent have only one partner Some Parents Disapprove Anxiety about parental reaction ranks along with fear of pregnancy as a primary concern and while the moral winds may be shifting the teenagers still do not find their parents accepting or understanding of the new freedoms My mother found my younger sisters pills said a 16 yearold at the rap session I lied and said it was me who was taking them She was very upset she said she had failed as a parent that sex is wrong if youre not married While this was a common reaction not all parents re spond in the same manner In fact some of the young Sanger patients are enrolled at the instigation of their mothers and other parents view sexual morality as a matter of degree My mothers the one who told me I was having sex said a 15yearold She said in the beginning my boyfriend and I were always touching and when we stopped she knew it was because we were sleeping together She thought it was wonderful just like Romeo and Juliet until she discovered I was sleeping with a second boy Then she called me a whore and a slut Most teenagers experts agree have a deepseated desire for their parents to know Kathy Hull 17 who receives course credit at John Dewey High School in Brooklyn for her work as a Sanger volunteer explained why Its not a matter of guilt but of furtiveness she said I felt sad that my mother didnt know that I was sneaking behind my parents backs Being secretive takes away from the pleasure When my mother found out I felt much better Where does all this leave the beleaguered parents many of whom feel that the acceleration of sexual maturity in their children is like hearing a longplaying record on a 78 rpm phonograph Clearly they are caught in a painful dilemma If  approve contraception for the teenager they believe they are giving condonation if they forbid it they subject their children to the risks of pregnancy Alfred Moran is not only a Planned Parenthood executive he is also the father of a 15yearold daughter I have told her I dont think she should have sexual intercourse he said As a parent I wouldnt provide her with contraception but I would expect the Planned Parenthood office in my com munity to do something It is now right to expect the doctor to provide help

‘Coalition of Protest’,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/13/archives/coalition-of-protest.html,In its recordbreaking allnight session on platform the Democratic convention made a useful start toward dem onstrating the partys desire to serve as a bridge between the established elements in American society and the millions of societys outsiders The clear effort was to show that the party can accommodate new groups and ideas while still exercising responsible restraint There is as Gov Reubin Askew of Florida said in his keynote address a new coalition of protest Blacks who began appearing at Democratic conventions in dis cernible strength only in the last thirty years and who throughout that time have been variously cast as victims moral heroes or mere supernumeraries have emerged in this convention as a mature political force chairing committees important state delegations and the conven tion itself Now it is the Chicanos and Indians who are moving in on the margins of politics Women who are 40 per cent of the delegates have also consolidated their new political importance at this convention Ladies in flowered hats and fashion shows for delegate wives are on their way to extinction the legion of pantssuited activists has arrived Young persons of both sexes are more numerous in delegations than ever before but youth as a definable bloc has not made the impact of blacks or women The academics members of the clergy peace activists and middleclass rebels and independents of many kinds are also present as a diffuse but quickening force They are voting on the issues instead ofas in the past sending anxious telegrams to unresponsive delegation chairmen In terms of dress decorum and serious attention to business the behavior of the Democratic delegates four fifths of them attending their first convention has been exemplary This is no assembly of disorderly beatniks On the contrary there has been less horseplay and hijinks than in the usual convention But what intrigued press observers and deeply wor ried the McGovern managers was whether the political skills and selfdiscipline of these inexperienced delegates would match their sober behavior The voting on the platform issues provided a reassuring answer Most dele gates could not have been more dutiful in putting what they conceived to be the good of the party and of Sena tor McGoverns campaign ahead of their own predilec tions if they had been say the loyal henchmen of Mayor Daley They adhered loyally to the leftleaning but not radical document drafted by their platform committee As expected they voted down the substitute plat form offered by the supporters of Governor Wallace but they gave Mr Wallace himself a courteous recep tion His kind of protest cannot be reconciled with the protests of racial minorities and white middleclass lib erals by even the fuzziest compromise language But the Wallaceites were heard if not heeded Harder tests came when the delegates voted down Senator Harriss taxreform proposal the welfare lobbys demand for a guaranteed family income of 6500 and the plea for a forthright plank asserting the right to abortion On these issues many delegates went against the tug of their private convictionsor prudently abstainedat the urging of the McGovern managers In our view their selfrestraint was wise Although a party of reform would stultify itself if it limited its proposals to what it calculated could easily pass Con gress even the party of reform has a responsibility to set forth programs with some reasonable prospect of enactment and some relation to foreseeable budget realities Senator McGovern has enough in the way of proposals for constructive change to explain to the electorate without being burdened with more farout ones he does not wish to defend The best written most venturesome party platform cannot be a passport to Utopia

DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/13/archives/mcgovern-record-during-13-years-in-congress-one-of-conventional.html,WASHINGTON July 12 Senator George McGoverns overall record in public life is basically that of a conven tional liberal A study of his votes and statements during 13 years on Capitol Hill discloses a rath er modest list of legislative achievements and shows too that he has generally stayed well within the perimeters of Democratic liberalism on most rights consumerism education matters particularly such is sues as agriculture cities civil environment health poverty and the Supreme Court His deviations have occurred mainly on matters concerning foreign affairs and defense where he sometimes has been particularly active and out spoken For instance as early as 1963 he was criticizing United States involvement in Vietnam al though it was four more years before he again attacked the war policy For the last several years he has been one of the movers in the effort to halt the war by cutting off the flow of funds to the Defense Depart ment Mr McGovern has also brok en to the right or toward the middle of the road a few times most notably in 1968 when he was up for reelection to the Senate and was seeking the Democratic Presidential nomi nation as well Furthermore his record shows that he has voted in fa vor of righttowork laws and for many yearsuntil Rob ert Kennedys assassination was against gun control meas ures Mr McGovern tends to look upon this as practical politics particularly for a liberal Dem ocrat from a conservative Re publican state But others fellow politicians looking for his soft spots disenchanted lib erals and some labor leaders see the breaks as inconsistency Current Stands Assailed Nevertheless most of the criticism that Mr McGovern now faces is not aimed at his past positions and record Rather they center mainly on positions he has takenor al legedly takenduring his cur rent run for the Presidency In recent months new issues have suddenly come to the fore disputes over such matters as amnesty Mr McGovern would grant it once the war ends redistribution of national wealth he would close tax loopholes and grant every citizen 1000 as a start toward eliminating poverty and legalization of marijuana and abortion he would lessen some marijuana penalties strengthen hard drug penalties and leave abortion decisions to the states His personal view is that abortion is a matter best left to the doc tors and families involved Eighteen months ago before he announced his candidacy Mr McGovern seldom dis cussed any of these matters Whether they represent a new McGovern is impossible to say On the other hand the old McGovern is a matter of record Two political pressure groups the liberal Americans for Dem ocratic Action and the Conserv ative Americans for Constitu tional Action have assayed that record and come up with rat ings for the Senator With 100 as the ideal score meaning the politician voted the groups preference every time the ADA gives Mr McGovern a 13year average of 862 and the ACA gives him an aver age of 93 A 966 Rating for Humphrey By contrast Senator Hubert Humphrey has a 966 ADA average and a 14 ACA aver age Senator Edmund Muskie has an 851 ADA average and a 48 ACA average and Sena tor Edward M Kennedy has a 916 ADA average and a 21 ACA average These comparisons certainly seem to place Mr McGovern in the ideological mainstream of Democratic liberalismex cept for 1968 when the ADA gave him a rating of 43 and the ACA one of 39 That was a year in which among other things the Senator voted against gun control and for tougher police riot meas ures He was also absent for several key votes which counted against him with the ADA though not with the ACA Despite this apparent ideo logical shift in 1968 however a detailed look at Mr McGov erns record over the years provides solid evidence that he has been indeed a conven tional liberal Mr McGoverns record is not the record of Lyndon Johnson the wheelingdealing Majority Leader Nor is it the record of Wilbur Mills the lowprofile powerhouse Rather it is the somewhat average record of a liberal legis lator who idealistically eschews cloakroom clubbiness because of the compromises so often demanded but who as a fresh man was practical enough to request membership on the Agriculture and Interior Com mittees the two billhandling units that could do the most for the Indians and farmers who people his home state of South Dakota Throughout the McGovern record are scattered three ma jor themes  a better rural America a war on hunger and a quest for peace From the Beginning Farm Food and Peace At the beginning back in 1957 when he first came to Washington as a member of the House the most important theme was the farm issue par ticularly as it related to rural development and higher com modity prices Within a few weeks of his arrival on Capitol Hill Mr Mc Govern was trying to push through an amendment to raise parity the ratio of prices re ceived to prices paid under which the Government tried to assure farmers a fair return It failed by four votes Many other bills Senator Mc Govern has introduced to im prove the lot of the farmer have also been killed by a Sen ate that is less and less rurally oriented But he has known some successes particularly re garding wheat one of South Dakotas important products In 1964 with little help from the Johnson Administra tion he guided through a wheat program that provided Federal supports for farmers willing to sign up voluntarily instead of compulsorly Eight out of 10 did and he told the Senate The voluntary signup will put several hundred mil lion more dollars in wheat producers pockets Equally important the pro gram served as the basic out line for establishment of other farm support programs and therefore must be considered one of Mr McGoverns major legislative accomplishments Concurrent with the McGov ern agriculture theme has been his war on hunger a good leg islative cause especially for lib erals and one that could hardly hurt him back in the grain and cattle country of South Dakota He has on several occasions fought to get more food for poor people overseas and at home Headed Food Aid Program When he was defeated in 1960 in his bid to switch from the House to the Senate he took a job as director of the Food for Peace Program And when he finally got into the Senate three years later he was instrumental in establish ing and getting the chair of the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs In 1958 he helped pass a new food stamp law saying Most of us come from a heri tage that teaches us we can best serve our Creator by giv ing a piece of bread to a man that is hungry or a cup of cold water to a person that is thirsty 1959 and 1960 he was among the sponsors of two bills that expanded the school milk program a legislative achievement he ranks among his most important He told the House as it went about passing the 1960 bill The milk for school children program is one of the truly successful services of the Federal Government After taking over as director of the Food for Peace Program he toured South America for a firsthand look at poverty and hunger then came back and fought for additional food to hand out around the world arguing that it was better than bullets for fighting commun ism Meeting Pope John XXIII at an audience in Rome in 1962 he was told by the Pontiff When you meet your Maker and He asks Have you fed the hungry given drink to the thirsty and cared for the lonely you can answer Yes As soon as Mr McGovern got back on Capitol Hill in 1963 as a Senator he resumed his legislative war on hunger In 1964 for example he got the Food for Peace Act ex panded by almost 75 per cent and later he helped win an ex tension of the program He failed several times in 1969 to get the food stamp program expanded but suc ceeded the next year And in May of last year he put in a bill to expand the program to such an extent that it would for once and for all end the tragedy of continuing hunger and malnutrition in America The bill is still in committee It was his Select Senate Committee on Hunger that put the most illuminating spotlight on the hunger problem In 1969 it held hearings then he took it to Florida for a firsthand investigation of food shortages among the poor There was wide press coverage and he himself reported back to the Senate What we found was nothing short of disgracefula level of human misery combined with official neglect which none of us expected in a country founded and governed for 200 years on the premise that hu man dignity is the inalienable right of every citizen The War First Critique Came on Sept 24 1963 The third of Mr McGoverns major themespeaceis per haps his bestknown because of his opposition to the Vietnam war He is campaigning for the Presidency on a slogan that de clares he was right from the start and whether or not he was right he certainly got an early start in speaking out against American involvement in Indochina His first criticism was made on Sept 24 1963 when very few people were saying much about the war not even lib erals While debating a defense appropriations bill he termed American policy in Vietnam a moral debacle and political de feat then added almost pro phetically The failure should be a signal for every member of the Senate to reexamine the roots of that policy The trap we have fallen into there will haunt us in every corner of this revolutionary world if we do not properly appraise its les sons A little over a year later in August the United States was deeper than ever in the war and the Senate was approving the now controversial Tonkin Gulf Resolution that gave President Johnson the power to use all necessary force in Vietnam to protect American troops Mr McGovern voted for the resolu tion but the next day had sec ond thoughtshe was to do this on several Vietnam measures and told the Senate I voted in favor because our leaders assured us that the military evidence was such that it constituted a military chal lenge which had to be met with a military response I do not wish my vote for the resolution to be interpreted as an endorse ment of our longstanding and apparently growing military in volvement in Vietnam His second thoughts also were shown a few months later in February 1965 when he told the Senate We cannot run out unilater ally on our commitment to the Government of Saigon to which we have pledged our continued support in that area Still further evidence of his second thoughts can be found in his repeated votes through out the 1960s for most mili tary appropriations bills However he continued dur ing those years to be bluntly outspoken about the war his opposition to it increasing after a visit to the battle front in late 1965 The day before the Cam bodian incursion in 1970 he joined with Senator Mark Hatfield to make one of his strongest antiwar moves an amendment to cut off funds for the war by the end of 1971 The move was turned back in the Senate on a 55 to 39 vote but in 1971 Senators Mc Govern and Hatfield reintro duced their proposal in several forms Most of the measures are still pending with little ex pectation of success Concerned About Draft Paralleling Mr McGoverns concern about the war has been his concern about the draft As with the war he was one of the first to begin questioning the worthiness of conscription in the United States asking Congress back in 1964 to come up with alternatives Along with the war in Viet nam and the draft Senator Mc Govern has also questioned United States foreign aid pol icy over the years seeking often to cut back military grants He set the tone on such matters in 1958 asking the House Is not the hour at hand for us to offer something deeper and finer than guns and mili tary packs Then in 1963 while voting unsuccessfully to cut a foreign aid measure he said I do not see foreign aid so much as a weapon of the cold war as a tool for improving life on this planet where both Communists and nonCommu nists will live or die In 1966 he again was on the losing side as he voted to reduce a military assistance act to 642million from 892mil lion He submitted his own foreign aid bill last year saying he wanted little military aid ex cept for Israel a country that some American Jews think Mr McGovern has neglected He ex plained In the light of the delicate and difficult situations prevail ing now in the Middle East we cannot permit delay in as suring that Israel will have the military equipment essential to maintain the balance of forces or the support required to un dergird an economy depleted by the threat of war He had seldom spoken out on the Middle East situation before that though in 1970 he did take the floor to back a pro posal to sell planes to Israel Asked to justify such aid in light of his Vietnam stand he said that Israel was a democ racy with a government sup ported by its people but South Vietnam was a military dicta torship Besides military aid Mr Mc Govern also opposed transfer ring nuclear weapons to foreign soil In July 1959 he criticized the plan to ship them to arse nals in Greece Turkey Great Britain and other European countries And in 1963 he voted with the majority to ratify the lim ited nuclear test ban treaty telling the Senate We are in a balance of ter ror today and neither side has the slightest need to explode another test bomb He also voted with the ma jority to ratify the nuclear non proliferation treaty of 1969 Similarly he has been a con sistent opponent of the anti ballistic missile system voting at every opportunity to cut its funding and last year he also called for cuts in United States forces in Europe The presence of American forces in Europe he said in a Senate speech symbolizes our commitment to the defense of Europe and our belief that the defense of the United States begins in Europe But there is no good reason why that symbol must be main tained at such high and costly levels Despite the statement he was not present when the issue came to a vote and no cuts were ordered Defense Spending Cuts A Frequent Theme Apart from his quest for peace Senator McGovern has also frequently proposed cuts in the Defense Departments budget His current campaign proposal to slice off about 30 billion has raised both eye brows and hackles but as far back as 1957 he proposed un successfully to cut 5billion from that years 54billion budget During the current cam paign and in previous years the Senator has suggested that the savings could go into needy civilian areas such as education and housing To quiet the fears of defense con tractors and their employes he has frequently submitted bills calling for a special commis sion to plan the nations con version from a war to a peace economy None of these measures has made it out of committee thus far though the Senator con siders them among his most constructive legislative sugges tions In 1963 explaining the need for planned conversion he told the Senate Many American communi ties have come to lean heavily on the economic stimulus of arms production and military installations We need to prepare these communities for conversion to a more perma nent economy When a major percentage of the public resources of our society is de voted to the accumulation of devastating weapons of war the spirit of democracy suf fers Despite his announced inten tion to trim the defense budget drastically Mr McGoverns cur rent general position on de fense particularly as regards the politically sensitive question of Israel is reflected in his sup port of fairly strong platform language urged by Senator Henry M Jackson of Washing ton That language calls for the United States to maintain a political commitment and mili tary force in Europe and at sea in the Mediterranean ample to deter the Soviet Union from putting unbearable pressure on Israel Mr McGovern has pledged to withdraw United States forces from Indochina within 90 days of his inauguration But he has said he will keep some forces in Thailand and surrounding seas so long as they are needed to help insure the release of prisoners of war Predictably Liberal On other matters related to defense and foreign affairs the McGovern record is pre dictably liberal As early as 1950 he was calling for normal relations with China and in May 1965 he rose in the Senate and said It is in our national interest to open at least limited con tacts with mainland China The problem posed by China will not be solved by burying our heads in the sand Likewise in March 1963 shortly after the Cuban missile crisis he said in one of his first Senate speeches I am constrained to speak out against what seems to me to be a dangerous Castro fixa tion that is not worthy of this great nation Labor and Firearms A Source of Opposition On domestic matters the Mc Govern record is particularly subject to analysis and specula tion on labor and gun control issues His stand on the war has irked George Meany the labor leader all along But even more irritating to labor is the fact that in its eyes Senator Mc Govern has failed the union litmus test  he has voted twice against the union shop  in 1965 and 1966 During the second debate he told the Senate Rightto work laws have not weakened or retarded growth of labor unions Their effect is negli gible As he later explained this to his biographer It was a straight political decision It was the only time in the United States Senate I voted against my conscience South Dakota is not a heavily unionized state But there is a National RighttoWork Com mittee there and righttowork is part of the states law South Dakota is also a big hunting state And hunting means guns Senator McGovern has been on both sides of the firearms control issue In May 1967 he voted against prohibiting the interstate mail order sale of rifles and shotguns But three weeks later after Robert Ken nedys assassination he rose in the Senate and said In the wake of the tragic assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy I am asking my con stituents whether they are will ing to undergo a small amount of inconvenience to help slow the growing use of firearms in violent crime in the United States His mail at that time was running 6 to 1 in favor of con trols It had been running 10 to 1 against A few days later he rose again in the Senate this time to speak about a new proposal to ban mail order gun sales He said Certainly it is not presented as a panacea to the problems but the hearings [on it] do indicate that it would have some effect Nonetheless despite these fa vorable remarks when the final vote came on the bill Mr Mc Govern did not vote The bill passed 70 to 17 Another grass roots issue for Mr McGovern is American In dian policy During his years on Capitol Hill he has introduced dozens of bills intended to help South Dakotas Sioux with such things as grazing rights and water impoundment But the Interior Subcommit tee on Indian Affairs which he chairs has accomplished lit tle else in recent years pri marily because of its basically conservative makeup It is so conservative in fact that Mr McGovern has threatened sev eral times to resign Civil Rights Cosponsor Of Major Legislation He has also spoken out in support of the American Negro and has been a cosponsor of every piece of major civil rights legislation in the last decade including the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Open Housing Act of 1968 In February of this year he continued his support of black causes speaking out heatedly and successfully  against so called antibusing amendments to education legislation On Supreme Court nomina tions Mr McGovern voted for Lewis Powell but against Judge Clement Haynesworth Judge Harold Carswell and William Rehnquist Mr Powell and Mr Rehnquist were confirmed Judge Carswell and Judge Haynesworth were rejected On economic matters Sena tor McGovern is one of the sponsors of a pending tax re form bill that is described as a comprehensive program to close tax loopholes and raise 16billion in additional reve nues During his campaign Mr Mc Govern has proposed a tax pro gram that essentially would combine Federal income tax re form and state and local tax relief with a plan for income redistribution within the tax system One part of that would be a minimum tax with a possible formula requiring everyone with an income over 50000 to pay at a rate of 75 percent of the current nominal rates they would have to pay if there were no tax loopholes He would raise corporate taxes by eliminating prefer ences but has indicated tax concessions would be possible in the areas of environmental outlays plant relocation or conversions from war to peace production He would raise in heritance and gift taxes On property tax relief he has proposed the Federal Gov ernment pay a third or more of public education costs through revenue sharing and provide incentives for states to drop property taxes in favor of other forms of taxation His income redistribution plan would substitute minimum income grants 1000 is the figure most often used for most welfare payments and the per sonal income tax deduction The plan would require higher tax payments for those in upper income levels In 1970 he voted with the majority to delete 290million in funds for the development of the supersonic transport plane and he was in the mi nority in trying to head off a 250million Government loan to financially pressed Lockheed Aircraft One economic area in which Senator McGovern does not be lieve in stinting is the war on poverty In 1964 he was one of the sponsors of the economic opportunity act that authorized almost 1billion to fight pov erty On the cities issue Mr McGovern voted for the rent supplement program in 1967 telling the Senate The eyes of the nations low income fam iliesare looking to you Would Ease Urban Crush He also proposed in 1967 that the Government help ease the population crush in big cities by showing preference for contrac tors in smaller cities On health he cosponsored the 1965 medical care insur ance program for the aged Then in August 1970 he asked Congress to adopt a na tional crash priority program on dread disease He considers the suggestion one of his most important But it died in committee Senator McGovern also has been active in the environ mental field successfully spon soring a bill that declares a na tional policy of conservation and proper utilization of na tional resources Perhaps his most important suggestion in this area however is his bill that would give individual citi zens the right to bring action against polluters His bill is currently stalled in a Capitol Hill committee Finally Mr McGovern now has a truth in advertising bill pending on Capitol Hill a meas ure that would require adver tisers to document their claims In sum then Senator Mc Govern has touched on most of the important issues during his 13 years as a legislator He has veered to the right and the left at times particularly when run ning for office but basically he has played the role of a solid liberal Democrat
A STUNNING SWEEP,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/13/archives/a-stunning-sweep-senator-seeks-unity-wallace-rules-out-thirdparty.html,MIAMI BEACH Thursday July 13George Stanley Mc Govern was proclaimed the Democrats candidate for Presi dent here early this morning to complete a stunning sweep of the partys processes and na tional convention Without suspense but with many raw wounds of battle the convention registered on a single ballot the victory that was sealed in a tense creden tials battle 48 hours earlier Inexorably to triumphant cheers the Senator from South Dakota who had defied the polls the odds and the estab lished techniques and the estab lished power centers of his party cashed in his three years of dazzling organization effort One week before his 50th birthday and barely three months after he first vaulted to prominence in the grassroots primaries Mr McGovern claimed the prize of a reformed restructured but also partly re sentful convention He also won the platform he had sought and gave to the partys many skep tics and holdouts a promise of conciliation and unity by No vember for the expected race against President Nixon At the moment of victory he learned that Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts was firm in his refusal to run for Vice President and that Gov George C Wallace of Ala bama had firmly decided to stay out of the Presidential race this year A Matt in the News ar ticle on Senator McGovern appears on Page 24 A re view of his record on public issues is on Page 25 The formal tally at the end of the first ballot gave Mr Mc Govern 171535 votes comfort ably beyond the 1509 needed for nomination The hall explod ed with joy when the decisive ballots were cast by the bitterly disputed Illinois delegation TV Set Proves Balky Mr McGovern was fiddling with a balky television set in his hotel suite and barely got back to his chair before the moment of climax His staff burst out with applause but he merely smiled remarked that it was a longawaited moment and retreated to take a tele phone call from his stoutest rival Senator Hubert H Hum phrey of Minnesota Mr McGovern also received a congratulatory call from Sen ator Kennedy at Hyannisport Mass during which he formal ly asked the bearer of a famous name to join him as his run ning mate The nominee later announced that Mr Kennedy declined for very personal reasons Expressing regret Mr McGovern said that he fully un derstood because the Kennedy family has already made great sacrifices to the nation He asked Mr Kennedy to play an unspecified role in the campaign and Mr Kennedy agreed to consider it Mr McGovern also asked Mr Kennedy Mr Humphrey and Senator Edmund S Muskie of Maine to suggest possible running mates to him by later today Mrs McGovern In a front row box in the convention hall said merely Its unbelievable reallyI feel a little bit of anxi ety too  it means a great change in our lives Four other names were placed in nomination They were the favorite sonsand one daugh ternot of states or regions as in past conventions but of ideological segments of Demo crats everywhere that were un reconciled to the McGovern candidacy the McGovern ap proach to both foreign and do mestic issues the McGovern habit of circumventing oldline party regulars and the McGov ern following of the young and other outsiders clamoring for a share of power Governor Wallace was pro posed as the starkest alterna tive with a demonstrated ap peal as an independent in 1968 and in the primaries this year Wallace Pledge Reported Mr Wallace won the con vention vote of Dolph Briscoe the leader of the delegation from Texas and candidate for Governor there with the ex plicit promise Mr Briscoe said that he would not conduct an independent campaign for the White House this fall The man who nominated Mr Wallace said that he was under instructions to relay that pledge to the convention but forgot to do so Senator Henry M Jackson of Washington was put forward as the clearest ideological op ponent with the diehard sup port of big labor big industry and others committed to a mili tant defense posture Terry Sanford the president of Duke University and former Governor of North Carolina let his name stand partway through the balloting as a sym bol of Southern moderates who fear that Mr McGovern will cost the Democrats further losses throughout their region Representative Shirley Chis holm of Brooklyn became the first black woman ever offered to a major conventionas the bearer of the hopes of both women and blacks who resent being taken for granted by liberal political movements Before switches distorted the result the first  ballot totals read as follows  In addition there were 6670 votes for Mr Humphrey 3380 for Representative Wilbur D Mills of Arkansas 2430 for Senator Muskie 1270 for Sena tor Kennedy 5 for Representa tive Wayne L Hays of Ohio 2 for Senator Eugene J McCarthy of Minnesota 1 for Senator Walter F Mondale of Minne sota and 1 for former Attorney Geenral Ramsey Clark There were 5 votes abstaining from the total vote of 3016 After switches Mr McGov erns total as announced by the rostrum stood at 186465 There was no move to make it unanimous Mr Mills the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee withdrew his name in the closing hours following the example of Mr McGov erns principal rivals Senators Humphrey and Muskie the 1968 standardbearers Mr Mills said that he would be glad to talk about the Vice Presidency if asked but the word from McGovern head quarters was that the candidate would prefer someone more in his ideological ball park Mr McGovern had come to regard eSnnator Kennedy as the man who could most quickly help unite the party and as probably the only one who could measurably enhance the prospects of election in Novem ber Shriver Is Mentioned Right through the nominat ing session the McGovern forces were still juggling any alternative names Sargent Shriver the former director of the Peacbe Corps and aneipov erty program and a brotherin law of Mr Kennedy was said now to have been added to the list So were Gov Reuben Askew of Florida the keynoter of this convention who again declined interest and Senator Thomas F Eagleton a liberal Roman Catholic from Missouri But Mr McGoverns private thoughts were unknown to any one He held himself in seclu sion yesterday after breakfast with five troubled Southern Governors and yet another clarification of his Vietnam peace plan for equally troubled supporters on his left flank Forecasts of Defeat Even before the formality of nomination the pressures of candidacy  indeed pressures commensurate with those felt in the Presidencybore in on Mr McGoverns entourage Senator Jackson was voicing the conviction of many party regulars that Mr McGovern was destined for defeat and the warning that he would drag down members of Congress and other officeholders I W Abel president of the United Steelworkers of Amer ica joined George Meany pres ident of the American Federa tion of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations and other big labor leaders by won dering whether Mr McGoverns followers were seeking to de liberately lose The exclusion of Mayor Rich ard J Daley of Chicago from this convention under the Mc Govern reforms still rankled in many quarters some of them in the McGovern camp And the passionate proponents of stronger promises on defense policy on abortion on the rights of homosexuals and other issues were raising fears of betrayal as the McGovern forces tried to move toward the center of the party they had seized The South Dakotans answer was given in effect in the nominating speech of Senator Abraham A Ribicoff of Con necticutindeed in the very choice of Mr Ribicoff to be the principal proposer Sen McGovern telephoned Governor Wallace and urged him to attend the conventions closing ceremony tonight An aide to the Senator said that Mr Wallace had replied that he would participate in the tra ditional unity ceremony if his doctor would permit him Mr Ribicoff said that he spoke for the finest political organization in the history of American politics and his first pledge was that it would be available in November for ev ery Democratic candidate in this land He spoke he said for a candidate who had read the mood of the country when others had read public opinion polls and who had shown con trary to all the dire predictions tonight that he is a winner Lists the Chief Issues It is only with a plausible promise of victory over Presi dent Nixon in the fall that the McGovern forces expect to re gain the support of some of their most bitter opponents and a demonstration of that promise will be their first mis sion in the weeks ahead Senator Ribicoff listed the issues that he said would domi nate the McGovern drivean immediate end of all American involvement in Vietnam a de termination to protect the real interests of the United States in Europe and the survival of Israel a reversal of Repub lican economic policies that were said to have caused high unemployment widespread in flation and escalating food prices a reordering of prior ities to rebuild the country through prosperity while reduc ing hunger and poverty and a Presidency that would be hon est about problems and trust the inherent decency and com mon sense of the people The difficulties anticipated for Mr McGovern in his own party rested not only on the expectation of a formidable campaign by a sitting Presi dent His problems will also be compounded it is thought be cause he is the first Democrat in 40 years to have come to the nomination without any signficant support from the es tablished barons of regional racial business or labor power Never before has a major party nominated a candidate from a state with only four electoral votes reflecting a population of 666257 That his torical oddity alone is evidence of the transformation of Ameri can politics upon which Mr McGovern counts so heavily The big states the big unions even the big names are vulner able as never before in this era of overnight television fame and ideological fragmentation The crucial but no longer suspenseful third session of the Democrats 36th quadrennial convention opened an hour late at 801 PM but no one be grudged the managers this tardiness after the record breaking meeting of more than 10 hours Tuesday night devoted largely to writing a platform Despite the passions repre sented in the hall the dominant McGovern forces set a pattern of remarkable decorum and attentiveness They listened po litely to Governor Wallaces appeals for serious changes in their party planks before vot ing them down They listened to avowed homosexuals plead for more active support before voting them down They yielded easily and on instruction to Mr Jacksons plea for a warm er pledge to Israel They fought back a more open endorsement of abortibn by a margin of 3 to 2 Though there were many more young people many more blacks many more women many more Indians many more beards blue jeans and other informal clothes in the hall there was none of the hostility or rowdiness that many had feared from such a gathering All points of view were made to feel welcome and all the delegates held their seats so as to assure a voice and a defense of their interests When the final gavel fell for adjournment of the second ses sion at 621 AM the Demo cratic National Chairman Law rence F OBrien announced that 95 per cent of the dele gates were still on hand and praised them for their maturity The nomination last night in a final innovation came in an order determined by lot rather than rollcall Wallace Sanford McGovern Chisholm and Jack son The Alabama Governor was proposed by State Senator Robert Wilson of Jasper Ala and was seconded by Hall Timanus a lawyer who is chairman of the Texas Demo crats for Wallace and Dr Helen Calvin a physician from In diana Speaking for Mr Sanford were Hodding Carter 3d edi tor of The Greenville Miss Delta Democrat Times Andrew Miller the Attorney General of Virginia and Howard Lee Mayor of Chapel Hill N C Seconding Mr Ribicoffs nomination of Senator McGov ern were Walter Fauntroy the District of Columbias non voting delegate in Congress who is a leader of the blacks who gave their convention votes before Miami Beach and Mrs Valerie Kushner an alter nate delegate from Danville Va the wife of an Air Force pilot imprisoned in North Viet nam Mrs Chisholm was put for ward by Percy Sutton the Bor ough President of Manhattan and was seconded by Barbara Amran a party leader from Minneapolis and Charles Evers the Mayor of Fayette Miss Senator Jackson was offered by Gov Jimmy Carter of Geor gia with seconds from Mrs Lynn Sommerer the daughter of Gov Warren E Hearnes of Missouri and Mr Abel the steelworkers leader In a final departure from precedentamong so many at this convention  the party moved with dispatch through the routine of nominations and demonstrations One minute of music greeted Mr Wilsons mention at 945 PM of Mr Wallace as the most popular votegetter on the American scene today and as the man who will take the ownership of the people away from the Gov ernment Time was running out Mr OBrien reminded the Gover nors cheering supporters and after another minute the next speaker was on Ten minutes per candidate was the rule and the fact Mr Carter presented Mr Sanford with these words While others were blocking schoolhouse doors Terry San ford was opening them to all races Mr Humphrey appearing rested and refreshed after his withdrawal from the race yes terday was among the many delegates who greeted this hon orary presentation with ap plause But there was no one in the huge arena who did not know that Mr Ribicoff the next speaker was bearing to the rostrum the name of the victor in this long nominating season The standards of dozens of states came out of their moor ings for the first time this week and the roars though brief were the conventions loudest Mr Humphrey stood and clapped before waves of blue McGovern placards
McGovern Forces Shape Planks to Suit Candidate,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/13/archives/mcgovern-forces-shape-planks-to-suit-candidate-mcgoverns-supporters.html,MIAMI BEACH July 12In an 11hour session that ended at sunrise today the Democra tic National Convention reject ed strong efforts to write into the party platform a series of New Left stands on such is sues as abortion homosexual rights tax reform and guar anteed income The forces of Senator George McGovern were firmly in control The convention operating at full strength despite the hour turned back by a wide margin an appeal by Gov George C Wallace of Alabama for planks against busing and Government spending and for a stronger military a citizens right to bear arms and prayer in public schools In the end Senator McGov ern got almost exactly the kind of platform he wanted to run on against President Nixon in Novembera 24000word doc ument with a liberal Populist tone and direction but one so worded that he could shape his own stand on the major issues of the day The McGovern forces did not so much fear tying the Sena tors hands with a New Left platform drawn for his constitu ency in the primaries as they did providing targets for the Republicans to use against him in their appeal to the center of the electorate Only two of 20 minority re ports to the document drafted by the Platform Committee in Washington last month were approved by the convention one to extend more land rights to Indians and one to offer stronger military support for Israel The McGovern leaders in effect gave way on these two relatively mild planks in return for delegate unity on ones that they felt could cost the South Dakotan large numbers of votes in the election the chief of which was abortion The platform calls for im mediate and complete with drawal of all US forces in Indochina amnesty for Viet nam draft evaders when the fighting has ceased and our troops and prisoners of war have returned abolition of the present welfare system and en actment of a guaranteed income of about 3900 for a family of four full employment with the Government as employer of last resort tax reform on a gradual basis and enact ment of a number of new so cial programs from day care to massive aid to the cities It also calls for a reduction in military spending The platform debate opened at 10 PM yesterday An hour later Governor Wallace in a wheelchair made his appear ance and gave a nineminute address which received a polite but restrained reception Then after two hours of speeches for and against his proposals the convention voted down all eight of the Wallace planks with a thundering chorus of noes No effort was made to obtain a rollcall vote on them Then came a tax reform pro posal that had the McGovern forces worried Supported from the rostrum by Senator Fred R Harris the selfstyled Populist from Oklahoma it would have endorsed a specific plan for a more sharply graduated income tax and removal of many ex emptions and loopholes From the press gallery and elsewhere in the hall the yeas sounded as loud as the noes But Yvonne Braithwaite Burke a forceful black woman who is vice chairman of the Demo cratic National Committee ruled that the noes had won There were no objections until after she had moved to the next item of business at which time she ruled that it was too late to take another vote The first rollcall came on the National Welfare Rights Organizations plan for a 6500 minimum income for a family of four It was defeated 1 85286 to 99975 By voice vote the convention rejected a pro posal to freeze rents at their level on Aug 14 1971 Then came the seemingly mild report sponsored by the Womens Caucus In matters relating to human reproduction each persons right to privacy freedom of choice and individ ual conscience should be fully respected consistent with relevant Supreme Court de cisions The convention came to life The McGovern forces had care fully gauged the situation and released as many of their dele gates as possible to vote their conscience while holding enough to win Shirley Mac Laine the actress endorsed the meaning of the report but asked delegates to vote against it to save the McGovern candi dacy The vote was 156980 to 110337 against the proposal Another motion to adjourn was shouted down and the Gay Lib eration report calling for repeal of all laws regarding sexual acts between consenting adults was put before the convention The plank was defeated by voice vote A plank saying we support allocation of Federal surplus lands to American Indians on a firstpriority basis carried by an overwhelming margin The delegates were trying to keep alert Still they shouted down attempts to adjourn In rapid order they rejected planks to oppose busing to in ferior schools or when it in volved long distances leaving Ithe platform with a probusing position and link withdrawal from Vietnam to a release of American prisoners They overwhelmingly ap proved maintenance of a mili tary force in Europe and the Mediterranean ample to deter the Soviet Union from putting unbearable pressure on Israel a proposal offered by support ers of Senator Henry M Jack son of Washington The platform was adopted at 615 AM At 621 AM it was allover and the delegates strug gled out into the dawn
MIAMI BEACH,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/14/archives/come-home-america.html,MIAMI BEACH July 13The Democrats came out of their convention In fairly good order with George McGovern crying Come home America In McGovern and Eagleton they have ticket that runs no farther than from Missouri to South Dakota but at least they avoided the worst of their nightmares and theyre not deceiving themselves about the magnitude of their problems The only thing they dont have to worry about is overconfidence They have lost three of the last five Presidential elections They have been out of the White House for twelve of the last twenty years They are broke and divided but they seem to thrive on adversity They have time energy and youth on their side and they hope the old Democratic slogan of peace and prosperity will still carry them back to the top This is the time McGovern insisted in his acceptance speech It is the time for this land to become again a witness to the world for what is noble and just in human affairs It time to live more with faith and less with fear It was clear that the Democrats are going back to the old evangelical themes of the populists and the economic themes of the New Dealers in spite of all their present troubles Meanwhile they have a few consolations Their young delegates here proved to be more temperate and disciplined than they looked They got through the convention without single bloody nose They minimized though they certainly didnt end the controversies over pot abortion amnesty taxes and welfare and from their new base a little west of center they believe they can now recapture their historic position as the reforming force in American politics Considering what might have happened in Miami Beach and where McGovern started from only a few short months ago this is not a bad record and compels a reappraisal of McGovern his organization Ills assumptions McGovern is a cool and determined man with considerable inner serenity and a conviction that it is not the Republican conservatives but the McGovern progressives who have the forgotten Americans on their side There is nothing in his mood or manner that marks him as a radical He has the radical words but not the melody He has the populist impulse and something of the populists moral selfrighteousness but in manner he is nearer to Harry Truman than to Bryan As for his organization it is about as amateur as the Dallas Cowboys This is no bluejean brigade dominated by radical zealots There was less booze and horsing around here than at any political convention since the Temperance party met in Baltimore and while some of the men around him look like Jerry Rubin most of them talk like Jim Farley As a matter of fact it was a little disconcerting to listen to the McGovern aides discussing the pros and cons of the various VicePresidential candidates They were all votes and very little philosophy or ideology seldom a word about whether the man could unite and the lead the country in an emergency but endless analysis of what the McGovern private polls showed about whether Ribicoff could improve McGoverns chances with the Jews or what Woodcock could do to console the disgruntled labor leaders or what Eagleton or any of the other four Roman Catholics on the short list could do to balance the ticket Nevertheless if the public likes things that are new and different the Democrats should look better as time goes on In Eagleton they even picked a man with a sense of humor and a good turn of phrase and this should be worth a lot in a country that hasnt had a good giggle or vivid line from any prominent politician since Adlai Stevenson It is McGoverns assumptions about those forgotten Americans and about the war and the economy that are the real question Both McGovern and Nixon not to mention Spiro Agnew agree that the American people are restless frustrated and unhappy but they disagree about the causes of this churlish mood The Republicans think they can hold the White House by promising them law and order winding down the war and gradually cutting down unemployment and prices McGovern is promising more faster He doesnt want to wind down the war but end it He doesnt want to talk to the Chinese and the Soviets to increase the defense budget but to cut it substantially He doesnt want to win the civil war with the rising generation but to end it More than likely the election will be won not by the personalities of the candidates this time but by the side that produces a believable answer to this national mood of frustration McGovern is trying to make common cause with the young and the poor the women and the blacks but a lot of Republicans think the country is fed up with the demands of the noisy young poor blacks and women and nobody will know until November who has judged this question aright Also President Nixon is in a posi tion to do something between now and November about ending the war and improving the economy and McGovern is not Mr Nixon would have to swallow a lot of threats and promises to do so but that wouldnt be new either Meanwhile all the Democratic nominee can do is promise to go to Hanoi and make peace with the Communists and even this wont mean much unless he first goes to Chicago and a lot of other places and makes peace with the Democrats

DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/14/archives/mcgovern-rises-in-gop-eyes.html,MIAMI BEACH July 13Nine weeks ago at a barbecue at John B Connallys Texas ranch a reporter asked H R Haldeman a senior White House staff member whether President Nixon would enjoy the prospect of running against George McGovern Wouldnt you he replied with a grin In a telephone interview today Clark MacGregor the new director of the Nixon campaign discussed the coming months in more urgent tones We are not where we ought to be on some of the basics  voter identification and registration and volunteer recruitment he said The difference between Mr Haldemans eager anticipation and Mr MacGregors expressions of concern nine weeks later clearly reflects a change of mood in the Nixon camp where the Presidents advisers no longer seem to take Mr McGovern as lightly as they once did Mr MacGregors worries about the organization also reflect another point The Nixon forces are now moving quickly to improve their skills in precisely those areas of grassroots politics where Mr McGovern has demonstrated his greatest strength The Republican National Committee has registered 400000 new voters while the youth division of the Committee to Reelect the President which Mr McGregor heads says it has signed up 125000 volunteers In both cases Mr MacGregor says he wants more Despite these and other worries however Mr MacGregor and others believe that a McGovern candidacy presents new opportunities for political profit To begin with they seem perfectly prepared to test Mr McGoverns views on social policy against the Presidents stance on such issues as crime busing and drugs and to pit the strengths of incumbency and the Presidents diplomatic forays into China and the Soviet Union against a man they regard as relatively untested in international issues other than the war in Vietnam In addition they believe that the McGovern nomination may enable them to make major inroads in traditional Democratic constituencies among workingmen Jews and moderates who may be worried about Mr McGoverns views on taxes and welfare At present there is no formal Republican structure through which disaffected Democrats can work to reelect Mr Nixon But the President who is now in San Clemente conferring with Mr Connally is expected to remedy this defect shortly by naming the former Secretary of the Treasury to run a Demo crats for Nixon operation In a speech in Washington Mr MacGregor extended an invitation to to dissident Democrats to join the Nixon forces He also described Mr McGoverns forces as an elitist group capable of playing the old politics they say they reject and described Mr McGoverns positions on such issues as welfare as vague and contradictory At the same time however Mr Nixons strategists concede privately that Mr McGoverns nomination has posed the clearest possible test of Mr Nixons policies on the economy and the Vietnam war Mr McGovern has taken positions so plainly different from the Presidents on both issues that he cannot be implicated if either of Mr Nixons policies fail the managers concede The most formidable new challenge posed by Mr McGoverns candidacy howeverat least in the view of the Nixon camplies in its demonstrated capacity to induce thousands of unpaid volunteers to work on the precinct level We have got to do the same thing Mr MacGregor said This has been my major concern since arriving here two weeks ago Mr MacGregor has in mind other ideas for improvement Unforeseen circumstances and the tactics of Mr McGovern may require modifications yet for all practical purpoties the structures strategy image and ideological content of the Nixon campaign appears to be well established In terms of Issues Mr Nixon has tried for three years to occupy the middle ground on most major questions while reaching out  especially in recent months  to groups with special concerns Nixons Strong Suit Since early May he has courted Roman Catholics with promises of aid to parochial schools and by taking a firm stand against liberalized abortion laws identified himself more clearly than ever with foes of school busing and appealed to homeowners and suburbanites with pledges of relief in property taxes Nor has he been inactive in exploiting what he long considered his strong suitforeign policy His missions to Peking and Moscow aside his aides have made a steady stream of announcements  the recent grain deal with the Soviet Union for example  to keep the momentum of his overseas activities going and his chief foreign policy advisers have made optimistic projections of the peace negotiations in Paris It is clearly the judgment of Mr Nixon and his aides that he can serve his candidacy best by playing a Presidential role His judgment has not prevented Mr Nixon and his aides from attacking Congress for its failure to enact certain programs of Mr Nixonwelfare reform and revenue sharing to name twoand does not foreclose a more aggressive political stance At the same time however the campaign apparatus has begun gearing up for Mr McGovern On June 9 the Republican National Committee established an answer desk to provide information on Mr McGoevrns positions and started mailing answer desk bulletins on Mr McGoverns views drawn from an information retrieval system set up on the fourth floor or the National Committees headquarters The Democratic nominees earlier controversial statements on drugs abortion and amnestynone of which found their way into the Democratic platformare prominently displayed Mr McGovern might well moderate his views in the coming campaign John N Mitchell Mr MacGregors predecessor said in an interview last week What we want to do is point out that his earlier views on issues might well reappear if he is reelected Strategically Mr Nixon and his managers are planning what Mr Mitchell once called a 50state campaign There is no evidence that any state has been crossed off the list and the emergence of dramatic local issuesschool busing in Michigan for example or the apparent disaffection of many New York Jews from Mr McGovernhas raised hopes that Mr Nixon can capture traditional Democratic territory This is equally true of Pennsylvania where Mr Nixon has cultivated powerful allies in Frank Rizzo Philadelphias Democratic Mayor and among the Catholic hierarchy there In the end Nixon aides concede his strategy may come down to what it was in 1968a strong pitch to Southern and Border states combined with major emphasis on a few battleground states notably Illinois Ohio California and Texas It is for this reason that Nixon operatives are hopeful that Gov George C Wallace of Alabama will remain aloof from Mr McGovern in the coming campaign
Democrats Feel Impact Of Women's New Power,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/15/archives/democrats-feel-impact-of-womens-new-power-womens-power-has-an.html,MIAMI BEACH July 14Mrs Martha Clampitt McKay of North Carolina had drink with a national polling expert Tuesday afternoon to find out how the country felt about abortion Louis Harris the pollster told her that the majority of the voters in the South and MidWest were against it Twelve hours later after intensive proselytizing by Mrs McKay and Others 48 members of the North Carolina delegation to the Dernocratic National Convention voted for a proabortion plank in the party platform and only nine voted no It was apparent that some of the proabortion votes front the North Carolina delegation reflected an attempt by supporters of Gov George C Wallace to embarrass Senator George McGovern but others Seemed to have been swayed by Mrs McKay and her associates on the merits of the case The proposal lost by 472 votes out of a total of 2673 but the fact that this explosive emotional issue got to the floor and that its supporters were willing to fight for it across candidate lines and against the advice of professional politicians is one illustration of the impact that women had upon this convention Time and again the 1000 women delegates showed their clout even though 88 per cent of them had never been to a national political convention before They showed it simply by being here in force with 38 per cent of the troops as against 13 per cent in 1968 They showed it by pushing through for the first time a sweeping plank on womens rights They showed it in the persons of Patricia Harris a black woman who managed the thorny credentials challenges from the podium Monday night with toughness and skill and Yvonne Braithwaite another black woman who stood on the same spot Tuesday night to preside over the platform debates that did not end until sunrise And they showed it with the first women floor managers for a Presidential candidate  Anne Wexler and Jean Westwoodwho helped to seize the prize for George McGovern Today the Democratic National Committee with 303 members unanimously voted to make Mrs Westwood its chairman It was the first time either the Democratic or Republican party had given this job to a woman The conventions 15point womens rights plank included pledges supporting the equal rights athendment the elimination of discrimination against women in public accommodations and jobs equal access to educational opportunities tenure promotion and higher salaries the availability of maternity benefits to working women and the appointment of women to positions of top responsibility in all branches of the Federal Government The womens political caucuses outputted the luaus and the lunchesand other caucuses including one for those under 30 years old Presidential candidates made a point of appearing before women delegates meetings to discuss the issues Thats a revolution right there said Gloria Steinem the womens liberation movement leader But it was not really the celebrated personalities such as Miss Steinem who was not a delegate and Representative Bella Abzug who was that made the difference It was the women who mainly had not been visible before both the seasoned campaigners and the novices They won some and they lost some but all of them said we learned a lot in July 1972 And they planned to apply those lessons in the four years that lie between this Democratic convention and the next A Result of Reforms There were more women more minorities and more young people at the 1972 gathering because of party reforms that made delegate selection more democratic and representative of the people as a whole Those reforms were drafted by a commission formed in 1968 of which Mr McGovern was the original chairman The initial test for women came quickly at the very beginning of this convention last Monday night As with the abortion plank delegates were voting on a new subject A man who has attended many conventions commented Only four years ago it would have been inconceivable that the first substantive issue to come up in a national political convention would be whether to seat more women on a delegation The National Womens Political Caucus had fought for a minority report that would have added nine women to the South Carolina delegation for a total of 16 and shaved the number of male delegates from 25 to 16 thus giving the women a voice proportional to their numbers in that state It lost by 1555 votes to 1429 but the outcome would have been even closer if the backers of Senator McGovern had not changed their votes late in the tally for strategic parliamentary reasons The second test as far as the womens political caucus was concerned resulted in a victory That too came on Monday night The convention upheld a Credentials Committee decision that ousted Mayor Richard J Daley of Chicago one of the last of the big city bosses and 58 others and seated a delegation with more women and more blacks The womens caucus believes its fervent lobbying helped contribute to the vote The third test producing tears shouting fistshaking and husbandwife splits on the floor in the middle of the night on Tuesday was the minority abortion proposal The word abortion did not appear anywhere in the proposed amendment to the 15point rights of women plank adopted by the convention The amendment read In matters relating to human reproduction each persons right to privacy freedom of choice and individual conscience should be fully respected consistent with relevant Supreme Court decisions Both abortion and code phrases such as the right of a woman to control her own body were used as the battle raged on for two hours There was talk of a HumphreyWallace coalition to vote yes for a plank that could discomfort and ultimately defeat Mr McGoverns race for the White House Meantime the McGovern forces were moving around the floor urging delegates to vote against the plank In the end they won and it was jettisoned We were outmaneuvered and outmanipulated said Betty Friedan a convention observer who had been present at all the womens political caucuses The McGovern supporters were convinced that if the proabortion minority plank were adopted it would brand the South Dakota Senator as extremist Today the delegates began streaming away from Miami Beach and many of the women among them expressed hope and determination for the future rather than disappointment at this weeks events They seemed to agree with Miss Steinem that The convention is only the tip of the iceberg A lot of hard important work was done before women could go through the systema system not created to help them The major changes are going to endure no matter what happened in Miami Its like pushing marbles through a sieve It means the sieve will never be the same again
The Balanced Court…,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/15/archives/the-balanced-court-.html,The Presidents goal of a politically balanced Supreme Court may have had some theoretical appeal among those who see the world entirely as a giant scale on which liberal and conservative views ought to neutralize each other In practice the effect of this balancing seems to be to create a sharply divided Court Important cases involving civil rights civil liberties and capital punishment have been decided by the narrowest of majorities While such rulings do of course carry the full weight of the law the price is high in their power of moral persuasiveness It is higher still in respect for the integrity and detachment of the legal process The divisions among the justices over fundamental issues will increasingly be interpreted as political rather than constitutional disagreements Additional doubts are created by the fact that Justice William Rehnquist has not disqualified himself from a number of cases which were closely related to his previous activities in the Justice Department This too creates the impression that political zeal of individual members of the Court may be getting in the way of judicial ties that ought to bind the Court together even when there is sharp legal or ideological disagreement This will further reduce the Courts authority in the eyes of the general public The image thus created will not be that of a balanced Court but of an indecisive one Such a view of the Court might not be a serious matter in an era of strong Congressional or Presidential leadership in the realm of basic domestic principles and moral issues But when neither the White House nor Capitol Hill provides such leadership the decline in the Courts stature and effectiveness will expose these vital areas to uncertainty and drift Such a time is now Checks and balances among the three branches of Government are largely inoperative because no branch is providing any discernible sense of direction These are not the days of the New Deal when a conservative Court felt the need to put the brakes on an activist Franklin D Roosevelt and a docile Congress Nor is the present comparable to the wellintentioned lethargy of the Eisenhower years when an activist Court sensing the threat of violent upheaval by the disenfranchised gave teeth to the Constitutions provisions for the protection of civil rights and individual liberties The Nixon Administration instead of bringing together the many factions that divide the country has allowed the divisions to deepen particularly when as in the busing controversy and even in the abortion issue this seemed politically expedient Congress has tried to block some of the Administrations extreme strategies especially in school desegregation but in the main Congress continues to flounder If the Court now establishes a pattern of indecision or regression in the areas of social justice and on the issues of great ideological conflict and uncertainty the American people will increasingly be paralyzed by selfdoubt In such an atmosphere the Supreme Court possesses unique powers to dispel those doubts It can do so not by reflecting the national divisions but by making the Constitution the strong and steadying anchor of a confident nation

"On British TV, Advice on Contraception",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/20/archives/on-british-tv-advice-on-contraception.html,LONDON  A young girl and boy appear on the viewing screen Arm in arm they walk together In the spring sunlight at first glance the dewy scene looks like a cigarette commercial but then comes the voiceover When you care about each other a lot and want to show each other how you feel its natural to worry about what might happen if youre not careful Dont keep your questions to yourself Talk to each other and talk to somebody at the Brook Advisory Centers Never mentioning the word sex this 30second interlude which was previewed here last week is the first commercial of its kindit advertises contraception Its an absolute breakthrough said Mrs Helen Brook the founder of the centers which specialize in distributing birth control advice and contraceptives to young people Weve tried time and time again to get our message past the censor but this time weve won she explained The film which like other cinema advertising in Britain will be viewed during the icecream interval between shows will be distributed in five major cities Edinburgh Bristol Birmingham Coventry and London An awful lot is written about birth control in the press said Mrs Brook a fulltime family planner who will be 65 next October But young people arent influenced by that as much as by advertising on the telly or in the cinema We looked for the kind of message that would make boys and girls holding hands at the back of the stalls suddenly see themselves not just sexy but romantic as well No Lectures But romance has pitfalls and most young people are shy about asking for help she continued One of the things that strikes us most is that when people come here for the first time they often expect to be lectured After the first three minutes when they find thats not the case they relax The film focuses on a couple of teenagers rather than just the girl in the hope that it will encourage young men to accompany their girl friends when seeking contraceptive advice The centers estimate that about one third of their clients are girls who bring along their boyfriends and of that group over half share the costs of supplies and the yearly fee just under 10 The need for the film which was made free of charge by a group of young film makers and advertisers may be indicated by the rising rate of illegitimate pregnancies and births in Britain Provisional figures indicate that last year 21879 therapeutic abortions were recorded in Britain compared to 15020 in 1970 while illegitimate births totaled 20000 an increase over the preceding year Mrs Brook speculated that the reason the commercial slipped past the censors was because the message is implied rather than directly stated There are still a lot of mums and dads who cant accept the idea yet she lamented She said also that it was the parents generation who felt that the availability of contraceptives was a licensefor promiscuity On the contrary I think it shows responsibility when young couples deal with a longterm aspect of their relationship she said Its a bit of old nonsense that adults sometimes hang onto because theyre envious of the freedom of young people to love They want to make it sound pretty nasty she added
The Right to Bear Wanted Children,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/21/archives/the-right-to-bear-wanted-children-welltodo-women-can-obtain.html,WOODS HOLE MassThe antiabortion movement in this country has begun to masquerade as a right to life movement but it seems to be concerned more with the lives of fetuses than with the lives of people I too am for the right to life and a much better life than most people have the chance to live but I think our job is to work for that better life and not to force unintentionally fertilized eggs to become unwanted children The fact is that where abortion is not legal it is performed illegally By and large there is no great difference between the numbers of abortions performed in countries in which it is legal and in those in which it is not Before 1965 the greatest proportion of abortions three to four abortions per live birth was performed in Rumania where abortion was legal and readily available But the next highest abortion rate three abortions per live birth obtains in Uruguay where abortion is illegal Rumania is an interesting case because in 1965 the Government decided that the birth rate needed to be raised and put restrictions on abortions The next year the birth rate did rise but by the following year it was hack down again The decrease in the number of legal abortions had been made up largely by a corresponding increase in the number of illegal abortions Probably onethird to onehalf of all pregnancies in the United States end in abortion and bebop one and twothirds of these abortions are performed illegally By usual estimates in this country at least 2500 illegal abortions are performed every day When one advocates legalization of abortion one is therefore not talking about whether abortions will be performed for they will be whenever women find themselves pregnant and cannot countenance bearing that child Legalization affects primarily two aspects of abortion its safety and its price tag Lets talk safety first The mortality rate from abortions is lowest where abortion is freely available because when readily available it can be performed early in  pregnancy and by qualified people Under such conditions abortion involves a considerably lower risk than childbirth But at ores ent in Washington DC for example ten to twelve times as many women come into hospitals for the repair of botched abortions than obtain legal abortions and botched abortions are the single largest cause of maternal deaths in the United States But antiabortion legislation also introduces economic discrimination For example a recent survey in which American women 15 to 44 years old were asked how many children they expected to have and how many they actually had showed that nonpoor women wanted on the average slightly more than two children per family and had about 15 per cent unwanted pregnancies or about one in six Poor women wanted about the same number of children but had about twice as many unwanted pregnancies 32 per cent or about one in three One in three unplanned children is a large proportion The main reason for the difference lies in the fact that nonpoor women in general use more effective methods of birth control that require the services of a physician Most poor people in this country do not have ready access to preventive medical care and therefore use no birth control or the less reliable methods that do not require medical supervision Furthermore welltodo women can obtain abortions no matter what the law says either by paying the high price of an illegal abortion or by travelling to places where abortion is legal So though restrictive abortion laws work hardships on all women they are hardest on poor women Every woman should have the right to bear as many children as she wants But no woman should be forced to have children she doesnt want Even our most effective contraceptives have about a 1 per cent failure rate and for the woman whom the contraceptive has failed the alternative to an abortion is a compulsory pregnancy Without the availability of abortion in the United States a failure rate of 1 per cent would mean onequarter million compulsory pregnancies per year terminating in the births of onequarter million unwanted children We must secure the right of women to bear only wanted children We must therefore have free and safe birth control and free and safe abortion

A funny thing happened on the way to the coronation,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/23/archives/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-coronation-a-funny-thing.html,MIAMI BEACH The word had just gone forth the McGovern trailer outside the Convention Hall Frank Mankiewicz McGoverns top political strategist was in the back room with Rick Steams the young Rhodes Scholar who was overseeing eight staff members at telephones who in turn were touch directly and indirectly with about 250 McGovern whips on the floor Vote no on the minority report advocating Senator Fred Harriss populist tax proposal said Steams as he emerged from the back room No shouted Deputy Campaign Director Harold Himmelman into the phone No John  I said the vote is no I know Senator Harris is a McGovern supporter but McGovern thinks the majority platform plank is better There was a chorus of nos from the seven other telephoners as Gov Pat Lucey of Wisconsin left the trailer to return to the floor where he would pass the word to the Wisconsin delegation It couldnt have been more than three minutes later when Governor Luceys pleasant Midwestern features came into focus on the TV set inside the trailer He was being interviewed on the floor by Tom Pettit of NBC who wanted to know how the McGovern delegates were going to vote Governor Lucey said Oh we dont control our delegates We cant tell them how to vote We let them know that McGovern is supporting the majority platform but we tell them to vote your conscience  On the day Mervyn Fields California poll showed McGovern a big winner in the June California primary Mankiewicz had told me If things keep going the way they are it wont be a convention it will be a coronation A funny thing happened on the way to the coronation It turned into a convention with all the behindthescenes pulling tugging and manipulating that a true contest entails and Governor Luceys TV performance was related to one of the four key issues the convention had to resolve all designed to secure the nomination of the candidate and to do so on terms that would permit Senator George McGoverns attendance at our Republics only official coronation  Inauguration Day Jan 20 1973 First to win the nomination McGovern thought he had to win the credentials fight on California which by a parliamentary quirk turned out to require losing the credentials fight on South Carolina Second to improve his chances of winning the election he hoped to work out a compromise which would make Mayor Daley of Chicago relatively happy Third McGovern wanted a platform which would reflect his social vision without alienating the more conservative oldline elements of the party this is where Governor Luceys TV performance came in And fourth he hoped to select Vice President who would help bind party wounds without resorting to the unpalatable and oldfashioned practice of blatant ticketbalancing I had called Mankiewicz in the hope that he would let me tail him during the Democrats days in Miami My assumption was that as codirector with Gary Hart of McGoverns preconvention effort he would play a critical role at the convention though a key aide of the Senators when asked who was running the campaign had told me George really is The extent to which McGovern is privately running this is not appreciated I had been told that Hart McGoverns 34yearold national campaign manager is terribly important in an organizational sense Hes the one who put the whole apparatus together and hes the one who can control it But I also knew that Harts work of rounding up the delegates had been mostly completed before the convention commenced whereas the 48yearold Mankiewiczs work of negotiating with the party powers was just beginning When asked his role in the attempt to get the Daley people and the antiDaley reformers together prior to the convention Mankiewicz had said Im just the hollow oak in which both parties drop their messages If McGovern won the California primary he would arrive in Miami with enough delegates to take the nomination and the business of the convention would be to build bridges to the antiMcGovern wing of the party a task which was more in Mankiewiczs than Harts bailiwick Hart would be busy directing the floor effort he had organized while Mankiewicz served as ad hoc political troubleshooter Besides as RFKs respected and wellliked press secretary as the man who in 1968 had the sad duty of telling the nation that Robert F Kennedy was dead as something of a television personality Mankiewicz I thought might be a magnet for people with problems whenever he appeared on the convention floor in a hotel lobby in an elevator Finally it occurred to me that Mankiewicz the son of the late Herman J Mankiewicz who wrote screenplays for such classics as Citizen Kane Duck Soup and Pride of the Yankees seemed to have the wit and the capacity to cut through the conventional and I assumed the convention wisdom It was Mankiewicz who observed when people still came out for Muskie after he had lost the Wisconsin primary Thats the first time I ever heard of rats climbing aboard a sinking ship Actually the lines of authority between Mankiewicz and Hart had up until the convention been rather fluid a situation that was not without its tension It seems to be a problem for some people Gary Hart conceded on convention eve but its not for Frank or me The Senator asked me to take over his campaign in midAugust 1970 and thats what Ive done When I asked Mankiewicz who joined the staff in the spring of 1971 how he would describe the division of labor between Hart and himself he looked at me through the smoke screen of Kools with which he habitually surrounds himself and said About half and half Then he added with his jutjawed smile the corners of his mouth poking up into his cheeks You remember that famous line of Pope John when they asked him how many people work in the Vatican He said About half  In the days that followed I sometimes saw Mankiewicz on the tube ran into him in the lobby and occasionally managed to find my way into the Situation Room at the Doral and the trailer outside Convention Hall Mankiewiczs desk was always piled high with urgent messages from Governors Senators relatives and seekers of rooms tickets jobs favors One day I penetrated his bedroom which was more than he did most days since he existed virtually without sleep only to discover his brother Don a delegate from Long Island who had been told to wait for five minutes and the family would go out to dinner It was now an hour and a half later and there was still no sign of Frank I came out for McGovern before Frank said Don I started out as McGoverns man on the island and worked my way down to foot soldier I figured if I wasnt going to see Frank I might as well interview Don who after all is a novelist and wrote the TV pilots for Ironsides and Marcus Welby What is it like being Frank Mankiewiczs brother We holler at each other a lot Don replied But Im at a disadvantage When somebody is right in the last 3000 arguments and you try to convince him on 3001 its like trying to teach DiMaggio how to hit Kurt Vonnegut once said that the worst thing that can happen to you is to wake up and discover that your highschool class is running the world Well let me tell you its worse than that when you discover that your kid brother whom you remember from the days he couldnt tie his shoelaces is running the campaign of the next President of the United States Credentials Two weeks before the event the Democratic party Credentials Committee sitting in Washington converted the coronation to a convention when it temporarily threw out at least 151 of McGoverns 271 California delegates on the dubious grounds that Californias winnertakeall primary was contrary to the guidelines under which the convention would be operating To complicate matters further the Credentials Committee also threw out Mayor Daleys Illinois slate because it lacked the appropriate numher of women blacks and young although it contained the appropriate number of precinct captains ward heelers and old pols lacking which one is told it is difficult for Democrats to win elections in Illinois Without the challenged California delegates McGovern might not win the nomination Without the challenged Daley delegates McGovern might not win the election Everybody went to court and for a few days the law was a brooding omnipresence in the Miami sky Then on the Friday before Convention Monday the U S Supreme Court stayed an Appeals Court ruling favorable to McGovern and left the seating questions up to the convention saying that at least for the time being the Court had no place in this particular political thicket Mankiewicz who found the decision outrageous observed It was a Nixon decision High lofty moralizing and selfcongratulatory while avoiding the issue If theres a style of speech than can be called nixonian with a small n thats it Nixon is always describing his speeches as important historical He never waits for journalists or historians to call his speeches historic or important Its Nixon who calls it that When asked what he planned to do about it he smiled and said Maybe well take it to The Hague As the McGovern people analyzed it that night there were a number of crucial questions on which the chair would come to rule What would be the order of the challenges Who could vote on them Who could vote on appeals Who could vote on the final adoption of the report And what majority would be required on these votes Hart and Mankiewicz set up a meeting with Lawrence F OBrien the Democratic National Chairman Joseph Califano counsel for the Democratic National Committee and Representative James G OHara of Michigan who was serving as the conventions parliamentarian and whose name had on the Monday morning before the credentials fight mysteriously found its way onto a list of darkhorse VicePresidential possibilities Mankiewicz and Hart had their meeting with OBrien et al at which they presented a brief with all the legal and historical arguments supporting their position and came away unsure of whether they had won their point Mankiewicz later said Were trying to convince OBrien that the possibility of an orderly convention is dependent on California being decided fairly If we lose California half the delegates will think something was stolen Were not sure Larry understands the fury the situation might unleash Joe Napolitan a leading campaign consultant and longtime friend and colleague of OBriens who attended the meeting at his request recalled They were very impressive It was almost like those police teams where Mankiewicz is the soft guy and Hart is the tough guy I never met Hart before but in a very nice way he raised the theoretical questions and let us know the possibilities of what they could do on the floor When OHara was there Hart would talk law When OHara left the room Larry and Frank would talk politics It was a constructive meeting While these private meetings went on the candidate was publicly hinting that he might bolt the party if the nomination was stolen from him As Mankiewicz explained when asked why McGovern would not accept Muskies invitation to a secret meeting of the candidates to resolve the credentials issues If Illinois and California become Czechoslovakia McGovern doesnt want to participate in a Munich On Saturday McGovern and Senator Abe Ribicoff of Connecticut met with OBrien et al and told them what Hart and Mankiewlcz had told them on Friday Despite the meetings Mankiewicz seemed edgy agitated suspicious I asked why he was so upseteven if they lost the California challenge couldnt they make up the missing 151 votes by dealing on things like the VicePresidency That only happens in Allen Drury he replied Thats not the way its done Besides if we did that wed be no different from anyone else Thats not George McGovern In the evening he had an urgent call from Representative Louis Stokes of Ohio It was imperative that he drop everything and attend a rump meeting of the Congressional blacks at the Fontainebleau within the next 15 minutes Mankiewicz said he would be there in five But the phone started ringing and he had to talk to Senator John Tunney of California who agreed to call a halfdozen Muskie supporters and explain to them why they should vote with McGovern on the California challenge You dont change the rules after the game has been played On arriving at the Fontainebleau Mankiewicz found he had lost the room number of the rump black caucus but eventually he tracked down the Rev Walter Fauntroy the District of Columbias delegate to Congress It seemed Senator Hubert H Humphrey was planning to release all of his black delegates and urge them to vote for Representative Shirley Chisholm of Brooklyn Humphreys strategy was to make Mrs Chisholm the official candidate of the black caucus and thereby woo some blacks away from McGovern on the California challenge Humphrey and Chisholm delegates were both voting to stop McGovern from recovering his California delegates so Humphrey would lose nothing by the maneuver The next day Mankiewicz appeared at an earlymorning news conference with Californias mod black Congressman Ronald Dellums an early Chisholm supporter who announced he was switching to McGovern Later on Sunday after 30 hours of conferring with all sides OBrien OHara  Co invited Mankiewicz and representatives of the other candidates to a 130 PM meeting to let them know what the rulings of the chair were going to be  First and most important the chair would rule that only a majority of those present and voting would be needed to determine any credentials challenge or appeal from the chair This made Mankiewicz happy since the McGovern camp were not sure they could muster the absolute majority of 1509 On any given vote under the chairs rule the required majority would be less than 1509 since challenged delegates were not permitted to vote  Second the chair would rule that the South Carolina challenge would come up before the California challenge The regular South Carolina delegation contained only 28 per cent women compared with the states population of 51 per cent women and the challenge sought to replace nine men with nine women This made Mankiewicz unhappy because he was afraid the opposition would take the occasion of the South Carolina vote to appeal the ruling of the chair on the question of which majority would prevail and a vote against McGovern on that issue would mean he would again have to get 1509 votes on California Third the chair would announce that no appeals from its rulings would be entertained unless there was a controversy And the chair would recognize a controversy only when a vote fell in the twilight zone between an absolute majority 1509 and a majority of those present and voting Thus on the South Carolina issue where nine seats were under challenge majority of those present and voting would be 1504 so the chair would hear an appeal from its ruling only if the vote fell between 1504 and 1509 This meant that all the McGovern forces had to do was to manipulate the vote to avoid this danger zone Mankiewicz thought this was good news and his reaction was confirmed when Max Kampelman Humphreys representative on the committee who is an experienced Washington lawyer and political infighter exploded and told OHara that the rulings were hostile dictated by political considerations and the result of intimidation and blackmail He promised to disrupt the proceedings by any means possible A happy Mankiewicz emerged from the meeting I think theyve given it to us he said and then rushed back to the Doral to brief the McGovern team on the rulings and to work out the floor strategy that ultimately defeated the stop McGovern coalition confused Walter Cronkite and disillusioned an army of feminists in the McGovern camp Later that evening he and Eli Siegel a young McGovern aide attended another such meeting where the threats from the other candidates representatives were so virulent that on their return they interrupted Senator McGoverns dinner to give him the news For the McGovern strategists the South Carolina situation was the final obstacle to be surmounted in the long drive for the nomination They had only to avoid falling within the twilight zone on South Carolina between 1504 and 1509 and then they would be home free on California Once they won back their California delegates they would have the nomination locked up For the more militant women however the South Carolina challenge was a litmus test of Mccoverns good faith Would heas they had been assured he would wholeheartedly support their challenge to a delegation comprising only 28 per cent women It was not that the McGovern team which used Anne Wexler who was as responsible as any other person for pushing through the rules reforms in 1968 and Jean Westwood who went on to replace OBrien as the party chairman was insensitive to the problems of women Oh Mankiewicz made a joke when he was asked whether a list being handed out of McGoverns floor men Senators Ribicoff and Gaylord Nelson Governor Lucey et al included any women  Theyre all men theyre all over 40 most are over 50 and none weighs less than their batting averages But the truth was that McGoverns No I priority was still securing the nomination while the womens temporary priority was a symbolic victory When they started the rollcall vote on South Carolina Rick Stearns who had operating responsibility for the 250 floor whips was not sure what he would do All he knew was that at all costs his instructions were to avoid the twilight zone Gary Hart was down on the floor and Stearns went back to confer with Mankiewicz STEARNS Are we going to give instructions that we support South Carolina MANKIEWICZ Where do we stand Could we fall within the margin STEARNS We could MANKIEWICZ Can we hold one delegation STEARNS Were holding Michigan MANKIEWICZ Will the women understand STEARNS No MANKIEWICZ Im worried about that margin STEARNS Ill say that were for it but we dont want to push for any extra votes that will jeopardize California At this point the phone rang not the red one which was a direct line to Senator McGoverns suite in the Doral It was Fauntroy who wanted to know about a black seconder for McGovern Mankiewicz appearing slightly irritated said California had to be won before he could worry about that Then regaining his cool he said This is the real test Walter Were counting on you And if we dont win California a seconding speech isnt going to be worth anything As Mankiewicz talked Stearns moved out into the other room where his team was manning a bank of telephones Tell them the Senator supports the womens caucus he said but remind the people you really trust that we may have to switch some votes at the end This was Stearnss night As a Rhodes Scholar he wrote his thesis on The Constitution of the Democratic National Convention The controlling idea of the thesis he told me is that traditionally reforms are aimed at convention rules but if you really want to understand the politics of the convention you have to construe them in terms of the politics of how people got there Past reforms were always aimed at the institution Thats why I thought the McGovern Commission would have such a tremendous effect And it did Stearns spent a halfhour going over the situation with the floor whips who also heard from Hart and Mankiewicz By the time we got to Maryland he recalled I could see we were getting dangerously close to where wed be in the parliamentary gray area I could see that wed have to shave votes Then Minnesota voted 56 to 8 for the minority report he continued That was the tipoff But was Hubert Humphreys home delegation voting in effect for Humphreys opponent It looked to me like they were attempting to lure us into believing that we could win the vote on a majority of over 1509 and then at the last minute theyd switch some votes and wed be stuck in the twilight zone So I made the decision that we had to lose itwe had to push them over the statutory majority to protect ourselves Once you go over its difficult to get people to back down The Senator would have preferred to go with the women but we couldnt risk it So there on the opening night of the convention was this 27yearold scholar with his neat tally sheet in front of him and seven key state chairmen men like Governor Lucey and Senators Nelson and Ribicoff simultaneously getting their telephone orders as he read to each of them the number of votes they ought to cast which way The instructions in effect lose it but not so obviously that it would be embarrassing When a television reporter who did not understand the McGovern tactics asked Mankiewicz how he could explain the poor showing the challenge seemed to be making in Wisconsin which was supposed to be strong McGovern territory he replied Its obvious that Wisconsin has more male chauvinists than we thought When I heard that said his wife Holly who had come to Miami with their son Josh I knew what was happening Mayor Daley Having won the South Carolina fight by losing thereby paving the way for victory in California the California chairman State Senator Willie Brown was so happy that he almost swallowed the toothpick in his mouth when he kissed Mankiewicz and Hart as the vote passed the magic number the McGovern team proceeded to lose the Illinois fight by winning That is they were unable to devise a compromise satisfactory to both sides Ever since the Credentials Committees ruling against Mayor Daley there had been talk of a compromise Mankiewicz was in touch with Daleys people in Washington but as the convention got closer Daleys position seemed to harden The insurgent slate which had organized to conform to the guidelines included the highly visible and articulate Jesse Jackson and came to symbolize in the minds of most delegates a black alternative to the Daley slate The issue was additionally complicated by the fact that Daley was a triple symbol First he was the symbol of the Chicago repression and the police riots of 1968 second he was a symbol of the establishmentarian oldline half of the party and third he was a symbol of effective machine politics of victory While McGovern officially supported the antiDaley slate he said any number of times that he hoped they would work out a compromise the one he suggested was to seat both delegations giving every delegate a onehalf vote In fact McGovern said so many times that he hoped to bring Daley into the party that a rumor started that McGovern was willing to drop the antiDaley slate On Monday afternoon to quash the rumor and to make sure that Illinois voted right on the California challenge Mankiewicz drafted a letter to the antiDaley delegation signed by McGovern assuring them that McGovern would endorse only a solution accepted by both parties I must say for about 20 minutes there I thought the compromise was possible Mankiewicz said One major leader of a Southern delegation told me that he would vote for the McGovern compromise but only if we first had an upordown vote and Daley lost So the question was do we do that and then go the other way My feeling was that if either side won theyd be unwilling to compromise so I figured we had to go ahead and see if we could get it After the triumphant California vote Mankiewicz met under the stands with William Singer the 31yearold leader of the reform delegation and Jesse Jackson to see whether they wanted an adjournment The hour was late and Mankiewiez was afraid that the mood of the convention might be to seat Daley Singer and Jackson disagreed Mankiewicz returned to the trailer conferred with Hart and by phone with Fred Dutton and McGovern and they all agreed it would be best not to give the stop McGovern coalition a chance to regroup otherwise the compromise would certainly fail So they did not adjourn and the session lasted until 453 AM In a television discussion on the possibility of a Daley compromise Mankiewicz said We may have to be like the US on the Middle East and impose a settlement Within half an hour a West Coast chairman of the UJA was on the phone saying they were getting complaints that he had endorsed the Rogers plan At the last minute Mankiewicz got an agreement from the Singer group to propose the sort of seateverybody plan that McGovern had been talking about and so the McGovern strategists decided to move to suspend the rules a motion that requires a two thirds vote to see if they could pass it without Daleys approval Daleys people had agreed only to reconstitute their own delegation with more women and blacks but not to take any substitutions from the other delegation Stearns who rushed to the floor with a draft of the compromise motion in time to hand it to the Nebraska delegate mounting the podium to make the motion says On our own we knew we obviously werent going to get the twothirds vote needed to suspend the rules But we had to assume that Humphrey and Muskies people might vote with us on Daley They didnt do that They couldnt believe that by winning California we had already won After Daley was dislodged someone asked Mankiewicz how McGovern could possibly hope to beat Nixon given the Democrats disrepair He replied Anybody who picks the Redskins the Dolphins and Pakistan in three weeks just cant win Do you think some voted for you on California who wont vote for you on McGovern asked a TV interviewer Sure said Mankiewicz but who was itMercutioin Romeo and Juliet who said Tis not so deep as well nor so wide as a church door but tis enough twill serve  Tuesday was platform night but first came Governor Wallaces highly dramatic appearance Mankiewicz commented when asked his assessment of the conventions response It was whelmed The Platform It is a mark of the ideological bent of the McGovern campaign that while the leaders gave away some votes to Muskie and Humphrey supporters on the Credentials Committee which then proceeded to temporarily unseat 151 of McGoverns California delegates they made certain that they controlled the Platform Committee Although the country at large may be in a furor over busing it was not Wallaces antibusing plank that preoccupied the convention Even as Monday was the night on which the McGovern forces outmaneuvered outmanipulated and outvoted their opponents on the right Tuesday was the night that they did the same thing to their allies on the left McGovern had arrived at the convention with what he considered a progressive acceptable boobytrapfree liberal platform on which he was content to run Proponents of minority planks on abortion tax reform gay liberation welfare rights  no matter that McGovern might endorse their positions privately were shot down seriatim Some by prearrangement with the chair would be done in by voice vote Thus Senator Fred Harriss tax plan never reached the level of a rollcall vote even though most delegates thought that the yeas were louder than the nays When delegates John Galbraith and Allard Lowenstein belatedly tried to get Californias Willie Brown to move to reconsider the plank Brown declined only because to do so would have required challenging Yvonne Braithwaite Burke the black Californian who had made the ruling while serving as the conventions vice chairman He didnt want to be in the position of embarrassing one of his own Others would be done in by roll call Thus on the abortion vote the word went out that those whose consciences forbade their voting against the bodyrights minority plank would please abstain And even so many were asked if in an emergency they would be prepared to switch their vote As it was the plank was defeated by a vote of 156980 to 110337 but Rick Stearns who kept the closest count said that if we hadnt sent out our word the abortion plank would have passed The minority welfarerights plank was done in at least partly by deception if the man who submitted it George Wiley of the National Welfare Rights Organization is to be believed He had his own meeting with McGovern and according to Wiley They promised to remain neutral Basically we said Give us a direct shot at the delegates They didnt They told their people to get out every vote against us so long as it Continued on Page 41 didnt get them into trouble with black delegations Wed have gotten a lot more if people didnt feel that McGovern was against us that we were hurting our chances Wiley tried unsuccessfully to engage Mankiewicz in an oncamera argument I asked Pierre Salinger who surfaced at the convention as one of McGoverns inner circle Why is it necessary to control the platform that way Isnt that sort of manipulation exactly what McGovern is supposed to be against Isnt it enough that he makes his own position clear on these matters and disavows those planks he personally finds unacceptable Most candidates dont run on their party platforms anyway so why play this game The reason we have to do this is that Nixon wouldnt let us get away with it if we didnt Salinger said Thats the way these guys operate The Vice President With the possible exception of Senator Edward M Kenedys extraordinary appearance and speech written by Milton Gwirtzman the rest of the convention was an anticlimax The nomination of the candidate was pro forma The selection of the nominee for Vice President was interesting chiefly for the rumors that surrounded it First it was Kennedy then it was Leonard Woodcock of the United Automobile Workers then it was Pat Lucey then it was Ribicoff Dick Tuck who published a daily Convention newspaper called The Reliable Source said privately on the Wednesday before the Convention that the Vice Presidential nominee would probably be Senator Eagleton But then he also said that former Massachusetts Governor Endicott Peabody was the only candidate for Vice President with four cities named after him Endicott Peabody Marblehead and Athol Dick Dougherty a McGovern press aide surreptitiously passed around his own list of VicePresidential dark horses Abbie Hoffman Jerry Rubin Bella Abzug Harold Hughess brother At one point Mankiewicz was quoted as saying that if Kennedy said no McGovern would take someone not involved in electoral politics a man more responsible than Ralph Nader but younger than John Gardner When asked what he meant by that he denied having said it He also denied having said There is nobody more responsible than Nader and nobody older than Gardner Mankiewicz sat in on deliberations over the VicePresidency but declines to say what his contribution was other than to concede that he gave serious thought to the idea of New York Citys Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy whose virtues are apparent Musing later he said he rejected the idea on the ground that in a short campaign how do you explain to the American people especiaily when youre running against Nixon that just because you preside over a scandalridden department doesnt mean that you are responsible for the scandals On Thursday when a group of protesters refused to leave the lobby of the Doral Mankiewicz came down and negotiated a deal If Senator McGovern talked with them they would leave in peace They agreed McGovern agreed and there followed a halfhour colloquy which everyone remarked was in striking contrast to the bloody spirit of Chicago McGoverns speech of acceptance brought tears to some when he concluded by quoting from This Land Is My Land Robert Kennedys campaign song providing the words to which was Mankiewiczs only contribution to the address which suggests that Lets Bring America Home Again and return to the virtues of our Founding Fathers is going to be the dominant campaign theme Others who proposed language for the speech included Arthur Schlesinger Stephen Schlesinger Arthurs son and editor of The New Democrat Dick Goodwin Marc Raskin former White House aide and a director of the Institute for Policy Studies Adam Walinsky a former aide to Robert Kennedy and Milton Gwirtzman an attorney for the Kennedy family and an alumnus of the Muskie campaign When I asked Fred Dutton who has been traveling with Senator McGovern whether this wasnt a form of neoisolationism he waved his fist in the air and said that right after the Senator talks about bringing America home again he always explains why its not isolationism A fillip McGovern replaced a reluctanttoleave Larry OBrien with a woman Mrs Jean Westwood of Utah who had successfully managed the California challenge But his nomination of Pierre Salinger as vice chairman the jokes had already started Would he be in charge of the Mens Division was rebuffed when Mayor Charles Evers of Fayette Miss a Humphrey man who was feeling very much left out of the whole convention spontaneously rose and nominated Basil A Paterson New Yorks new national committeeman to run against Salinger Not wanting to embarrass McGovern by having the record show that within 24 hours of his nomination there had been a black minirevolt against his leadership Salinger gracefully declined the honor The analyzers will soon start to tell us what it all means As I write this the Miami sun has barely set on the convention and the delegates have not yet left town The easy thing is to dismiss the McGovern victory as Goldwater with a better territory or as a marriage between the old politics and the new technology I was told that if they wanted to the McGovern computer had the capacity to send a mailing to every American Legion member at the convention But it is more than that Frank Mankiewicz who came to his job by way of Hollywood the Peace Corps Robert Kennedy and the life of a liberal columnist is not the old politics And Gary Hart who came to his job by way of Yale Law School where he worked with Charles Reich before he was famous He was a sort of Ralph Nader before there was a Nader the Justice Department actually he worked in the Internal Security Division Thats where I got my background in snooping and surveillance so whenever Frank suggests we sweep headquarters for bugs I can tell him how many thousands of dollars it will cost and a Washingtontype law practice run out of Denver is not the new technology George McGovern seems to have a special idea of what America is all about and Hart and Mankiewicz each in his own way with his own style has chosen to serve the idea It would be folly to ignore the fact that Wallaces support as registered in primary votes was not reflected in delegates Because he didnt bother to file slates where his strength was Stearns explains that McGovern wrote the rules by which he was nominated imagine if Hubert Humphrey had done that that McGovern manipulated his delegates on policy matters more effectively than any candidate in recent memory of course thats partly because he cares more about policy than most that when you add up the Humphrey Wallace and Muskie popular vote it is apparent that as of convention time Senator McGovern represented something other than the mechanical translation of popular will into democratic decision and that racial and sex quotas are at best a temporaryand at worst a quite dangerousinstrument in a democratic polity Does that mean the guidelines have not adhieved their purpose That they are window dressing which this year happened to yield a more progressive candidate but next year may be captured by some perhaps more astute parliamentarians of the right Not at all As Rick Stearns argues based on the point of his thesis The function of conventions is not to overthrow the elites but to choose between competing elites The McGovern rules simply made the process more fluid Thats an achievement that cant be underrated Does it mean that McGovern cynically misled true believers telling the world he was encouraging them to vote their consciences but telling his staff how he wanted the vote to come out Not really The candidate has been remarkably open about his agreements and disagreements with his constituents and the reasons for them Instructions from a command trailer are by necessity a form of shorthand for all that has gone before Now that McGovern has secured the nomination the inevitable rumors have started about campaign shakeups about staff rivalry about the relative importance of this or that adviser My own observation is that people are resented in inverse chronological order of their arrival on the campaign team and in direct proportion to their closeness to the candidate I dont know why McGovernsupporter and wealthy industrialist Don Mankiewicz says I thought wealthy industrialist were his two first names fundraiser Max Palevsky left town before McGoverns acceptance speech but I do know its not becauseas the rumor had it he felt McGoverns staff was insufficiently enthusiastic at the prospect of McGoverns inviting Ted Kennedy to be the VicePresidential candidate As Frank Mankiewicz puts it The only question on the staff about Teddy was how many fingers theyd be willing to lose to have him Im a lefthandtothewrist man myself At this writing it looks as if Gary Hart will continue running the McGovern campaign organization from Washington and Frank Mankiewicz will continue to do what he has been doing but from the candidates side as he travels across the land The extent to which the traveling party really runs a campaign is far more than the press appreciates says another member of the traveling party which Mankiewicz will oversee Anyway for what its worth another alumnus of the RFK campaign who will also have the candidates ear is Dutton who wrote a book last year on the future of American politics and this year has chosen to reach the masses with an election guide published by Playboy People are absolutely insistent that if youre going to run a political campaign theres got to be one guy in charge Mankiewicz says Maybe its because thats the way you run a business George McGoveins organization chart is more of a daisy chain suggests another McGovern staff man The day after the convention I asked Mankiewicz about all the rumors about pending staff shakeups and tensions between himself and Hart I must say theres an awful lot of pressure on McGovern to make staff changes he admitted I imagine its because were doing so badly Then Mr and Mrs Mankiewicz and Mr and Mrs Hart left for a twoday joint vacation in the Virgin Islands 
The Rapes of Bangladesh,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/23/archives/the-rapes-of-bangladesh-the-rapes.html,DACCA Bangladesh is a green and pleasant land It is flat with a dozen rivers snaking their way through it to the sea watering the fields of jute making them as emerald as the fields of Ireland or putting the rice fields under calm pools which throw back a tranquil sky Among this beauty move a tranquil soft people living in villages raised on mounds above the waters They are poor but not so very poor like so many others in the world who are living on an abundant soil They speak Bengali a lilting tripping language accompanied by delicate gestures They are smallboned shy and kindly to a fault They love their families they love the land into which they were born They love peace In one such village lived a girl of 17 She was considered the belle of the place for she had fine eyes and classical buttocks they were shaped that is as the great Sanskrit poet Kalidasa had prescribed like two halves of a perfect melon As became a good daughter she had married the boy of her fathers choice He had some difficulty choosing because there was no boy in the village who would not jump at the chance of marrying heror so she told me when I spoke to her It was the one and only time she smiled during my interview Her fathers house was the best in the village It was not built of thatch and wattles It was made from corrugated iron When she was married her husband as is often the Hindu custom came to live in her fathers house he having more land than the boys parents Her father bought some more corrugated iron and built another room for the bridal pair On the morning of Oct 17 last year a military truck drove up the one earth road that the village possessed A group of soldiers jumped out obeying the orders of a sergeant who spoke in a language nobody in the village could understand For all that they knew that they were their own soldiers and thus had to be obeyed The village was part of Pakistan and those tall rawboned military men were Pakistanis They spoke so strangely because they came from that part of Pakistan which lay to the West across a thousand miles of a foreign territory that was called India One soldier spoke a little Bengali He told the villagers who gathered round him not to be frightened The soldiers were only there to see if anybody was a worker for the traitor Sheik Mujibur Rahman The villagers knew that the Sheik was the leader of this part of Pakistan and that he was quarreling with the leaders of the other part More they did not know Politics was something that spoiled the programs on the one transistor radio in the village a radio that otherwise gave forth songs when its owner could afford new batteries of which they were inordinately fond and loved sing in the fields The soldiers scattered each taking a house They searched for pamphlets but in a quiet polite way The Hindu women they encountered drew their saris modestly across their faces and the soldiers smiled shyly and avoided them The bride in the corrugated iron house gave her soldier a drink of cool coconut juice He thanked her The soldiers took away the brightest boy in the village a 15yearold who was going to college But they said they would bring him back in the evening He did not come back He has never come back But the soldiers did come back in the same truck at 10 oclock that night It stopped outside the corrugated iron house The family inside was sleeping the three young boys on the floor the bride and her husband on a bed made of wood and string her father and grandmother on ancient beds with mattresses of cotton The soldiers woke them up by kicking down the door They got the family to its feet poking them in the ribs with the muzzles of their automatic rifles They lined them against the wall I have made that journey along the single road I have been in the iron house I have asked the father Were they drunk No he said they were not drunk They did not swear or spit They just He broke off Then knowing I represented this journal he went on I have been told their guns were American You can tell me if this is so I replied that I could not be sure They may well have been There were six soldiers in all Two went into the room that had been built for the bridal couple The others stayed behind with the family one of them covering them with his gun They heard a barked order and the bridegrooms voice protesting Then there was silence until the bride screamed Then there was silence again except for some muffled cries that soon subsided In a few minutes one of the soldiers came out his uniform in disarray He grinned to his companions Another soldier took his place in the extra room And so on until all the six had raped the belle of the village Then all six left hurriedly The father found his daughter lying on the string cot unconscious and bleeding Her husband was crouched on the floor kneeling over his vomit These details I know because the father told me He wanted you who are reading this to know talked to the bride but not in the corrugated iron hut I met her in a large comfortable house in the capital city She had a room of her own a Western bed with a thick mattress and jars of flowers everywhere There were it is said 10000 other women like her When the horror was over and that green and smiling land had become a free independent nation she and the others had been declared Heroines of the Nation Fortunately that did not remain a piece of rhetoric Solid citizens shocked into action had offered their homes the raped womenthose that is who lived Institutions took others She was indeed beautiful Her eyes were soft and even humorous in the Bengali manner Only her mouth was strange It did not seem to belong to her face It was hard and tense When she spoke it would sometimes go into a lightning twist Why was she here in Dacca These kind people she said pointing to my hosts who were there in the room with me these kind people brought me Do you like the big city She shrugged She looked vacantly at the flowers These kind people she began again but interrupted Would you have rather stayed in your village She shook her head The lady of the house said some words to her which she did not translate It seemed that she was encouraging her to talk Her mouth twisted They did not want me she said The villagers Yes She paused And my father was She broke off Ashamed prompted the lady of the house Yes There was a silence in the room Im afraid said the lady of the house it true The whole family feels it has been disgraced By her I said incredulously By fate said the lady of the house By destiny We Hindus believe greatly in destiny I turned back to the girl Your husbandhas he come to see you No He is ill I glanced at my hostess She looked at the ground with an expression of resignation We must try to understand she said It was terrible thing to happen These poor people have no precedent to guide them We Hindus need precedents very much Will you ever go back to the village I asked the girl She looked up A fierce pride suddenly blazed her eyes I do not need to I work here with these kind people That is very good I said I am sure you will be happy here And you will forget I was at loss for words but she nodded obediently I took my leave I was at the door when she called me back Huzoor a title of honour Yes You will see that those men are punished she said Punished Punished Punished Not all showed this reluctance to talk There were others I met who seemed to find some consolation in telling me what had happened to them They wished I felt to see themselves in others eyes Continued on Page 24 to be reassured they had behaved as well as could be expected of them There was a mother of two children in a clinic in Calcutta a city to which with millions of others she had fled for refuge I do not know her name Like most of the others I met her identity was concealed by a number They raped me several times she said quite firm in voice and manner as though she were reporting to the police They made my husband watch But he swore at themterrible names that I did not even know he knew So they killed him with bayonets When they had left I took a rope and put it round my neck to kill myself But I heard my children crying I took them and put them in our cart next morning and joined a great crowd of refugees like myself I did not speak for a week She and the children are safe though she is ill with an internal malfunction that was not described to me in more explicit terms There were those that did not suffer but only saw and it is they that feel the most guilt An old woman in another Bangladesh village spoke and spoke to me about what had happened telling the story over and over again until tears came so fast they silenced her a relief I think that she was seeking The village was on a main through road rare in Bangladesh Her granddaughter aged 13 was waiting for a bus to take her to school A jeep full of soldiers arrived They leaped out seized the child and carried her off into plantation Her grandmother who had seen what had hap pened ran frantically after them But she stopped frozen with fear behind some bushes The soldiers raped the girl several times then shot her I did nothing said the old woman I should have saved her I assured her that had she tried to do so she would not have been alive to tell the tale Perhaps I said she would one day tell it in a court of justice and the men would get their just deserts I did not believe myself but she did and it consoled her But there came a time when I found my mind was growing numb with stories of lust and butchery I felt in the hot and humid air of Bangladesh that I too was beginning to accept things as inevitable Was there any explanation save that of the depravity of human nature I put the question to a political activist a sober man of 40 who had done much to bring the disaster about and was now rebuilding his country We talked bizarrely in a luxurious hotel in Dacca with a youthful rock group playingand playing wellsongs of protest from everywhere but Bangladesh There most certainly is an explanation but I dont know if it isnt as disconcerting as the facts The rape of Bangladesh was a calculated military maneuver made by a trained soldier who came within an ace of winning We were served martinis The group played Bob Dylan From the very beginning when Pakistan was founded the West Pakistanis treated us of East Pakistan as colonials It was logical We had the raw materialsjute rice youve seen for yourself the countryside drowns in them They in the West had very little But they held the reins of government  like Whitehall for instance in the days of the British Raj Pakistan is a developing country to use the catch phrase but West Pakistan had no intention of letting us develop And as you know I think they would have got away with it We Bengalis are a mild peaceful lot until were roused And what roused us was our language The band played the Beatles I felt my thoughts wandering So many Indians have the art of reducing an urgent human question to an abstraction With Bengali subtlety he divined my thoughts No he said Im not talking politics Im talking of the cause of those terrible things you have heard In a way it is grotesque Pakistan is a Moslem state The language of the Koran is Arabic Urdu the language of West Pakistan is a near approach to Arabic It is written in those curly characters with dots and so on But we speak Bengali which is quite different That wouldnt do for West Pakistan We had to speak and write Urdu Not even the Nazis in World War II tried to make the French speak German We protested We formed a movement We made six demands which while keeping us in Pakistan would have preserved our Bengali identity Yahya Khan decided to crush us Yahya Khan was the now deposed head of state in Pakistan I said that I had gathered that he was considered a blundering fool Was he asked my friend I wonder He lost yes But he might not have You seeand now I come to your point he decided to destroy the Bangladesh movement by unleashing a campaign of terror It is a cheap way of fighting a war and Pakistan hasnt much money And a campaign of terror includes rape I said He pursed his lips A campaign of terror includes such things as Dresden and Hiroshima he said I do not remember what number the rock group played at that point I recall we both heard it through in silence But those boys who did these things Have you an explanation for that Yes They were soldiers What do soldiers talk about in barracks Women and sex What do they look for when they go out of barracks on liberty Women and sex Put a gun in their hands and tell them to go out and frighten the wits out of a population and what will be the first thing that leaps to their minds Sex Remember some of our Bengali women are very beautiful My thoughts went back to the past Moslems and Hindus had fought one another for centuries But they had been wars of men against men not men against women Moreover they had been fought usually if not always with a code as rigid on both sides as that of medieval chivalry Moslems and Hindus alike had always held the chastity of women in the highest esteem the Moslems to the point of making their wives and daughters wear veils in public the Hindus celebrating the purity of a wife as the central theme of their religious epic The Ramayana Perhaps it was this very fact working in the minds of simple soldiers free to do as they pleased that had brought about this unprecedented catastrophe They were turning out the lights We walked out from the airconditioning into a sultry tropical night Yahyas plan worked so well that 10 million people fled the country It would have worked all the way if it had not been for one woman knowing her own mind Indira Gandhi saw what she had to do and she did it She sent in her troops and in six days we were all sane again But without that remarkable woman He paused shook his head and said goodnight He had been very calm But he was not so calm as Mother Theresa Mother Theresa is an Albanian who has worked in India for 40 years I knew her by name She is a Catholic and often when I went to the Vatican Palace the prelates would say that if I went to India I should visit her it being always interesting they said to meet a person who was certain to become a saint I went to see her in her small bare mission in Calcutta My excuse was that she had been the first to help the raped women opening five houses in Bangladesh to shelter them There are now over 60 rehabilitation centers in Bangladesh but in the early days the brandnew Government did very little Mother Theresa led the way Her women helpers in white saris with a pale blue border came and went and spoke to me Soon a short woman in the same uniform stood silently beside me and at first I thought she was another assistant Then I saw her face no rather her eyesand I knew who she was She is middleaged Her face is worn But her eyes are young They are tranquil they are shot with humor I have seen those eyes only in two other people Pope John XXIII and Mahatma Gandhi She began her mission in Calcutta by caring for the aged and dying who had been abandoned by their relatives She succored and comforted them in their last moments From that grim and Christian act she had gone on with her works of charity until she had become an Indian legend She brushed aside my compliments that she had been the first in Bangladesh There are thousands at work now she said Then surprisingly and very calm It was a good thing to happen The Bengali is kind at least he means to be kind But it needed something like this to shake him into action Men and women came forward in hundreds to help I think the tragedy of their fellow men has changed them Do you know we have had young men offering to marry these poor women Mother Theresa I asked have any of them done so Not yet she said You see we have the babies Many of the women are pregnant So we must wait For these pregnant women Government facilities are available for abortions but this practice is still not accepted by orthodox society and no pressure of any sort is brought upon the women to leave the ways of their community Most of these babies will see the light of day Mother Theresa looked for a long moment through the window then turned back to me What we need now is forgiveness People still say You did this to us Were going to do it to you  Some I knew had taken revenge The people tell me she went on that all they want is peace But without forgiveness they will never have it
Stop Kidding Around!,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/23/archives/stop-kidding-around-stop-kidding.html,The following piece was submitted by Christopher Arnoll the pseudonym of a 10yearold Long Island boy who has been active in various militant childrens causes for the last three years Arnoll whose father is a doctor and whose mother is a piano teacher was born in bake Zurich Ill At the age of 5 he moved with his parents to Wantagh LI where he attends public school He is president of the Federated Childrens Film Societies of Long Island the author of a forthcoming book The Image of the Child in Film a lecturer and a member of the board of directors of a major New York advertising agency IM fed up Im tired of going to the movies and seeing children portrayed as small sycophantic nonentities whose principal purpose is to flatter the egos of adult moviegoers Im also angry about the way most critics accept these portrayals but then most critics are adults who whether they are aware of the fact or not have a vested interest in maintaining the adult power structure Who publishes the critic Who pays his salary Who reads his column People over 17 thats who But who goes to the movies most often at least whenever we can Who has to sneak around an X rating to be able to see Fritz The Cat Who has to bribe some THE OPENING SPEED GETS THE POPPYS Thursday MercerBrecht 730 A musical by Lila Levant and Lorenzo Fuller Postponed from July 20 crumbum over 17 to escort us past an R rating to see A Day in The Death of Joe Egg only to find a movie in which the child in this case a daughter even though the sex is not important is called a living parsnip and is shown to be a lump of flesh incapable of speech or movement The critics found this film beautiful moving masterful while I sat there feeling impotent identifying with that grotesque heap in the wheelchair feeling loathing for myself wondering whether I in 10 or 12 years time would also have forgot ten what it was like once to have been a child an object to be talked over around about but never to I say its time for moviemakers to take heed before its too late to listen to those of us who stand on the brink of puberty with a new militancy that  I now believewill not be neutralized by advancing age If we stop going to movies and why shouldnt we where will the movie industry be in 20 years Surviving on Federal subsidies if its lucky Joe Egg is not an isolated example of the low esteem in which moviemakers hold children A principal character in Godzilla vs The Smog Monster is a superstitious kid of about 8 whose affection for Godzilla a mythical monster made out of hard rubber and plastic may be interpreted on the one hand as a homosexual crush and on the other as indicative of the childs thus of all childrens readiness to fly from reality into fantasy in the face of any crisis No brat who moons over a comicstrip character like Godzilla is likely to take to the streets to demonstrate on behalf of valid social issues Keep children dumb Keep them out of the mainstream of American life Im reminded of Lewis Carrolls lines Speak roughly to your little boy And beat him when he sneezes He only does it to annoy Because he knows it teases Im dismayed when I think of the love with which my mother once recited that verse to me in my bath Im also proud to say that today she shares that dismay What is it but a denial of my feelings my rights my identity even I might say of that involuntary response to a stimulus that is the childs equivalent to the adults sexual response Beat him when he sneezes Is It any wonder that the world is divided between Us and Them We are the enemy and as long as we can be convinced that we are worthless ineftectual nasty deformed gravely handicapped and often partially toothless our elders need not fear us Take a look at The War Between Men and Women an abortion that playedsignificantly I feelRadio City Music Hall which come our revolution will be designated the Conciergerie for adult opinionmakers while they await their trials Of the three children portrayed in The War Between Men and Women the eldest a girl is rude and interested only in boys and the second also a girl suffers a psychologically rooted stammer The youngest child a little boy is afraid of everything including the water he drinks and the air he breathes It is one of the moviemakers favorite fantasies that the child who is not totally dependent upon his par ents as are the two youngest children in The War Between Men and Wornen is harmless because heshe is consumed with the kind of sexual curiosity that saps revolutionary fervor There are other equally pernicious types of putdown In Ben the 10yearold hero is not only a victim of heart trouble though there is no evidence that he smokes or even drinks he is so emotionally crippled he can relate with satisfaction only to a rat Rats of course play a historical role that cant be easily excised from The Pied Piper of Hamelin a 14thcentury legend that equates children with rats So why in this day and age would anybody want to make a movie of it I think I know I suspect that Jacques Demy ordinarily one of the gentlest of film directors truly loathes children Else how could he take such loving care to portray on film what is essentially the adult worlds most deepseat ed wish the banishment of all children not just to their rooms for an hour but to some hideous eternal kindergarten in the sky The Pied Piper of Hamelin is not about rats Its about adults and its one of the most vicious attacks on children ever exploited for the socalled amusement of children Brothers and sisters weve been had for centuriesand were still being had Even the Peruvian film The Green Wall a movie that otherwise pretends to be humanistic exploits the suffering of a child obviously for the pleasure of the adult audience Quite early in the film we are made aware that the little boy who lives in the jungle with his parents is sooner or later going to be bitten by a venomous snake Over and over the director cuts between shots of the little boy at innocent play and shots of the snake moving inexorably through the grass towards the play area This goes on for the better part of half an hour before the child is finally fatally attacked I have no idea with whom the adult members of the audience were identifying perhaps the snake I being who I am was drawn towards the child I was literally sickened I had to leave the auditorium for several minutes to compose myself Imagine my sadness then when I read several glowing reviews for the film Sadness followed by anger Dont talk to me about style and meaning being the same thing When I go to the movies I see pictures on a screen and when a helpless little kid gets zapped by an adder I get mad So help me I want to zap all adults back And I hate myself for feeling that way I feel degraded strangely soiled somehow The paradox of all this is that moviemakers especially American moviemakers are supposed to cater to the youth market Indeed most of American industry is reportedly geared to create and then meet the demands of an increasingly more youthful consumer Somehow or other moviemakers are getting their wires crossed They make movies for children that children thoughtful children must find intolerable In the last year there has been only one film that in any way captured my admiration Im ashamed but then Im so damned angry that I wont apologize The film was Robert Mulligans The Other based on Thomas Tryons novel about identical twin boys of 10 who between them manage to kill their father turn their mother into a paralyzed mute pickle a baby niece in wine scare an old lady to death and get rid of an adolescent cousin named Russell who is really a sort of Uncle Tom child by means of a pitchfork Im not pleased to admit it but I cheered each new act of mayhem Childrens Liberation tells us not to emulate adults but to realize ourselves This sounds okay and is okay but in my gut I want to strike back I want to get even with the public that remains undisturbed by stories about child abuse and that can make a bestseller out of a spurious novel that portrays a preteen child named Lolita as a seductress thus to relocate Original Sin thus to blame us I believe in freedom as much as the next child I believe in art But it just may be that the time has come for some controls that will effectively curb these biased perverted and perverting portrayals of children by adults Otherwise all dialogue between us will cease Otherwise it will be war and make no mistake about it there are enough of us who are tired of seeing ourselves always as victims to relish a confrontation A savage one Im sorry but its true

How McGovern Lost a Delegate's Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/23/archives/how-mcgovern-lost-a-delegates-vote.html,TRENTON  A week or so before the Democratic national convention opened in Miami Beach Lynn Merle a delegate from Vineland and the Cumberland County coordinator for Senator George S McGovern was asked how long she would stay with Mr McGovern if the convention went more than one ballot I would stay with George McGovern for a thousand ballots and even if I were released I would feel obligated to vote for his choice she said And how about the platform would she be a hardliner or was she amenable to compromise Im a politician now and I realize that there has to be give and take None of us is as ideological as we were a couple of months ago We couldnt be because we had to get elected The convention did not go 1000 ballots It didnt even go two But when the time came for Miss Merle to cast her vote for the partys nominee she did not support George McGovern she gave her vote away to an alternate After arguing and losing in the battles within the conventions platform committee and after four days of being in her words pushed around by McGovern staffers in Miami Beach after trying and failing to convince the McGovern floor leaders and ideals had given way to expedience she just could not bring herself to vote for George McGovern as the nominee for President Senator McGovern wound up with 92 of New Jerseys 109 votes and with the notable exception of the votes on the abortion plank and the Vice Presidency the delegation supported the McGovern line It was incredible Miss Merle recounted People were just sitting around there from the trailer [the Mcwaiting until the word came Govern communications center] or the Doral [the McGovern Miami Beach headquarters] and then they would vote the way they were told I went to Miami with the Idea that I would be a good delegate and do what I was told but expediency began to get in the way of things that we were supposed to stand for Miss Merle 24 years old will be entering graduate school at the University of Southern California in September Like many McGovern county coordinators she simply called the state headquarters in East Orange last spring when Senator McGovern was getting 5 per cent in the popularity polls and asked what she could do to help Miss Merle said she was bothered more by the lack of candor and the patronizing attitude by the McGovern staff people than by Mr McGoverns strategy of moving toward the center And she is also concerned by the lack of emphasis on issues I was a member of the Platform Committee and I sort of felt that that was my baby she said We were fully briefed on rules and credentials but nobody paid any attention to the platform until just before we voted on It We were told by Dick Rubin [a national staff member on liaison to the Jersey delegation] what McGoverns position was But he never told us why Then he said that if we felt strongly about something we should vote our conscience But when the word came over the blue telephones that McGovern needed some votes then Rubin told us that a conscience vote was a no vote Miss Merle was referring to the series of ballots taken on minority positions on the platform where a no vote usually was a vote in behalf of the McGovern strategy of avoiding adoption of such positions as abortion on demand guaranteed income and sexual freedom for homosexuals Miss Merle passed yes votes on these issues and she voted against the abortive compromise that would have seated both the Illinois challengers and the organization slate led by Mayor Richard J Daley of Chicago On other issues however she supported the moderate McGovern approach I realized that it probably was a good thing that the abortion plank was defeated Miss Merle asserted because it would have been a hard thing to run on but I resent all this business of being told to vote your conscience and then when your conscience gets in the way of what his managers think is good for George McGovern you are told to ignore it Despite all these reservations she said she would work for Senator McGovern this fall and work hard Miss Merle hopes to have an organization put together in Cumberland County before next month when she will leave for California adding I expect to be as active as I possibly can in Los Angeles I dont think McGovern is responsible for everything his staff said or did Miss Merle commented Was it all worth it then Im reconciled to what happened Miss Merle said Somehow word filtered up to McGovern I think he got the messige People say he has to move to the right But I say that for every vote he picks up that way hell lose two from the left And I think hes beginning to understand that
Why Is Bella Bored?,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/23/archives/why-is-bella-bored-why-is-bella-bored-by-the-candidate.html,THE critics say this movie The Candidate gives the real inside stuff about how to run a campaign And besides it has everythingsatire cinema verite a hero whos supposed to be KennedyTunneyLindsay but looks like Robert Redford thats even better sex on the run the old politics versus the new the mastermind political technicians making with the TV spots and the trumpedup crowds and the ghetto walking tours and most of all the sellouts because thats what politics is supposed to be and we have to warn the young people dont we So why am I so bored I should be sitting here empathizing with the Candidate and instead I cant warm up to him Maybe thats the idea Hes supposed to be cool Before getting into active politics he makes those little whimsical speeches with long pauses as if hes thinking hard and his issue ecology clean all the way through and hes never even bothered to register let alone vote So hes a sucker for the political mechanic with the beard especially when the guy guarantees him that if he runs for the Senate hell lose That shows hes a committed liberal But the real gimmick is that he himself never even thought of running for office The mechanic finds him the Candidate doesnt go looking for the mechanic Lets see Do I know anyone in Congress like the Candidate In New York I must be hanging out with the wrong types I like the way the campaign starts so quietly and before you know it our hero has won the primary Maybe things are different in California And what about the money Where does it come from Sure he makes one phone call but what about the budget crises and the rounds of fundraisers the cocktail parties lunches dinners shows letters special mailing lists frantic calls for loans to pay the headquarters rent the phone company the sound truck company the button company the sign maker the printer Thats enough to kill most candidates but not this one He doesnt yell much Hes kind of detached But wait He does get mad a couple of times Look at the way he kicks the Coke machine after his advance men have him chasing God knows where to talk to a few farmers in a cavernous hall But then why does he even try to make a formal speech In real life one would scrap the speech and sit down with whoevers there and find out whats bothering them and talk and argue and have a good time The Candidate does have stabs of insight and lots of little funny surface bits culled from campaign trivia I feel for the hero when he rushes off to the forest fire and starts sounding off on his big issue of land preservation and then the incumbent reactionary Senator descends in his helicopter steals the issue steals the Candidates solutions smoothly mentioning that hes talked it over with the President and is introducing a bill The Candidate is left standing there like a dummy Were going to see a lot of that in the next few months Nobody beats Nixon at stealing issues Still the Candidate doesnt have to hang around in the background looking pained He should move right in and start debating I thought this was the one Issue he really cared about but there he is on the outside He always seems to be on the outside getting those little surprises Why is he so surprised when he finds the reporter and photographer in his house and his wife dressed up like Jackie in a riding habit Did he think he was going to have a private life He already found out in the mens room scene that hes a standing duck for anyone who wants to insult him or even hit him Those mens rooms seem to be the place for serious conferences Maybe thats why women havent made it to the top in politics They wont let us into the mens rooms where the big decisions are made I dont get the women in this picture not that there are so many The wife for instance is a nothing Pretty but blah Only one young woman serious  looking on his staff Who does all the work And then the mysterious girl in the hotel corridor whom ha makes out with toward the end Thats to show moral rot setting in Oh finally he blows his cool Its the big TV debate and right at the end he gets mad and talks about how our society is in terrible danger and his TV adviser who resembles David Garth is upset because hes spoiled his image The special thing in this campaign is supposed to be those great TV commercials the square flagwaving fullfaceforward ones of the conservative and the tieoff shirt  sleeve action shots of our hero The only trouble is I cant tell whether the Candidate is going to win or lose because of them The commercials are nice but what did they do for Lindsay in Florida Now its getting to the turning point The Candidate is creeping up in the polls and theyre pushing him to compromise Only they dont have to push He makes a few humorous remarks and caves in Hes waffling on busing on abortion on foreign policy but hes got a real good Bobby Kennedy type speech there identifying himself with the poor and the elderly and the oppressed without giving any solutions The fix is in They bring in The Establishment in the person of a labor leader does he have to look like a gangster and our hero insults him but his father the tough old pro rescues the situation and from then on its clear sailing to victory Youre a politician the old man congratulates His Son the Senator Presumably at this point youre supposed to run gagging from the theater What do I do now says the new Senator As the credits flash on the screen and the soundtrack plays Hail to the Chief the full cynicism of the message comes through In order to win you have to lose your principles and all thats left is to run for President As a candidate who has both won and lost I dont buy the message or the script by Jeremy Lamer a dis enchanted McCarthy speechwriter If the hero couldnt figure out what to do once he got elected to the Senate he didnt have much to begin with Of course there are gutless politicians like him around and plenty who will do anything for votes There always have been This movie isnt saying anything new it just says the techniques for winning have changed What worries me is that young people who get disillusioned as quickly as Lanier will find their worst fears confirmed by this simplistic film and see politics as a determinist process that forces its participants from compro mises into doubletalk and sellouts Theres still room for men and women with passion and principles in our society They just need staying power and more confidence in the electorate than The Candidate is willing to concede People in this movie are just crowds that pretty much look alike I hear they showed The Candidate as a benefit down in Miami Beach with the proceeds divided between the Democrats and Republicans Could that be why they mentioned the war in Indochina only once in passing in this film about contemporary politics
Talk of the South,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/24/archives/mcgovern-raises-racial-fears-in-the-south.html,BIRMINGHAM Ala July 21In one little corner of the land at least the national politics of 1972 seem remarkably uncomplicated From Atlanta to Chattanooga to Birmingham the whites with a stake in the outcome are fleeing from George McGovern and the blacks are flocking to him as if he were the last hope of the decade You can hear various reasons expressed but the unavoidable impression is that racial reasons and sentiments form the basis of all others Gov Jimmy Carter of Georgia says he wishes that his partys Presidential candidate would be a more demonstrative patribt for his militant Southern constituency and that Senator McGovern had paid more ostentatious tribute to Gov George C Wallace of Alabama He says he will vote for the McGovernEagleton ticket but he leaves no doubt that it is a vote of duty and that he will try to salvage other Democratic officeholders by emphasizing their independence from the Presidential candidate Pat Brock the Chattanooga candy maker whose brother William now sits in Albert Gores Senate seat in Washington says he thinks Mr McGovern will be decimated at the polls because he is perceived as soft on abortion and indifferent to the American prisoners of war in North Vietnamand because President Nixon has struck a vital nerve by opposing school busing the current convulsion in Chattanooga Economic Fears The elite of Birmingham out in the exclusive suburb of Mountain Brook say they suspect the McGovern economic program and especially all that talk of what might happen to inheritance taxes But David Herring the chairman of the Jefferson County Democratic Committee herea progressive and normally loyal party worker thinks his regions basic fears ought to be stated more bluntly He is advising all his candidates for local office to steer clear of the national ticket for sheer survival Maybe people here would accept it and understand he says if McGovern were just a niggerlover for political reasonsusing the blacks and making it known that he needed their votes But he comes across as a man who really likes blacksa niggerlikeryou know who actually kissed one of those black ladies on the rostrum Mr Herring left the impression of regretting the political danger he attaches to a spirit of equality that he actually admires The perception of blacks in this region is equally blunt John Franklin the mildmannered Commissioner of Education in Chattanooga fears that the Presidential campaign will rekindle racial antagonisms and make the opposition to courtordered desegregation and busing even more intransigent Judge Peter Hall the first black man on a Birmingham bench says no one of his color has any business associating with a Republican Administration that he perceives as hostileunless they are what he calls poverty pimps who are lining up for Federal grants Four more years of Nixon is bad news for us says Lonnie King who has left the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to make some money at the construction of a black office building in Atlanta What he fears are the further conversion of the Supreme Court to conservatism and an antagonisticto blacksadministration of justice The reelection of the President would mean to him not only the erosion of civil rights gains of a decade but something that he earnestly calls American fascism An Old Obsession The same epithet comes spontaneously from Julian Bond the young state legislator from Georgia who is vowing to work harder for Mr McGovern than ever before in a national campaign For all the talk about New Southand there is new breed of politician here who has successfully diverted some state and local campaigns from the bitter divisions of racethere also remains an old obsession with the color line For the white majority this is Wallace country and without the clear alternative of the segregationist Democrat it sees at least safety if not always comfort in such Republican candidacies as those of Barry Goldwater in 1964 and now Richard Nixon in 1972 Nevertheless there Is New Southby which its champions mean either the new vitality of Atlanta which beckons the young to desert other cities throughout this area or at least a new concern with problems no different from those known in the North and West the flight of whites from inner city blacks the struggle to hold or attract jobgiving businesses and industry downtown the recognition that beyond busing and desegregation lies the awesome diffculty of educating any child the frightful cost of pollution of traffic jams of shameful prisons and court procedures Expansion or Merger City expansion or merger with the surrounding suburbs are live issues here as in Atlanta and Chattanooga for the simple reason that city costs are rising while the bigger taxpayers are escaping Atlanta is looking toward a subway to keep its rebuilt core alive and its Mayor Sam Massell is boasting to the cities of the world about the 22 per cent increase in riders and downtown utilizers that resulted from the recent drop in his bus fare from 40 cents to 15 cents The memories of Eugene Bull Connor and the civil rights demonstrators he pursued with dogs and hoses are finally fading in Birmingham Here as elsewhere New South also means a recognition by the owners of downtown real estate and enterprises that economic survival requires a congenial atmosphere for attracting new business But boosterism and civic mindedness can evoke conflicting emotions Black Resentment In much of the black community here for instance there is now welling up a deep resentment of the treatment of Negroes by the police Emotions are running so high that Prof John Monro the former Harvard dean who has devoted himself in recent years to instruction at Miles College the Negro school near here fears another explosion coming on unless the vacant job of Police Commissioner goes to an enlightened and experienced official John Nixon a dentist and the former head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People here believes with other blacks that more jobs and therefore enterprises would help overcome a great many urban difficulties including racial antagonism Yet how do you vent the blacks anger and reform the police without at the same time scaring away the new business Population Declines Birmingham now knows the toll of an ugly reputation The turmoil of the past decade the depression in its steel industry and the high pitch of its Governors politics combined to produce a net population decline of 10 per cent South Central Bell has finally rewarded the new faith with a gleaming skyscraper to supervise operations in five states and it projects a doubling of telephone households here in the next 10 years But as Donald Hess remarks on returning from Dartmouth only the young with an established family enterprise find it easy to plan a future here His father Emil Hess is a prominent merchant and former president of the Chamber of Commerce who has given leadership to the recreation of his city But Donalds contemporaries both white and black look to Atlanta for opportunity Professor Monro perceives salvation in the rapidly growing Birmingham campus of the University of Alabama Indeed he suspects that the defenders of the old order wont know what hit them until after the South and this town is bursting with progressive teachers and vital longhaired students by the tens of thousands Yet projecting forward from his intimate experience with students in recent years the professor is also troubled by a dangerous undertow The Southern black colleges are doing a great deal for their students he reports even though they arrive illprepared three or four years behind in tabulary arithmetic information and the ability to draw conclusions from facts The real difficulty he remarks turns on their expectation that institutions can work their willwhether that be educating or governing or anything elseirrespective of the individual effort invested Whereas a generation ago survival was perceived by the young as a function of their diligence the professor observes the student today is fooled by affluence and by a benign environment into believing that institutions will provide for him always Black and white he believes are afflicted alike by

Caution on the Left,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/27/archives/caution-on-the-left.html,Not every longhaired troublemaker has returned to the system through George McGovern the Presidential candidate with the Tim Leary smile Though George has received the enthusiastic endorsements of such counterculture heavies as Abbie Hoffman Jerry Rubin and Rolling Stone magazine it is not because McGovern is a radical but because Yippies Hoffman and Rubin have ceased being so and Rolling Stone never was Jerry Rubin whose warpainted face from fiercer days now glares from color posters on Times Square told The Miami Herald July 11 If hes elected hell drop the contempt charges against the Chicago Seven I face five years in the can Sure Im for McGovern Rubin says he is writing a book with Hoffman whom we can assume also has little taste for jail about the Miami conventions As for Rolling Stone the house organ for Con III Inc their endorsement of McGovern was predictable since on their board of directors sits Max Palevsky a major fund raiser and contributor to the McGovern campaign The trouble is when Hoffman Rubin and Rolling Stone speak out politically it is taken to be the voice of political youth While this may have been the case four years ago it just isnt so now The political voice of youth could be heard on the eve of McGoverns nomination when he was forced to come down from his room in the Doral Hotel to the lobby to face a group of existential warriors called Zippies allied with a strange new incarnation of SDS They wanted to know What about this residual force of troops to be left in Thailand What about marijuana prohibition What about abortion Gay rights In addition to the Zippies and the SDS most underground papers around the country have approached the McGovern candidacy with caution While the underground press is of the unanimous opinion that Mr Nixon must be ejected from the White House many underground editorials point out that if elected McGovern will be heir to what has become an American Empire that the business of an empire is worldwide business and that from his past record there is little indication that McGovern sees anything wrong with US imperialism While Hoffman Rubin and Rolling Stone speak for their own special interests in supporting the candidate of the Democratic party the feeling of the young left is perhaps more truly expressed by the underground paper in Atlanta The Great Speckled Bird when it declares It has been the militance and particularly the independence of the antiwar movement in bringing the question of Vietnam into every sector of the American society that made McGoverns candidacy viable in the first place If the antiwar movement loses its independence will lose its influence for it will no longer be a factor with which McGovern or Nixon must contend Rex Weiner is publisher of The New York ACE an underground newspaper
"As the Demand for Abortions Increases in Britain, a New Type of Clinic Is Developing",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/28/archives/as-the-demand-for-abortions-increases-in-britain-a-new-type-of.html,BRIGHTON England July 24  About 30 young women toting overnight bags arrive in this faded seaside resort every day outside an old Vic torian mansion that used to be known as Wistons Girls School Now it is called Wistons Nurs ing Home and it is one of the busiest abortion clinics in Brit ain  One new wing has been add ed since the nursing home opened last September and an other is under construction When it is finished Winstons will be doing 16000 abortions a year which is 1250 more than all the National Health Service hospitals in the Greater London area performed last year 40 by Health Service In the four years since a lib eralized abortion law went into effect in Britain steadily ris ing demand has far outpaced the ability or willingness of most National Health Service units to perform the operation The result has been the im provisation of a threetier sys tem to cope with what one outraged professor of gynecol ogy calls the abortion epidem ic On one side is the Health Service where abortions are often difficult to get but free of charge when they can be ob tained Last year the Health Service performed barely 40 per cent of the 123091 abor tions in Britain On the other side are private clinics where fees range from 250 to 500 and fast fortunes have been made by a handful of doctors who were quick to recognize a commercial oppor tunity In between are estab lishments like Wistons which are now coming into being as nonprofit charitable organi zations in order to show up both the Health Service and the profiteers Easing the Way Were the buffer said Dr Ian Hudson the administrator of the nursing home which was founded by a Birmingham organization called the British Pregnancy Advisory Service It recently opened a second abortion clinic in Liverpool and plans to open three more in other cities by the end of the year The advisory service started soon after the Abortion Act took effect contending that eligible women seeking abortions  single women espec ially  were being received by the Health Service in brusque even accusatory fash ion and frequently turned away At first it was staffed by volunteers who visited the wo men in their homes and re ferred them to doctors willing to perform the operation A similar organization using the same name came into being in London Now both groups are performing their own abortions in their own clinics together this year they expect to do about 45000 That means they will be do ing nearly as many abortions as the Health Service itself and more than all the other clinics in the private sector The fact that Wistons can make enough on a fee of only 125 to support a program of loans and grants for needy pa tients and still keep expand ing its facilities is an index Mr Hudson says of how wo men have been exploited in the more blatantly commercial clinics Such clinics he believes are now catering almost ex clusively to foreign women mainly from France and West Germanywho accounted last year for onefourth of all abor tions in Britain Wistons Sets Standard Wistonsapos also sets a stand ard for the Health Service Dr Hudson asserted in both its medical arrangements and the reassuring climate it offers its patients once they arrive in its cozy carpeted wards which the doctors wife has decorated in floral patterns and warm pastels Considering the attitude patient is likely to meet at roost hospitals he said I think youre doing her a dis service if you refer her to the National Health Service We hear shattering stories In Yorkshire there is one consult ing doctor whose criterion for an abortion is how hard he can make his patients cry The criteria at Wistons are that the woman really want the operation and that it is medically feasible No women are turned away because Dr Hudson or one of his colleagues has made up his mind that she has no good excuse for seek ing an abortion The interpretation of the law depends entirely on the doctors own attiude Dr Hud son said If he is antiabortion and feels he is entitled to play God then he can refuse the wo man On the other hand he said carefully restating an obscure and controversial section of the law that is used to justify four out of five British abortions there are those of us who be lieve in good faith that a woman is bound to be injured if an attempt is made to force her to continue with a pregnancy she has already decided to terminate The legal provision the doc tor paraphrased says an abor tion may be performed when any two doctors have sub scribed in good faith to finding that continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman greater than if the preg nancy were terminated Ironically that wording was slipped into the bill at the end of the debate in the House of Lords four years ago with the approval of the antiabortion forces none of whom realized its impact at the time Both the sponsors and opponents of the Abortion Act agree that Parliament never intended to legalize abortion on demand which is what the New York State Legislature did two years later In New York City alone last year there were 85000 more abortions than in the entire United Kingdom But the rate of abortion in New York ap pears to be leveling off while here it is still climbing British groups that have al ways backed the idea of easy abortions express no interest in further amending the law to make it as sweeping as the New York statute the fact is they acknowledge privately that legal abortions could hardly be easier to obtain than they are here  outside the National Health Service at least That same fact of course is fuel for the antiabortion move ment which has gained strength in the four years since the law went into force The act was drafted in order to he flouted says Miss Elspeth RhysWilliams secretary of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child Many who are active in that organization agree to the neces sity for a legal abortion when a woman faces serious physical or mental injury But they be lieve such injuries should be narrowly defined in medical terms and deny that social con siderations can be medical The sharpest criticism of the law along these lines comes not from the churches but from doctors Among them is Queen Elizabeths own gynecologist Sir John Peel Right to Refuse Sought What they are really fighting for these doctors say is their own right to refuse to do abor tions on what they deem to be medical grounds in the same good faith as doctors who agree to perform them The issue has meaning only within the confines of the Na tional Health Service for no one is demanding that doctors generally be forced to perform abortions to which they object Within those confines how ever it offers dramatic evi dence of how far socialized medicine has to go in Britain before it enforces that drab uniformity that is sometimes held to be one of its main dangers In most of the big British teaching hospitalsthe Health Services major installations the attitude of the professor of obstetrics and gynecology to ward abortion is the surest guide to the availability of the operation Statistics from city to city are wildly inconsistent In New castle last year 150 abortions were performed in Health Ser vice hospitals for every one performed in a private clinic while in Birmingham it was five abortions in private clinics for every one through the Health Service In the Queen Elizabeth Medical Center there  the largest in the Midlands with a 110bed gynecology ward there were fewer abortions in a year than little Wistons Nursing Home in Brighton per forms in four days The major reason as nearly everyone in Birmingham knows is the strong ScotchPresby terian conscience of the pro fessor of gynecology Dr Hugh McLaren who regards clinics such as Wistons as efficient sausage machines The law has popularized abortion and the public has gone absolutely starkers Dr McLaren declared the other day when he was interviewed on the subject Ninetyeight per cent of all British abortions are social disposals in fact We think thats wrong Were not social abortionists were ob stetricians Professor McLaren held up a color slide showing a plump and apparently healthy 15 yearold girl who was brought to the hospital by her parents for an abortion At some Health Service hospitalsand in all private clinicsit would be taken for granted that a 15yearold girl could be in jured by becoming a mother In Birmingham the professor thought that the girl needed a social worker not a doctor Theres nothing wrong with her health he said Shes just sexy Responding to criticism by both supporters and oppo nents of the Abortion Act the Conservative party Government last year appointed a High Court judge as head of an im partial committee to study the administration of the act and suggest ways in which some of its obvious anomalies might be ironed out Possibly because of the sensitivity of the issue the committee was given two years to report One question it will consider is why it is sometimes even harder for a woman to get guidance on contraception from the National Health Service than it is for her to get an abortion

"Women, the convention and brown paper bags",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/30/archives/women-the-convention-and-brown-paper-bags-women.html,It is absolutely crucial that no one go for hot dogs or anything else during the voting tonight or the Senator could lose the nomination You must look and listen carefully for our instructions on the floor You know were not exactly a fascist organization but it is imperative that you follow our orders implicitly  Gary Hart McGoverns national campaign man ager spoke slowly and with scientific precision into a hand microphone It was early in the Dem ocratic convention at Miami Beach and at a caucus of McGovern floor managers and delegates of whom I was one from California Hart was explaining the Senators strategy on the challenge to the South Carolina delegation which was the first on the convention calendar and had become the priority issue for women The challengers charged that women were underrepresented on the delegation and sought to replace nine men with nine women In principle Hart wanted us to vote for the challenge However the McGovern high command sensed that if the challenge did not lose decisively or win decisively the question of what constituted a majority vote during the convention could be raised from the floor If that occurred when the 151 StopMcGov ern delegates from California were eligible to vote it was dangerously possible that 1509 votes would be established as a majority thereby threatening the California challenge which would come later If 1509 votes was established as a majority and McGovern didnt have enough votes to win the California challenge his nomination on the first ballot would be impossible Therefore it might be politically necessary to dump votes and de cisively lose the South Carolina challenge on purpose It took time to explain and reexplain but ulti mately everyone understood The problem of course was that many Mc Govern delegates would feel manipulated and some thing worseMcGovern himself had promised the National Womens Political Caucus NWPC that he unequivocally supported the South Carolina challenge and would lend his complete support to its success In June 1971 Gloria Steinem Bella Abzug Betty Freidan and Shirley Chisholm had formed a multipartisan organization to bring women into the political arena The NWPC had worked a year to secure representation at the Democratic convention Of the 1134 women delegates and 742 women alternates about 10 per cent were also NWPC members  or approximately 113 dele gates and 74 alternatesand their influence far exceeded their numbers Their spokeswomen for the convention were Bella Abzug and Gloria Steinem Black clouds and rain ushered in the convention as the delegates gathered in the great hall traipsing across a thick crimson carpet which somehow served to soften the acoustics and convey the inviting impression of a gigantic multiseat living room Laden with buttons hats posters political literature and credentials each delegate found his corner of democracy for the next four days The California delegation representing McGovern took their seats toward the front The stopMc Governs sat at the rear It was a foregone con clusion we wouldnt communicate Outside the hall Willie Brown cochairperson of the California delegation was arguing with a security guard who wouldnt let him in because he had improper credentials The delegation 43 per cent women sat waiting for the South Carolina challenge with brown paper bags of food on their laps They were not going to move from their seats After an indecisive voice vote on the South Carolina challenge Ms Abzug called for a roll call With that McGoverns problems began Every thing Gary Hart had warned us about was now possible McGovern delegates all over the floor sat attentively waiting for instructions As the roll call progressed it seemed that the womens challenge was doing very well Then a strange thing happened Some states began to switch their votes I sat with my portable TV set on my lap and listened to Walter Cronkite The McGovern forces are losing ground This is a serious setback I dont understand whats going on He went on to mention a report that the McGovernites were going to throw the South Carolina challenge deliberately For 90 minutes Cronkite was confused Then irony of ironies Anne Wexler the brilliant Mc Govern strategist admitted to Dave Schoumacher of CBS that she had dumped the womens chal lenge on purpose so McGoverns strength wouldnt show on the floor and the question of what consti tuted a majority wouldnt come up Suddenly I heard a commotion to my left I looked up and charging across the floor toward my seat in the California delegation was Bella Abzug with whom I had served on the Platform Committee Abzug  the most refreshing and effective radical force to hit the House of Repre sentatives in yearsraised her fist her straw hat shaking and thundered at the top of her famous voice The McGovern staff has sold the women down the river I wont let you bastards get away with this You dont need to do it you could have won by enough to make an absolute majority     Youve sabotaged all our efforts I wont forget this I went out and got you 200 more votes Her eyes were murderous I got up from my seat She walked away stopped and came back again After each of her points she walked away again Come on Bella I said stop still a second so I can tell you why were doing this It could cost McGovern the nomination if we dont She piled her hands on her hips stood with her feet apart and said My figures say otherwise Well I guess that makes you McGoverns new campaign strategist replacing Gary Hart I said Who needs Gary Hart Hes a 34yearold kid I dont give a goddam about Gary Hart A crowd was gathering fast Oh for Christsake Bellaevery time you see a red light go on you get up there and do a number You know youre getting to be a bigger ham than I am Im becoming the pol and youre becoming the drama expert A crowd of Chicanos and black women from my delegation began backing me up Bella walked away again Come back here Bella they yelled Let us explain why we have to do this Bella turned It is unconscionable I know more about this than you do she yelled and then barreled back to the New York delegation She was right The McGovern strategists had gotten nervous too soon But she hadnt realized how hard it had been for them to sacrifice idealism on the altar of pragmatism Because the question of a majority had not come up McGovern survived the crucial California vote but with the loss of the South Carolina test the priority issue of the women delegates had gone down to defeat too Anne Wexler was a brilliant strategist but she was no feminist With the nomination of the candidate assured the real issue of the convention came before the delegates    WOMEN Leaders of the Womens Caucus were absolutely furious In their opinion McGovern had lied in promising to support the South Carolina challenge and they knew now that they had the power to embarrass him thoroughly with one issueabortion During the Platform Committee hearings in Washington in late June McGovern had gotten a taste of how most of the women felt Feeling that McGovern was insensitive to their concerns and priorities the NWPC had requested a meeting to dis cuss his views on women Some 28 of us were in vited to his Japanesestyle home in Washington There sitting among others on a wool carpet woven to look like an authentic rice straw tatami surrounded by Kahemono scrolls and low formal furniture were Gloria Steinem crosslegged against a sliding glass door her long coiffed toast  colored hair spilling around purpletinted aviator glasses and Betty Freidan curled in a silk printed dress with her arms folded McGovern entered He wore a pinstriped suit blue and red tie white shirt and a just a touch of nervous strain on his face that indicated nothing can make a man even a normally calm cool and collected one like the Senator from the placid state of South Dakota  more nervous than a group of demanding forsaken intelligent unheeded women who are more than probably any other force in America responsible for a bloodless revolution that is already re versing some of the coun trys priorities McGovern leaned back in his chair Senator said Betty Frei dan Youve been saying some ridiculous things lately Why did you say you believed that the New York State abortion law was too liberal if you believe it is a question of states rights They hadnt wasted any time getting to the point Its the number of weeks he said I think 24 weeks is too late for an abortion Why dont you leave that to the doctors Senator said Brenda Feigen  Fastau Theyre perfectly capable of deciding when its unsafe Well the Supreme Court decision will come down soon Ill run on that Gloria leaned forward You know the Supreme Court wont be good enough Now I have just the language for you Senator which would be acceptable in the platform to run on I suggest non governmental interference in the sexual and reproductive freedom of the American citizen  McGovern leaned forward Thats interesting Gloria sat up straighter We women look at this sub ject as our Vietnam since there are more women dying from butchered abortions than servicemen killed over there McGovern nodded the way he always does when he listens intently Betty Freidan got to her feet You know Senator you shouldnt joke about the theory of the virgin birth of Christ either as you did in Newsweek You dont know how serious the women are in this country     You have got to start asserting yourself in terms of womens issues because you wont win the election without them If you dont I couldnt be less en thusiastic about your candi dacy You think you have women in your pocket but you dont And you have to have more women visible in your campaign because right now they just arent there Thats just sheer non sense McGovern replied You dont know what youre talking about The women are represented in this campaign on what I would call a fair basisall across this country you just dont know what youre talking about No Just look at the CBS story of McGoverns top ad visersand there are six men period Theres not a lot I can do about thatthats news media distortion Look he said The only place we really dif fer is on abortion isnt it Senator I have to speak out on that a lady from New Jersey spoke up There are some of us who dont feel as strongly as Gloria and Betty on abortion Im sorry but    We dont need to discuss that said Gloria I can give you statistics on how popular abortion would be  but my language would certainly avoid it in a Presidential campaign I thought about nongovern mental interference in the sexual and reproductive free dom of the individual citizen It sounded okay but some thing bothered me After a while McGovern got up from his chair thanked the women and moved to the corner of the room where he talked with a group of us including Gloria and Betty Let me think over this language for the next 24 hours well talk again The women dispersed some pleased some not Driving back to my hotel in the car I figured out what was bother ing me At the hotel I found Gloria lobbying the platform drafting committee  namely Bella Abzug who deserves credit for the language of most of what is progressive in the platform Gloria Bella you realize the language puts McGovern in the position of defying states rights where sex laws are concerned so that some imaginative clever journalist can do research on sex laws and conclude that George Mc Govern is for sodomy in the streets How will that look for a Presidential candidate regardless of how much we all agree with sexual freedom Glorias hand flew to her mouth Shhh she said No one will think of that  we want this language regard less You mean you want Mc Govern to run on a platform that makes it OK to    goat in the street It might do him good Later I telephoned Mc Govern to inform him of the hidden implications of Glorias language He then asked Bella and me to work something out The next morning Gloria and Betty Freidan gave a press conference They attacked Mc Govern as being a disappoint ment and not at all in touch with the concerns of women They concluded by reaffirm ing their support of Shirley Chisholm At 230 AM the morn ing of the second day in Washington I found Gloria had successfully lob bied the platform committees task force on abortion I must have been somewhere trying to lobby a hot meal and her language had been included at the bottom of one page of a series of proposals to the drafting committee Its intent slowly began to dawn on people At 245 AM with the plank about to be sub mitted Eleanor Clark French a delegate from New York turned to me and said My God Ive been Gloria Steinems patsy where are some scis sors I rushed to the front desk of the hotel and picked up a pair of scissors then I col lected the stack of proposals and went to a back room where I cut off the bottoms of all the pages on which the language appeared If the press or anyone else dis covered that McGovern might find the proposal acceptable wed be in trouble even if it was never included To exclude the subject of abortion from the platform entirely violated my own personal beliefs as well as those of many of the other members of the committee The right to abortion on de mand the right of a woman to control her own body was a basic human female free dom To deny a woman that right by maintaining laws against abortion was to keep a woman a secondclass citi zen whose rights were deter mined by the arbitrary im posed impersonal authority of men Of all the planks before the Platform Committee noth ing was more personal more individual or received more dedicated study and discus sionon both sides of the issuethan abortion Because it was a matter dealing with the question of life itself it brought out deep and disturb ing moral and religious con siderations And because it was so personal and so deeply disturbing I was beginning to realize that it was not a sub ject to introduce into partisan politics The laws needed to be changed there was no ques tion about that But with Richard Nixon as the opposi tion it seemed to me a strong abortion plank would hurt not only George McGovernbut the issue itself If Nixon had the audacity to write a letter to Cardinal Cooke about the New York State abortion law thereby involving the execu tive branch of the Government in a states legislation what would he do if it became a campaign issue In my opinion he was mercilessly political on the subject and might fan the emotional flames sur rounding it so much that other important issues in the fall campaign could become for gotten Bella disagreed with me She said that Nixon would make it a campaign issue any way Far into the night over hamburgers at the White Tower restaurant she talked about why she believed it belonged in the political process It was a subject that needed airing because the laws needed changing so badly she emphasized Being an ex pert in pressure politics she knew how far she could go without damaging the cause and what gains she could make in terms of the womens movement if it was handled properly She was not only being feminist in her attitudeshe was being pragmatic while I agreed with her in many ways however I felt that even while winning the battle over the issue we might lose the war of the Presidency I was will ing to put the question of a womans right to her own body on the back burner for five more months So I drafted a plank which stated that the matter of abortion was up to a woman her doctor and anyone else she wished to consultbut that was a matter best kept out of a Presidential cam paign The next day the plank passed the Platform Com mittee on a show of hands but the opposition called for a roll call Voting against were on the one hand pro abortionists who wanted a stronger statement included in the platform and on the other hand people firmly opposed to mention of abortion in any context So complicated and disturbing was the discussion that afterwards no one could claim that the Platform Com mittee had taken a firm posi tion one way or the other Therefore nothing appeared in the majority platform report At 330 AM the subject was closed Thus it was that at 9 oclock the following morning or the Platform Committees deliberations Jennifer Wilke from Alaska was stunned to see that nothing on abortion had been included in the majority platform And even enouph abortion was not her thing she was moved to collect the necessary number of signa tures to enter a minority resolution which said that in matters relating to human reproduction each persons right to privacy free dom of choice and individual conscience shall be fully re spected consistent with rele vant Supreme Court deci sions Now in Miami Beach at 515 AM the morning of the third day of the convention Wednesday  Section 7 of Rights Power and Social Jus tice the weak minority reso lution was before the body We had come to abortion once again and the convention hall woke up I had decided to speak in the time reserved for opposi tion to the minority plank It was the only time open and it was just as well because what I had to say would pre vent anyone from giving a righttolife speech The McGovern staff had agreed on a hands off policy I didnt speak against the minority plank but called instead for a vote of con science outlining the history of the work done on the Plat form Committee However just before I spoke Eugene Walsh a dele gate from Missouri made an emotional speech against abor tion He talked about the murder of little children the right of the fetus to life and in general poured gaso line on an already inflamed issue Two longhaired sandaled girls in blue jeans rushed up to me Why arent there any women speaking out against abortion they pleaded Its just horrible that only a man is against murder Youre for murder too even though you sounded like you dont want them to vote that way Its not fair One of them broke down completely Her friend led her away Young girls with a free lifestyle and their future ahead of them as part of a new worldand they are against the right to their own bodies I rushed from the podi um back to the California delegation to find Willie Brown and the McGovern staff hovering over the red telephone Were in big trou ble Willie said The Wal lace  Humphrey forces have gotten together and sent out the word to vote yes on abortion in order to embarrass the Senator My stomach turned over Those sons of bitches screamed Willie Ill cast all 271 votes from California against it if thats how theyre gonna play We went along with a legiti mate vote of conscience and now theyre screwing us The women in the Califor nia delegation heard what he said and descended on him like locusts Well report it Willie Brown you cant do that Pierre Salinger came over to Willie North Carolina is going big for abortionthe fix is in We have to do some thing They didnt play fair now we have no choice So the word went out Lobby twist arms plead anything  only its vote no on abortion Bella began to circulate Vote yes on abortion she was saying you can afford to because itll lose anyway Gloria ran up to Joe Duffey a McGovern floor manager She tore into him shrieking You are a bastard for allow ing the righttolife man to speak You lied to us You promised you wouldnt allow anyone like that to speak Joe was shocked He was speechless He claimed he had agreed to go along with a legitimate vote of conscience Near hysteria Gloria burst into tears before the television cameras and rushed down the aisle With the tactics rampantly political on the floor Gloria had concluded that the male enemy had once again con spired against her If the abortion vote lost it was be cause one male had allowed another male to talk about the rights of the fetus instead of the rights of women I was more shaken than Duffey What did the women delegates who had never been part of the political process think of all that Were they as suspicious as their media leaders were I hadnt found much opposi tion to the need for pragma tism The women in California were satisfied to vote their consciences They thought Eugene Walsh had been ridic ulous probably helping more than hurting because of it I heard the same thing from other delegations It was true they didnt want their votes dumped but they accepted the practicalities Hysteria had be come oldfashioned There was a new world of women now who were essentially calm and extremely welldisciplined if given the chance to partici pate With the emergence of those who had heretofore remained silent came the possibility of real change Change that wouldnt happen on television but rather in offices living rooms colleges and in the political process itself What no one understood about the abortion vote was that Martha McKaya calm sensible nontheatrical woman from North Carolina was re sponsible for the yes vote in North Carolina She had formed a strong womans cau cus and her strategy had been to lobby the men The success of her maneuver had fooled everybody The McGovern people were wrong to believe the vote had been intended to embarrass McGovern and Gloria was wrong to believe the obsolete theory that the enemy was men The minority plank on abor tion lost Once again there was not enough agreement on the subject But in the process a new political awareness emerged The 1134 women delegates were more prag matic than anyone had real ized They saw no reason to supplant unreasonable tactics by men with unreasonable tactics by women That was what the women of America wanted to change They wanted more directness more honesty more democracy less maneuvering less hysteria and no games For the first time in American political history the concerns of one half the population were recognized as real 
How McGovern will win,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/30/archives/how-mcgovern-will-win-mcgovern.html,Man an boy Ive seen the Dimmycratic party hangin to th ropes a score iv times Ive seen dead an

with its hair sthreamin in its eyes an an axe in its hand chasin Raypublicans into th tall grass Tis niver so good as whin tis broke Mr Dooley To suggest this July that George McGovern will be elected President next November is of course preposterousas preposterous as to have suggested last November that he would win the Democratic nomination this July The columnists the editorial writers the professional politicians and the rest of the class that specializes in doing other peoples thinking for them are already explaining with hardly diminished confidence why the same things that they used to say would deny McGovern the nomi nation will now surely deny him the election Still it is possible that the spring may contain lessons for the autumn No one contends that it will be easy for McGovern to win so one might as well begin the argument by noting the obstacles in his path First of all he is running against an incumbent President prepared to exploit the ample advantages conferred by resi dence in the White House the ability to create new situations the command of the means of com munication a certain familiarity and authority in the public eye Moreover this incumbent though quite sufficiently vulnerable has not been the utter disaster some had predicted It is true enough that many of the good things he has done like changing our China policy or establishing price controls were at the expense of his own longproclaimed prin ciples But a politician unencumbered by principle has certain technical advantagesabove all the capacity to surprise the opposition It is altogether conceivable for example that President Nixon will in due course change his Vietnam policy in an effort to get the prisoners of war home in time for the election Further the Republican party is the richest polit ical party in the long history of the world As Jack Anderson so insistently documents for us large corporations have enjoyed unprecedentedly tender relations with the American Government under President Nixon and men of wealth will no doubt be prepared to make appropriate sacrifices to keep those relationships aliveeven to the point of providing the Republicans through one chan nel or another with 50million or so to return Nixon to power In addition the Nixon Adminis tration has been relatively successful in its efforts to intimidate the television networks and even the press hence quite apart from the natural affinity of communications barons for Republicans one may expect that the Presidents reelection cam paign will have predominant exposure in the media and overwhelming support on the editorial pages And the Nixon managers unquestionably hope through the proper deployment of John Connally to make substantial inroads among disaffected Dem ocrats Then there is the curious fact that certain foreign governmentsnotably those of Russia China and Israelseem to favor President Nixons reelection It is easy to understand why Moscow and Peking should want Nixon again He is by now a known quantity something always favored by conven tional Communist minds moreover both Brezhnev and Chou Enlai have a considerable personal investment in him And Marxists generally prefer dealing with conservative leaders in capitalist states on the theory that conservatives represent the real power in the country and can deliver the capitalist interests while liberals only antagonize the true centers of power Support from Russia and China hardly means that American Communists and Maoists will rush to endorse Nixon but it does mean that Russia and China will avoid doing things that might embarrass Nixon before the election The phenomenon of Israel is more puzzling No foreign envoy since the unfortunate SackvilleWest in 1888 has intervened so mindlessly in internal American politics as the present Israeli ambassador in Washington General Rabin Publicly he has dis missed the Democrats as a party of words and praised the Republicans as the party of deeds and privately he has wigwagged to Jewish leaders that they must get behind Nixon Unless his Govern ment recalls him one must assume that he is executing a premeditated policy The impact of such gross intervention on the highly intelligent and independent Jewish vote is however prob lematic In McGovern himself the Republicans have what they affect to see as an extremely easy target an unknown a presumed radical the candidate of what they expect will be a sullen and divided party All this seems a formidable array of obstacles for McGovern to overcome Yet McGovern heaven knows has overcome formidable obstacles up to this point And he has done so because his percep tion of what is wrong with America seems to express the concern of millions of Americans and because his vision of what America might become seems to express the hope and faith of these mil lions In the end this may be more decisive in determining the result than all the Presidents for eign spectaculars all the money of his supporters and all the solicitude of the Russians the Chinese and Ambassador Rabin What is at stake is two contrasting diagnoses of the American condition President Nixon sees Americans as basically contented trustful of authority to such an extent that he feels he can ignore Congress invade and bomb other countries with impunity and even dispense with regular Presi dential press conferences fearful of change resentful of liberals of the young of those pushy nonwhite minorities dedicated to law and order ancestral pieties and the status quo If this diag nosis is correct Nixon will win If it is wrong he is in serious trouble Senator McGovern has a fundamentally different sense of things In his view many Americans think their country is in a mess they have no automatic trust in authority they do not feel represented in the political process they do not think their Gov ernment cares about them or listens to them they fear that often it lies to them they consider that it is run in the interests of insiders they know that they themselves have no say in the decisions they even wonder whether the system can handle the problms assailing the country a pessimism more penetrating than the pessimism of the Depres sion because then even if the economy was in collapse people believed in the national Govern ment at least after 1933 and felt it represented them and was fighting for them whereas now they are estranged from the political system hostile to what they perceive as a selfish and oblivious ruling Establishment and intensely eager for a change Underlying the McGovern diagnosis is the belief that Americans want change but that they do not know what changes they want that they are gen erally neither liberal nor conservative now in the traditional sense but are rather essentially nonideo logical At the same time the extension of higher ed ucation and of the electronic media has made them unusually aware and demanding They want leaders to have definite judgments and convictions and not to reflect the voters own uncertainties or to retreat into clich and banality They are turned off by politicians who do not take stands And because they realize that many of the questions the nation faces have no easy answers they are rather tolerant about specific issues and do not expect to agree with every stand a politician takes They are more interested in their own sense of his personality of his honesty and decency of his readiness to listen to them and level with them of his determination to change things As Haynes Johnson the sensitive political reporter of The Washington Post wrote a year ago The issue if Im right is not the waror the economyor crime and permissiveness and youth and drugsor pollution of the environment    It is what kind of country America is going to become and whether the people will believe what anyone tells them If this diagnosis is correct McGovern will win There are strong reasons to think it may be correct Do people think the country is a mess According to the findings of A H Cantrill and C W Roll Jr in their study published last year Hopes and Fears of the American People 47 per cent of Americans believe that national unrest is serious enough to lead to a real breakdown in this country Are people estranged from the political order Louis Harris this July found that in both the public and private sector the Establishment is under heavy attack Fifty per cent of the respond ents to his poll agreed with the statement The people running this country dont really care what happens to people like yourself The Harris com puter came up with 47 per cent as the national figure in an alienation index In what sense do voters care about issues Polls have repeatedly shown how little difference so called ideological differences among candidates make in the nineteenseventies Conventionalminded political reporters are indignant when voters hesi tate between McGovern and George Wallace or describe themselves as hawks and antibusers and then vote for McGovern Such reporters really dont get what is happening to the country As another Harris poll reported last December the muchtouted ideological differences    have made little impact on the rank and file of the voters likely to deter mine the nominees in the primaries The primaries themselves especially the success of McGovern and Wallace provide the best evidence for the proposi tion that voters in 1972 care less about a candi dates stand on particular issues then they do about the candidates integrity his broad direction in policy and above all whether he wants to keep or to change the poli tical setup that so many feel has excluded and abandoned them The political pundits in their splurges of afterthefact wisdom explained McGoverns success in the primaries as the result of preternatural skills in organization On the whole pundits know very little about politics If a poli tician wins they automatically attribute it to the marvelous efficiency of his organization if he loses it is because his organization was poor Mc Govern does indeed have a firstrate organization but this did not arise because Frank Mankiewicz and Gary Hart rubbed a lamp It arose in response to McGoverns perception of the national mood and would not have come into existence without it Of course his success in the primaries was among Dem ocratic voters and as the pun dits have assured us espe cially among extreme Dem ocratic voters the primaries in 1972 were ascribed some mystical power not detected in earlier years to wipe out the center of the party The convention was supposed to carry fragmentation even fur ther No doubt some Dem ocrats are unhappy after Miami Beach but Republicans should not count too much on that There are fewer unhappy Democrats than in 1968 nor are they as fierce in their un happiness and there is much more time this year to heal wounds the 1968 convention took place in late August For a convention that threw out Mayor Daley and put down Governor Wallace Miami Beach turned out to be a sur prisingly amiable even be nign affair The Democratic party is the longestlived political party in the world It has lasted longer than any other party in this or any other country because it has recurrently welcomed and absorbed the emerging energies of American life When vital new forces claim a role people who like the party as it is become unhappy and resentful Some feel it to be the end of the party if not the world But the party not only survives it prospers The last time this happened in a big way was when or ganized labor surged into the Democratic party in the nine teenthirties The more vener able among us can still recall the lamentations and cries of doom with which the Southern patriarchs of the party Estab lishment looked upon the ag gressive young trade union ists Ironically labor itself is today a bastion of the Estab lishment and feels threatened by the women the young the blacks and so on precisely as the Bourbons felt threatened by them 40 years ago The party Establishment objects to McGovern not because he is radical but because he is mysterious This proposition is verified by the fact that it was perfectly willing to em brace Senator Kennedy whose views on issues are the same as McGoverns except that some of Kennedys are more radical But the old guard feels relatively comfortable with Kennedy because the Kennedys have been around for a while and it does not feel comfortable with McGov ern In such moments access and familiarity count a good deal more than ideology Still the oldtimers will come to terms with McGov ern as the Establishment of the thirties came to terms with Franklin Roosevelt McGovern will hold I believe most of the traditional Democratic strength among the bluecol lar voters and the nonwhite minorities That his was a new face kept him low in the polls during the early primaries but this soon be came an asset for an elector ate grown tired of old faces It will be even more an asset in the general election Mc Govern is already drawing close to Nixon among inde pendent voters and polls show him running surprising ly well among once reliably Republican groups as suburb anites the bettereducated and farmers Senator Charles Percy the Illinois Republican recently told The Chicago Sun Times that he had talked to many Republican voters who have expressed an intention to cross over and vote for McGovern especially because of his stand on the war As Republicans reflect on the fact that Nixon won last time by only 600000 votes against a bitterly divided Democratic party as they note McGovems inroads into traditionally Republican areas they must begin to wonder where the President is going to find support in 1972 that he did not have in 1968 He has plainly written off large segments of the population the young the poor the blacks the intellectuals the consumer advocates the en vironmentalists No doubt he expects gains among bourbon Democrats through Connal ly Jews through Israel Catholics through abortion and parochial schools and Wallace voters through bus ing but though he will do well here and there he can not realistically suppose that he will find say six or seven million new votes among these groups And he needs six or seven million new votes if he is to offset not just McGovern gains in formerly Republican areas but above all the Dem ocratic potentiality among first voters For since 1968 the elector ate has been enlarged by 25 million young persons entitled to vote for the first time in a Presidential election  11 million enfranchised by the 26th Amendment and 14 mil lion more who became 21 after 1968 If 60 per cent of this group registers and votes it will mean 15 million new voters of whom so far as one can tell more than two thirdssay 10 millionwill vote Democrat now that Mc Govern is the nominee Other wise many might have broken out of the twoparty system those fearful of McGoverns radicalism might note the fact that he has given the two party process pronounced by experts to be in a state of dis solution a new lease on life The Republican plurality of 600000 four years ago could sink without a trace in this flood of new votes This is why the McGovern people are now organizing a nationwide drive to register the young Nor should anyone forget that recent legislation authorizes the registration of voters up to 30 days before Federal elections The Republicans it is said suppose that they can destroy McGovern by denouncing him as a radical They argue that once people are made to un derstand what he realty stands for the scales will fall from their eyes and they will stampede to vote for Nixon But as we have already noted voters this time look at issues as indications of general direc tion rather than as forecasts of specific programs They know well enough that no position paper will become a law before it is ground by the mills of Congress But they do feel that position papers may tell them something about a candidates mood and ideas and they read issues primarily in that sense This is why the effort to unmask McGovern as a revolutionist will not only fail but may well rebound against those who make it Republicans have been using this tactic against McGovern in South Dakota for years and South Dakota is hardly one of our more notably radi cal states Yet South Dakota votersthe people who know McGovern besthave twice sent him to the Senate and by increasing margins not be cause they particularly agree with the positions he has taken as Senator but because they value him as an honor able and conscientious man who tells them the truth McGovern is simply not a believable radical nor do voters once exposed to him perceive him as a menace to society He comes on not as bomb thrower but as an old fashioned American idealist of a traditional sortthe min ister down the street or the teacher across the block moreover as a practical ideal ist who can pilot bombers win Distinguished Flying Crosses build party organizations dis tribute farm surpluses abroad and win elections While Re publican orators conjure up lurid pictures of a wild man out to subvert the Republic the voters will find instead a calm determined quiet chap setting forth a reasoned case in reasonable language calling for America to come home again as a good and decent land representing not frenzy and revolution but rather the application of traditional val ues to a society itself gone out of control Nor indeed is he all that radical on issues Consider the Republican gag about Mc Govern as the 3A candidate acid abortion and amnesty Acid of course means LSD though the Republicans ap parently think it means pot McGovern who is entirely opposed to acid has indeed favored removal of criminal penalties for private posses sion and use of marijuana But this is a position less far reaching than that taken by the recently retired deputy director of the Bureau of Nar cotics and no more than that taken by President Nixons own Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse headed by the former Republican Governor of Pennsylvania Raymond Shafer On abortion McGov ern has said this is a question for the statesthe position taken not only by the Repub lican Governor of New York but by President Nixons own Commission on Population Growth and the American Fu ture headed by that notorious radical John D Rockefeller 3d On amnesty for draft evaders McGovern has taken substan tially the same position as another member of a notori ous radical family Senator Robert A Taft Jr of Ohio On Vietnam he stands along with famous leftists like Clark Clifford and John Knight His desire to return corporate taxes to the level of the last year of the Eisenhower Admin istration hardly represents un bridled extremism and those leftwing kooks Wilbur Mills and Mike Mansfield have al ready proposed an attack on tax privilege somewhat more drastic than McGoverns and readily accepted by him Even his welfare program is essen tially a more generous version of the Family Assistance Plan already submitted to Congress by the Nixon Administration Where McGovern is radical is in his determination to tackle such previously sacro sanct questions as a promiscu ously interventionist foreign policy a grossly inflated de fense budget and a sadly in equitable distribution of wealth and income He is a tough critic of the system of men and ideas that has kept us in Vietnam encouraged the militarization of American diplomacy strengthened in ternal economic inequities re buffed minorities seeking their constitutional rights and re7 garded the national Govern ment as the private domain of the rich and powerful The beneficiaries of this estab lished system are absolutely right to see McGovern as a threat But the more they muster their forces to con demn him as the enemy of the Establishment the more in the current atmosphere they may gain him sympathy as an underdog and confirm the popular belief that he is ex actly what the country needs And the gap between the stridency of their attack and the imperturbably disarming and reassuring persona of McGovern may only mean that in the end they and not McGovern will seem dis turbers of the peace and mer chants of hysteria As for McGovern what beyond the challenge to the Establishment and the call for change will his counter attack consist of There is first of all Vietnam In 1968 Nixon promised to end the war and even confided to the voters that he had a secret plan to bring this about The plan still remains secret In the meantime while Nixon has withdrawn American ground combat forces he has increased American air and naval deployments deepened American involvement with the hopeless regime in Saigon invaded two new countries resumed and intensified the bombing and mined the har bors of North Vietnam It is still possible that with Rus sian and Chinese help he can get a settlement before No vember but to do that he will have to dump the Thieu regime and he could have had a settlement on those terms at any time in the last four years And if he gets a settlement it would be widely believed that McGoverns candidacy had forced him in to it Even if the prisoners of war return many Americans will have the sour feeling that Nixon gratuitously pro longed the war and that if he had done in 1969 what he may still do in 1972 many Americans and many more Vietnamese who are now dead would be alive Then there is the domestic situation Everyone knows that Nixon is not much inter ested in domestic affairs As he told Theodore H White in 1968 Ive always thought this country could run itself domestically without a Presi dent all you need is a com petent Cabinet to run the country at home This policy has hardly been a grand suc cess Though there are signs of mild recovery from the re cession of 197071 there has been little gain in reemploy ment and 6 per cent of the labor force will very likely still be unemployed in the autumn While the belated re sort to controls stopped the careening inflation of 196971 prices are starting to rise again and the stabilization machinery is shaky One doubts whether economic conditipns will be a great source of strength for the Re publicans In the meantime continued revelations of the chumminess of the Nixon Ad ministration with big business are not likely to captivate an electorate already largely persuaded that the people running this country dont really care what happens to people like yourself The Ad ministrations partiality for large and ludicrous conglom erates like ITT the ma ternal concern for incompe tent corporate giants like Lockheed and Penn Central the refusal to disclose Nixon campaign contributors the arrogance of mind that en couraged the Republican Na tional Committee security officer to suppose he could win favor somewhere higher up by bugging the Democratic National Committee  such things can only confirm the average voters contempt for the Republican Establishment Reforming the tax system and cutting down Defense spending will be particularly strong McGovern issues Few citizens are deeply moved by the equity of a tax process in which corporations like Alcoa Gulf  Western and Conti nental Oil can make profits but pay no Federal income taxes as in 1971 or in which individuals56 in 1969with incomes of more than a mil lion dollars pay no Federal income taxes at all The bene ficiaries of such a system will doubtless be loyal to it but there is no reason why any one else should be As for cutting the Defense budget our military spending has been characterized by dupli cation inefficiency and waste as a dozen Congressional in vestigations have shown and as every person who has ever served in the armed forces well knows Increased reve nues and reduced military ex penditures will make it pos sible to substitute personal tax credits for welfare pay ments and thereby provide a system of income guarantees about which we will hear more later And there is President Nix on himself In the end he may be the Democrats secret weapon For whatever the merits of his Administration the President is not a particu larly beloved figure Even Re publicans really dont like him very much He does not like Roosevelt or Eisenhower or Kennedy have reserves of popular affection on which he can draw in cases of error or misfortune He has no high reputation for candor or for principle In addition he is the worst campaigner to re side in the White House since Herbert Hoover He has two campaign styles the above thebattle unctuous which served Dewey so well in 1948 and the rockingsocking in his own manner of the fifties Both are disasters His capac ity to blow elections is un surpassed After the conven tions in 1960 he had a 6per centagepoint lead over John Kennedy in the polls but he succeeded in kicking his lead away before the election After the conventions in 1968 he had a 12point lead over Hubert Humphrey and he al most succeeded in kicking that away In 1970 the Republi cans appeared to be doing fairly well in the Congression al elections until Nixon threw himself into the campaign whereupon he so appalled the electorate that they gave the Democrats a dozen new Con gressmen No doubt the Re publican managers are perfectly aware of this and will do their best to keep their President off the hustings or at least on the high road But it is hard to tell a President he should not campaign as he wishes for his own reelection especially when deluded local candidates will be clamoring for his supportand particu larly hard to say this to Richard M Nixon who meas ures his manhood by his re sponse to crisis So the Dem ocrats may confidently ex pect that before the autumn leaves fall Nixon will hit the campaign trail his voice sputtering his eyes glittering and his arms flailing promis ing to save the Republic from the awful fate of a McGovern Presidency So in a broad sense the election of 1972 will be the politics of authority and the Establishment versus the poli tics of change The contrast obliterates older contrasts be tween liberals and conserva tives It even enters into and atomizes the traditional voting blocs The disgust with the way things have been recently managed in this country the recoil against the Establish ment the pessimism about the national future the desire for unspecified but recognizable change the demand for every day decency in politics and for candor and concern in the White House  these things infect every bloc in the nation including the Estab lishment itself Analysis in conventional termsthe Ital ians will do this the Poles that the Baptists something else  will not work as it used to work The electorate is flowing out of the conven tional blocs or rather new blocs are growing up within both parties and diffusing the old loyalties Women the young the suburbanites for example are on the move as forces in their own right Thus in the labor movement women workers younger workers and workers living in suburbs are making judgments on their own grounds without a passing thought for George Meany In particular young people not only assert a dis tinctive political identity of their own but also have more influence on the attitudes of their parents than any other young group ever has before in American History If McGovern is right on the currents of change his appeal will reach into every part of our society The center itself is moving as it has so many times in the past and Mc Govern has succeeded because he has understood this more clearly than any of his op ponents His techniques of organization are better de signed to operate in this fluid and individualized electorate than campaigns cast in terms of traditional voting blocs This is why he won the pri maries against oldline rivals thinking in oldline categories He won also against new comers who misunderstood the future and supposed that a media campaign could serve as a substitute for face toface contact The volunteer young who canvassed for Mc Govern in state after state are the contemporary equivalents  the only contemporary equivalents  of the ward heelers of the early century and of the C0PAC org anizers of midcentury In the end it comes down to electoral votes so it will be necessary to spend a mo ment in the familiar computa tions The winner in 1972 will need 270 votes in the elec toral college In 1968 Hum phrey carried 13 states with 191 electoral votes The Democrats must subtract Texas and perhaps Michigan from their 1968 list while they may realistically add Wis consin and South Dakota If George Wallace runs he will take electoral votes away from McGovern in the North to give a state or two to Nixon if he stays vaguely within the Democratic fold the potential Wallace voters will probably divide 2 to 1 for Nixon In any case the Democratic nest egg will be 159 this means that assuming the Democrats hold New York and Pennsyl vania McGovern will have to add 111 electoral votes in the campaign In the following states he can look for these votes California 45 Illinois 26 Ohio 25 Michigan 21 New Jersey 17 and Missouri 12 It is easy to speculate on possible combinations Califor nia Illinois Ohio and Michi gan for example would do it or California Illinois New Jer sey and a number of smaller states Alaska 9 Iowa 8 New Mexico 4 North Dakota 3 Delaware 3 are reasonable prospects But except to note that California is a necessity I am not certain how useful such calculations are at this point If the dikes break  if the traditional blocs crum ble everywhere before the forces surging into American politics  McGovern will go very far indeed Some Republicans are seek ing consolation of a maso chistic sort by calling Mc Govern another Goldwater ie a sectarian candidate more concerned with purity than with success and doomed to lead his party to disastrous defeat They are kidding them selves Unlike Goldwater McGovern wants and expects to win and where Goldwater did his best to cut his party off from the mainstream of American life McGovern is trying to renew the Demo cratic party by immersing it in what he sees as the strong est currents in contemporary America Senator Percy has declared himself deeply dis turbed about press comments suggesting that the White House and White House ad visers feel McGovern will be an easy candidate to beat Percy calls him the toughest of all Presidential Democratic opponents and suggests that if they think otherwise Nixons advisers havent really caught on to what the new politics of 1972 is all about    The advisers ought to go out in the country and take another look at it If anyone wants historical analogies for McGovern the appropriate analogy would be not Goldwater in 1964 but Roosevelt in 1932 Forty years ago as today the nation was in a state of political and economic frustration Ordi nary people in 1932 felt a pro found mistrust of the Estab lishment and widespread es trangement from the political order Confronted by stale mate and alienation Franklin Roosevelt understood the im perative necessity of bringing about a realignment of politt cal and economic forces To do this he had to begin his campaign some 15 months be fore the convention and in many cases to operate outside the local organizations of his party Bosses were against him including Tammany Hall in his own state Traditional party leaders were against him including Al Smith the partys candidate four years before the liberal turned con servative who cried of his onetime friend I will take off my coat and fight to the end against any candidate who persists in any demagogic appeal to the masses of the working people of this coun try to destroy themselves by setting class against class and rich against poor Bernard Baruch said If Frank is nomi nated I wont give one cent to the Democratic party The old powers in the party their positions threatened by new forces and new faces did their best to block the new man to denounce his pro grams as absurd and danger ous and even to threaten the breakup of the party But FDR said I warn those nominal Democrats who squint at the future with their faces turned toward the past and who feel no responsibility to the demands of the new time that they are out of step with their party What FDR had going for him was a strong conviction of the insufficiency of exist ing policies a strong concern for what he called the for gotten man and a strong determination to bring about genuine change He repre sented in short the New Politics of 1932 Naturally like all who call for new direc tions he was described as divisive but history has proved that the truly unifying and reconciling leaders are those who move the country forward For FDR put to gether a new coalition  a coalition that revitalized the Democratic party changed the country restored popular faith in government and ushered in a new epoch in American politics In the same way George McGovern stands today for the rejuvenation of the Demo cratic party He is the leader of a coalition of citizen parti cipation a coalition for change as broad as FDRs coalition of 1932 This coali tion  the young the women the blacks the bluecollar workers the suburbanites the farmers the MexicanAmeri cans the intellectualshas al ready won him the nomina tion As he thus proves he understands the vital currents of our time he will bring along the regulars as surely as Roosevelt did 40 years ago Smith walked out of the 1932 convention in a rage but was on the stump for FDR by October and Baruch gave a good deal more than a cent to the Democratic party McGovern now has the oppor tunity to carry forward in the White House the work John Kennedy did not have a chance to complete nor Robert Ken nedy to begin He has read more accurate ly than anyone else the dis quietudes of the nation and where the Wallaces have re sponded to popular discontent by stirring up aimless rancor McGovern has responded by offering reasoned discourse and rational hope If in 1972 as in 1932 voters demand a change from the system and men who have got the na tion into deep trouble at home and abroad if they want to see America realize itself as a good and decent land George McGovern will win rather emphatically in No vember

The Women's Movement,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/30/archives/the-womens-movement-women.html,To make an omelette you need not only those broken eggs but someone oppressed to break them every revolutionist is presumed to under stand that and also every woman which either does or does not make 51 per cent of the population of the United States a potentially revolu tionary class The creation of this revolutionary class was from the vir tual beginning the idea of the womens movement and the ten dency for popular discussion of the movement still to center around day care centers is yet another instance of that studied resistance to the pos sibility of political ideas which char acterizes national life  The new feminism is not just the revival of a serious political move ment for social equality the femin ist theorist Shulamith Firestone an nounced flatly in 1970 It is the sec ond wave of the most important revolution in history This was scarcely a statement of purpose any one could find cryptic and it was scarcely the only statement of its kind in the literature of the move ment Nonetheless in 1972 in a special issue on women Time was still musing genially that the move ment might well succeed in bringing about fewer diapers and more Dante Joan Didion is author of Play It As It Lays Slouching Towards Bethlehem and Run River That was a very pretty image the idle ladies sitting in the gazebo and murmuring lasciate ogni speranza but it depended entirely upon the popular view of the movement as some kind of collective inchoate yearning for fulfillment or self expression a yearning absolutely devoid of ideas and therefore of any but the most pro forma benevolent interest In fact there was an idea and the idea was Marxist and it was precisely to the extent that there was this Marxist idea that the curious historical anomaly known as the womens movement would have seemed to have any interest at all Marxism in this country had ever been an eccentric and quixotic pas sion One oppressed class after an other had seemed finally to miss the point The havenots it turned out aspired mainly to having The minori ties seemed to promise more but finally disappointed it devloped that they actually cared about the issues that they tended to see the integra tion of the luncheonette and the seat in the front of the bus as real goals and only rarely as ploys counters in a larger game They resisted that es sential inductive leap from the im mediate reform to the social ideal and just as disappointingly they failed to perceive their common cause with other minorities con tinued to exhibit a selfinterest disconcerting in the extreme to organ izers steeped in the rhetoric of brotherhood And then at that exact dispirited moment when there seemed no one at all willing to play the proletariat along came the womens movement and the invention of women as a class One could not help admiring the radical simplicity of this instant transfiguration The notion that in the absence of a cooperative prole tariat a revolutionary class might simply be invented made up named and so brought into existence seemed at once so pragmatic and so vision ary so precisely Emersonian that it took the breath away exactly con firmed ones idea of where 19thcen tury transcendental instincts crossed with a late reading of Engels and Marx might lead To read the theo rists of the womens movement was to think not of Mary Wollstonecraft but of Margaret Fuller at her most highminded of rushing position pa pers off to mimeo and drinking tea from paper cups in lieu of eating lunch of thin raincoats on bitter nights If the family was the last fortress of capitalism then let us abolish the family If the necessity for conventional reproduction of the species seemed unfair to women then let us transcend via technology the very organization of nature the oppression as Shulamith Fire stone saw it that goes back through recorded history to the animal king dom itself I accept the universe Margaret Fuller had finally allowed Shulamith Firestone did not It seemed very New England this febrile and cerebral passion The solemn a priori idealism in the guise of radical materialism somehow be spoke oldfashioned selfreliance and prudent sacrifice The clumsy tor rents of words became a principle a renunciation of style as unserious The rhetorical willingness to break eggs became in practice only a thrifty capacity for finding the sermon in every stone Burn the literature TiGrace Atkinson said in effect when it was suggested that even come the revolution there would still be left the whole body of sexist Western literature But of course no books would be burned the women of this move ment were perfectly capable of craft ing didactic revisions of whatever apparently intractable material came to hand As a parent you should become an interpreter of myths advised Letty Cottin Pogrebin in the preview issue of Ms magazine Por tions of any fairy tale or childrens story can be salvaged during a cri tique session with your child Other literary analysts devised ways to sal vage other books Isabel Archer in The Portrait of a Lady need no longer be the victim of her own idealism She could be instead the victim of a sexist society a woman who had internalized the conven tional definition of wife The narra tor of Mary McCarthys The Com pany She Keeps could be seen as enslaved because she persists in looking for her identity in a man Similarly Miss McCarthys The Group could serve to illustrate what happens to women who have been educated at firstrate womens collegestaught philosophy and his toryand then are consigned to breastfeeding and gourmet cooking That fiction has certain irreducible ambiguities seemed never to occur to these women nor should it have for fiction is in most ways hostile to ideology They had invented a class now they had only to make that class conscious They seized as a political technique a kind of shared testimony at first called a rap session then called consciousnessraising and in any case a therapeuticallyoriented American reinterpretation according to the British feminist Juliet Mitchell of a Chinese revolutionary practice known as speaking bitterness They purged and regrouped and purged again worried out one anothers er rors and deviations the litism here the careerism there It would have been merely senten tious to call some of their thinking Stalinist of course it was It would have been pointless even to speak of whether one considered these women right or wrong meaningless to dwell upon the obvious upon the coarsening of moral imagination to which such social idealism so often leads To believe in the greater good is to operate necessarily in a certain ethical suspension Ask any one committed to Marxist analysis how many angels dance on the head of a pin and you will be asked in return to never mind the angels tell me who controls the production of pins To those of us who remained com mitted mainly to the exploration of moral distinctions and ambiguities the feminist analysis may have seemed a particularly narrow and cracked determinism Nonetheless it was serious and for these high strung idealists to find themselves out of the mimeo room and onto the Cavett Show must have been in cer tain ways more unsettling to them than it ever was to the viewers They were being heard and yet not really Attention was finally being paid and yet that attention was mired in the trivial Even the brightest movement women found themselves engaged in sullen public colloquies about the in equities of dishwashing and the in tolerable humiliations of being ob served by construction workers on Sixth Avenue This grievance was not atypic in that discussion of it seemed always to take on unexplored Ms Scarlett overtones suggestions of fragile cultivated flowers being spoken to and therefore violated by uppity proles They totted up the pans scoured the towels picked off the bathroom floor the loads of laundry done in a lifetime Cooking a meal could only be dogwork and to claim any pleasure from it was evidence of craven acquiescence in ones own forced labor Small children could only be odious mechanisms for the spilling and digesting of food for robbing women of their freedom It was a long way from Simone de Beauvoirs grave and awesome recog nition of womans role as the Other to the notion that the first step in changing that role was Alix Kates Shulmans marriage contract wife strips beds husband remakes them reproduced in Ms but it was to ward just such trivialization that the womens movement seemed to be heading Of course this litany of trivia was crucial to the movement in the be ginning a key technique in the politi cizing of women who perhaps had been conditioned to obscure their re sentments even from themselves Mrs Shulmans discovery that she had less time than her husband seemed to have was precisely the kind of chord the movement had hoped to strike in all women the click of recognition as Jane OReilly described it but such dis coveries could be of no use at all one refused to perceive the larger point failed to make that inductive leap from the personal to the political Splitting up the week into hours during which the children were di rected to address their personal questions to either one parent or another might or might not have im proved the quality of Mr and Mrs Shulmans marriage but the improve ment of marriages would not a revo lution make It could be very useful to call housework as Lenin did the most unproductive the most barbar ous and the most arduous work a woman can do but it could be use ful only as the first step in a political process only in the awakening of a class to its position useful only as a metaphor to believe during the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States of America that the words had literal meaning was not only to stall the movement in the personal but to seriously delude

Womens LiberationMajor Writings of the Radical Feminist Notes 150 More and more as the literature of the movement began to reflect the thinking of women who did not really understand the movements ideolog ical base one had the sense of this stall this delusion the sense that the drilling of the theorists had struck only some psychic hardpan dense with superstitions and little sophis tries wishfulfillment selfloathing and bitter fancies To read even desultorily in this literature was to recognize instantly a certain dolorous phantasm an imagined Everywoman with whom the authors seemed to identify all too entirely This ubiquitous construct was everyones victim but her own She was persecuted even by her gynecolo gist who made her beg in vain for contraceptives She particularly need ed contraceptives because she was raped on every date raped by her husband and raped finally on the abortionists table During the fashion for shoes with pointed toes she like many women had her toes ampu tated She was so intimidated by cosmetic advertising that she would sleep huge portions of her day in order to forestall wrinkling and when awake she was enslaved by de tergent commercials on television She sent her child to a nursery school where the little girls huddled in a doll corner and were forcibly re strained from playing with building blocks Should she work she was paid three to ten times less than an always unqualified man holding the same job was prevented from attend ing business lunches because she would be embarrassed to appear in public with a man not her husband and when she traveled alone faced a choice between humiliation in a res taurant and eating a doughnut in her hotel room The halftruths repeated authenti cated themselves The bitter fancies assumed their own logic To ask the obviouswhy she did not get herself another gynecologist another job why she did not get out of bed and turn off the television set or why the most eccentric detail she stayed in hotels where only doughnuts could be obtained from room servicewas to join this argument at its own spooky level a level which had only the most tenuous and unfortunate relationship to the actual condition of being a woman That many women are victims of condescension and ex ploitation and sexrole stereotyping was scarcely news but neither was it news that other women are not nobody forces women to buy the package  But of course something other than an objection to being discrimi nated against was at work here something other than an aversion to being stereotyped in ones sex role Increasingly it seemed that the aversion was to adult sexual life itself how much cleaner to stay forever children One is constantly struck in the accounts of les bian relationships which appear from time to time in the move ment literature by the empha sis on the superior tenderness of the relationship the gen tleness of the sexual con nection as if the participants were wounded birds The dero gation of assertiveness as ma chismo has achieved such currency that one imagines several million women too delicate to deal with a man more overtly sexual than say David Cassidy Just as one had gotten the unintended but in escapable suggestion when told about the terror and revul sion experienced by women in the vicinity of construction sites of creatures too tender for the abrasiveness of daily life too fragile for the streets so now one was getting in the later literature of the move ment the impression of women too sensitive for the difficul ties and ambiguities of adult life women unequipped for re ality and grasping at the move ment as a rationale for denying that reality The transient stab of dread and loss which accompanies menstruation simply never hap pens we only thought it hap pened because a malechauvin ist psychiatrist told us so No woman need have bad dreams after an abortion she has only been told she should The power of sex is just an oppressive myth no longer to be feared because what the sexual con nection really amounts to we learn in one liberated womans account of a postmarital affair is wisecracking and laughing and lying together and then leaping up to play and sing the entire Sesame Street Song book All ones actual appre hension of what it is like to be a woman the irreconcilable dif ference of itthat sense of liv ing ones deepest life under water that dark involvement with blood and birth and death could now be declared in valid unnecessary one never felt it at all One was only told it and now one is to be reprogramed fixed up rendered again as in violate and unstained as the modern little girls in the Tampax advertisements More and more we have been hear ing the wishful voices of just such perpetual adolescents the voices of women scarred by re sentment not of their class posi tion as women but at the failure of their childhood expectations and misapprehensions Nobody ever so much as mentioned to Susan Edmiston that when you say I do what you are doing is not as you thought vowing your eternal love but rather subscribing to a whole system of rights obligations and responsibilities that may well be anathema to your most cherished beliefs To Ellen Peck the birth of children too often means the dissolution of romance the loss of freedom the abandonment of ideals to economics A young woman described on the cover of a recent issue of New York magazine as the Suburban Housewife Who Bought the Promises of Womens Lib and Came to the City to Live Them tells us what promises she bought The chance to respond to the bright lights and civiliza tion of the Big Apple yes The chance to compete yes But most of all the chance to have some fun Fun is whats been missing Eternal love romance fun The Big Apple These are rela tively rare expectations in the arrangements of consenting adults although not in those of children and it wrenches the heart to read about these women in their brave new lives An exwife and mother of three speaks of her plan to play out my college girls dream I am going to New York to become this famous writer Or this working writer Failing that I will get a job in publishing She mentions a friend another young woman who had never had any other life than as a daughter or wife or mother but who is just discovering herself to be a gifted potter The childlike resourcefulness to get a job in publishing to be a gifted potterbewilders the imagination The astral discon tent with actual lives actual men the denial of the real am biguities and the real genera tive or malignant possibilities of adult sexual life somehow touches beyond words It is the right of the op pressed to organize around their oppression as they see and de fine it the movement theorists insist doggedly in an effort to solve the question of these women to convince themselves that what is going on is still a political process but the hand writing is already on the wall These are converts who want not a revolution but romance who believe not in the oppres sion of women but in their own chances for a new life in ex actly the mold of their old life In certain ways they tell us sad der things about what the cul ture has done to them than the theorists ever did and they also tell us I suspect that the womens movement is no longer a cause but a sympton

To Win the Future,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/05/archives/to-win-the-future.html,Most of electoral politics can fairly be called the art the possible because candidates and their supporters are preoccupied with winning the election immediately ahead of them But there are candidates and parties concerned only with pushing back the boundaries of the possible Their objective is not to win the next election but to in fluence the thinking of the next generation  The Peoples party which has nominated Dr Benjamin Spock as its candidate for President is a political move ment with this kind of longrange aspirations It has no visible support among ordinary voters It is a party of radical political activists When Dr Spock was provisionally nominated last November the expectation then was that the Peoples party might become a vehicle for dissident antiwar Democrats and that he would stand aside in favor of betterknown political figure That tentative strategy dis appeared when the Democrats nominated Senator McGovern Dr Spocks platform calls for immediate withdrawal of all American troops abroad free medical care a guar anteed minimum income of 6500 for a family of four the legalization of abortion and marijuana and an end to discrimination against homosexuals It could be argued that this platform is not radical enough It is a grabbag of miscellaneous proposals of varying merits and some with no merit at all but it does not really add up to a searching thoroughgoing criticism of American society and institutions Dr Spock and his associates apparently favor the decentralization and de bureaucratization of American life Favoring neighbor hood schools and health clinics they see their major impact at the neighborhood and community level But huge agglomerations of power are not readily dispersed The balance of power between government private institutions and the individual is not easy to de fine in a large complex nation If the Peoples party is going to perform the critics function in the nations pol itics it is these decentralization ideas and the resulting problems which it will have to address more seriously than it has yet done
The New Democratic Vice‐Presidential Choice,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/06/archives/the-new-democratic-vicepresidential-choice-robert-sargent-shriver.html,Man in the News WASHINGTON Aug 5 The political nod that Robert Sargent Shriver Jr hes been looking and waiting for over the years finally came today when Senator George Mc Govern the Democratic Press idential nominee selected him as his running mate The political ambitions of Sarge as he is known to both politicians and friends have been wellknown particularly with in the Kennedy clan which he joined through marriage But until today the politicians always seemed to look the other way or his political aspirations had to be subordinated to the inter ests of the Kennedys In 1964 when John F Ken nedy had been dead less than a year President Johnson let it be known that he was considering Mr Shriver as his running mate Mrs Shriver the former Eunice Kennedy the third eldest of the Ken nedy girls and sister of John and Robertwas reported to have replied No its Bobs turn Ostracized on Plane The fact that Mr Shriver should even consider the VicePresidential offer after Mr Johnson ruled outAttor ney General Robert F Ken nedy for the post caused some strains in the Kennedy family Shortly after the inci dent Robert Kennedy sat in icy silence aboard the Ken nedy plane on the way to Hyannis Port deliberately os tracizing his brotherinlaw The gulf between Mr Shriver and some of the rest of the Kennedys widened when Mr Shriver remained in the Johnson Administra tion first as director of the Office of Ecenomic Opportu nity to direct the war on poverty and then as Am bassador to France Then in 1968 Hubert H Humphrey Mr Johnsons po litical heir once again floated the name of Mr Shriver as a VicePresidential candidate Instead the post went to Edmund S Muskie who to day declined a VicePresi dential offer from Senator McGovern thus at last let ting the political nod come in the direction of Mr Shriver There was never any doubt in the minds of associates and friends that if asked Mr Shriven would accept Hes like Barkis more than will in one Shriver associate commented Seeks Independent Role Whether Senator Edward M Kennedy now the leader of the Kennedys was equally willing to see his brotherin law go on the Democratic ticket is a political story that remains to be told At least in recent years Mr Shriver has seemed to be trying to break out of the clan and establish an inde pendence politically if not personally He has benefited from the Kennedy aura at tached to his name but he has also suffered from al ways being under the Ken nedy shadow Actually Mr Shriver has more than enough glamous on his own as well as that acquired through marriage Physically he is as handsome as a movie star with dark coloring a flashing smile and dark hair streaked with gray He exudes the kind of rest less hardmuscled breezy masculinity that made gen erations of women respond to Cary Grant At the age of 56 years he has developed some jowls but otherwise lie is a trim athletic figure who likes to leap on a horse and go trot ting around the front lawn of Timberlawn his suburban Maryland farm In style and dress he also has gone slight ly modish in the last few years with his locks now fall ing over his collara striking contrast to the conservative figure he used to cut as the Yaleman in threebutton suits Mr Shriver dawned upon the Washington political scene as the first director of the Peace Corps a job he got through his brotherinlaw President Kennedy The Peace Corps turned into one of the lasting achievements of the Kennedy Administration largely through the razzle dazzle energetic perform ances of Mr Shriver before Congressional committees and his persuasive peripatetic lobbying When the Peace Corps bill was finally passed President Kennedy proclaimed his brotherinlaw to be the most effective lobbyist on the Washington scene a tribute that indicated Mr Shriver had finally made his political mark with the Kennedys A few years later when Mr Shriver was enmeshed in the politics of the antipover ty effort Representative Al bert H Quie of Minnesota a leading Republican opponent of the Office of Economic Opportunity called Mr Shri ver a lousy administrator but the best salesman in Washington Aside froth his Kennedy associations Mr Shriver has some obvious assets as campaigner He is attractive energetic charming and ar ticulate Through his asocia tions he can help raise mon ey which the McGovern campaign desperately needs he has strong ties to minor ity groups and he is strong in the Jewish community which has tended to be some what skeptical about the Mc Govern candidacy Politically Mr Shriver is cut from the mold of a Ken edy liberal critical of the Vietnam war and conviinced that the counrty needs a new vision and difetcion Some oldline liberals consider him somewhat naive in his social views His Charm Recalled For those who have ob served him Mr  Shrivers character remains basically impenetrable He is a friend ly and charming but not selfrevealing He is intel ligent and learns quickly but he is far more a man of ac tion than an intellectual and is certainly not a reflective pensive personality Some who nave worked with him say that he can be overly demanding some times imperious and some what mercurial One associ ate who was aware of that reputation observed I start ed off with a certain nega tive attitude towards him but found him utterly charm ing He can be utterly charm ing or as cold as an ice cube remarked one woman who worked for him Like the Kennedys Mr Shriver is the product of a large lively and privileged family When his mother heard that he was marrying a Kennedy the story goes she is supposed to have said He is marrying beneath him His forebears named Schrieber immigrated to the United States from the Ger man Palatinate early in the 18th century He was born in Westminster Md on Nov 9 1915 son and namesake of a conservative investment banker converted to Roman Catholicism at marriage His mother Hilda also was Shriver and a second cousin of her husband Sent to Boarding School After a strictly outdoor boyhood in Maryland he was sent to Canterbury an up perclass Catholic boarding school near New Milford Conn A teacher later was to recall Sarge was a work horse The more things he did the better he did them The Wall Street crash plunged the Shriver family into financial difficulties and it moved into a small apart ment off Third Avenue in New York City By virtue of his record at Canterbury Mr Shriver got a scholarship to Yale where he became a big man on campus in the class of 1938 Chairman of Newspaper He became chairman of The Yale Daily News one of the most prestigious under graduate posts in those days played varsity baseball and was tapped for Scroll and Key a senior and secret hon or society known for its so cial litusn and lockstep marching around the campus on a Saturday evening The historian of the class of 1938 later wrote of him Serge Shriver took over The News and put his cards right on the table    by out lining his position as Christ ian Aristotelian optimist and American Whew well we knew where he stood at any rate Mr Shriver graduated from Yale cum laude and went to the Yale Law School where along with Kingman Brew ster the present president of Yale he was to become one of the leaders among the isolationist America First movement on campus Mr Shriver was later to say that as of that time he had observed the preWorld War II buildup in Europe and I didnt want Americans in volved in itwe werent pre pared In 1940 he enrolled in the Navy Reserve Officer Pro gram and was called to duty shortly before Pearl Harbor He served first as an anti aircraft officer aboard battle ships in the Pacific and then bored with battleship duty shifted to submarines Sought More Excitement At the wars end the 30 yearold lieutenant com mander tried a brief and unsatisfying stint with a prestigious Yaledominated law firm He also took up in Manhattan with his more affluent Yale classmates whose style of living he could not afford and began casting around for some thing more exciting and re warding Through a Yale contempo rary he obtained a job on Newsweek magazine as an assistant to the editor but as his story ideas were rejected it became obvious he was miscast A colleague remembers him there as hardworking pleasing stiff collared well groomedand broke Among his circle of friends in Manhattan was Eunice Kennedy which led to the turn in his fortunes that was to result in affluence and now political prominence In 1946 while he was still at Newsweek Mr Shriver was summoned by Joseph P Kennedy the patriarch of the Kennedys to see whether he might edit the Spanish war memoirs of Joseph Kennedy Jr who was killed in World War II Alternative Is Offered At a second breakfast meet ing with the senior Mr Kennedy in the Waldorf Towers Mr Shriver con fessed that the memoirs were not publishable Mr Kennedy came up with an alternative Ive just bought the Mer chandise Mart and Im look ing for guys to work for me So Mr Shriver went west to Chicago looking for ten ants for the huge half empty mart then the worlds biggest private office build ing In 1947 the elder Mr Kennedy ordered Mr Shriver to Washington to organize an office for Eunice Kennedy who was setting up a na tional committee on juvenile delinquency Of Eunice her father once said She has more drive than Jack or Bobby It took the charming impatient suit or six years to win her They were married in 1953 at St Patricks Cathedral by Cardinal Spellman At the champagne toast at the re ception the new Mrs Shriver lifted her glass and said I searched all my life for some one like my father Headed Seluiol Board Their marriage has pro duced five children Robert 18 Maria 16 Timothy 12 Mark 8 and Anthony 7 Mr Shriver returned to Chicago in 1948 to become a civic leader as director chair man or fund raiser for 25 educational cultural hospi tal welfare and charitable groups From 1955 to 1960 he served as president of Chica gos Board of Education helping to pull the citys pub lic school system then one of the worst in the nation to an accentable level Along with the rest of the Kennedys Mr Shriver was enlisted in the Presidential campaign of 1960 serving primarily as the contact man with minority groups It vas he who prompted John Ken nedy in the campaign to call Mrs Martin Luther King Jr after her husband was jailed in Georgiaa call that is believed to have had con siderable political impact in several key industrial states With the Kennedy election Mr Shriver became one of the principal talent hunters for the new Administration and then was named to direct the Peace Corps Stayed With Johnson His break with the Ken nedys began in 1964 when he stayed on with the John son Administration President Johnson rewarded him by making him director of the Office of Economic Oppor tunity a post that for two years he held simultaneously with his Peace Corps job In March 1968 President John son named him Ambassador to France As an Ambassador Mr Shriver appalled the embassy staff with his disregard for rules and protocol and the zealous way that he sought contact with the French people He seemed more like a campaigner than a diplo mat as he plunged into a French crowd shaking hands and saying Je suis Searjahn Shreevair But at a time of strained FrancoAmerican relations Mr Shriver charmed the French and their leaders in cluding General de Gaulle It was at the suggestion of the French Government that the Nixon Administration continued him for two years as its Ambassador in Paris When he returned from Paris in the spring of 1970 he was apparently desirous of striking out on his own politically Joined Law Pirm For a while he considered running for Governor of Maryland against the incum bent Marvin Mandell but he withdrew from the race after a long period of uncharacter istic vacillation In the fall of 1970 he took to the cam paign trail on behalf of Dem ocratic candidates throughout the nation with an enthu siasm that led to speculation he was attempting to build up his credentials to bid for the Democratic Presidential nomi nation in 1972 In the spring of 1971 he joined the Washington law firm of Fried Frank Harris Shriver and Kampelman head ed by Max Kampelman close associate of Senator Hum phrey To the surprise of some of his associates he worked conscientiously and effectively in building up his own clientele apparently in tent on developing his own law practice as an indepen dent base for future political activities Mr Shriver was at the Kennedy compound in Hyan nis Port this morning when he first learned that the VicePresidential nomination was about to be offered him His butler said that Mr Shriver had ordered the car to be readied and he was rushing when he left
DECISION HAILED,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/06/archives/decision-hailed-successor-to-eagleton-called-favorite-of-nominees.html,WASHINGTON Aug 5Sen ator George McGovern chose Sargent Shriver as his Vice Presidential running mate today after Senator Edmund S Mus kie had rejected his invitation to join the Democratic ticket  Mr Shriver the first director of the Peace Corps under his brotherinlaw President Ken nedy and of the antipoverty program under President John son will be put in nomination before an expanded 303member Democratic National Com mittee here Tuesday night Text of McGovern statement appears on Page 28 He will succeed Senator Thomas F Eagleton who re signed from the race last Mon day after disclosing that he had been hospitalized three times in the nineteensixties for nervous exhaustion and depression Mr Muskie the Democratic VicePresidential nominee in 1968 and the early front runner for the Presidential nomination this year cited family consider ations in becoming the sixth man to reject Mr McGoverns offer Other Rejections Earlier this week Mr Mc Govern had been turned down by Senators Edward M Ken nedy of Massachusetts Hubert H Humphrey of Minnesota and Abraham A Ribicoff of Con necticut In addition Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin and Gov Reubin Askew of Florida were thought to have been given chances to express interest but declined Mr McGovern made his an nouncement for television cam eras sitting before a wooden desk in front of a false marble fireplace in a small room in the Capitol Mr Shriver who had sailed this morning off Hyannis Port Mass was playing tennis at the Kennedy family compound there when he received Mr McGoverns firm offer Before leaving for Washing ton from the Barnstable Mass airport Mr Shriver said he was very happy and very proud to have been chosen Staff Favorite Mr Shriver had been the choice of several factions with in the McGovern organization at the Democratic National Convention three weeks ago and was the staffs favorite after Mr Eagletons candidacy collapsed He has political roots in Chica go where he once managed the Merchandise Mart one of the worlds largest office buildings for the late Joseph P Kennedy and in Maryland where he con sidered running for Governor in 1970 But he has never been candidate before a point that his advocates felt confirmed the antipolitics or beyondpoli tics air that the McGovern cam paign began Mr Shriver was recommend ed to Mr McGovern at the convention at Miami Beach by the black members of his cam paign staff and by Pierre Sal inger the White House press secretary during the Kennedy Administration But he was also thought to be an attractive figure in most of the Democratic party a friend of Mayor Richard J Daley of Chicago for example and warmly endorsed to Mr McGovern last week by Senator Humphrey Last week his outspoken backers came to include Con gressional figures as diverse as Representatives Shirley Chis holm of Brooklyn Wayne L Hays of Ohio Sam M Gibbons of Florida and Lester LWolff of Nassau County He is attractive personable and wellliked by a broad cross section of groups Mrs Chis holm wired Mr McGovern last week He knows the Hill and is an experienced and respected businessman but he is equally at home with the poor and minority groups whose affec tion and support he earned dur ing his tenure as head of the Office of Economic Oppor tunity Wife Foe of Abortion There had been suggestions that the determined views of Mr Shrivers wife the former Eunice Kennedy against abor tion would be an obstacle in his selection Senator McGov ern has tried to keep the abor tion issue out of the national campaign saying It was a mat ter for the states to decide It had also been thought that Senator Kennedy who discour aged Senator Humphreys in terest in Mr Shriver as a run ning mate in 1968 might veto his selection this year But Mr Kennedy was report ed not to have involved him self in the consideration of Mr Shriver this year And on the abortion issue Mrs Shrivers strollg convictions and her in depenence were considered to have an appeal even to people who disagreed with her Sonic ranking members of the McGovern staff indicated with out attribution that they were delighted with Mr Mus kies refusal and hinted that they had worked purposefully at discouraging him Told to Stay Available Even before Mr Muskie made up his mind word was circulating here that Frank Mankiewicz McGovern campaigns cief strategist and Henry A Kimelman its finance director had called Mr Shriver on Cape Cod and told him to keep his hopes up and remain available as the next choice One of the men who had met with the Muskie staff yesterday to consider details of the pro spective campaign said with re lief this morning that Mr Mus kies decision was the best thing that ever happened to this campaign They were interested in all the really vital issues facing the country said the sarcastic McGovern staff members like the configuration of Muskies airplane whether he could have his own advanced staff and what his headquarters of fice would look like It was preposterous Stewart Mott the young Gen eral Motors heir who has con tributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the McGovern campaign commented this af ternoon I dont know a single member of McGoverns staff that was enthusiastic about Muskie The offer to Muskie is one of the greatest conundrums of our time I expected that after the offer to Humphrey McGovern would give it to Lyndon Johnson or Richard Daley Excerpts from Mr McGov erns address tonight that were released at campaign head quarters this afternoon made no mention of Mr Shriver or the VicePresidential selection process Sense of Uneasiness Reviewing the Eagleton af fair Senator McGovern assert ed that although the Missouri Senator had triumphed over his illness disclosure of psychi atric treatment stirred a power ful sense of uneasiness in many Americans The medical ques tion he said might obscure and confuse the real choice of this Presidential year In a fresh statement of his purpose Mr McGovern agreed with President Nixon that the 1972 campaign offered the clearest political choice of century He gave briefer atten tion to the war in Vietnam than in most of his speeches to date though he said again that end ing the war was his first priority The fundamental choice he said is between the belief that political power exists to serve private power and the conviction that political lead ership must take up the peo ples cause against those who seek advantage at their ex pense Echoing the theme of the late Robert F Kennedys 1968 campaign he declared It is decision between the desire to preserve things as they are against the confidence that this nation can do better that life in this nation can be more re wardingfor every citizen The chronicle of America like some great river sweeps into the future he said to ward the close of a speech that was crafted by Richard N Goodwin a Kennedy speech writer It cannot be mastered by clinging to threatened banks but only by those who unafraid and desiring set out upon powerful and uncertain currents transforming shifting dangers and unimaginable change into a trail for a new American journey This time not a journey to a distant coast but inward toward the most powerful aspirations of the human heart to make this

That Old Devil Moon,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/06/archives/that-old-devil-moon-that-old-devil-moon-and-tijean.html,THERE seems to be a new policy in effect at the New York Shake speare Festival For the second summer in a row the second of the Festivals three productions In Central Park is a musicala musical moreover not entirely devoid of refer ences to black peoplea musical which is scheduled to tour the five boroughs on the Festivals Mobile Theater after Its run in the park Last summer there was the famous superintegrated musical version of Two Gentlemen of Verona but whereas Two Gentlemen was at least ostensibly by Shakespeare this years show is a Folk Fable with an allblack cast entitled TiJean and His Brothers by the Trinidadian play wright Derek WalcottEspecially when its narra tor is a frog who passes the time of day with a cricket a bird and a firefly But simplicity in this world can be very hard to come by especially for sophisticated literary persons  In theory the new policy is probably a good idea because it recognizes that New York is now in good part a black city arw because doing three Shake speares every summer year in and year out can easily become an empty ritual But in practice TiJean and His Brothers is except for some lively West Indian music pretty heavy going Walcott is a very sophisticated liter ary person a poet of some repute and the author of Dream on Monkey Moun tain which the Negro Ensemble Com pany produced in New York a couple of years ago Monkey Mountain was a highly abstruse affair mysterious allusive dense with complicated verbal imagery TiJean on the other hand seems intended to be clear simple childlike naivewhat else should folk fable be The story begins as a good folk story should with a poor old woman who lives with her three sons GrosJean MiJean ann little TiJean in a humble cabin in the woods The little family is challenged by the devil and each son in turn issues forth to answer the challenge GrosJean vain about his arm of iron is defeated so is Mijean a pompous autodidact it is left to little TiJean to beat the devil and precipitate the happy ending Now folk tales of this kind tend to be repetitive and pre dictable at best it is part of their charm Anyone who cant see from the very be ginning that MiJeans ad venture will be similar to GrosJeans and that TiJean will win out in the end has spent his youth on Batman instead of Grimm But Wal cott makes the worst of this built in tendency toward rep etition I began to think after a while that if I had to hear about GrosJeans arm of iron one more time  And though the story is so pre dictable it is oddly difficult to follow in detailprobably because the actors are often impossible to understand the openair Delacorte Theater is not the best place in the world to do a play spoken in a thick though charming foreign dialect but perhaps also because Walcott finds it difficult to write clearly His dialogue is full of coy rem iniscences of Shakespeare Marlowe Milton and Shelley most of which serve no pur pose except to give the author a chance to show off his learningand of course to give critics who happened to catch these allusions an opportunity to show off their As befits a sophisticated literary person Walcott is not telling his story purely for the fun of it In order to defeat the three Jeans the devil disguises himself as white planter which enables Walcott to make the point repeatedlythat black men who work for white men are expected to laugh and smile and be affable and hide their true feelings It is a cogent enough point in itself but do seem to have heard some thing of it before in other plays It sometimes seems as if black performers nowadays are asked to spend almost as much time parodying Stepin Fetchit types as their fathers had to spend playing Stepin Fetchit types Well in a funny kind of way I suppose its only fair Somebody must be expiating something But whoand what TiJean of course sturdy lad that he is will ultimately have no truck with truckling instead in a Fanonical gesture he incites the workers to burn down the But Walcott is not essen tially pushing revolutionit might be better if he were He offers us instead at the end of the evening a maud lin sentimental affirmation of life that makes the late Oscar Hammerstein II look like Samuel Beckett by com parison The devil himself breaks down and starts bab bling about the love of an other the sacrifice of the self And when the spirit of a little child caught in some vague kind of limbo as the result of abortion or infanti cide or something of the sort surely one of the most em barrassing characters in mod ern dramatic literatureis given life as a result of Ti Jeans virtue the poor crea ture is forced to say I am born I shall die Oh the wonder and glory of it Aside from being a writer Walcott is also the director of his own theater in Trini dad and lie has directed this production of TiJean but Walcott the director has not given Walcott the playwright the help that he so urgently needs His staging is unin teresting and his actors on the whole are neither imag inative nor subtle Clebert Ford as GrosJean overworks strenuously Leon Morenzie as MiJean overworks some what less strenuously and young Dennis Hines as the boy TiJean seems to be go ing through his part purely by rote The best performance comes from Albert Laveau member of Walcotts com pany in Trinidad who pro vides three distinct and nice ly turned characterizations as the devil in disguise and in propria persona if Laveau could manage to clear up slight speech defect he might be quite a considerable actor The best thing about Ti Jean is the beguiling music by Andre Tanker which is usually backed by a calypso ish beat but is by no means restricted to one mode But there is not enough music and the songs come at the wrong times instead of being used to intensify the con frontations and climaxes they are for the most part only allowed to mark time between them Then is there nothing about the occasion that I can praise without reservation Well there are the appealing young citizens who sell bags of ex cellent fruit and other edibles before the performances and during the intermissions they do fine work And in the sky above the theater the moon makes its customary appearance with its custom ary silent ineffable authority rebuking with its serenity the carryingson below
Draft Abortion‐Reform Plank Being Written at White House,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/06/archives/draft-abortionreform-plank-being-written-at-white-house.html,The question of abortion re form on which the Democrats rejected a strong position at their national convention last month is apparently in the hands of White House strate gists as well as the feminists in these days before the Republi can National Convention in Mi ami Beach  A preliminary platform draft is being written at the White House and prospects for abor tion proposals in the Patform Committee are not promising Only a tiny group of the most optimistic Republican re formers expects to get enough votes in the Platform Commit tee to produce a minority plank the only way to open debate on the convention floor Yet there is some talk among Republican feminists that the Administration consistently op posed to abortion might inter vene One suggestion is that President Nixon might allow the issue on the floor to assure a public defeat in prime tele vision time Others believe that the Presi dent wants to do something for women while showing up the Democrats According to this theory the President might de cide to permit a convention wide airing of the subject to win support among feminists This theory is said to be based on Mr Nixons awareness of what feminists call Senator George McGoverns abortion sellout a reference to the de cision of his strategists to urge McGovern delegates at conven tion to vote against abortion reform after first advising them to vote your conscience A decision by Mr Nixon to permit convention discussion of abortion reform would be safe it is argued on the ground that reform has no chance of adop tion And although some fem inists are already viewing this latter strategy as a pyrrhic vic tory they think it might be useful As one New Yorker put it At least well have a chance to get everybody talk ing about abortion Both theories assume that abortion is of real consequence to Republican women but it is not Even the dedicated fem inists say it is just a priority  not enough of a priority to provoke a fight Most Republican feminists seem to agree with the Presi dent that the issue is a matter for the states rather than the Federal Government Exceptions to this stand are Mrs Barbara Greene Kilberg a Washington lawyer who is for mer cochairman of the Na tional Womens Political Caus us the multipartisan lobby for feminist causes and Represent ative Paul N McCloskey Jr of California Both have said they would fight for an abor tion plank We dont see abortion as primary plank said Mrs Wil liam Ruckelshaus the caucuss Republican spokesman the wife of the Presidents envir onmental protection chief Miss Carole Ann Taylor cur rently vice chairman of the womens political caucus New York delegateatlarge to the convention who is a mem ber of Governor Rockefellers staff is equally cool to an abortion fight Abortion and equal rights for women are fine but other things concern a greater mass of women she said I con sider housing day care wel fare and busing more impor tant I think we must work for the proposed reforms similar to the McGovern guidelines [on greater representation for wo men blacks Chicanos and others] The proposed party structure reforms officially known as the Delegates and Organization Re port or DO Report are a ma jor priority with womens cauc us Republicans Included is proposal that would insure equal representation of women within the party itself and at the 1976 convention Caucus Republicans are also publicly pledged to support their own womens plank Be sides repeal of abortion laws that restrict a womans right to control her own reproduc tive life the plank calls for the following Stepped up efforts to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment Comprehensive child care programs Equal treatment for women and families headed by women in housing Elimination of all tax in equities affecting women Continued efforts to appoint women to positions of top re sponsibility in all branches of the Federal Government in cluding the Cabinet and the Supreme Court The Platform and Rules Com mittees are scheduled to meet in Miami Beach the week of Aug 14 to decide the fate of these and other issues I really feel the convention will include a very broad and strong plank for women Mrs Ruckelshaus said The Presi dent is for women so I cant see that it will be so diffi cult Mrs Rita Hauser cochair man of the Committee to Re elect the President thinks that although abortion will be side lined the womens plank may be even better than the Demo crats
How Nixon will win,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/06/archives/how-nixon-will-win-a-republican-takes-to-the-soapbox-in-answer-to.html,Richard Nixon is the heavy favorite to win in November for several reasons In the first place he is the incumbent respected albeit not loved with the powers of the Presidency at his com mand during the next three months Secondly the United States is in the midst of political upheaval and the forces of the New Politics are not nu merous enoughdespite McGovernite predictions to outvote the realigning elements of the existing electorate  Politics is always a numbers game But wider certain ideological circumstances electoral demog raphy assumes clear and unusual importance Whenever one of our parties has nominated a radical Presidential candidate a man unlikely to win under normal conditions the selection has invariably been accompanied by prophecy and an ticipation of a large new electorate dedicated to upsetting the status quo Just as invariably that turnout has proved insufficient New forces have entered the political lists but not with the necessary impact in numbers or lopsided ideological fervor Thus it is proper to doubt George McGoverns claim that he can forge victory on the anvil of 1972s new group of 18 through 24yearold voters The other major radicals of the century William Jennings Bryan Robert La Follette Henry Wallace and Barry Goldwater radical in the sense of differing sharply with the current wisdom drew some supporters to the polls but not enough and simultaneously their efforts stirred up backlash that buoyed the forces of stability Inasmuch as the concept of a new youth bloc is central to the McGovernite theory of a New Kevin Phillips a former special assistant to John Mitchell in directing the 1968 Nixon campaign and later at the Justice Department is the author of The Emerging Republican Majority Politics it is useful to deal with itand I think scotch itbefore moving on to Richard Nixons more traditional blueprint for success Seventythree million persons voted for Presi dent in 1968 61 per cent of those eligible About 70 million are still alive today aged 25 or more Some 95 to 99 per cent of them can be expected to vote again in November Furthermore there are 25 million potential new voters 1820 enfran chised by the 26th Amendment to the US Con stitution and aged 2124 enfranchised by the pas sage of time since 1968 McGovern adviser Fred Dutton has predicted that of these 25 million 18 million will actually cast ballots 13 million for the South Dakotan 5 million for the President In short the McGovern people see their man gaining his mar gin of election from an intensely motivated youth bloc vote Traditional analysts dispute this notion on two counts 1 the level of turnout and 2 the solidarity of youth for McGovern In the last five elections voters under 30 have shown little variation from the overall electorate 6 per cent more Democratic in 1952 1 per cent in 1956 4 per cent in 1960 3 per cent in 1964 and 4 per cent in 1968 Elec tions expert Richard Scammon sees much the same pattern recurring this year and he sees young voters being only 5 to 10 per cent more liberal and McGovernish than their parents My own projec tion would be midway between the Scammon view and the McGovernDutton theory Although biological increments to the vote whether newly enfranchised women or young people entering the electorate have historically made little dif ference this year the biological increment has unique cultural ingredient that could make a dif ference Given the separate culture character of a minority of 1972 youth the 1824 vote likely to be as much as 15 per cent more Demo cratic than the adult vote Unprecedented as this would be it is not nearly as potent as the Mc Governites make out and furthermore counter forces are being generated in the older electorate Now for some ballot math a necessary evil of any careful analysis of 1972 In 1968 only the following percentages of youthful voters made to the polls 1820 yearolds 33 per cent and 2124 yearolds 51 per cent All together their actual turnout was perhaps 45 per cent a far cry from the 72 per cent envisioned by the McGovern ites At the moment roughly 12 million 1824 year olds are registered and if 85 per cent of those enrolled vote roughly the norm then the Novem ber turnout would be 102 million or 42 per cent Although eight weeks of registration remain youth enrollment totals are not likely to climb above 15 million McGovemite calculations assume a 13  to 5 vote ratio 72 per cent for the Prairie Sena tor This is also pieinthesky The June Campus Opinion Poll shows McGovern leading by less than 2 to 1 even among college students 50 to 27 per cent In Massachusetts one of the more liberal states a June Boston Globe poll shows McGovern ahead of Nixon among under25 voters by 69 per cent to 29 per cent So with President Nixon able to score 27 to 29 per cent among these liberal constituencies his national youth vote may well be calculated in the 40 per cent range Data released by the Gallup Organization on July 22 puts it even higher According to Gallup McGoverns lead among those 1824 yearolds already registered just 57 to 41 per cent While collegians prefer Mc Govern by a 61 to 35 per cent spread 1824 year olds not in college prefer Nixon by 48 to 44 pei cent To date youthful registration is dispro portionately collegiate and middle  class when McGoverns strength is highest Youthful blue collar rural and smalltown voters more in dined to Nixon have not yet registered in simila ratios Gallups July figures show that among 18 24 voters as yet unenrolled President Nixon actu These figures suggest what Nixon campaign ficials have believed for months that the GO percentage of the youth vote will increase as non collegians begin signing up in greater number and that a big turnout will work for rather tha against the President Current Republican campaig plans are aimed at exactly that group My own estimates are as follows Some 70 to per cent of the 1824 yearolds will register these 70 to 80 per cent will actually vote Thus 49 per cent to 64 per cent of those eligible will actu ally make it to the polls Assume 60 per cent the national averageor 15 million voters Of these McGovern will get 55 to 65 per cent 825 to 975 million and Richard Nixon will get 3545 per cent 525 to 675 million By those calculations then the McGovern youth lead will range from 15 million to a very improbable 45 million That wont be enough Too many American young people still espouse traditional values for McGovern to get the bloc support he needs to overcome probable Nixon gains among other vot ers and potential voters Now for the Nixontargeted electorate  and then the strategy White House aides will use in pursuing it There are really two constituencies First there is the 73 million vote electorate 1968 now four years older and reduced to 70 million or so voters by deaths Second there are about 36 million people now over 25 who did not vote in 1968 Lets begin with the second category because its the bigger question mark During the nineteen sixties the percentage of eligible Americans who bothered to vote dropped from 637 per cent in 1960 to 62 per cent in 1964 to 61 per cent in 1968 US turnout ratios tend to lag and then in certain years jump under some political or cultural spur During this century large increases in turnout have occurred in elections marked by these fac tors 1 popular desire to keep America from enter ing a war the elections of 1916 and 1940 2 reli gious and ethnic tribalism 1928 and 1960 and 3 maintenance of societal stability 1896 1920 1924 1936 and 1952 The latter category is relevant to this Novembers vote It may seem oddor even improperto lump the Roosevelt landslide of 1936 in with the obvious bourgeois valueaffirmations of 1896 1920 1924 and 1952 However I would argue that in 1936 Roosevelt was perceived as the man whose 193236 efforts were bringing America out of chaos and not like George McGovern threatening to push the country into it In this a vote for Roosevelt was a vote for stability Aside from the youth vote the election of 1972 may see an unusually large turnout of stability oriented voters This factor could be one of the years sleepers Conventional wisdom of course assigns the belowaverage income occasional vote  In 1920 most of the new voter turnout came from newly enfranchised women to the Democrats on economic grounds but this may be an error in 1972 To some extent just how much we have yet to see US political partisanship is shedding its old incomegroup cleavage Cultural differencesmorality living style and group rival riesare taking over With the rise of George Mc Govern the Democrats have donned the lovebeads prefaded denims and purple sunglasses of affluent liberalism Lowerincome perceptions of the two parties are changing So an increased vote turnout could very well help Nixon Of the 36 million nonvoters over 25 30 million are white Their mean family income is well below the US average as are their educa tional levels Far from being a force for change most of them feel threatened by it While youthful McGovernites may claim empathy with the 53 yearold poor white from Chicago the feeling is not reciprocated To the contrary the poor white may feel his culture endangered by them and be driven to the polls to vote against them Note too that the last big spurt in the electorate came in 1952another occasion when the Democratic can didate was the hero of the intelligentsia and the GOP candidate stood for the values of the man in the street The detailed breakdown of the May Gallup poll wherein Nixon had only an eightpoint lead over Mc Govern showed that voters with incomes under 3000 preferred the GOP candidate over the Democrat by 58 per cent to 28 per cent the largest spread of any income group The Wallace vote is splitting between 2 to 1 and 3 to 1 for Nixon according to both Harris and Gallup and where the Wallace consti tuency is moving can the shortorder cook the disabled bus driver the farmers widow and the pensioner be too far behind In one rural Missouri County I visited last month the county clerk told me that requests for absentee ballots were abnormally high among conservativeminded elderly and disabled persons These facts considered 1972 could see an outpouring of four to eight million persons over 25 who failed to ballot in 1986 The cutting edge of voter turnout ultimately depends on the nature of alienation McGoverns people think it runs their way But the White House is banking on the op posite view capsuled by Cali fornia pollster Don Muchmore McGovern has got a great issue in alienation but I won der if he knows the cause The people who are alienated arc the ones who dont want pot who dont want abortion who dont want to pay one cent more in taxes Or as the Socialist party journal New America puts it McGovern is partly correct that the categories of left and right are not relevant to his campaign But the categories of class are His followers un like those of Wallace are the products of affluence and edu cation who claim a moral edge on the rest of society    When Wallace followers dis cover that the McGovern forces represent the most cosmopolitan segment or that Democratic leadership the McGovernWallace sym metry will break down While it is oversimplistic to divide alienation into just two categories there would seem to be a basic cul tural difference between new valueoriented indignation the elitist McGovern brand and the Middle American anger of trodupon tradition and spurned Levittown societ al beliefs and values Perhaps the real pivot of the election is this Just how much have people  or human nature  really changed If there is an all  pervasive new morality cumalienation that cuts across previous ethnic and chrono logical lines then McGovern the clear beneficiary could win But if the real frustra tion is with the trampling of traditional values and if major chunks of the old Democratic coalition are an gry at the cultural upheaval represented by McGovern then Richard Nixon will come out on top My own belief is that the Democratic party is going to pay heavily for having become the party of affluent profes sionals knowledgeable in dustry executives social cause activists and minorities of various sexual racial chrono logical and other hues This shift has been gathering force for some time When the New Deal began the Democrats represented the South the West and the unfashionable Northeast in opposition to the Republican economic elitism of the Northeastern Establishment Back in those days of course US wealth came from traditional produc tion and commerce agricul ture manufacturing mining banking railroading People with money were conservative and Republican they didnt want change In 1932 and 1936 the rich Northeast vot ed Republican to try to halt economic reform and the South and West voted Demo cratic to force the Northeast ern elite to give ground But in the last 40 years the source of US affluence has shifted Mines mills and railroad yards are no longer the key to US wealth To day 35 per cent of the Gross National Product is accounted for by the production con sumption and dissemination of knowledge The institutions representing this shift are fa miliar to everyone IBM Time Life NBC Itek Xerox the Ford Foundation the Rand Corporation Harvard Yale the research manage ment and social consultancy firms These and other insti tutions constitute a new elite exercising tremendous power in our emerging communi cations society Whereas the old elite deplored change the new stirs it up and makes business out of it Nurtured by liberal ideas and programs these interests are increas ingly Democratic in politics In 1968 affluent citadels like Manhattans East Side Bostons Beacon Hill and sub urban Scarsdale all voted against a winning Republican President for the first time in history Why Because the Pucci and Porsche precincts of the Northeast now march to a differing economic drummer Republican strate gists hope to build a new coalition around traditional Democrats alienated by elitist values and seizure of party control Nor is it coincidental that the South West and the Spiro Agnew North have been the mainstays of its previous coalitions from Andrew Jack sons to FDRs aimed at curbing a Northeasternbased Early political trends sug gest that Nixon forces are on the right track in betting on traditional values tactics and gains Two major Democratic constituenciesthe 1968 Wal laceites and 1968 Humphrey Catholicsare shifting heav ily to Nixon In turn Nixon is losing only a small sliver of his 1968 vote mostly the John Lindsay  Ogden Reid coterie of uppermiddle and upperclass GOP liberals Here are the numerical strengths of some traditional constituencies where Nixon is making gains Catholics 17 million 1968 voters Wal laceites 99 million 1968 voters Southern and Border State Democrats perhaps 3 million Humphrey voters and Jews 25 million 1968 voters When the actual sta tistics of 1968 are compared with the early poll figures of 1972 the Nixon increment is striking According to June Gallup and Harris polls na tional Wallace voters are splitting about 21 to 1 for Nixon Allocating the 99 mil lion 1968 Wallaceites this yields 70 million for Nixon and 29 million for McGovern a Nixon lead of 41 million Catholics are a bigger group and here the GOP shift comes out of previously Democratic totals Gallups postelection data for 1968 shows HHH beating Nixon 59 to 33 per cent with per cent going to Wallace  These figures are based on the late July probability that George Wallace will not be a thirdparty candidate in 1972 However as of the writing this by no means certain Polls now find Nixon ahead among Catholics 1968 Actual vote Humphrey 1003 million Nixon 561 million Humphrey lead 442 million 1972 June Harris Poll Nixon 915 million McGovern 68 million Nixon lead 235 million Taking the Wallace and Catholic groups together the hypothetical Nixon net gain is 105 million 70 million from Wallace and 35 million from proHHH Catholics In turn the hypothetical Democrat net loss is 330000 a drop of 323 million pro HHH Catholics partly off set by 29 million Wallace ites To be sure this is merely the mathematics of the June polls but the shift it represents dwarfs the prob able impact of the youth Another million  plus switched votes are likely to come from Jews 25 million 1968 voters and from the small white Southern and Border State group that voted for Humphrey in 1968 But for the moment forget these and count them only as off sets against smallscale de fection of 1968 Nixon voters Because of this demography the basic Nixon strategy is aimed at 1 Consolidating and holding 1968 Nixon sup port 2 Maximizing Walla cite support and 3 wooing conservative Catholics senior citizens and other traditional ists In a kindred vein the White House is busy courting organized labor The Republi can sights are set on tradi tional segments of the old Democratic coalition and the GOP tactics are akin to the old interestgroup and ethnic politicking of the New Deal When the nations electoral votes are tallied on November 7 I expect Richard Nixon to have a clear majority based on a sweep or near sweep of the South and Border states and a kindred runaway victory in the Rocky Mountains and Lower Farm Belt Kansas Nebraska and Iowa These states alone will provide about 200 of the necessary 270 electoral votes The Pres ident is also a heavy favorite in upper New England Maine New Hampshire and Vermont 11 electoral votes and the OhioIndianaIllinois tier 64 electoral votes Michigan should go to Nixon on the busing issue Ethnic and la bor will help Nixon in Pennsylvania and New Jer sey especially Pennsylvania where Democratic majorities in Philadelphia will plummet because of the proNixon ac tivities of Democratic Mayor Frank Rizzo and Roman Catholic Cardinal Krol New York and Connecticut will be close but I think the big shift in the Catholic vote will give Nixon a good chance of victory California could be a surprise it is one state where the youth vote could conceivably be large and co hesive enough to put McGov ern over All told Nixons elec should exceed 400 At this point it seems fair to say as The Wall Street Journal and other newspa pers have speculatedthat the Nixon high command is basi cally following the strategy set forth in my 1969 book The Emerging Republican Majority which said that the partys opportunity lay in molding a new coalition of Republicans plus Wallaceites and Catholic Democrats re pelled by their partys push to the left In midJune even Hubert Humphrey talked about the possibility that George McGoverns nomina tion could bring about the long  planned  for emerging Republican majority Let me note though that the blueprint has not been stead ily followed since 1968 Dur ing that years campaign the major themes of the book were pulled together in state bystate memos for campaign manager John Mitchell and together with other more im portant influences helped keep the Nixon drive aimed at Southerners Wallaceites and Catholics But after the Administration took office it lost its sense of a new con stituency Only the South was regarded as an obvious tar get and even regarding Dixie White House commitment was sporadic Early in 1969 Assistant Attorney General Civil Rights Jerris Leonard urged that the Republicans should write off the South And whereas back in 1968 Nixons communications chief Herb Klein had distributed excerpts from The Emerging Republican Majority by autumn 1969 the ostrichlike White House line was to deny having read it as the President himself did at an By summer 1970 the Ad ministration was leaning in the liberal direction and jeopardizing its political re alignment with such schemes as busing removal of tax exemption for some Southern schools George Romneys sub urban low  income housing quotas the Philadelphia Plan and of course the Fam ily Assistance guaranteed annual income Plan Mean while parochial school aid and help for farmers were ignored After leaving the Administration in the spring of 1970 I described these various programs as subver sive of GOP Middle Ameri can coalition hopes and I succeeded only in making my self more unpopular around the White House Because the Administration had no pro grams for Middle America it was obliged in the 1970 mid term elections to mount a shallow campaign based on law and order rhetoric When this proved relatively unsuc cessful the idea of a new Middle American coalition re ceived a further setback Things got worse in the spring and summer of 1971 Private Administration polls sometimes showed the Presi dent with little chance for re election This was the period when the Nixon Administra tion lost its domestic political bearings Decisions were made like those to support busing in Austin Texas or push the Family Assistance Plan  that Nixon strategists now look back upon quite sheepishly But in Augast and subse quent months things began to sort themselves out By embracing the wage  price freeze the Administration moved towards a more voter minded economic policy President Nixon also got a big summer boost from his Chinese and Russian summit announcements Meanwhile the Administration began re versing its attitude towards a guaranteed annual income and busing By winter Nixon policymakers were clearly moving to the right on issues like welfare busing and de fense Parochial school aid was gathering intraAdminis tration support and farm programs received a big boost under the auspices of new Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz As the number of Demo cratic candidates proliferated into potential disaster Re publican prospects began to brighten During the spring as the Democrats cut them selves up the Administration strengthened its own pro grammatic approach with an eye toward bidding for con A passel of radicals A radical by the authors definition is one who differs sharply with the current wis dom These four are his chief examples from the past cen tury of American politics Wil liam Jennings Bryan above Henry A Wallace far left Barry Goldwater left and Robert La Follette below To the list Mr Phillips would add Senator George McGovern servative and moderate Democratic support in No vember According to a June Harris poll the US electorate fa vors the current Nixon stance over the McGovern position on 15 of 16 major issues from Vietnam to busing and the GOP can be expected to push hard on a number of these themes Besides empha sizing the Presidents foreign and domestic achievements the Nixon campaign will 1 Stress issues that display some of McGoverns more radical statements 2 there by oblige the South Dakotan to hedge equivocate and deny past positions in a way that will ruin his claim to candor and sincerity mean while infuriating his cadres of loyal leftists 3 tag him with the cultural and class imagery of radical chic and supercilious elitist morality thereby convincing the aver age unhappy American that McGovern isnt part of the solution but rather part of The big Nixon issues are obvious First the war in Vietnam Count on Richard Nixon to labor mightily to end the Vietnam war before the election However even if he hasnt quite ended it Nix onians expect to be able to more than neutralize the issue by tagging McGovern with his begging is better than bombing attitude towards Hanoi as well as his extraor dinary comment widely dis seminated by the White House press office that the war should not be won McGov ern made this statement in an early July speech prepared for delivery to the South Carolina Legislature The speech was not given but McGovern stood by the text including the statementthe first in US history by a ma jor Presidential candidate that a war in which US troops are fighting should not be won because it is illegal and immoral In the aftermath of US wars from the War of 1812 to date voters have invariably turned against parties and candi dates seen as unpatriotic de featist or in sympathy with the enemy On Defense Secretary Mel vin Laird has already laid down the GOP line McGoverns unpreparedness budget would weaken us to the point of virtually hoisting a white flag of surrender or as Democratic Senator Henry M Jackson of Wash ington described it McGov erns running on a platform of national weakness On welfare Nixonites will attack McGovern by citing his en thusiastic 1971 embrace of the National Welfare Rights Organizations 6500ayear guaranteed annual income On busing Nixon campaign ers will emphasize that the President opposes it while McGovern endorses it Paro chial school tax credits will be a major issue in some areas President Nixon fa vors Federal income tax credits of up to 200 per pupil attending parochial schools and this could boost his stock considerably among Catholic voters In contrast Senator McGovern is opposed to assistance to either paro chial schools or parochial school parents As for the economy un employment remains a prob lem that must cost the Presi dent some votes However those Democrats who put too much faith in the Election Day impact of unemployment may be quite mistaken The highest ratios of US jobless ness tend to be concentrated in states that Nixon did not carry in 1968 and can prob ably be reelected without carrying in 1972 Except for California the employment picture is bright in the key Nixon states of the South and West Despite Administra tion nervousness over food price levels inflation is an issue that has historically favored the tighterfisted GOP Look for the Adminis tration to emphasize the White House fight against in flation while simultaneously underscoring the inflationary nature of McGoverns spend ing programs Tax reform is one issue that the Nixon forces have tried to sidestep and they will probably devote more time to labeling McGov ern proposals as radical than to detailing GOP tax reform ideas In a tactical sense at least the White House is negligent in not adopting some tax reform ploy to wit George Wallaces highly successful diatribe against taxexempt founda tions Still even though tax reform is the South Dakotans best issue the June Harris poll shows that support for McGoverns position is indeed only a percentage point or two ahead of the asyetun defined position of the White House Foreign policy is one of the Presidents strongest points He will be spotlighting this skill and appeal by his post GOP  convention visit in Hawaii with Japans new Pre mier Kakuei Tanaka a visit which should remind voters of Nixons historic Moscow and Peking summits Another theme the Republi cans will attack aggressively is social morality issues like am nesty marijuana and abortion which the GOP will use but use carefully to avoid the type of abrasive overkill that characterized the 1970 election Here again McGov ern is clearly vulnerable For example although he claims never to have proposed legal ization of marijuana United Press International Feb 16 1972 quotes him as saying that because of the experi ence of prohibition a more promising route might be to regulate marijuana along the lines of alcohol President Nixon probably wont call McGovern any names Others will do the job like Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott tagging McGovern as the triple A candidate  Acid Amnesty and Abortion Handled prudently tactics like this will help link Mc Govern to a culture and morality that is anathema to Perhaps the Administra tions greatest asset and weapon will be a context that the White House can only in directly help to create the notion that McGovern is a radical whose election could jeopardize the fabric and sta bility of American society The White House is stirring up friendly economists to talk about McGoverns bringing On a depression Businessmens fears of crackpot economics are being whetted So too with Asian and European fears of McGoverns neoisola tionism Also the GOP suggests that Congress would be at odds with a Mc Govern White House for four straight years Even most Congressional Democrats are leery of McGovern As Sena tor Ernest F Hollings of South Carolina chairman of the Senate Democratic Cam paign Committee said of Mc Govern as a candidate I find him almost in fantasy land McGovern has pledged his support to the entire pro gram of the Black Caucus including a demand that the goverment implement the US pronouncements in the United Nations to help lib erate the remaining areas under colonial rule in Afri ca and including the posi tion that one per cent of the US Gross National Product 11billion a year be spent on foreign aid with priority to Africa What it adds up to the GOP will say is a pic ture of a man whose radical erratic and incompetent poli cies threaten a domestic and foreign instability in rnarked contrast to President Nixons record of new milestones to ward world peace and in creasingly prosperous econ omy and the reemergence of domestic order In previous years when America has been threatened by a radical candidate the electorate has eventually ral lied around stability McKin ley beat Bryan this way and Coolidge turned back John Davis and thirdparty candi date LaFollette in 1924 with the slogan Coolidge or chaos Henry Wal lace  McGoverns 1948 can didate  wasnt even taken seriously by the time Novem ber rolled around To be sure a radical able to win a major party Presidential nomination is tapping a wellspring of real discontent and sometimes his movement goes on to later victory or at least influence But radical movements have always lost their first Presi dential contest because in that first breakthrough they are too brash and narrow for the electorate to tolerate So it is likely to be again in 1972 McGovern represents a new radical elite that has taken control of the Demo cratic party and alienated much of the traditional party structure in the process Wit ness the words of AFL CIO president George Meany hitherto a Democratic stalwart This mans ideas arent liberal This mans ideas are crazy To use these circumstances to best advan tage the GOP must not only show McGovern as a radical but President Nixon must eschew the vitriolic stumping of 1970 and present himself as the statesman leader of the forces of sta bility Virtually all of the Presidents associates have cautioned him against repetition of 1970 and there is little chance that he will fall into the trap On November 7 I expect Americans to vote for sobri ety and stability giving Richard Nixon a decisive re election majority

Her Summer Festival Lasts All Year,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/13/archives/her-summer-festival-lasts-all-year.html,She is black She lives in Harlem She rides the subways She has never been mugged She loves New York City and she gets paid to tell people why  She is New Yorks 19th Summer Fes tival Queen and as her reign nears its end 23yearold Bernadette Allen has found that people are not so much surprised by her colorshe is the first black to win the titleas they are by the fact that a beauty queen of any color could have some thoughts in her head Everywhere I go people look at me like I cant possibly be articulate the articulate 5foot6inch 117pound queen said smiling wryly as she sat in an office at the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau 90 East 42d Street During a visit to Australia one man told me Ive never met a beauty queen who could talk And my time on various talk shows has been shortened because the people told me afterwards they didnt think I would have anything to say Its almost enough to turn a beauty queen to womens liberation Almost but not quite I would like to be thought of as a sex object its good for my ego Ber nadette said looking like one as she sat braless in a clingy beige Qiana dress part of her official wardrobe Nothing the womens lib groups do is going to wipe the sexobject thing out of a males mind she said because a female is different from a male and always will be No matter what species of animal or insect she is different Bernadette a fashion model was chosen Summer Festival Queen last December from a field of eight finalists three of them black She is paid 50 for each official appearance and 250 plus expenses for each week she is on the road She is allowed to continue accepting modeling assignments from the Royal Model and Talent Agency but the city has first claim to her services Bernadettes in  city duties include serving as an official ornament at such things as the opening of the Schaefer Festival in Central Park the Miss Black TeenAge America Pageant in Madison Square Garden the dedication of a 42 story apartment building on East End Avenue and judging costumes at a Bra zilianAmerican Society dance On her outoftown and overseas Aus tralia and the Orient jaunts she usually kept busy answering questions about whether New York is really more of a bummer rather than a summer festival Everybody wants to know about crime and mugging she said shaking her head a bit sadly They also want to know if the people are really cold The pollution thing doesnt seem to bother them very much And how does she answer the ques tions On crime The whole thing is exaggerated Were not even in the top 10 American cities in crime statistics On the coldness of New Yorkers Im not cold In fact my father says Im too friendly I even go out of my way to speak to construction workers and sanitation men On pollution Have you ever been to Hong Kong The only untoward thing that has happened to her in the city she said occurred when she was 17 and working at a summer job in the financial district I was waiting for my parents to pick me up she recalled and a man who had had a little too much to drink walked up to me and asked me to go into the park with him I said How would you like it if you had a daughter and she came home and said Daddy a man propositioned me today The man walked away shaking In fact she is so relaxed about crime that she thinks nothing she says of parking her yellow Opel GT on the streets at night Sometimes Ive left my windows down she said and people come by and close them And so far I havent lost any hubcaps or aerials Bernadette lives in the once exclusive Sugar Hill area of Harlem with her par ents Her mother came here from Ja maica her father a native of North Carolina is a retired postal worker She attended PS 164 Washington Irv ing High School and City College for six months before she quit It was too confining to go to work as a model She said she had received no criticism from anyone about her selection as Sum mer Festival Queennot even from black militants who might view her as a shill for the white establishment The people in my neighborhood all think its fantastic she said I think this opens up opportunities for other nonwhites to get involved and I think thats important Bernadette said she had never smoked pot but I have inhaled its fumes It makes me very depressed and sleepy Abortion she believes is up to the individual And politics Thats the one subject I cant talk about be cause it would reflect on the Visitors Bureau Is there a special man in her life Theyre all special she replied with a smile that revealed dazzlingly perfect teeth I have to have romance in my life It makes life easier But marriage is not one of my particular goals It just something that comes eventually And speaking of particular goals Ber nadette is hoping for a career in tele vision after her reign ends this fall Specifically she would like to host television talk show or be a television news reporter These are both jobs where I would be able to talk she said and I think Id like that
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/13/archives/a-foreigners-view.html,To the Editor Allow me a visitor from Europe to your country to comment on your recent editorial Halting Nuclear Spread You speak of the need to make American security assurances credible to those nations that y upon the American nuclear umbrella if they are not to turn to developing their own nuclear capacities This is indeed a point that worries many Euro peans who have until now resisted the Gaullist argument that in a real con frontation Europe cannot rightly ex pect America to risk its own destruc tion hence the need for Europe to have its realistic deterrent  But how does the situation look to any foreign statesman whose first duty is to his own country One of your major parties has just shown it self far more agitated over abortion than over any foreign policy ques tions excepting Vietnam Its Presiden tial candidate has to be sure thrown in a reassurance in his speech of acceptance clearly a tactical one and clearly of least interest to his audi ence His more recent indecisiveness is scarcely reassuring in light of the major decisions that one expects an American President to be capable of making if the credibility your editorial speaks of is to be maintained If Americans will put themselves for a moment in the position of Europeans Israelis Japanese etc they will per haps understand why there are serious misgivings abroad about a possible McGovern victory and why the Gaul list argument will be rather convincing in such an eventuality Philadelphia Aug 1 1972
Government Accused of Speech Curb,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/13/archives/government-accused-of-speech-curb.html,The American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties Union accused the Federal Government yesterday of trying to use the Federal Election Act of 1971 to curb free speech  A letter signed by Aryeh Neier executive director of the national group and Ira Glasser executive director of the New York group criticized Controller General Elmer B Staats for applying the law to a recent twopage advertise ment in The New York Times That advertisement asked for the impeachment of President Nixon because of his actions on the war in Vietnam The letter said that the two liberties unions had no pres ent quarrel with the acts gen eral purpose of bringing finan cial limitations and accounta bility to political campaigns In this instance however the letter said the complaints against the advertisement in The Times and any interpreta tion of the law which justifies such complaints [are] shocking ly insensitive to the First Amendment The letter was addressed to Mr Staats as head of the Gen eral Accounting Office a Con gressional agency that oversees Government activities Part of the agency is the new Office of Federal Elections which enforces the new law governing spending for political cam paigns Last June the elections of fice accused The Times of an apparent violation of the new law and referred the case to the Justice Department The agency said that The Times had failed to obtain and publish a statement from the advertise ments sponsor the National Committee for Impeachment to the effect that no candidate for Federal office had author ized an expenditure for the publication Administrative regulations promulgated under the act cover advertisements oppos ing or urging the defeat of a Federal candidate or derogating his stand on campaign issues If a candidate opposing the subject of the attack is involved in sponsoring the advertise ment the advertising costs are counted against the limit on his spending If no candidate is involved a disclaimer must be published with the advertise ment In an election year the liberties unions said almost any statement concerning a public issue could be regarded as supporting or opposing a candidate Public advertise ments about skyjacking school busing arms aid to Israel or abortion could come within the regulations requirements These regulations by requir ing the candidates certification before they could be published would give any candidate an absolute veto over all messages Such a result is both absurd and unconstitutional yet the regulations clearly permit it The letter said that the ad vertisement in The Times was plainly not in behalf of any candidate The letter added It was merely the expression of views Yet complaints were filed and criminal prosecution is reportedly being considered The letter urged Mr Staats to revise the regulations be cause they authorize the impo sition of a blanket of silence in this election year

The other July convention,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/13/archives/the-other-july-convention-the-bpoe-best-people-on-earth-in-atlantic.html,Ah the middle of July and in romantic en chantic Atlantic City down on the old New Jersey shore 16346 Elks and their wives have herded together from all over the United States to hold their national convention Meanwhile in Miami Beach some 1100 miles to the south the Demo cratic party is in the midst of its national conven tion But the Elks seem not to have the slightest interest in the goings on in Miami Beach In fact while just about everyone else in the country has his eye on Lawrence OBrien and Gary Hart  Company the Elks are spending the hot Atlantic City evenings either strolling on the Boardwalk riding the Ferris wheel on the Million Dollar Pier making the scene at an endless round of cocktail parties or whooping it up in the Club Le Bistro where they are entertained by Sonny Richard and His Panic Buttons plus the Big Bear Revue  The Elks Clubor the Benevolent and Protec tive Order of Elks BPOE of the United States of America as the organization is formally known was founded in 1868 and so is 104 years old But since it has sometimes held two conventions in one year the 1972 convention is its 108th The founding fathers of the Elks were curiously enough a group of New York actors who set it up as a fraternal drinking club and that despite the in volvement of the Elks in such eleemosynary ac tivities as aid to crippled orphans and handicapped veterans is essentially what it remains today in a town like say Sioux Falls S D the Elks lodge is a place where a Jiggslike husband can get away from his Maggielike wife for a few hours in the evening to shoot pool to play pennyante poker and especially to drink at the bar with his brother Elks Indeed I get the im pression from a number of Elks whom I talk with at the convention that any lodge that was forced to close its bar would lose most of its members in a matter of months And just about all of its income too Not that the Elks do all that much drinking Instead theyre the sort who like college freshmen do more talking about drink ing than actual drinkingBoy did I get clob bered at that party a typical Elk is apt to brag or announce when offered a cup of coffee in the morning This is the stuff I should of been drink in last night ha ha ha Still to use a phrase that is heard constantly around the convention the bar in the lodge seems to be the great heart of Elkdom On the evening of Tuesday July 11while the Democrats are in the middle of their platform bat tle over such issues as busing and abortiona couple of hundred Elks and their wives are gathered in the pale moonlight around the swimming pool at the Howard Johnsons Motor Lodge on Pa cific Avenue downing such stuff as Four Roses and ginger ale at a party thrown by a crowd Massachusetts Elks And they are doing a good deal of laughing though mainly at slightly off color jokes that all seem to have the same punch lineseither Try it youll like it or I cant believe I ate the whole thing After a time many of them become a bit tipsy and they boisterously sing a medley of songs with state names in them The Yellow Rose of Texas California Here I Come Back Home Again in Indiana And among those on hand at the party is this writer Or at least Im intermittently on hand That is interested in whats going on at the Democratic convention I scuttle back and forth all evening long between the poolside party and the TV set in my upstairs room And the contrast between the delegates to the pair of conventions is strik ing to say the least Among the Elks I encounter al most no one under 30 and fairly few for that mat ter under 40 The median age of Americas 1520 731 Elks Id learned is 49 and an astonishing number of those around the pool look weirdly enough to be exactly 49 Most of them I discover as I wander about the party are smalltown pro fessionals and businessmendruggists undertakers mobilehome salesmen dentists and the owners drycleaning stores from places like Zanesville Ohio and Herkimer N Y The median family income of the Elks is 12555 and 62 per cent of them have no education beyond high school So for the most part theyre middleaged middle class Middle Americans who wear miniature Amer ican flags in the lapels of their midnightblue and tangerinecolored sports jackets Paunchy balding and bespectacled And very likable too  grinning easygoing and unembarrassedly friendly How ya doin The songs they sing have a way of naming their states so do the shirts they wear I notice on my upstairs TV set that many of the male delegates in Miami Beach have side burns bushy mustaches and beards while the Elks appear almost to have a rule against sport ing any sort of facial cabbage At any rate only about 1 per cent of the Elks have mustaches all of which are of the pencil  thin Cesar Romero type and I come upon only a single Elk all week who has a beard None has long hair or sideburns Moreover I havent seen so many crewcuts in any one place since I was at college in the middle of the nineteenfifties There are scores of women in evidence at the party but they are the wives of Elks rather than delegates for the club admits no women to its membership A fact about which no one includ ing Betty Friedan Gloria Steinem and the Elks wives themselves seems to care in the least Any way just about all of the Elks have brought along their wives to the convention which probably ex plains why Atlantic Citys nightclub owners arent particularly happy with the convention Or so Ive been told by a bartender in Red Morgans a boite on Missouri Avenue that features Dale Arnell and Her Family Affair And probably ex plains too why Ive spotted absolutely no hook ers or other ladies of dubious virtue lurking about the convention Indeed no group of 16346 Amer icans could be more cleancut cleanliving and apparently cleanthinking than the Elks and their wives While its admittedly ungallant of me to mention the Elks I observe at the motel pool do not appear to marry especially goodlooking womenthere are approximately as many pretty Elks wives at the party as there are mustaches on their Elk husbands As a matter of fact the typical Elks wife seems to be a shorthaired broadbeamed and puddingfaced woman of 43 in harlequin glasses cerise Bermuda shorts and a sleeveless aquamarine Orlon blouse The most dramatic difference between the dele gates in Miami Beach and those in Atlantic City is that there are no blacks at the Elks convention None The Elks Club does not admit blacks to membership in any of its 2170 lodges which are located in all 50 of the United States Puerto Rico Guam the Canal Zone and the Philippines Says Article VI Section 4 of the Elks constitution an Elk must be a white male citizen of the United States of sound mind and body of good character not under the age of 21 years and a believer in God Most years the annual Elks convention is a carefree whoopdeedoo occasion of parties and high jinks interrupted only by a few obligatory daytime hours of routine business sessions This year however reality has harshly intruded itself upon the conventionLodge 410 of Madison Wis has introduced a resolution to amend the constitution by striking the word white from Article VI Section 4 and thus making blacks and other nonwhites eligible to join the Elks And the argument whether to vote for or against the Madison resolution has divided the convention into bitterly warring factions Actually a similar reso lution has been introduced at four previous con ventions but needing a twothirds majority to pass it has always been swiftly voted down by a hurried show of hands The Madison resolution however will be voted on by secret ballot on Thursday morning at the conventions closing business session and its backers are confident that at last given the chance to vote in secret the Elks will finally come out in favor of admit ting nonwhites As it is now the constitution immoral and unAmerican flatly states James Hourihan Jr of Marblehead Mass a tall beefy and bespectacled chemicalcompany execu tive who is the state president of the Massa chusetts Elks and a longtime leader in the fight to integrate the club We cant stay forever in the 19th centuryits time that we moved into the 20th century Anyway I believe that your average Elk is of such high moral character that the Madison resolution will definitely pass From the poolside party at Howard Johnsons I stroll over late in the evening to the Holiday Inn on the Boardwalk where I keep an appoint ment with an official spokesman for the Elks who though wishing to remain anonymous has prom ised to fill me in with some general facts on the organization First however over a postmidnight can of Sprite in his 21stfloor room he emphat ically lets it be known that the leadership of the Elks is extremely upset about the way that the press has handled the story of racial bias in the club The press he tells me has been guilty of selective editorializing in that it constantly harps on the fact that the Elks Club doesnt admit blacks while neglecting to mention that the organ ization also excludes the members of just about every other minority group in the country That is Im rather surprised to hear him say the lead ers are angry because reporters never seem to bring up the fact that the Elks discriminate not only against blacks but also against American In dians Orientals Chicanos Puerto Ricans women the under21 young Communists Communist sym pathizers atheists agnostics revolutionaries an archists and anyone who isnt either a nativeborn or naturalized citizen of the United States In short the Elks are all but indiscriminately dis criminate and theyd like everybody to know it You see its not just the blacks were keeping outits all sorts of other types too including a lot of whites who dont come up to our stand ards he explains to me with a broad benevolent grinOh I see I say Those who want to keep the club restricted to whites Im told argue that the Elks is a private organization and that its lodges are thus an exten sion of their living roomsAnd nobody can tell us who we must or must not invite into our living roomsif we want to keep out blacks or Indians or anybody else we have a perfect right guaranteed by the United States Constitution the spokesman tells me And we dont like the press and other outsiders trying to pressure us into accepting types whom we dont want The leadership of the Elks is mainly in the hands of 17 expresidents of the organization or socalled Past Grand Exalted Rulers a cabal of very elderly men that includes among other notables a former president of the American Medical Association The leadership rules Politburostyle with an iron hand The Past Grand Exalted Rulers for example decide among themselves who is to be the next Grand Exalted Ruler of the Elks and then submit only his name to the convention to be voted upon They also decide what is and what is not to be discussed at the convention In short they run a tight ship and their candidate for Grand Exalted Ruler running unopposed has little more difficulty getting elected than General Thieu had last year in South Vietnam The official sessions of the Elks convention are taking place in a vast auditorium on the second floor of Convention Hall on the Boardwalk that seats some 5500 Elks And on Wednesday morning at 9 the Past Grand Exalted Rulers slump into a row of wooden folding chairs on the flowerbe decked stage and the session is opened by a stand in for the indisposed Grand Exalted Ruler Eugene Fournace an aging utilitiescompany ex ecutive of Canton Ohio who is in the nexttothe last day of his unsalaried oneyear term of office The gavelwielder stands at a microphoneequipped dais in the middle of the stage above which hangs a sign saying Build Pride of Elkdom that is flanked on either side by banners that bear a draw ing of an Elks head the American flag and the words Our Flag Love lit or Leave  I sit around for about a half hour of the session which is public and thus open to such types as Elks wives the whitehaired wives of the Past Grand Exalted Rulers sit in a place of honor in the front row of the auditorium and the press but I frankly soon become excruciatingly bored with the proceedings which have to do with things like the annual reports of the Youth Activities Committee and the Elks National Service Commission and so I roam into the hallway to have a cigarette And there I encoun ter a fourman delegation of Elks from Lodge 1274 of Mid dleboro Mass Finding out that Im from the press the Middleboro Elks ner vously explain to me that one of the main reasons why the matter of striking the word white from their con stitution has become so urg ent this year is that a black had actually applied for mem bership last December to their lodge And theyd been forced to turn him down because of the constitutional rule against accepting nonwhites Evident ly I learn no black has ever before attempted to join the Elks and so the question of admitting or not admitting a nonwhite has always in the past been academic Perhaps this is because there is an all black organization known as the Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks the IBPOE which was founded by a group of Philadelphia blacks some 70 years ago and today has approximately half a million members The IBPOE has absolutely no connection with the BPOE however indeed the two organizations have never been on speaking terms Or perhaps no black has ever tried to be an Elk before because as a black friend of mine had put it to me before Id left for Atlantic City No selfrespecting black would want to be an Elk In any event upon being turned down by the Middleboro Elks the black William F Ezell a parcel post deliverytruck driver and the scoutmaster of a troop of Boy Scouts spon sored by the Elks themselves had filed a complaint against Lodge 1274 with the Federal District Court in Boston And Ezells complaint is still pend ing the Middleboro Elks tell me though theyve come to the convention to make it no longer necessary  that is theyre on hand to lobby in favor of the passage of the Madison resolution so that theyll be able to take in Ezell as a member Or at least have the option to accept or to re ject him on grounds other merely than his race Actu ally since Ezell has caused Lodge 1274 a good deal of public embarrassment and since any applicant can be turned down by any lodge by the blackball vote of only three members Ezells chanc es of ever becoming an Elk no matter how the constitu tion might be amended are about equal to mine after this article appears We are here to bring about the constitu tional change through estab lished Elk democratic process es earnestly says Thomas J Wynn Lodge 1274s attorney a jittery young Elk of about 30 from Taunton Mass And let me stress we have no con nection with CITE At the Elks grand ball CITE I ask Yes the Committee to In tegrate the Elks replies Wynn scornfully Theyre nothing but a bunch of rabble rousing publicity  seeking troublemakers And militants The Elks dont like to be pressured to be told how to vote on an issue  so CITEs militant tactics are losing us votes Aha CITE huh I say and immediately beat a re treat in search of CITE head quarters Militant Elks Rab blerousers publicityseekers longhaired freaks BPOE Abbie Hoffmans I can scarce ly wait to meet them CITE I find out is encamped in a suite of rooms on the 21st floor of the Holiday Inn to which I now hasten expect ing to come upon a crowded frenetic scene of CITE volun teers at work on phones and at mimeograph machines But I am disappointed The only sound in the suite is the rumble of a defective air con ditioner and no one is around but a trio of sad and angry Elks And the trio turns out to make up the entire mem bership of the Committee to Integrate the Elks Three out of the 1520731 Elks in America And none of the three even slightly resembles Abbie Hoffman Instead al though one of them is a Ro man Catholic Priest and is thus dressed in clerical garb they couldnt be more typicallook ing Elks I introduce myself to the members of CITE and find that their leader is Richard Zalenka a 39year old Post Office letter carrier from Ridgewood N J who was expelled from Lodge 1455 in Ridgewood last March for conduct unbecoming an Elkie speaking out at meetings in favor of admitting blacks to the lodge Zalenka a burly man of 275 pounds who looks like a Baltimore Colts lineman becomes sud denly animated when he learns that Im from the press and he launches loudly into a speech in which he proclaims that while he believes the Elks to be the greatest fra ternal organization on the face of the earth the club has a moral duty to remove the offensive clause from its constitution and to begin admitting nonwhites Can you believe it in 1972 after all the progress that this country has made in civil rights in the past 10 years that an organization like the Elks that preaches charity and justice for all could still be keeping out blacks says Zalenka pacing excitedly about the room Incredible So until the Elks are no long er racist Im going to keep on speaking out against them Ranting on becoming more and more agitated as he speaks Zalenka at one point strikes a melodramatic pose and cries If necessary I am ready to die for this cause Meanwhile the twp other members of CITE William Randall and the Rev William M MacKenzie sit quietly by looking increasingly embar rassed by the pronouncements of their leader Randall a lean haggardlooking 37 yearold automobile mechanic with a sharply receding hair line is also from Ridge wood where he and Zalenka worked together in a futile attempt to integrate Lodge 1455 Like Zalenka Randall was charged by Lodge 1455 with conduct unbecoming an Elk but he was found inno cent of the charge and so re mains an Elk in more or less good standing The third member of CITE Father MacKenzie a 32 year  old Catholic priest from Middleboro Mass is a benign  looking roly  poly young man who looks a bit like Friar Tuck Father Mac Kenzie is a member of Lodge 1274 of Middleboro which at tempted to kick him out last fall after hed made a number of speeches at meetings in favor of letting blacks into the lodge But the attempt had failed And hed then been instrumental in getting Wil liam F Ezell the black parcel post driver to apply for mem bership in Lodge 1274 and had also supported Ezell in his decision to file a com plaint against the Elks in Federal District Court So like Randall Father MacKenzie continues to be an Elk though he has something of a problem with his brother Elks in Lodge 1274that is none of them will speak to him How do you think the vote on the Madison resolution is going to come out tomor row I ask the members of CITE and Zalenka at once loudly again takes the floor Unless the Elks want to go down the drain to cut their own throats theyve got to vote tomorrow in favor of the Madison resolution shouts Zalenka Because believe me if they dont the Elks are going to lose the respect of everyone in the communities where they live And theyre not going to be able to get any new members either especially from among the kids of today including their own sonsif they dont start letting in blacks the Elks are finished Zalenka I discover is an unlikely civil libertarian for he finds no fault with any thing that the Elks stand for other than the clubs policy on race He is for instance a rabid Vietnam hawk and a jingoistic patriot who an nounces to me that As far as Im concerned the only good Comrriunist is a dead Communist Father MacKen zie at last manages to get in a word We dont know how the vote is going to come out tomorrow he says in a soft Massachusettsaccented voice but all three of us are pray ing that the Madison resolu tion will passpraying very hard What you may well ask actually goes on at an Elks convention Well aside from private business sessions at which the delegates discuss such confidential matters as financial reports there are a number of public sessions at which the Elks seem mainly to congratulate one another for various good deeds that theyve done for mankind in general and Elkdom in par ticular And to award plaques scrolls and trophies to each other Of the 16346 Elks and their wives at the convention only 2719the Exalted Rul ers and Past Exalted Rulers of local lodgesare actually delegates and at one point or another it seems as though every one of the 2719 is given an award for something or other up to and including a brandnew Cadillac which is presented to the incoming Grand Exalted Ruler as he begins his oneyear term And when the Elks arent congrat ulating individuals for jobs well done theyre congratu lating the club as a whole for its multitude of good deeds The Elks are particularly in furiated at the press for writ ing constantly about racial bias in the club while almost never writing about all of the good things that it does Last year for example the Elks gave innumerable hours of their time and forked out some 16million on what they themselves term benev olencesthat is financial and other aid to such types as hospitalized veterans re tarded children Boy Scouts Campfire Girls and cancer patients And the Elks Nation al Foundation which has as sets of more than 27million spent about 7million on col lege scholarships for nearly a thousand students The Elks scholarships moreover are given to students of all races and creedsthe only criteria for winning an Elks scholar ship are need and merit But you guys never write about those kinds of things do you an Indiana Elk bel ligerently says to me at one point shoving a beefy fore finger into my chest Late in the Wednesday morning session of the con vention the four top winners of the 197273 Elks scholar ships are trotted out to give thankyou speeches to the as sembled delegates and Im hard put to believe that the Elks could possibly have found such cleancut 1940s looking kids anywhere in the United States these days Anyway theyve found them Thomas Camp Michael Strohbach Janice Czokmay and La Dawn Shaw the last of whom looks as though shes inadvertently turned un early in Atlantic City for the Miss America contest At the Tuesdaymorning session the conventions guest speaker Art Linkletter formerly of TVs People Are Funny had spoken on the evils of drug abuse but typical of the speeches given now by the scholarship winners is that delivered by Miss Czokmay a prim and pretty brunette of Warren Ohio No organiza tion is an island and the Elks have shown this by becoming a bridge between generations by extending patriotism good will and the American dream and not to let others destroy it    The foundations upon which the United States was established all men are created equal    must not be destroyed by troublesome radicals who are dissatisfied with the status quo And she concludes her speech which seems to go on forever by reciting the lyrics of The Impossible Dream from Man of La Mancha to a background of organ music after which she gets a stand ing ovation from the pleased Elks whove apparently sensed no irony in her words nor I guess has any been intended Such in any event is a typical example of a typ ical speech at the Elks con ventionthe stuff of which American Legion Oratory Contests are made God the flag the American way of life the brotherhood of man biased radicals the Commu nist menace and love of Elk dom are constantly mentioned in just about all of the speech es and no speech is received with anything less than a standing ovation Thursday morning and the Elks have assembled in Con vention Hall for the final ses sion of their convention at which theyll vote on the Madison resolution and install a new Grand Exalted Ruler Last night in Miami Beach the Democrats nominated Senator George McGovern for President but the Elks who might be politically described as Agnew Republicans make no mention this morning of McGovern and the Democrats Still a backer of Senator Mc Govern might wonder if it is soma sort of favorable omen for his candidacy that the Elks new Grand Exalted Rul er a 61yearold lawyer named Francis M Smith is from South Dakota If it is however its the first favor able omen for McGovern that has evidenced itself all week matter of fact McGovern can count himself as damned lucky that hes running this year for President of the United States rather than for Grand Exalted Ruler of the Elks for the Elks dont seem to like McGovern at all Among a hundred that Ive informally polled during the convention including nine from South Dakota Ive found only one who plans to vote for McGovern in November and he is Father MacKenzie the rogue Elk as Newsweek called him a few months ago Zalenka and Randall mean while are voting for President Nixon Before Smith is put into of fice the vote on the Madison resolution must be taken and now the press is barred from the auditorium So I lurk out side in the hallway and at tempt to get some idea of how the vote is apt to go Wynn the nervous leader of the Middleboro delegation tells me that he is uncertain of the outcome but hopeful To get a twothirds majority theyll need the votes of 1813 of the 2719 delegates and that might be difficult Wynn admits especially if CITE has turned too many of the delegates against us with its troublemaking Troublemak ing As far as Ive been able to discover all that CITE has done is lobby for the resolu tion around the Holiday Inn pass out handbills on the Boardwalk in front of Con The Weatherpeople theyre not vention Hall and put up few posters in Convention Hall itself all of which were swiftly torn down No burn ing of their Elks cards no violence no bombs The Weatherman theyre not A strong factor on the side of passage of the Madison resolution is the fact that it apparently has the support of Elkdoms geriatric leader ship the Past Grand Exalted Rulers who voted by a two toone margin in April in favor of striking the word white from the constitu tion However Zalenka had earlier told me the Past Grand Exalted Rulers had so voted because theyd been afraid that a number of lodg es would lose their state issued liquor licenses if the club continued to be restrict ed only to whites And Zalen ka had added the Past Grand Exalted Rulers had taken their vote before June 12 1972 when the United States Su preme Court  in a case in volving a Moose lodge in Har risburg Pa that had re fused service at its bar to a black guest  had ruled that the Constitution does not require states to deny liquor licenses to private clubs that discriminate against blacks And upon learning of the Supreme Courts decision in the Moose case which had been joined in by all four of President Nixons Supreme Court appointees and written by Mr Justice Rehnquist the Elks Grand Exalted Ruler E Eugene Fournace had told reporters It was gratifying to know that our interpreta tion of the Constitution was reaffirmed I think it points out the importance and wis dom of the Constitution as to the right of association and freedom of choice So Zalen ka had said the Moose deci sion had ended the worry about the loss of liquor licenses among the Past Grand Exalted Rulers who were now hed claimed lobbying behind the scenes for the de feat of the Madison resolu tion As the 2719 delegates to the Elks convention file one by one up onto the stage at the front of the auditorium and drop their paper ballots into a cardboard box the vote on the Madison resolution is taken But it will be a while before the votes can be count ed and the official result is announced and so now the public including the press is let into the auditorium At 1136 am Francis M Smith is installed in office as the new Grand Exalted Ruler of the Elks And at 1158 am as one of his first official acts Smith calls upon a clerk to read the results of the vote on the Madison resolution The clerk makes his way to the dais with a slip of paper in his hand Total silence in the vast auditorium The re sult is as follows says the clerk in a twangy Middle Western voice in favor of the resolution 921 opposed to the resolution 1789 The resolution is defeated Cheers from most of the as sembled Elks who a couple of minutes later after the final session of their national convention has been ad journed file happily out of the auditorium So rather than passing by a twothirds majority the Madison resolu tion has been defeated by nearly twothirds and I spy the members of the Middle boro delegation standing in the hallway looking ashen faced and despondent Theyll have to go now into Federal District Court and contest Ezells complaint against them Now Grand Exalted Ruler Smith holds  a press confer ence with a half dozen or so reporters at which he im mediately announces that hell have no comment on the result of the vote on the Madi son resolution Before the vote was taken when I hadnt yet been installed in office I felt that it would be im proper for me to make known my personal feelings about the resolution says Smith And now Now I still wont make my feelings about it known he says I ask him a couple of questions Would he agree that the question of whether or not to admit non whites is the most important issue currently facing the Elks Yes Then isnt his re fusal to take a position on the question rather like Presi dent Nixon refusing to take a position on the most im portant issues facing the Unit ed States like the Vietnam war and busing But I dont get anything even vaguely re sembling a straight answer to my question from Smith his rambling reply is worthy of a Presidential candidate ap pearing on Meet the Press Ducking out of the press conference I walk over to the CITE suite where Zalenka is stomping about in a rage while Randall and Father MacKenzie sit dejectedly by Just tell everybody that we are sorry and disgusted dis gusted and sorry shouts Zalenka And that in our opinion the Elks have by their vote relegated them selves to the dustbin where all such hypocritical bigots belong And the future of CITE In doubt says Father MacKenzie for none of the committees three members has either the money or the time to keep up the fight to integrate the Elks Next year the Elks convention will be held in Chicago where the club has its national head quarters and says Father MacKenzie None of us can afford to go all the way out to Chicago Anyway right now were packing up and going back home says Zalenka angrily flinging a shirt into a suitcase And well see what the future will bring The rest of the Elks are going back home too I re turn to my room to pack Later suitcase in hand I get on a clown elevator at the sixth floor which is jammed with a cheerfully chattering crowd of crewcut Ohio Elks and their wives At the fourth floor the elevator stops and a handsome young black couple get on a man and a woman in their early 20s who are perhaps in Atlantic City on their honeymoon Sudden and utter silence among the Elks in the elevator The young man pushes the button for the third floor and the couple get off when it stops there The door swooshes closed and the elevator continues down Hey I guess theyre not part of our bunch yips one of the Ohio Elks Raucous laugh ter Yeah but they could be someday quips his redhead ed wife Nervous laughter And then the elevator has reached the lobby
News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/14/archives/mcgovern-strategy-widen-base-in-party.html,WASHINGTON Aug 13  When Senator George McGov ern began his campaign jour neys last Thursday as the Democratic Presidential nom inee his candidacy seemed to face a fork in the road By all the rules of logic lie had either to bear left toward the dream of a liberal young plurality that he pursued in the primaries or veer right toward the security of the conventional old coalition that Franklin D Roosevelt con structed 40 years ago Not surprisingly since logic and politics seldom mix he chose neither grassroots or ganization nor Democratic ma chines but a combination of the two In New York State he named Robert F Wagner the 62yearold former Mayor of New York as campaign chair man and J Joseph Grandmai son a young political novice from New Hampshire as cam paign coordinator He broadened a heralded drive to register 18 million new young voters under the age of 25 to include the reregistration of millions more women blue collar workers and older citi zens and he placed the whole effort under the Democratic National Committee rather than the McGovern campaign He clung to his reform prom ises while attempting to shed the impression that he is radical Mr McGovern pro fessed to have found from chats with voters at a shoe fac tory in New Hampshire in an insurance company in Connect icut and in an Italian neighbor hood in Rhode Island that there is an intense yearning for peace in Vietnam jobs for the jobless and reform of the tax system a fortunate discov ery inasmuch as those have been his three key issues since January But he went out of his way to tell 4000 people on a shop ping mall in Providence that the Federal Government should not intervene in any way on the abortion question that he did not want his own children to use marijuana and that his proposal of amnesty for draft evaders was no more than what Calvin Coolidge had declared after World War I Style and Substance It is more a marriage of style and substance than of old poli tics and new but still it is a shotgun wedding The South Dakotan is as he conceded his first day on the road 23 per centage points behind President Nixon in the current Harris Poll So he has adopted the J F McElwain shoe factory scenario for the campaign Senator McGovern stood at 4 per cent in the opinion polls when he visited the old Mc Elwain company plant in Man chester on Feb 18 during the New Hampshire primary cam paign He had planned to spend most of his time in the liberal antiwar suburbs but the shoe workersmostly lower middle class ethnic and blue collar seemed so receptive that he told his staff he would concen trate on Manchester When the nations first pri mary had ended Mr McGovern had 33 per cent of the Man chester vote to 34 per cent for Senator Edmund S Muskie of nextdoor Maine the Muskie campaign had suffered the first of a series of crippling blows and Senator McGovern had tapped the roots of discontent that helped to fuel his drive toward the nomination There was more than sym bolism involved in Mr Mc Governs choice of the McEl wain plant as the first stop of his campaign as the Demo cratic nominee My God said a 46yearold worker Edgar Boulanger they all shake hands with you in the primaries and then you never see them again My God I think hes the first man who ever came back In going back Mr McGovern was attempting to substitute President Nixon for Senator Muskie Just as he had taunted Mr Muskie in New Hampshire for refusing to debate and keeping campaign contributor lists secret Senator McGovern criticized Mr Nixon for de clining to debate and for re fusing to disclose the names of those who gave 10million to the Republican campaign be fore a new disclosure law took effect It took the Senator 30 min utes to walk one short block through a crowd in Manchester Several hundred employes of Aetna Life and Casualty Com pany in Hartford stayed after work to greet him He was surrounded by friendly work ingclass ItalianAmericans in the Federal Hill section of Providence Needs More Assistance All the same Mr McGovern can reach only so many foot wear factories insurance offices and ethnic enclaves even by television commercials before the Nov 7 election If he is to translate primary pluralities into an electoral majority it will require assistance from old guard Democrats and labor leaders who still have some clout among their constituents Thus Mr McGovern publicly apologized in Rhode Island to the state chairman Lawrence McGarry for a misunderstand ing during the primary there Mr McGarry unmollified professed to be 1000 per cent behind George McGovern in a stinging reminder of the Sen ators 1000 per cent support of Senator Thomas F Eagleton before replacing Mr Eagleton with Sargent Shriver as his run ning mate Thus Mr McGovern said he planned to work hand in glove with John Bailey the patriarch of the party in Con necticut Thus he will visit with former President Lyndon B Johnson in Texas and Mayor Richard J Daley in Chicago later this month In a memorandum made pub lic in June Frederick G Dut ton a senior McGovern strate gist theorized that a registra tion drive among youths could provide the determining mar gin of difference Last week however he was saying how important it now is to sign up women and bluecollar voters too Oppose Youthful Focus Both Richard G Stearns the campaign coordinator in the Western states and a Wash ington consultant on ethnic politics who preferred anonym ity argued successfully in McGovern headquarters against focusing the registration drive on youths alone For every one of my ethnic grandmothers you lose the ethnic adviser said you have to register two kids As if to bear out the thesis that Mr McGovern may still be able to retain some sem blance of support among the old guard when a visitor to the Bradford House Senior Citizens Center in Providence asked an elderly woman why she seemed enthusiastic about her guest Senator McGovern she narrowed her eyes and re plied Arent you a Democrat
"After Adoption, Their Families Are Interracial",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/15/archives/after-adoption-their-families-are-interracial.html,DOBBS FERRY N YAbout 100 Westchester parents who have adopted children of races other than their own held a picnic over the weekend to show their children off to each other and to encourage prospective parents not to be afraid of interracial adoption The parents are mem bers of Adoptive Families of Westchester an organi zation that in two years has acquired 120 interracial families a monthly news letter and the members hope a strong lobbying voice for legislative re form concerning adopted children Weve sought each other out in supermarkets post of fices everywhere said Mrs Bernice Gottlieb the hostess for the Sunday picnic That approach has its drawbacks however On sev eral occasions Mrs Gottlieb has gone up to white mothers and asked if their black or Oriental children were adopt ed only to be told rather coldly that the children were their own the offspring of interracial marriages A Curious Saleswoman On the other hand Mrs Gottlieb remembers the time that a saleswoman in a Fifth Avenue department store after scrutinizing her 5year old Korean daughter Su sannah inquired sweetly Does your little girl resem ble her daddy The picnic was held on the grounds of the HyattLiving ston House a 30room Revo lutionary War mansion of which the Gottliebs are part owners The organization was ori ginally called Transracial Adoptive Parents of West chester but dropped the Transracial this spring as a step toward broadening its concern to include all adop tions It was founded by Myron and Claire Eckhardt of Mount Kisco who had a 3yearold natural daughter Kimberly when they received their black adopted son Mark in 1969 The nicest thing about the process was meeting other parents who had adopted black children Mrs Eck hardt said We had a lot of questions we wanted to ask someone And we wanted so cial contacts for our child The Eckhardts live in a part of Westchester that has very few black families but the community reaction the couple had prepared themselves for never de veloped Quite the contrary Our white friends made such a fuss over Mark that Kimberly got very jealous Mr Eckhardt said Thats one of the things people have to learn and we had to learn ourselvesnot to over react White parents who adopt black children have come under criticism recently from black social workers who say that such children are deprived of the chance to develop their true racial iden tity The question of identity has come up at the groups monthly meetings and at smaller meetings where those who have adopted Asian chil dren and those with black children meet separately It will be explored more fully at a panel discussion sched uled for the fall We were aware of all the problems said Mr Eck hardt a public school psy chologist But our assump tion was that these were children that were not being adopted A number of black people have stopped us in the street and told us what a nice thing were doing He cringed in repeating the re marks Thats not it at all its we who have profited One of the organizations major concerns is to cut down on the long delays involved in bringing orphans and abandoned children from Ko rea and Vietnam Mrs Gottlieb cut through much of the delay by going to Korea four years ago and finding Susannah in an or phanage But the experience of Joan and Bernard Mc Namara was more typical It took them 15 months to get Thanh a 3yearold Viet namese boy whose legs were crippled by polio Korean Children Two organizations the Council on Adoptable Chil dren and the Friends of the Children of Vietnam help arrange adoptions in South Vietnam The Holt Adoption Program Inc in Crestwell Ore which describes it self as a Christian agency but says it is open to application from nonChristians special izes in Korean adoptions But the process is still a slow one involving the United States Immigration Service Federal health offi cers and reliance on a num ber of intermediaries In addition a family can obtain only two visas for foreign children To bring in a third child requires an act of Con gress Due both to liberalization of abortion laws and to the growing willingness of un married women to keep their children the supply of adopt able American children of any race is shrinking rapidly The members of the group believe that in time interna tional adoptions will no long er be the exotic undertaking they still are but the only recourse for many couples who want children Already the Westchester adoption agencies which dis couraged interracial adoption a few years ago have begun to refer applicants to the Adoptive Parents group so they can consider other pos sibilities This fall the Westchester parents will explore sending one of their members to Korea where there are 80000 homeless children to expe dite a large number of adop tions at once Most of the picnickers to day were already members of the organization either as adoptive parents or as part of a special section for pro spective parents But the newsletter goes to all the names on the County Social Services Departments wait ing list and there were a number of new faces Among them were Margie and Elbano Schezzini who adopted Kathy a 14yearold JapaneseAmerican girl six years ago and just received a 4yearold white boy named Marc last week The picnic was the Sehez zinis first contact with the group and they said they planned to come back often because their experience as an interracial family has been so happy that they wanted to share it Marc seemed especially in terested in the gathering Look Mommy that girl looks just like Kathy he said pointing to an Oriental girl seated across the lawn

For God and Mr. Nixon,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/17/archives/for-god-and-mr-nixon.html,WASHINGTON Aug 16The Nixon Administrations lengthy and assiduous courtship of Catholic voters is one of the remarkable features of the political scene The latest gesture was its en dorsement of a Democraticsponsored bill to give a 200 tax credit to parents or children in parochial and private schools  A year ago this month President Nixon told the Knights of Columbus in New York In your fight to save your schools you can count on my support On April 10 he went to Philadelphia to repeat that pledge to the Natonal Catholic Educational Associations an nual convention Financial help for parents of chil dren in churchrelated schools83 per cent of such children are in Catholic schoolsis only one of the Adminis trations many proCatholic moves Consider these other items Two weeks ago the Administration announced that 41 private schools and colleges damaged by Tropical Storm Agnes would receive money from the Presidents disaster relief fund to pay or their reconstruction Twentyseven of them are Catholic primary and secondary schools Two years ago the President ap pointed John D Rockefeller 3d and 23 other distinguished citizens to serve on a Commission on Population Growth and the American Future When the commission finished its work on May 5 the President issued a statement rejecting much of its report I con sider abortion an unacceptable form of population control    I do not sup port the unrestricted distribution of family planning services and devices to minors he declared When repeal of New Yorks per missive abortion statute was pending before the State Legislature the Presi dent intervened on the antiabortion side with a letter to Cardinal Cooke President Nixon has Henry Cabot Lodge his 1960 running mate in Rome as his personal envoy to the Vatican He has retained a Jesuit priest on the White House staff Viewing these actions Democratic politicians shake their heads in envy As one of them remarked the other day Nixon is doing things Jack Kennedy could never dream of trying Can you imagine the uproar if Ken nedy had come out for parochial school aid or put a Jesuit on his staff or sent that abortion letter to the Cardinal Matthew Troy the Queens County Democratic chairman wisecracked re cently Nixons done everything ex cept say mass The Catholic community is not a political monolith A substantial ma jority of Catholics however used to vote Democratic Beginning in the late nineteenthirties during the contro versy over the Spanish Civil War the minority of Catholics voting Republi can grew appreciably General Eisen howers campaigns made more inroads In 1960 however the Democratic vote among Catholics rose sharply when John F Kennedy was the candi date It stayed high in 1964 perhaps because President Johnson was seen as carrying on the Kennedy policies and again in 1968 partly because Senator Edmund S Muskie a Catholic was the Democratic VicePresidential nominee In choosing first Senator Eagleton and then Sargent Shriver for Vice President Senator McGovern also picked a Catholic running mate President Nixon like a fair number of other nonCatholics undoubtedly opposes abortion and favors aid to churchrelated schools on philosophical grounds There is nothing unusual in the hope of GOP political strategists to translate these positions into ad ditional Catholic votes When the Presidents gestures are closely examined however they are all curiously insubstantial Although he retains Ambassador Lodge in Vati can City for example the President completely disregards Pope Pauls urgent pleas to end the Vietnam war and to stop the killing and the crea tion of new refugees Mr Nixons opposition to abortion is symbolic and has little practical effect Abortion is an issue decided not by the Federal Government but by the states as Governor Rockefeller demonstrated when he vetoed abor tion repeal despite Mr Nixons letter Although a strong argument can be made for Federal aid to church schools a 200 tax credit is not going to save foundering parochial schools Since the average cost of educating a child is 930 a year a credit would have to be three to four times larger than what the President has endorsed to be of decisive help to hardpressed Catholic parents Will any of this money actually be forthcoming Caspar Weinberger the Budget Director warned the Ways and Means Committee that since the Ad ministration wants no tax increase and a rigid budget ceiling any help for parochial school parents should be financed by cutting existing Fed eral aid to public schools Put in those terms the bill could set off the kind of parochial vs public school Donnybrook which killed Federal aid to education bills for twenty years
Humanities Endowment Thrives Amid Internal Strife,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/18/archives/humanities-endowment-thrives-amid-internal-strife.html,WASHINGTON Aug 17 Mention the National Arts En dowment and the response might be at least a nod of recognition mention the Na tional Humanities Endowment and a puzzled frown is more likely But this littleknown Fed eral agency with about 38 million to dispense this year is alive and despite some re cent internal troubles apparent ly well  The agencys progress and its problems a tangle of conflict ing personalities and philoso phies are currently being de bated by warring factions of its guiding advisory council The projects for which the endowment has supplied funds range from television programs the Biography series is one exampleto a 500000 grant to the New York Public Library and from the collecting and editing of George Washingtons private papers to archeological digs A Complex Chain The National Endowment for the Humanities to use its for mal title occupies two floors of a building in downtown Washington that also houses its twin the Arts Endowment The staff of about 70 persons handled 4500 applications for endowment funds totaling 125million in the fiscal year 1972and processed the award of 1133 grants totaling 24 537496 to individuals colleges and universities museums and nonprofit groups in all the states Who gets money how much and under what conditions is determined through a complex chain that includes the staff outside experts in the various specialties the endowments new chairman Dr Ronald S Berman who was appointed by President Nixon last December and a 26member National Council on the Humanities which is meeting here today and tomorrow The councils sessions have been closed and sources with in its ranks were reluctant to disclose what was being dis cussed but one topic more than likely to be under dis cussion  not on the agenda but very much on the minds of some council members and endowment staffers  is a simmering dispute between Dr Berman and some staff mem bers in the agencys Education Division The dispute has al ready led to resignations and dismissals by mutual consent and to bad feeling in the di vision Philosophical Conflict Some of those involved in the disputewhile they do not want to be quoted for fear they say of reducing what they see as a basic philosophical conflict to what might seem to be a matter of personal piquede scribe the conflict in almost Miltonic terms They see it as a conflict between litism and democracy between clinging to tradition and willingness to ex periment between a wouldbe cultural commissar and an institution that should be flexible The incident used as illustra tionand the one that turned disagreement into crisisin volves Dr Bermans acknowl edged desire to veto grants al ready made earlier this year and therefore approved by the council to three colleges Since they had already been an nounced and could not be vetoed all parties are eager that the names of the institu tions not be used to spare them embarrassment One veto desired by Dr Ber man involved a course whose description stated that genocide would be among the subjects considered another included consideration of the lyrics of Bob Dylan and the Beatles still another would use The Green ing of America and The Harrad Experiment He also objected to courses on the basis of their use of guerrilla theater as a teaching technique and because he felt the level of the course was too low or because the outline did not seem to demonstrate ac ceptable understanding of the humanities Strict Constructionist To Dr Bermans critics in cidents of this sort indicate that he takes what one called a strict constructionist view of the humanities that he favors the narrow rather than the broad scholarship for scholar ships sake Dr Bermans view of his critics perhaps was summed up best by him when he said They confuse the humanities with humanitarianism As for the litism charge he re sponded in a recent interview by saying You can be ac cused of litism if you confine it [education] to the lite but you cant be accused of litism if you bring the best to the most Dr Berman who succeeded Dr Barnaby Keeney a Demo cratic Presidents appointee whose term expired in 1970 is not apologetic about his views He agrees heartily with the views expressed by Irving Kristol he said and went on to quote Mr Kristol So much that passes for educational in novation is an excuse for level ing down In his own words he said he saw the choice as between giv ing students work of quality and admitted difficulty or we can give them Classic Comics culture simplified and castrated The choice that I think ought to be made is never to lose track of the student but to bring the work to him Yes he said he had wanted to veto the grants But the rea sons he gave were that in one the Beatles and Bob Dylan were the substance of a whole course not just a way to lead students back to other less ac cessible lyricistpoets and that The Harrad Experiment and The Greening of America absolutely dominated the curriculum in another As for the genocide dis pute he said I wanted to have it explained when a course announces that it is going to teach genocide I want to know more about it The course ac cording to others was a new humanistic approach to biol ogy man from the cell to so ciety which would lead to a discussion of such matters as genocide and abortion He denied allegations that he had demanded to see all grant applications saying I want to See only the ones that are con troversial He defined con troversial as any that might be using the Federal agencys money for political purposes and by extension social tion He does not feel as some others in the Education Divi sion do that the endowments basic function in education should be to make the human ities accessible and relevant to the unsophisticated student The humanities he said in a tone that sounded prideful are a very hard thing When a visitor disagreed he said Let me inform you that you are wrong And he does not believe in making them easy bringing the students up to the work Another Viewpoint Herbert McArthur the direc tor of the Education Division and one of two staff members who resigned at Dr Bermans request during the June dispute over the vetoes and the differ ences in viewpoint that re flected set forth his position in these words I favor a broad interpreta tion of the endowments man date relating the traditional concerns of humanists to issues of acute public national inter est We ought to challenge academic institutions and their professors to demonstrate why and how the humanities can help us all to a more decent life That means experimenta tion and innovation That means putting together human istic and humanitarian goals I know the chairman has a more conservative view and I dont see how I could be effective in implementing it Robert Kingston the endow ments director of planning and analysis said in a discussion of what he described as the muchvexed Education Divi sions troubles that he felt there had been only a very minimal change in policy un der Dr Berman This took the form of a sharper scrutiny of the kinds of activities that applicants for grants propose to undertake which have perhaps tended to veer toward novelty at the expense of goals he said He and others also noted that while Dr Keeney was with the endowment from its beginnings Dr Berman was the first highranking outside appointee and a man of very different manner an academic above all and with decided opinions a personality that some in the endowment might find abrasive Innovative Projects Cited Both he and Dr Berman cited the types of projects that the endowment has supported that could be called at least in novative such as financing the group of students whose re searches in Appalachia produced the compendium of folk wisdom Called The Foxfire Book About half a million people in small towns and cities have participated in the endowments humanities series in which teams of lecturers and per formers hold public audience participation sessions on such topics as American folklore and the alienation of young people Students in Hampton Va are learning archeology and history by uncovering the re mains of the Colonial city there The definitive editions of American authorsTwain Mel ville Thoreauare being put together A justannounced program begun before Dr Bermans term began is the youth grants program which describes itself as giving grants for research by people between 18 and 30 who need not have a college degree Among the first 29 awards an nounced last Tuesday only three recipients were not listed as degreeholders or students And in the Public Division director John Barcrofts special projects subdivision is trying to see just how far you can stretch the definition of hu manities What they would like to do maybe he mused would be to change those little pla cards on zoo cages to tell peo ple not only what the animal is and its scientific name and that sort of thing but also some of the myths attached to them Children  or adults  could gaze upon the whiskered mana tee and learn that it was this unlovely creature that medieval sailors called a mermaid Think how fascinating it would be
WHITE HOUSE WOOS UNIONS IN PLANK,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/18/archives/white-house-woos-unions-in-plank-offers-platform-draft-that-lauds.html,MIAMI BEACH Aug 17  The Resolutions Committee of the Republican National Con vention began tonight consid eration of a platform designed by the White House and con taining a strong appeal to or ganized labor The draft that was placed before the 105member com mittee not only praised the record of labor unions but omitted any support for right towork laws as contained in the 1968 Republican platform The labor plank committee sources said was designed to enhance President Nixons hopes of cutting deeply into la bor voting blocs which tradi tionally have supported Demo cratic nominees Meanwhile the Republican National Committee approved a delegate plan for the partys 1976 convention that would expand the conventions mem bership and increase the rela tive political power of the smaller more conservative states The plan will go to the 1972 convention next week for final approval [Details on Page 36] In the platform proceedings Representative Silvio O Conte of Massachusetts chairman of the subcommittee that had ju risdiction over the labor plank termed the plank fair and predicted that it would pre vail before the full committee but he acknowledged that con servatives on the committee planned to fight for a right towork provision The platform proposed by the White House is more lib eral than the views of the com mittee overseeing it But Rep resentative Peter H B Freling huysen of New Jersey said This is the Presidents par ty and most conservatives here indicated that they were willing to give Mr Nixon what he wanted on the issues Draft Read to Panels Last night the seven sub committees met in executive sessions In each session a copy of the platform draft more than 100 pages was brought in in a red binder and that section pertaining to the subcommittees jurisdiction was read to the members They were not permitted to examine the document Ernest L Wilkinson of Pro vo Utah a member of the Conte subcommittee said We only heard 17 pages of the platform read I am a lawyer and I like to see something in print If there is not a right towork provision elsewhere in the platform I intend to offer one before the full committee Section 14B of the TaftHart ley law gives states the au thority to pass laws prohibit ing unions from requiring all persons covered under work contracts to belong to the un ion Repeal of that section has been sought repeatedly by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Or ganizations Republican oppo sition in Congress has been an important factor in defeating repeal The AFLCIO on the rec ommendation of its president George Meany has refused to endorse either Presidential can didate In the past that en dorsement has gone to the Dem ocratic nominee One reason for Mr Meanys opposition to Sena tor George McGovern the Dem ocratic nominee was that he voted against repeal of Section 14B during the Johnson Ad ministration The 1965 Republican plat form contained this language Basic rights of some workers guaranteed by law are inade quately guarded against abuse We will assure these rights through vigorous enforcement of present laws including the TaftHartley Act and the Lan drumGriffin Act and the addi tion of new protections where needed This was generally in terpreted as a stand for right towork laws Yesterday the National Right  to  Work Committee based in Washington asked the platform committee to adopt an even stronger plank this year and a number of members on the committee expressed their support The committee was expected to approve the platform pretty much as proposed by the White House The draft sets out in detail President Nixons stand on the issues and contains praise for the Presidents record Efforts were being made in the committee to make the plank against busing to achieve school desegregation somewhat stronger than proposed by the White House The draft en dorses President Nixons pro posed antibusing legislation and contains some of the Presidents language on the subject Some members however pro posed adding language that would say that a constitutional amendment against busing should be considered if the leg islation should fail Senator Rob ert P Griffin of Michigan in testimony today endorsed that move The National Womens Po litical Caucus seeking a strong plank on womens rights ap peared to have been defeated today in its effort for a pro abortion statement despite plea for such a provision by Jill Ruckelshaus wife of Wil liam D Ruckelshaus adminis trator of the Environmental Protection Agency The main controversy in volved a proposal for compre hensive public and private child care programs Representative Margaret M Heckler of Massa chusetts was leading a fight to have such day care programs include women of all economic levels as well as the poor President Nixon vetoed a com prehensive day care bill voted by Congress The extraordinary care the Administration was taking in keeping the draft document confidential was shown last night in the subcommittee on responsive government The chairman of the Resolu tions Committee is Representa tive John J Rhodes of Arizona and the secretary is Mrs Anna Chennault widow of Maj Gen Claire L Chennault leader of the volunteer antiJapanese

PLATFORM HAILS G.O.P. TAX RECORD OF ‘SOUND REFORM’,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/20/archives/platform-hails-gop-tax-record-of-sound-reform-says-party-bars.html,MIAMI BEACH Aug 19The proposed economic plank of the Republican platform says that the Nixon Administration has already brought about sound tax reform and that the party will reject deceitful reforms that would raise the taxes of millions of middleincome Americans The Resolutions Committee of the Republican National Convention completed work On the partys 24000word platform at 2 AM today The convention itself will open here on Monday Between 30 and 40 per cent of Democratic voters now say that they will abandon Senator George McGovern and will vote to reelect President Nixon according to surveys made by the Gallup organization and Daniel Yankelovich Inc [Details on Page 42] Strong Appeal to Labor The committee finished the platform after turning back attempts by conservatives to insert a righttowork provision The document makes a strong appeal to organized labor By midafternoon the full text of the document had not been releasedonly sections on the economy defense and foreign affairs An amendment to oppose repeal of Section 14B of the TaftHartley Act which gives states the right to enact laws against work contracts that require all workers covered to belong to a union was defeated by a 2to1 margin The White House which had lobbied against the righttowork provision after having written a strong prolabor plank is seeking to cut deeply into labor union voting blocs that traditionally have supported the Democratic ticket Issue in Campaign The language on tax reform was considered significant because that issue had been heated one in the Presidential campaign Senator George McGovern the Democratic Presidential nominee has charged that highincome individuals and corporations are receiving faVored tax treatment and he proposed a fairly radical income redistribution plan The Republican platform says that as a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 and the Revenue Act of 1971 95 million lowincome Americans ware removed from the Federal income tax rolls that persons in the lowest income tax bracket will pay 82 per cent less than they would have paid without the new laws and that some moderateincome families will pay less This is sound tax reform the kind that more equitably spreads the tax burden and avoids incentivedestroyin tax levels which would cripple the economy and put people out of work the document says We reject the deceitful tax reform cynically represente as one that would soak the rich but in fact one that would sharply raise the taxes of millions of families in middleincome brackets as well We reject as well it continues the lavish spending promised by the opposition party which would more than double the present budget of the Government This too would cause runaway inflation or force heavy increases in personal taxes Stronger Antibusing Stand The committee also strengthened the partys stand against busing to achieve school desegregation The draft document written largely by the White House gave support to President Nixons antibusing legislation The committee added a section saying that a constitutional amendment against busing should be considered in the event the legislation fails The document says the party is irrevocably opposed to busing for racial balance The Democratic platform adopted here in July supports busing as one tool for achieving school desegregation It further wrote into the document language giving qualified support to federally funded day care centers for women of various economic levels plank sought by the National Womens Political Caucus A proabortion plank sought by the caucus was not proposed in the committee which had been meeting since Thursday in closed and guarded sessions in the Fontainebleau Hotel The day care plank pushed by Representative Margaret M Heckler of Massachusetts says We believe the primary responsibility for a childs care and upbringing lies with the family However we recognize that economic and other reasons often require that parents seek assistance in the care of their children To help meet this need we favor the development of public and private voluntary comprehensive quality day care services which would be federally assisted but locally controlled with the requirement that those participating will pay their fair share of the costs according to their ability Act Was Vetoed The subject was controversial here because President Nixon had vetoed day care legislation enacted by the Democratic Congress The platform thus added this sentence We oppose proposals which are illconsidered incapable of being administered effectively and which would heavily engage the Federal Government in this area Committee sources said that although a number of changes had been made in the sessions most were of a minor nature and the platform which will be presented to the convention on Tuesday Representative Peter II B Frelinghuysen of New Jersey said an attempt had been made in committee but defeated to tone down the tough language on amnesty without changing the substance The plank apparently as written in the White House and adopted by the committee says We are proud of the men and women who have borne the burden of fighting a difficult and unpopular war Here and now we reject all proposals to grant amnesty to those who have broken the law by evading military service We reject the claim that those who fled are more deserving or obeyed a higher morality than those next in line who served in their places The preamble and section on foreign affairs and defense were laced with accusations that the Democratic party had been taken over by a radical clique and implying that the Democrats would carry out an act of betrayal in Vietnam Mr Frelinghuysen said that nevertheless the committee had succeeded in taking out some of the strong language In thedraft copy Seeks More Tax Reform The platform says the party will continue efforts at tax reform through such means as local property tax relief and prudent fiscal management Ov erall however it rejects drastic changes in the tax laws On the general state of the economy the platform argues that the Administrations poli cies have worked and the nations economic growth is once again strong and steady On controls it says We have already remoVed some temporary controls tin wages and prices and will remove them all once the economic distortions spawned in the late 1960s are repaired We are determined to return to An unfettered economy at the earliest possible moment On deficit spending the platform blames the Democratic Congress for inflationaiy spending beyond a full employment budget Because of its present procedures and particularly because of its present political leadership Congress is not haridling Federal fiscal policies in a responsible manner it says We pledge vigorous efforts to reform the Congressional budgeting process In a new conference late today Representative John JRhodes of Arizona the chairman said the righttowork issue caused the most controversy in the committee He saidit was debated for about an hour after which a righttowork amendment offered by John M Wells a delegate from West Virginia was defeated by voice vote Among other proposals defeated were a series beingpushed by Common Cause a peoples lobby for governmental reform
Republicans:,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/20/archives/same-site-same-cast-same-script-same-republicans.html,MIAMI BEACHA special air of unreality hung over one of the most unreal of American cities all last week Signs proclaimed that a national political convention was to be held here A vanguard of recognizable political types gathered in the garish hotels for preliminary meetings Reporters wrote stories and television took pictures But everyone knew that when the Republican party officially opens its exercise in selfcongratulation tomorrow nothing unexpected is going to happenalmost literally nothing About 2700 delegates and alternates will be on hand and there is a very real chance that they will not be asked to make a single decision The party is not assembling to choose new leaders much less to debate any such choice The old leaders Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew will do very nicely thank you Satisfaction with the winning team of 1968 blanketed Miami Beach as heavily as the midAugust humidity True two Republican Congressmen of some ambition Paul Pete McCloskey of California and John Ashbrook of Ohio checked into town early but they seemed very nearly as obscure now as eight months earlier when they tried to challenge the President in the primaries from the left and right respectively to no real effect The absence of suspense in the main function of the conventionto pick the national ticketis the curse of the oneterm incumbent President Unless he is prepared to dump his running mate as Dwight Eisenhower considered doing once and Franklin Roosevelt actually did twice he faces a convention that is little more than an elaborate overstaged rally hard torouse to enthusiasm much less excitement The Democratic meeting in the same hall six weeks ago was chaotic unmanaged and seemingly endless but it was alive So were the Republican conventions of 1952 and 1964 when the intraparty competition was fierce But for Richard Nixon and his contented colleagues this week can only be a time to dramatize their achievements and their leadership before a national television audience All last week the Platform Committee and its subdivisions listened to the pleas and demands of those who somehow believed A that mention of a subject or stand in a partys national platform moves it toward realization and B that the Republican convention might accept some ideas that the Nixon Administration had not already stamped prime or at least choice I hope the lobbyists are getting well paid for their efforts one Republican observed Itll be strictly coincidence if any of this gets into the platform Thats already at the printers Key platform planks announced Friday supported the Presidents terms for ending the Vietnam war called for a strong defense establishment and rejected amnesty for war service resisters The proposed platform which will be presented to the convention this week for expected approval charged that the Democratic party has been seized by a radical clique which scorns our nations past and would blight her future Some of the language was tougher than that used by the President There was still the possibility however of a floor fight The Republicans do not have formal machinery for submission of a minority report to the convention as the Democrats do Some features of the Republican system are easier than the Democrats some are harder A single member can propose an amendment on the floor if he is bold enough and can get recognition But to force a rolicall on a proposition that lacks committee sanction such presumptuous Republican must have the backing of a majority of six state delegations something not lightly achieved Nonetheless there may be floor debates at least on such matters as abortion government reform and abolition of the union shop From the evidence of the past week the Republicans also had no intentions of shifting the power structure of their party Twice their committees rejected a new formula for the 1976 convention that would have rewarded the larger states with influence more commensurate with their Republican voting strength than they have enjoyed over the past two dozen years Adopted for ratification by the convention was a new plan that will expand the size of the next national meeting by 50 per cent or more thus at least in theory opening up the party Butthe power pattern remains basically little changed the smaller more conservative and more insecure states carrying more weight than their GOP votes seem to justify During the debate Charles T Lanlgan the New York state Republican chairman argued that the plan which eventually was adopted would freeze the Republican party into the same sectional politics that have torn us apart in the past But Ben J Clayburgh of North Dakota charged that the liberal alternativeplan was an effort to stack the deck against rural America The only startling moment of the convention may be in the street rather than in the hall The ragged collection of young demonstrators that has become a fringe feature of the nominating process gathered in Miami last week making the customary ominous noises They even publicized their planned activities in a 24page Tactical Manual complete with maps and photographs On Wednesday evening when the President and Vice President are scheduled to bring the convention to its climax with acceptance speeches the demonstrators will try to block their arrival by occupying the streets adjoining the hall The Rev Daniel J Berrigan and David T Dellinger told a news conference in New York last week that the Wednesday demonstration would line the road with admissible evidence of the Administrations war crimes Father Berrigan who did not plan to go to Miami himself said the protesters would hold up to their [the nominees] eyes burning children death masks limbs weeping faces photos puppets making the street a gauntlet of shame But the police and Secret Service have been preparing for weeks for possible trouble WARREN WEAVER Jr
‘Right to Life’ has a message for New York State legislators,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/20/archives/-right-to-life-has-a-message-for-new-york-state-legislators-the.html,The Church of St Margaret Mary is a not very imposing in fact somewhat dilapidated compound of structures on the western edge of Albany Outside the church auditorium and gymnasium a sign promises bingo every Monday at 8 PM On a recent Saturday a few of the bingo tables had been set up anyway in a hollow square about midway between the two gymnasium basketball hoops Around the tables were 23 men and 12 women average middleclass ladies and gentlemen none of whose names or faces would register at first with the average newspaper reader or television watcher With the exception of one man who arrived wearing a sandwich boardThou Shalt Not Kill it said on one side and Abortion Kills Babies on the othernone would have even stood out in the normal Monday night bingo game Two of the men wore turned collars marking their religious vocations only one was Roman Catholic however and the others were quietly and conservatively dressed most of the men in slacks and sports jackets and the women in skirts of more than Almost all of those around the tables were from suburban or rural areas Only one was under 30 None were black none were Hispanic The names of a few proclaimed a German Irish Italian or Polish heritage but nothing appeared in the voices mannerisms or faces of any of the 35 men and women that indicated their ethnic backgrounds Agreeing over principles they spoke in quiet moderated tones even when they disagreed about details ending their daylong session with a recitation of the Lords Prayer And after the men folded up the bingo tables and the women put away the folding chairs there was nothing to indicate that the church gymnasium had been the scene of the coming together of one of the toughestand least expectedpolitical monoliths ever to demonstrate to the New York Legislature the essential accountability of the democratic processor as one opponent put to intimidate the hell of it What had taken place in the gymnasium of the Church of St Margaret Mary was the annual caucus of New York States Right to Life organization an unchartered informally organized coalition of anywhere from 50 to 70 even they arent surechapters allied in one purpose Repeal of New York States permissive abortion law and the restorationof the prior restrictive legislation which permittedabortion only when necessary to save the life of the mother And among those who know their wayaround the back corridors of the Capitol whether they were proor antiabortion or as those attending the caucus would have put it antior prolife there was a consensus that this organization the Right to Life Committee of New York State had done the unprecedented when it turned the Legislature around in only two years breaking down proabortion majority that had taken well over four years to build Only Governor Rockefellers veto the statute they muscled through the Assembly and State Senate last May has kept the permissive abortion law in effectand the primary purpose of the meeting in the St Margaret Mary gymnasium was to do something about that At the head of the table sat or more often stood Edward Golden a 37yearold construction foreman from the town of Brunswick just outside of Troy in Rensselaer County Golden is a hardhat an attentive father of four sons and a daughter whom he and his wife Catherine are rearing in a large nicely maintained ranch house in the suburbs The Goldens were sweethearts at Catholic Central High School in the area They graduated from separate collegeshe from Holy Cross she from St Rose College  and then he spent three years as an Air Force officer navigating KC 97 refueling tankers in the Strategic Air Command before returning to Troy and joining his familys construction business The Goldens are in regular attendance at Our Lacy of Victory Church in Troy but not so loyal to the church that they send their children to its school which they consider inferion to the local public schools And to make sure the public schools stay as good as they are Mrs Golden mounted a successful campaign for the Brunswick School Board two Unlike almost all the others attending the Right to Life meeting Ed Golden could claim some experience in conventional politics He ran for Brunswick town councilman as a Democrat several years ago but was the only member of his ticket to lose As sort of a payoff for losing his description the winning administration named him to the County Sewer Commission a post paying 500 year It wasnt solely a political appointment however Im the only member of the commission with engineering experience Golden points out Also about that hardhat Two years ago the construction firm which Golden founded in 1968 got squashed when the Penn Central went broke our big account was with the railroad and I just decided to let someone else worry about meeting payrolls During business hours tterefore Ed Golden can be found scrambling around a housing project being built in Albany and as much out of touch as he can possibly be with both the Legislature a few blocks away and the more than 500000 members that the New York Right to Life Committee now claims After 5 however its another matter as Golden runs the committee from a telephone on his kitchen table which is where he started the movement late in 1965 just after the first liberalized abortion proposal drafted by a committee of the American Law Institute was submitted to the Legislature Many proabortionists argue that Right to Life was begun and is currently maintained by the Roman Catholic Church itself but Ed Golden emphatically denies any church participation in founding the movement They didnt nudge us he says we nudged them For myself I had a feeling that society was going downhill that this ALI bill seemed to be a major step they were ready to take I wasnt a Galahad or Quixote but it seemed time to test the system to see if anything could be done to stop the drift and I found three others who felt the same way Ray OBrien who comes from Troy and is active now only as our treasurer and two others who are no longer active Anyhow we talked it over ourselves before we went anywhere near our churches and what we wanted from them was not direction or even support but information we could use in the fight And thats the way we have continued to operate I am not saying we havent accepted assistance from the churches in helping us organize or even political racesif it was offered in a prudent fashion but we are the last people to go to the churches and ask their help Golden and his early committee members didnt originate the Right to Life name An antiabortion group had already been formed in California under the title which comes from the preamble of the Declaration of Independence and is also embodied in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights Everyone has the right to life liberty and security of person But certainly the New York State committee is considered the strongest of all the state movements In addition to his chairmanship of the New York State Committee At our first meeting we all sat around the table the four of us and somebody said Who wants to be chairman Everybody else had a good reason for not being chairman but me Golden is also a director of the National Right to Life Committee which in its way is as loosely structured as the New York State group and like it exists primarily as a clearing house and coordinating arm of antiabortion movements in all the states The national group was founded in 1968 by Juan Ryan a New Providence NJ attorney who readily admits that although we have some pretty strong chapters the New York State committee is the one everybodys watching right now Theyve In its first three years of existence however New York State Right to Life was in Goldens words only a letterwriting operation It wasnt until the end of the third year 1968 that we began to get our feet wet in terms of lobbying Boy were we neophytes Here I was 33 and I had lived all my life in Rensselaer County right next to Albany and had never set foot in the Capitol What brought Golden to the Capitol in 1968 was the first legislative committee hearing on permissive abortion proposals and it was at this and subsequent hearings that NewYork State Right to Life coalesced into a movement The most active antiabortionspokesman in the state at thattime was Robert Byrn then 37yearold bachelor and professor of criminal law atFordham University Professor Byrn still sort of runs thelegal side of the movementand last December when he unsuccessfully challenged theabortion statute in the courts he was temporarily appointed in the Supreme Court of New York a guardian of all human fetuses between the fourth and 24th weeks of gestation scheduled to be aborted in New York City municipal hospitals I got into the aborticn issue when I started teaching criminal law in 1963 Professor Byrn said recently I decided to study it because at first everything I came across seemed to be proabortion Soon I found some other people who were also disturbed Dr Bernard Pasani of St Vincents Hospital and Charles Rice now on the faculty of Notre Dame were twoand we sort of formed our group Metropolitan Right to Life For years afterward we remained just a few people working mostly out of my hat There was no real membership list but from time to time we picked up a few more members Jean Head a nurse joined us and then a rabbi David E Hollander and then Ann OGrady who later formed her own outfit the Alliance Against Abortion Anyway I got to know Ed Golden and most of us got to know each other in Albany Wed be waiting to testify and somebody else would show up on our side and wed start trading phone Despite public conception of Right to Life as an almost entirely Roman Catholic movement not all those who early opposed abortion liberalization were Roman Catholics In addition to Rabbi Hollander and several other Orthodox Jewish spokesmen the movement picked up substantial support when Bruce Duncanan Episcopalian formed Citizens Concerned for the Unborn the first and still one of the largest of 10 antiabortion organizations on Long Island Still as both its supporters and detractors point outRight to Life was onlyminor political force until 1969 when the abortion issuefinally broke out of committeeand onto the Assembly floor The next year an unrestricted bill abortion for anyreason up to 24 weeks wasintroduced not by the abortion proponents but by SenateMajority Leader Earl Brydgesone of the chief opponents of abortion This represented nota switch on Senator Brydgess part but rather a parliamen tary maneuver designed to consolidate opposition to abortion along the broadest possible lines It didnt work and even though Senator Brydges voted against the bill he introduced this is the one that passedwith an emotional lastminute scene involving a switch after the roll call by George M Michaels Assemblyman from a predominantly Catholic area in Auburn I realize Mr Speaker that I am terminating my political career Michaels said after the bill appeared to have been barely defeated but I cannot in good conscience sit here and allow my vote to be the The 1970 defeat marked the coming of age of Right to Life Until then most of the formal opposition to legal abortion had been mounted primarily within the Catholic Church itself and three Assemblymen were reported to have changed their votes after they were denounced in churches by their parish priests After the Legislatures vote Terence Cardinal Cooke appealed on behalf of the bishops of New York State for a gubernatorial veto The bill was signed however to take effect July 1 1970 Thats when we realized wed been steamrollered Ed Golden feels The people who had been conducting the campaign in favor of abortion had done their work in the corridors of the Legislature and we hadnt Wed been conducting an education campaign counting on that to win the issue but now we knew wed have to roll up our sleeves and really become political The first caucus of New York State Right to Life was held in 1970 at St Pius Church in Loudonville just outside of Albany and even Golden was surprised to see delegates from fully organizedand workingchapters of Right to Life representing areas from the top to the bottom of the state Up in Champlain for example John Middleton a sociologist at the State University College at Plattsburgh had organized a chapter of 80 workers which is fantastic for a town of that size Golden feels and had gone on to set up several more chapters in northern New York Down in Brooklyn a tax lawyers wife Mrs Marie Bianco without any coordination with statewide Right to Life had been forging a potent structure in the base ment of her Bay Ridge home which she describes as a hardcore nucleus of 90 or 95 people and theyre not all Catholics eitherDr Marion Matics the pastor of Christ Episcopal Church and my next door neighbor is a member of our board as well as thousands of supporters One of those at Mrs Biancos first meeting was Ann OGrady the wife of a plumber in the Bronx Mrs OGrady formed Alliance Against Abortion an organization which furnishes speakers to whatever groups ask to hear the Right to Life point of view We do most of our speaking in living rooms but well go wherever theyll have us and well talk to anybody wholl listen Those in our audiences have ranged from professional abortionists down to rosaryrattling Catholics Basically Right to Life speakers rely on a visual argument buttressing their contention that the unborn child is alive and entitled to the protection of the laws with still photographs of fetuses and film strips It has been estimated that there are more than 10000 copies of the organizations packet of fetus pictures in circulation throughout the state and the film presentation has been shown in hundreds of school and college auditoriums For those who wish to go further there are several handbooks which the organization distributes for less than 1 per copy and dozens of free pamphlets Right to Life based its campaign on one issue to the disregard of all others As Golden explains To our way of thinking any legislator who doesnt respect human life and protect it at all stages and despite infirmities is unfit to sit as a representative and we would look for a man to replace him and it didnt matter to us whether he was a Democrat Republican or independent or how he voted on any other issues The frankness of this approach brought not a little surpriseeven from proabortionists with a lot more experience in politics The Right to Lifers changed the ball game Alfred Moran executive vice president of Planned Parenthood said recently They didnt merely furnish the legislators with their information and point of view and ask them to consider the question on the merits they brought it down to a question of political survival telling each man If you dont stand with us on the abortion law well have your scalp Interestingly enough however now that the Legislature has reversed itself it is the proabortionists who have begun looking for scalpsand attempting to preserve legislators who opposed repeal A proabortion organization Coalition for a Free Choice raised 18000 on behalf of nine candidates in the recent primaries The seven Democrats it backed in New York City won but not the two proabortion Republicansboth incumbents it supported upstate In the upcoming election another drive has been launched by Betty Fried an a founder of the National Organization for Women on behalf of proabortionists So far however there seems to be this fundamental difference in tactics between the two factions The antiabortionists send campaign workers and canvassers the In any case according to Golden Right to Life is ex pecting to have to battle a revitalized and more militant proabortionist movement in the next session of the Legislature In 1970 the first scalp that Right to Life went afterand gotwas that of Michaels who had correctly predicted his political demise when he provided the vote necessary to pass the proabortion bill Normally one of the Democratic partys heavier vote getters Michaels first lost the endorsement of his areas party leaders and then was beaten in the primary by a political novice John Rossi who conceded that the issue had been framed by the way Michaels voted on the abortion bill In the general election Michaels running with Liberal endorsement fin Also defeated in the primary was a threeterm State Senator D Clinton Dominick of Newburgh who had sponsored the reform bill in the Upper House A number of urban Assemblymen Chester J Straub of Brooklyn William F Passannante of Manhattan Alexander Chananau of the Bronx and Arthur O Eve of Buffalo found themselves faced with unexpectedly strong primary challenges The effort didnt end in the primaries either In the general election Assemblyman Vincent R Balletta Jr a Republican suddenly found his Port Washington district plastered with posters reading Abort Balletta and whether it was Right to Life or the Catholic Church or the Conservative party which took up the issue Balletta was upset Interestingly enough the man who defeated him in 1970 Irwin Landes was also outspokenly proabortion Mrs Eleanor Tenner the secretary of the state committee who described herself as the coordinator of the antiBalletta campaign explains In loco parenium We got together a group of women to picket him wherever he went on his campaign telling everybody who came to hear him that Balletta was proabortion We knew Landes was too and we didnt expect him to vote for life  he had made his commitment What we wanted to do was get rid of the Republican legislator who had gotten fairly well up the seniority ladder At least Landes as a freshman wouldnt have as much of a voice in the Legislature And it worked We beat Balletta by 6000 votes and after two years of Landes now the Republicans have put up a candidate [Clinton Martin Jr] whos pledged to vote against abortion Sometimes you have to take a step backward to take two steps for Under this kind of pressure the Legislature came closer to repealing the abortion bill in the 1971 session than had at first appeared and in the end the repeal bill was kept in committee for the lack of only one senatorial vote There were no legislative elections in 1971 but Right to Life kept plugging redoubling its efforts in Albany where Golden was coordinating efforts to bring at least one antiabortion group to the Capitol each legislative day Wed tap our organizations for a busload or if they couldnt manage that a few carloads and suggest that they set it up as a sightseeing trip to Albany and we told them when the Legislature was going to be in session and the best times to be there and we asked those who came not just to flood the halls and corridors but to be sure to stop in and see their own Senators and Assemblymenand if possible to see one or Apparently the campaign was effective Early in the session Governor Rockefeller announced he would veto any repeal of the law permitting abortions an act interpreted by both sides as an effort to take the pressure off the legislators assuring them they could vote for repeal if they had to with the assurance that they would not be contributing to an actual repeal The Governor did indicate he would support a cut in the time limit permitted for abortion from 24 to 18 weeks after conception but this was quickly rejected by Right to Life people as an attempt to compromise on principle Besides they were beginning to anticipate victory in the Legislature an accomplishment which Golden felt would put the rest of the nation on notice that New Yorkers werent happy with this socalled model law and that our movement was getting somewhere A week before the repealer passed the Assembly andeven before a letter fromPresident Nixon to Cardinal Cooke disclosed the Presidents opposition to abortionthe Right to Life campaigners felt they had the votes inboth Houses In all eightAssemblymen who had supported the repeal of abortion prohibitions switchedpositionsand one State Senator Paul Bookson of Manhattan It wasnt the pressure that changed my vote Senator Bookson maintains but rather my feeling that the 24week period is too long Senator Bookson said he felt that way in 1970 toowhen the bill was first passedbut that the Governors announced intention to veto the1972 bill gave him an opportunity to express his opposition knowing that he wouldnot kill the abortion principleThey had a lot of women who ran around the halls inAlbany he said but theydidnt have any influence on me There is no Right to Lifegroup that I know of in myarea in Lower Manhattan Perhaps not but there is onein upper Brooklyn and Senator Booksons district has just been reapportioned to include a part of that areaThe campaign culminated on May 9 when the Assemblyvoted 79 to 68 for the repealer and on May 10 when the Senate concurred 30 to27 That evening after thevotes were tallied Golden and Jack St Leger Right toLifes Hudson Valley chairman decided on a hunch to introduce themselves to LieutGov Malcolm Wilson whohad presided over the State Senate debate According toGolden Wilson leaned backin his office chair and said You people have done onehell of a job on us this year and that was the nicest compliment he could have paid us What Golden and St Leger wanted from the Lieutenant Governor was his help in arranging an interview with Rockefeller before the Governor acted on the bill Wilson promised his assistance but on May 12 without seeing the Right to Life spokesmen the Governor vetoed the bill noting that the extremes of personal vilification and political coercion brought to bear on members of the Legislature raise serious doubts that the votes to repeal the reform represented the will of a majority of the people of New York State The paragraph in the Governors veto message that most upset the Right to Life people however was its conclusion I do not believe it right for one group to impose its vision of morality on an entire society Neither is it just or practical for the state to dictate the innermost personal beliefs and conduct of its citizens I read that as an attack on us as Catholics said Mrs Johanna Jankowski chairman of the Ulster County Right to Life chapter and I resent the Governors implication that cant show independent thought without the Pope telling me what I should do Golden himself takes a more moderate position He will concede that prohibition of abortion is in fact an attempt to impose a standard of morality upon society But isnt that what the Civil War was about too Didnt the North impose a standard of morality on the South then and that issue was slavery were talking about murder It was with this background that Right to Life convened at St Margaret Marys Church in Albany Numerically at least it appeared that the organization had lost some of its 1971 strength Only about 20 of the 50 to 70 constituent chapters were represented by the 35 delegates who attended But there was also the man who came wearing the sandwich board Nobody appeared to recognize him when he entered the gymnasium a few minutes after the caucus started and after removing his sandwich board he took a seat a few feet away from the delegates around the tables Except on one occasion he kept out of the discussion although he raised his hand to vote along with everyone There were a number of topics Ed Golden wanted to raise at this caucus most notably the basic reorganization of the State Committee which had been operating since its inception without either a state charter or a formal constitution We have so many people so many activities he had been telling his chapter leaders that if we dont apply guidelines it could all get out of hand and that to me would be more bothersome than taking on Rocky next year He also was looking toward the establishment of an office for the organization somewhere off his kitchen table and eventually the appointment of a professional executive director As the meeting convened however he thought it more prudent to begin by announcing more or less as a symbol of what Right to Life had accomplished the presence of a reporter covering the session The disclosure brought some surprise because of the widespread feeling among Right to Life leaders of bias against them in the press Their complaints are not so much of misrepresentations although one Long Island delegate did complain that one newspapers entire coverage of one of his recent wellattended rallies consisted of a picture of five proabortion pickets but rather of what many believed to be deliberate underrepresentation in the news columns Golden The early lack of press coverage was really a blessing in disguise because it made us all work harder We were the kids with the complexes we were fighting an uphill battle and at least nobody sat around and read their press clippings Lucille Buffalino the chairman of Suffolk Countys Celebrate Life is even more emphatic The media helped our cause by ignoring us she believes Because they didnt give us coverage nobody knew what stage we were in or how much momentum we were building and so we were able to surprise An Oneida representative disclosed that her group was considering a boycott of a paper in its area They wont give our position any kind of representation My sons a paper boy for them though and I know how upset they get when they lose even one subscriber so what we are thinking of doing is boycotting them for one week out of each month When they start losing customers theyll modify their policy The boycott idea seemed attractive as a weapon against others besides the press Dr Ada Ryan an emergencyroom specialist who is president of an organization called Doctors and Nurses against Abortion suggested that members boycott obstetricians who perform abortions Not only obstetricians Mrs Buffalino chimed in but all those who support abortions I stopped going to my dentist I switched drugstores and stopped going to a bookstore At no time in the nearly six hours of caucus discussions did the question of Roman Catholic Church policy come up Although he has never checked to see who is Catholic and who isntfrankly we dont give a damn Ed Golden estimates that 85 per cent of Right to Life members are Roman Catholics A year ago though Id have said 95 per cent and that basically their opposition to abortion comes from the teachings of the church What Golden and the other leaders of the organization deny repeatedly and vociferously however is that the church exercises any control or direction in Right to Life People say to me When you talk to the Cardinal   Ed Golden says and in fact Ive never even seen the Bishop Weve made a point of divorcing this from the church In the last session somebody suggested bringing Bishop Sheen up for a communion breakfast with the legislators I said Id much rather have a bar mitzvah on the Capitol steps It would be just too easy to get into bed with the church Right to Life family Golden also makes the point that Right to Life does not as an organization endorse the churchs prohibition on contraception There are Right to Life leaders who get wound up in conversation and denounce abortion and contra ception almost interchangeably But the organization itself has refused to take a stand against even the intrauterine device which is generally considered a form of contraception although it kills the embryo after it is fertilized and is therefore essentially an abortive agent Dur ing the caucus one delegate did suggest that Right to Life record an opposition to the IUD but he was reminded firmly of the official position that abortion takes a life contraception only prevents it The one Roman Catholic priest attending the caucus raised his eyebrows when the IUD point was raised but continued packing his pipe in tactful silence The Rev Zachary Grant of the Capuchin order said he was attending the caucus to back up Mrs Eleanor Martin the representative of the Province of St Mary an order of Catholic laymen In the course of the day Father Grant made only one suggestion It related to an organizational question and it was rejected almost unanimously Although they reject church domination and control there were Right to Life delegates who seemed to feel that the church had let them down both in the drive to prevent abortions and to support Birthright a program to help mothers who reject abortions to deal with the problems of unwanted pregnancies While the church has no formal connection with Birthright the Archdiocese in New York has helped to run the program in the city Dr Ryan of Doctors and Nurses Against Abortion maintained that a New York Archdiocese directive also permitted Catholic nurses to prep patients for abortions and to treat the women postoperatively If they didnt have the nurses to prep these women they couldnt do the abortions she charged so the church is actually backing them right now In theory Birthright is also separate from Right to Life but in practice Right to Life provides most of the manpower for the Birthright phones and offices and Golden himself feels that the success of Right to Life is inseparably linked to Birthright We cant just be a nono organization he says We need social change and we cant turn our backs on these women as people have done in the past One way the law evolved was from this void I think were going to have to start caring a hell of a lot for other people and Birthright is our step in that direction Maintaining Right to Lifes separate identity from Birthright and from the church is not an easy task for the organizations leaders  at any level Professor Byrn located the Metropolitan Right to Life Committee right in the Madison Avenue headquarters of the Archdiocese of New York and held a press conference there after his temporary appointment as fetal guardian Just as the abortion people use Planned Parenthood as their first resource we tend to use the resources of the church he said And what was the state Right to Life Committee itself doing under the roof of St Margaret Mary Church The answer came easily At a pinnacle of its success Right to Life was also broke and the church gymnasium was free However there was an inconsistency in the scheduling that went even beyond the locale The caucus was being held on a Saturday when none of the three Orthodox rabbis on the committees board of directors could attend There was one Protestant clergyman though the Rev Lester Messerschmidt pastor of St Luke Lutheran Church in Dix Hills Huntington Township L I and he attempted to clarify for the Roman Catholic delegates the ecumenical problems they would have to deal with in order to spread their movement I have no hangups in joining a group basically Roman Catholic in membership but you have to understand there are Protestant people who have Lets be frank about it there are some Protestant ministers who will not come to St Margaret Mary Church to a meeting with a Catholic group Mr Messerschmidt was ordained in the Missouri Synod the most conservative of the branches of American Lutheranism and the only one which has taken an ecclesiastical stand against abortion However he warned that while Right to Life would not be able to convert the whole area of Protestantism to the cause we have to reach more people of Protestant persuasion so that we dont get clobbered again and again by the charge that this movement is the Catholic Church attempting to foist its ideas on the community Another approach suggested was the establishment of separate organizations divided along religious lines but coordinated under a Right to Life umbrella Joseph Cahill of Alliance Against Abortion led the argument for this People want to be with their own he said They just arent going to come to a Catholic church to hold their meetings Frank Zanchelli the Dutchess County chairman led those who argued that the organization should continue to function ecumenically and nondenominationally I think wed go backwards if we split he said I admit that we have to bust the stereotype that exists in the public mind but I think we have to stay with the single Right to Life and get away from the churcheven when it costs us The issue was not formally decided and was left to the local chapters themselves either to attempt to form pilot programs among Protestants and Jews or to continue to operate nondenominationally The Right to Life chapters were warned to guard against infiltration of their movement either by actual under cover agents of proabortion organizations or as Middleton the vice president from Plattsburgh put it any volunteers who believe in abortion in those few cases Dr Middleton was talking about rape and incest and Right to Life opposes abortions even in these instances Golden says because human life has to stand in every instance You cant ask the unborn to pay with its life for the crime of somebody else Rape and incest came under the relative heading of old business at the caucus however The new business that Golden was finally able to bring forward for discussion was his request for an executive director someone who would be paid to be around full time and who would be authorized to pick up the phone and give an answer in a few minutes The problem lay in raising the money that would pay for an office an executive director and possibly a secretary There are no formal dues for New York State Right to Lifeeach group sends what it can to help out with the newsletter and the mailings Ed Golden saysand the same thing is true for many of the subsidiary organizations several of the chapters that do ask for nominal dues are not strict about collecting them There was also a nonmonetary objection to formal organization I would be very worried about an establishment exercising control of us a delegate said Communication and the exchange of ideas is great but if we get control and delegated authority everybody will get the idea that somebody else is doing all the work and therefore he doesnt have to Another representative agreed The more structure you have The debate on the issue the days most controversial was in full swing when it was interrupted by the man who came to the caucus wearing the sandwich board He had been raising his hand for recognition for some time and when finally called upon he said Sir I believe we should start all our meetings with little prayer I believe that would help a great deal After a short somewhat embarrassed silence it appeared that the fight had gone out of those on both sides and the issue was resolved with an agreement to go ahead with the planning for director and an office but not to go ahead in actually incurring the expenses until the question of their support could be discussed on the local level There were a few other resolutions introduced and passed unanimously to be sent to the national Right to Life organization One called for an appeal to President Nixon to give equal representation to the Right to Life position on any national commission dealing with population problems Another favored the right to life of all inmates of old age homes mental homes hospitals and prisons a declaration that could be interpreted as a stand againct both euthanasia and capital punishment Then the delegates got down to cases A resolution addressed to President Nixon asking that Rockefeller not be used for any position in the future because of his antilife stand passed with prolonged applause In short Golden said we are asking the President to leave Rocky to us in 74 First however would come the State Senate and Assembly elections and here Golden urged first priority for the support of the incumbent legislators who had voted to repeal the new permissive abortion law He urged discretion in opposing proabortion legislators however We cant take on all these candidates he said There are some we probably couldnt hit with a 10foot pole so we have to concentrate on the races where we have a good chance of defeating their man and electing ours We cant say we want 20 seats and only elect 8 because a year from now when we go back to the Legislature and shake our fingers and say were going to get them theyll laugh at us The life machine What were aiming for is a twothirds majority in each House Realistically I dont think we can come up with enough votes to get that But last year you didnt think realistically that we could turn the Legislature around this year did you one of the delegates interrupted No I didnt Ed Golden said so you never can tell With obvious satisfaction and candid appreciation he looked around at the 34 men and women sitting with him outside the square of bingo tables Were winners he said and I guess its time we started acting like winners Weve come a long way baby he concluded and although we still have a long way to go until the law is repealed Ill tell you one thing weve already accomplishedand when you think about it its not a small accomplishment Nobody says right to what when we call up any more
The White House watch over TV and the press,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/20/archives/the-white-house-watch-over-tv-and-the-press-media-watch.html,WASHINGTON D CWe of course dont take credit for the CBS Spectrum commentators the wide range of opinion on The New York Times OpEd Page White House aide Patrick J Buchanan says with smile but consider CBSs Spectrum Theyve got Jeffrey St John and Stan Evans on the right Stu Alsop in the middle and Murray Kempton and Nick von Hoffman on the left This is a balanced run of commentary which is a byproduct of the Vice Presidents criticism of the networks For three years Buchanan a pinkcheeked 33yearold hardline conservative who is close President Nixon and an influential member of the White House entourage has been orchestrating the Administrations unprecedented attack on the press He wrote Vice President Agnews 1969 speeches criticizing the television networks The Times and The Washington Post the speeches which opened the sluice gates More recently he has suggested that antitrust action may be necessary to force the network to produce the kind of news coverage and commentary wanted by the White House and has marshaled Administration forces in opposition to public television a campaign which resulted in Nixons veto this summer of a publicTV funding bill With that victory behind him the President it was said ordered a ceasefire in the White House battle with the press apparently for the duration of the 1972 Presidential campaign But the fact that there may be less public discussion of the press coming from the White House in the next few months does not mean Buchanan or anyone else in the White House entourage has changed his mind about the press My primary concern Buchanan told me when we talked one morning in his small quarters in the Executive Office Building across the street from the White House is that the President have the right of untrammeled communication with the American people When that communication is completed what he has had to say should not be immediately torn apart or broken down even before the American people have had a chance to make their own judgment about what he said The words untrammeled communication conjure up visions of Newspeak and Big Brother All regular television programs are suddenly canceled The President mysteriously materializes onthe screen He speaks aboutissues and problems that are soothing and he makes itseem oh so simple The dutiful mesmerized citizen listens and nods his head in agreement Then the president isgone and Marcus Welby is next Dutiful Citizen is ofcourse impressed with what the Leader has said and will vote for him in November No not at all answers Buchanan The President Buchanan said as we talked in his office is a unifying factor even if he is a politician as well as chief of state The people have a right to be informed and the President has a duty to inform them but the idea of the press playing the role of the loyal opposition is a lot of malarkey Who elected these gentlemen on television to have the right of instant rebuttal to a Presidential address Buchanan continued It is not Mr Sevareids views for example that represent a problem It is the fact that he alone has access nightly into 20 million American homes and there is no one to come in there and say that Mr Sevareid is wrong on this Brinkleys wrong on that Now thats a real question of power and it is a question that the networks dont confront But Buchanan has no hesitancy in confronting headon what he considers to be a major problem In an interview on public television earlier this year he said Youre going to find something done in the area of antitrust action if the networks continue to present what he looks upon as a single point of view on news broadcasts and in commentaries He told me that a better plan might be to challenge the Federal liof the five stationsowned by each of the networks The networks themselves are not licensed but each is entitled to own up to five stations and all three of the networks have the five outlets allowed them Buchanan however realizes how hard it is to challenge a television license success fully or get Congressional action on antitrust legislation so he plainly favors the use of pressure Through public speeches by officials from Vice President Agnew on down  generally written by Buchananand private complaints from top Nixon aides to the always nervous network executives the Administration has applied the pressure and not without some success Publicopinion polls show that the confidence of Americans in newspapers magazines and radio and television news is down sharply Reporters and editors are looking over their shoulders more often and politically sensitive stories and news broadcasts are frequently written with a view toward what the Administration reaction is likely to be Buchanan is still not happy with the media but he is pleased with the results of the White House campaign against the press limited though these results may be A remarkably confident matt with only three years of journalistic experience himself he has the assurance that comes with proximity and access to political power early in life Six feet tall and trim Buchanans pink cheeks are set off by dark eyes and black hair slicked back in a careful pompadour He is cleanshaven and does not have even the hint of sideburns He looks like the choirboy who made good and maybe has had little fun along the tooBuchanan talks rapidly in a flat voice with just a hintof a Southern accent And he is never at a loss for words when he is discussing his favorite subjectPresidents and the press Presidents have been feuding with the press ever since the United States was founded Some of the greatest PresidentsJackson Lincoln Wilson and the two Rooseveltswere excoriated in the press And Nixon is not the first President to hit back at the press What is unusual about the Nixon Administrations particularly strained relationships with the press is the high intensity and sustained nature of its attacks on the media The drumbeat of criticism directed by Buchanan began early in the Administration and continued after the initial political dividends resulting from it had long since been paid out Most Presidents have tried to make reporters editors and commentators their press agents In the 1960 campaign John F Kennedy assiduously buttered up Time magazine correspondents and editors because he felt that the magazines supportor at least its neutralitywas important to his election chances The attention given Time by Kennedy paid off in favorable stories but he never got the endorsement he wanted so badly When Lyndon B Johnson became President he told a group of reporters that he would make big men of them if they cooperated with him but Johnson never got any cooperation and his relations with the press were always as stormy as Nixons have been During his more than 25 years in public office Nixon has always thought he has received a bad press Everyone remembers his Youwont have Nixon to kickaroundanymore press conference after his defeat in the 1962 California gubernatorial election So when he organized his 1968 Presidential campaign Nixon decided to go directly to the people through paid television broadcasts and bypass reporters and commentators as much as possible He has continued that policy as President He has had few press conferences The President has correctly perceived that most Americans now get their first view of what is happening in the world and often their only view through television So it is not surprising that as the resident White House press critic Buchanan has concentrated his attacks on the television networks Buchanans principal media devils are the two major networksCBS and NBC He is much less concerned about ABC because the White House regards its senior anchorman and commentator Howard K Smith as a friend who is in the Presidents corner most of the time But listen to Buchanans views on CBS reporting They should sit right on top of the situation where they have someone like Mr Rather whos been identified as being antiNixon Dan Rather is the CBS White House correspondent Now let me give you just a single illustration Lets just assume hypothetically that David Schoumacher a CBS Washington correspondent is cov pathetic to McGovern So McGoverns got a fellow sympathetic to him presenting him to 20 million Americans each night on CBS And we have Mr Rather who for one reason or another is antiNixon and is presenting the President and his campaign to 20 million people Now elections in this country swing on 20 per cent of the voters tight elections on probably 4 or 5 per cent Now should we just sit back and say well thats just how the cookie crumbles we have someone who looks more at the negative side of what were doing and they have someone who looks more at the positive side of what theyre doing This is really a serious problem and it seems to me that the networks wont Buchanan and other White House aides are particularly upset by the coverage on television of the war in Vietnam and the Administrations policies regarding it Buchanan himself is most concerned about the way NBC covers the conflict With regard to the war in Vietnam Buchanan said there is a consistent bias in my judgment against American policy there on the part of the major networks When the United States went into Cambodia one of the networks had its reporter run around and catch two malingering Americans and the whole thrust of the report was whether they would go on this duty I think there is a focus on the negative in the war coverage Theres an exaggerated emphasis on the plight of the refugees The entire picture coming across there is al The worst reporting I see there is done by Phil Brady of NBC Buchanan went on to say Now there is one specific example I can give you that even NBC corrected A CBS reporter went into a village and indicated that the inhabitants had left and the enemy wasnt there and in order to ensure that the enemy didnt get the village the ARVN troops of the Souths Army of the Republic of Vietnam had burned it down That very night Brady came on and indicated that ARVN troops went in there and were so angered and bitter and frustrated that they burned thevillage The one story was that it was a tactical militarymaneuver and the other was that it was just almost a minor atrocity And the next night NBC apologized for the report You can say Brady made an error but given the guys bias about the war it is merely that Brady is an antiwar reporter White House TV ratings The networks of course vigorously disagree with Buchanans analysis of their reporting They maintain that they are merely reflecting what is going on in Vietnam and elsewhere And in so many news stories a political partisan like Buchanan sees what he wants to see in a Presidents actions and in the way they are reflected in the media Spokesmen for the networks tend to shrug off complaints such as those made by Buchanan as the kind of criticism expected from a partisan Our reporting really speaks for itself We make every effort to be objective We cover the news one spokesman for CBS said Another added We get the same kind of complaints from the Democrats Last February Hubert Humphreys people were denouncing David Schoumacher because he was reporting accurately that Humphreys campaign was going nowhere and that Humphrey and his aides knew it As for Dan Rather he is probably the bestknown correspondent whos ever covered the White House He does a very solid job But if you dont take the pabulum as they feed it to you at the White House they feel there is something very wrong with you In discussing George McGoverns decision to drop Thomas Eagleton from the Democratic ticket CBS commentator Eric Sevareid noted There is an ancillary lesson in the events of this past week They cast doubts on the NixonAgnew conviction that the socalled liberal press will always give the Democrats and McGovern in particular the benefit of the doubt It was the big liberal organs of the press that held McGoverns feet to the fire that scrutinized his White House aides for once seem to agree with Sevareid It is said that Nixons recent order to his aides to softpedal criticism of the press as the Presidential campaign heats up stems in part from a feeling within the White House that lately the press has been covering McGovern as hard as it covers Nixon Said one White House aide There is simply no reason to criticize the press at precisely the moment it has been doing such a good job of covering McGovern But in commenting on the White House election position first enunciated by Agnew in a speech at Portland Ore in July Buchanan noted This doesnt mean that some of us have abandoned or will abandon some of our cherished assumptions about the press We think we can win this one on the issues Any other line of attack would simply be diversionary and probably counterproductive Nobody in the White House suggests that the coolit approach during the campaign reflects any thing more than a tactical judgment of the moment or that ft involves any substantive decision about the merits or demerits of governmental attacks on the press and TV Among the television newsmen Bill Monroe Washington editor for NBCs Today show and former head of NBC News operations in Washington is considerably more alarmed about the White House attacks on the media than many of his colleagues are In speeches and articles Monroe has indicated that he feels if new restrictions are placed on television news the next target for restrictions such as arbitrary fairness rules will be newspapers themselves He argues for more freedom for television as a news medium protected by the First Amendment Buchanan of course dis If there were only three printing presses left in the whole United States Buchanan said then the people who owned and ran those presses couldnt simply print only those things they wanted to print and refuse to print the points of view they disagreed with Otherwise the whole basis of your democratic system would be undermined You would have then to have the Government require the printing presses to print all points of view conservative liberal whatever This is what these networks have got Theyve got control of essentially three giant complexes which enable inviduals to send comment at aninstants notice into 100 million homes And there are onlythree of them and so theyhave obligations that say The New RepUblic doesnt haveThose obligations have beenwritten in law and one of them is to be balanced andfair in their coverage I think it would be a disastrous situation if a group of individ uals who happen to get control of this CBS conglomerate for example could determine without any restrictions whatsoever precisely what came into your homes m the way of news and information The best solution if it could be brought about continued Buchanan would be whats happened to radio It has a huge band and all sorts of different stations and programs You can turn it on and listen to your own little white lie if you want to or you can listen to this program or that program This is a personal viewIm sure its not the Administration viewbut if there were 50 networks then you wouldnt have any problem at all If there are as many sources of news and information coming out of Washington on TV as there are in the press then you dont have any problem But Buchanan knows that the development of 50 television networks is not likely to happen soon even with the multichannel possibilities offered by cable television so he wants the networks to remedy what he sees as their bias problem by hiring more con Just as the networks have made a fairly successful effort in promoting blacks into positions of reporting news to give that particular understanding Buchanan said and just as they are beginning to promote women to positions of influence so perhaps it is time that they find some people who have a conservative or Republican orientation and promote them Buchanan believes however that fewer conservatives than liberals are attracted to journalism Conservatives he said take America as basically a good country It doesnt need a great deal of change in their judgment And the thing theyd like to be doingmost of them who are talented and intelligentis move into areas like business and finance And they make themselves a bundle of money But younger people who tend to be liberals show up in your journalism schools Buchanan is also concerned about what he calls the nationalization of the news in newspapers Although he considers the two major wire services The Associated Press and United Press International to be exemplary in their devotion to objective coverage of events he finds the spread of The Times and Washington PostLos Angeles Times news services alarming because he thinks their news stories tend to favor liberals over conservatives Each of these two supplementary services has about 350 clients and most major newspapers the country subscribe to one or both of them Nationalization of the news is not a very healthy thing said Buchanan It comes from a sort of laziness out on the local level where theres not a high measure of confidence and intelligence anyway You get offered a package from Washington or New York that is first rate in terms of quality and you tend to say lets use this Why do we need a guy covering the White House when we can pick this stuff up off The Times wire But Im really more concerned about The Post than The Times Because of its position in Washington it so directs the entire journalistic thinking here If I knew a lot of conservatives that had a hell of a lot of dough one of the best things that could happen to the city would be the revival of something as gutsy as but perhaps a little more responsible and more intellectual than the old Times Herald as a morning newspaper The Washington Times Herald was a conservative paper purchased by the Post in 1954 But unhappy as Buchanan is with The Times and The Post he keeps coming back to television You can yell and holler about the newspapers Buchanan concluded but you cant say they have to change because thats their prerogative to print what they want But in terms of power over the American people you cant compare newspapers to those pictures on television They can make or break a politician Its all over if you get chopped up on the networks You never recover The newspapers can beat the hell out of you and youve got no problem But you sit there and see somebody take you apart before 20 million people A native Washingtonian Catholic and one of nine children in the family of a successful public accountant Buchanan had a traditional Catholic education Gonzaga High School for boys in downtown Washington was followed by a cum laude bachelors degree in English and philosophy from Washingtons Georgetown University And then it was out into the world and a masters degree from the School of Journalism at Columbia University While in college Buchanan says he was most influenced by Thomistic philosophy the concepts of natural law and distributive justice and the writings of James Burnham Eric Hoffer and William Buckley On graduating from Columbia his to write a column like Buckleys After making what in retrospect was an ironic pass at a job with The Washington Post Buchanan went from Columbia to become a reporter with the conservative St Louis GlobeDemocrat But within a month and a half one of The Globe editorial writers quit and Buchanan got the job Ac tive in St Louis in the 1964 Barry Goldwater campaign for the Presidency Buchanan decided in 1965 that he had had enough of editorial writing I was having some trouble with the publisher he recalls and I also wanted to get into politics I looked around and decided that Nixon was about the only conservative Presidential possibility Conservative as the GlobeDemocrat was it was still not conservative enough for Buchanan He was a hardrock Goldwater conservative and the GlobeDemocrat always ended up being somewhat more moderate than Goldwater Buchanan noticed one day late in 1965 that Nixon was going to attend a reception in Belleville Ill across the river from St Louis He went to the reception and in his characteristically direct way told Nixon as he shook his hand in the reception line that he wanted to go to work for him Nixon asked him to send a resume to his law offices in New York Buchanan did and within a few weeks Nixon hired him Buchanan was just the kind of aide Nixon was looking for youngthen only 27bright and personable Nixon was building toward another try for the Presidency in 1968 and he was determined to give his staff look In January 1966 Buchanan packed his belongings in a convertible drove from St Louis to New York and went to work in a cubbyhole in Nixons law offices He was the first fulltime aide Nixon took on and for most of 1966 he served as a general factotum and allaround research assistant When the old man as Buchanan refers to Nixon crisscrossed the country in the fall of 1966 campaigning for Republican candidates for Congress and for state offices Buchanan was at his side carrying Nixons briefcase making sure the luggage got to the right hotel room doing some research on the keeping on the local newspapers and serving as press secretary Buchanan says that it was during the 1966 campaign that he first began to think about the way the press covers events As Nixon and Buchanan traveled the country one of Buchanans many chores was to take a telephone call first thing every morning from a Nixon secretary back in New York who had hurriedly read the major Eastern papers and listened to the television news and relayed to Buchanan the gist of the days political news Buchanan then passed the summary of the days news on to Nixon so that he would not be taken by surprise by some development that had not been covered by the local press During the Presidential campaign in 1968 Buchanan served as a press assistant and as a speech writer In Nixons New York headquar ters he helped set up a more elaborate daily survey of how the media were covering the campaign Nixon liked the daily press summary so much the when he entered the White House in January 1969 he made Buchanan a Special Assistant to the President and told Buchanan to provide him with a comprehensive news summary daily Nixon has seldom liked what he has read about himself in the newspapers his serious newspaper reading has generally been confined to the sports Rather than try to do the pressmonitoring job himself Buchanan hired five assistants whom he has supervised less and less as the news summary has become more and more routine Headed by Mort Allin a 31yearold former highschool history teacher in Janesville Wis who was active in the Young Republican Clubs effort for Nixon in 1968 the Buchanan assistants monitor the network television news programs and read The Associated Press and United Press International wires as well as 30 major newspapers from around the country every day and another 30 weekly and monthly magazines The offices of Allin and the two young men and two young women who work with him are across the hall from Buchanans in the Executive Office Building and filled with newspapers to be read stacks of clippings and long sheets of newsservice dispatches they look like an old fashioned newspaper morgue In an Administration which has cultivated the public impression that it is tightfisted with the taxpayers dollar there seems to be no lack of money available for monitoring the media Among Buchanans accouterments are expensive machines that tape news broadcasts and other publicaffairs programs on television so that they can be played back for whoever wants to watch them The result of all this listening watching clipping and collating is the 30to40page daily news summary which is put in a blue EyesOnlyforThe President leather folder on Nixons Oval Office desk by 8 every morning he is in Washington If he is out of town as he is about onethird of the time the summary goes by facsimile over telephone lines or via radio to wherever he is It even followed him to Peking and Moscow The EyesOnlyforThePresident business is nothing more than bit of White House mellerdrammer however About 100 copies of the summary are printed every day and it goes to all the principal White House aides other key officials in the Government and persons outside the Government including some at the Committee for the Reelection of the President Buchanan as proud of his product as any other editor likes to show it off to inquiring Washington reporters For the most part the summary is a straightforward bulletin version of what the networks the wire services the newspapers and magazines are reporting and analyzing Most of the items noted are news about the Government politics or foreign policy For example Sen Brooke wrote RN that US public housing projects may go broke unless RN nearly doubles his proposed subsidy to keep them running Presumably the Postal Service is no better with its White House deliveries than elsewhere and this probably was the first the President had heard of Brookes letter But the summary does not ignore the lighter side of the news LA Times piece on Presidential humor gives RN positive treatment says RNs humor seems to be surfacing more notes various RN quips such as outhouse question at news confer How wellread is this one of the worlds smallest but potentially most important newspapers There is evidence that items in the summary have prompted Presidential actions but there are also indications that Nixon reads the summary less today than when he was first in office in part because of the everincreasing pressure of work and in part because he may not be as concerned as he once was about what the media are saying about him now that he has made what he considers to be a good record in office Buchanan is not only spend ing less time overseeing the news summary which still is generally wellread by White House aides if not always by the President himself but he is also spending less time compiling drafts of answers for questions likely to be asked at Presidential press conferences Nixon has had far fewer press conferences than any other modern President so Buchanan is freer to write speeches and make his hard conservative views felt in policy areas Buchanan seems to be liked by H R Haldeman and John Ehrlichman Nixons two principal domesticpolicy advisers who are quite conservative themselves and by the President who remembers Buchanans yeoman work during the still dark and lonely days of 1966 and 1967 and appreciates his fierce loyalty Unlike many of the platoon of White House aides some of whom the President scarcely knows and seldom sees Buchanan has access to the Oval Office and is confident enough of his views to push them on to the President Nixon took him along to Peking and attended his wedding last year to Shelley Scarney a White House Buchanan for example was in the forefront of the White House aides who urged on the President the veto of the childcare legislation last winter Buchanan also spurred Nixon on to get into the controversy in New York over ultimately unsuccessful efforts to repeal an abortion bill last spring Buchanan of course takes a traditional Catholic antiabortion view and so did Nixon This summer Buchanan also told the President that he should veto the bill providing considerably more funding for public television than Nixon had wanted and the bill was vetoed Buchanan and most other White House aides view public TV as a taxsupported haven for liberals who couldnt make it on CBS or NBC Some White House aides like Robert H Finch consider Buchanan too conservative and wish that he would stick to his newspapers and television tapes But in the shakeout of the White House domestic staff during the first two years of the Nixon Administration the conservative faction headed by Haldeman and Ehrlichman clearly won out over such nowdeparted liberals as Daniel P Moynihan and former Kansas Congressman Robert P Ellsworth As interested as Buchanan is in getting his conservative views to the President on legislative issues his real importance is still in the press area Ever since the White House reacted angrily to the instant television commentary on the Presidents November 1969 speech on Vietnam Buchanan has been the Presidential aide who has constantly pressed the attack on the media Almost wherever he looks he finds what he considers to be blatant liberal If you take the networks he said one morning as we talked there is a legitimate concern about military waste cost overruns in the military programs and these get great emphasis But the military budget is about the same as the budget for the Department of Health Education and Welfare There is not a similar disposition on the part of the networks to look into waste in the welfare programs But if you had structured in the networks people with a basic sort of conservative viewpoint they would be liable to ferret out the abuses in the welfare program and the waste there That is as legitimate a story as waste in the military The exposure of any waste in Government is a legitimate journalistic function but why is it always the Pentagon boobery that is always brought to public Buchanan buzzed his secretary asked for some black coffee and then turned his attention to The Times and The Post Take the sending of Anthony Lewis a Times columnist to North Vietnam after he writes a column saying the United States is the most dangerous destructive nation in the world His arrival in Hanoi was just appalling in my judgment This was not worthy of The Times I think Restons interview with Chou Enlai was appalling for somebody who is supposed to be a hardnosed reporter I think Frankel is very good how ever He is not on my side of the fence but hes a firstrate writer and thinker White House romance But lets take The Washington Post which has been shilling for McGovern of late Ill show you George Wilsons piece in their Outlook section Theres the headline George McGovern Disciple of Eisenhowera disciple of Ike in his militarybudget thinkingand the next morning it comes across the wiresMcGovern saying Im a disciple of Eisenhower That was a campaign brochure Or take Newsweek which is owned by The Washington Post Company In April of this year Newsweek said and think this is very close to direct quote that George McGovern is the closest thing to an ideological radical in the United States Senate But right after the California primary when McGovern looks like the nominee theres a thousandword piece in Newsweek with the headline Is George McGovern a Radical This piece goes up one side and down the other saying no how can you call him a radical this or that really isnt a radical proposal and in a number of ways he is one of the most conservative senators This was a piece for political purposes They were cleaning up George a little bit for the Editors of major newspapers like The Washington Post and national magazines like Newsweek have long since given up trying to do battle with the White House over the way Presidential news is covered They talk about bias all the time says Howard Simons managing editor of The Post but they always forget that each reader has a bias The blacks say were prowhite the whites claim were problack The hippies say were proestablishment and the establishment says we favor the hippies The Jews say were proArab and the Arabs claim were proJewish How can you please everybody As for George Wilsons piece on McGoverns defense budget Simons continued hes not shilling for McGovern We dont shill for anybody The piece was quoting Eisenhowers own viewshis famous warning against the militaryindustrial complex remember when Frank Mankiewicz was coming in here last winter just accusing us of all kinds of bias Right now were being accused of being antiHumphrey by Dr Edgar Berman a confidant of Humphreys You cant run a newspaper by trying to please everybody Buchanan cannot in fact seem to escape the liberals that he sees fouling up the best laid plans of his President Even in the elegant Watergate apartment where he and his handsome blond wife Shelley live there often is no surcease from the 10to 12hour days they both work at the White House There are television sets in both the living room and bedroom and there are always news programs publicaffairs presentations and talk shows to check Movies are Buchanans principal recreation and he and his wife may see two or three a week In fact hed like to review movies some day But even the movies get in the way of his conservative views All the movies are carrying a good deal more ideological baggage than they did in the past and most of its oriented to the left and New Left Buchanan said as we finished talking But he added things may be changing Look at The French Connection and Dirty Harry Both feature Irish cops who are underpaid one even lives in public housingand are doing a dirty job to protect society Both come off as some new kind of heroes The conservative as hero Thats nice And of course voting for the old man

Feminists Shifting Emphasis From Persons to Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/21/archives/feminists-shifting-emphasis-from-persons-to-politics-feminists.html,The womens liberation movement  a massive behavioral revolution aimed at overturning the very structures of a male dominated societyhas entered a new stage of development It is now concentrating aner gies on legislative lohbying and politics Many women have passed through the movements consciousnessraising phase However there are still thousands of women meeting in groups after breakfast in suburban kitchens and after work in offices sipping sherry in living rooms with chintz curtains and smoking pot in lofts without curtains to discuss the measure of their personal oppression in a patriarchal society Women have held these sessions to help purge themselves of the belief that they are inferior to men and that the roles decreed for them are inevitable As consciousness was in fact raised the emphasis shifted to specific issues such as equal pay for equal work daycare centers and the repeal of abortion laws For many women the next logical step was to move into politics Once women step out of that troubled silence they cant step back said the author of Memoirs of an ExProm Queen Alix Kates Shulman Once women become politicized over something like the abortion issue they remain politicized Today with women making up 513 per cent of the countrys population thousands of women across the country are organizing to celebrate the third annual Womens Strike for Justice and Equality this Friday and Saturday which is the Bastille Day or the feminist movement is the 52d anni versary of the 19th Amendment which gave women the right to vote The womens movement is now so large and so fragmented that it can no longer properly be referred to as a single movement It has become multilayered multifaceted multipurposed Its membership now ranges from women who are getting their husbands to help with the housework to women espousing gynocracy where women would hold the power and would have such choices as whether to bear children in utero or in test tubesa world in the words of radical feminist Robin Morgan which would make 1984 look like Mary Poppins The largest of the groups the National Organization for Women NOW has about 20000 members and there are so many feminist groups ranging from Older Womens Liberation OWL to Radicalesbiansthat it is impossible to count them all Many of these groups do not fall into neat pigeonholes of radical or reformist NOW started out as a reformist organization although many of the first women were masking as reformists whereas they were really revolutionaries says Jaqueline Ceballos its eastern regional director Then as radical women became louder NOW became more acceptable Feminist accomplishments have ranged from a vast lobbying effort that culminated in passage of the Equal Rights Amendment this year to establishment of daycare centers and commitments from companies throughout the country to hire and promote more women Perhaps most important however in the opinion of most feminists is a new awareness demonstrated in part by a flood of books and television programs that presented the movements case Convention a Milestone A recent milestone of the movement was the Democratic National Convention last month where women made up almost 40 per cent of the delegates as opposed to 13 per cent in 1968 It was a heady experience for them Representative Shirley Chisholm received 151 votes for President Frances Farenthold of Corpus Christi Tex who had been defeated in her bid to become Governor received 408 votes from delegates in 42 states and territories to make her runnerup for the nomination for Vice President Mrs Jean Westwood was unanimously selected by the 303 members of the Democratic National Committee as its chairwoman the first time either the Some Legislative Breakthroughs Among the legislative breakthroughs cited by feminists that have changed or will change the status of women are Passage of the Equal Rights Amendment by Congress in March The amendment which must be ratified by 38 states would prohibit discrimination based on sex any law or action of Federal state or local government Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which added sex discrimination to the ban against race bias Strengthening powers of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to enforce nondiscrimination in employment Revised Order 4 issued last December by the Department of Labor which applies to companies having at least 50 employes and doing at least 50000 in Federal Government business a year The order requires companies to submit affirmative action plans to move women into job categories where they are underrepresented The goals and timetables must relate to the number of women potentially available for these jobs Extension of the Equal Pay Act of the Department Labor The extension provides additional economic benefits to an estimated 15 million executive administrative and professional employes This will benefit women because the new law requires the same pay for men and women doing substantially the same work New rules of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission giving more rights to pregnant women employes The new rules say that to deny a woman a job because she is pregnant is a violation of the Civil Rights Act 1964 They also say that pregnancy must be regarded an illness and therefore women who leave to give birth must be eligible for sick pay Democratic or Republican party had given the job to a woman and the convention passed a rules change that calls for a woman to chair the 1976 convention and every alternate convention thereafter Women were the most together group at the convention Representative Bella Abzug New York Democrat said the other day in a telephone interview from the Ladies Retirement Room I must do something about that name she said in the House of Representatives We showed we could put something together politically said Mrs Abzug who was defeated in the Democratic primary by Representative William F Ryan I think that its fair to say that what has happened in the last year or so is the first real political movement by women of any national scope since the suffrage movement There were some defeats for feminists at the convention however when their intensive backstage maneuvering failed to pass either the South Carolina challenge which would have put more women in that states delegation or a proabortion minority plank However the fact that the emotional issue of abortion even reached the floor despite the tough lobbying against it indicated the power of women at the convention You cant count success by either winning or losing the abortion votes said Brenda Feigen Fasteau coordinator of the womens rights project of the American Civil Liberties Union and a member of the policy council of the National Womens Political Caucus That whole convention was an enormous victoryjust to have 40 per cent of the delegates be women not just sitting there but actively participating Much of the success was attributable to a mammoth drive launched by the National Womens Political Caucus which was formed last summer by Mrs Abzug Mrs Chisholm Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan to awaken organize and assert the vast political power represented by women Through its taxexempt arm Womens Education for Delegate Selection the caucus held seminars around the country to teach women how to become convention delegates At the Republican National Convention opening in Miami Beach today 35 per cent of the delegates will be women 469 of a total of 1348 Many of the women have been active in politics participating on county and state levels as vice chairwomen Mrs Anne Armstrong cochairwoman of the Republican party will be the conventions secretary and five women and nine men hold positions as chairpersons or cochairpersons of the seven subcommittees of the platform committee [A report on the activities of feminists at the Republican National Convention appears on Page 201 It is six years now since the birth of the movement The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan had been published that year and it made millions of women realize that they were not alone in the frustration of trying to reconcile their potential as educated women with the demands of housewifery At the same time young women from the New Left who had joined the civil rights movement and flocked to the South to combat injiistie were beginning to pour out their wrath to one another over the fact that their male colleagues had banned them from the front lines and relegated them to the kit Hien the mimeograph machine and the bed America was in the throes of a sexual revolution at the time spurred by the advent of the pill and the old morality was challenged as never before A Rapid Spread The movement has grown enormously since those clays when small numbers of young women met to discuss radical feminist concepts and handful of women formed the National Organization for Women NOW to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American Society in truly equal partnership with men The movement has spread abroad and although no one knows how extensive the impact is groups of women are getting together in a number of countries and a NOW chapter was recently opened in Paris At first the movement appealed predominantly to white upper middle class women and in a lesser way to black middleclass women But there are signs now that white ethnic workingclass women and poor American Indians are being drawn into it by its emphasis on rights for welfare women daycare centers and equal pay The small radical groups have split and split again because of ideological differences and the names of groups that gave such flavor to the early part of the movement  Red Stockings WITCH Bread and Rosesare no longer bandied about In some cases they have simply dissolved because they tried to stick to one of the original tenets of the movement which was that there would he no leaders and it did not work As the extremists in the movement became more radicalized NOW appeared more moderate until it was dubbed by many the NAACP of the women s liberation movement The big difference within the movement is that the reform movement is after equality within the system and the radical movement is after changing the systemand by the system I dont just mean capitalism but patriarchy said Robin Morur author of Sisterhood Is poweriul a womens liberation antholory The visible victories and breakthroughs those that can be enumerated are mainly the result of the new thrust toward politics and legislation although some of the specific efforts date back year Rights Bill Cited The passage of the Equal Rights Amendment by Congress last March was perhaps the most significant signpost of womens gains The amendment for which feminists have struggled for 19 years would prohibit discrimination based on sex by any law or action of Federal state or local government An intensive and organized lobbying effort is now being directed at ratification into law by the states So far 20 states have ratified the amendment out of the 38 necessary to amend the Constitution We got this far only because of our nuisance value says Gloria Steinem one of the organizers of the National Womens Political Callells Youve got to get to the state where your legisla tors say Call your people off  The more radical elements of the movement who say they refuse to work within the political system are however lobbying for abortion repeal holding conferences on rape and prostitution establishing selfhelp clinics where women can get free or lowcost medical care from women doctors and nurses starting law clinics to deal with legal questions of particular interest to women and forming womens centers and action alliances to give information on childcare projects welfare rights and abortion Probably the most important and most emotional issue that unites the reformers with the radicals is the proposed repeal of all abortion laws A vital tenet of womens liberation is that a woman has the right to control her own body and many feminists feel that there should be repeal of all governmental interference in reproductive and sexual matters Other issues to which feminists are turning their energies are ending the war providing equal opportunities in employment with equal pay for equal work providing better daycare centers and reforming marriage and divorce laws The more revolutionary denigrate efforts to achieve change through the legislative process because they believe that to attempt to reform society is to perpetuate an oppressive patriarchy To give women full participation in society they say it is necessary to overthrow the structures on which the system is based The first things to go would be the political institutions that perpetuate the system such as institutional marriage which they assert enslaves women for economic reasons A Divided View Many women who are still trying to define their own feminist consciousness are struggling with the questions of marriage and children and their feelings toward men in general These women find it difficult to reconcile their intellectual view of man as the oppressor to their individual relationships with the men in their lives Its quite rational for me to say that I am a manhaterintellectually I am quite com milled to being a manhater even though I like individual men says Susan Brownmiller an author and one of the early radical feminists who is researching a book on rape There may come a time when you are able to say you know you never want to get marriedyou say it for the first time and thunder doesnt strikeand then later you may say the hardest thing to articulate which is that you dont want to have children Recently Betty Friedan wrote an article for McCalls saying there were antimale overtones in the movement and that they were alienating many women The article was widely deplored by many feminist spokeswomen and it was said that Mrs Friedan had taken the occasion to fire some personal shots at Gloria Steinem and Bella Mug both prominent leaders in the movement Mrs Friedan however insists that the extremists who are against marriage have given the movement a bad image and that many women around the country have been alienated because they believe this is the view all feminists espouse A major topic of conversation among all parts of the movement is female sexuality A revolutionary essay which is still being discussed was written early in the movement by Anne Koedt a founder of the radical feminist movement in New York Entitled The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm it challenged the commonly held concepts that women experience their most mature orgasm in the vagina and that as Freud contended the clitoral orgasm is adolescent Her thesis in effect says That the vaginal orgasm is a myth perpetuated by men because it enables them to be in control in the sexual act In actuality Miss Koedt says women prefer clitoral stimulus more than any other form of sexual activity Women have thus been defined sexually in terms of what pleases men she says and urges women to redefine their sexuality and discard the normal concepts of sex Lesbianism has been a difficult issue in the movement Many feminists believe that lesbians should have the same status as all other feminists but other women have been wary of lesbianism becoming too closely identified with the movement in the public consciousness Now evaded the subject for a long time but it passed a resolution at the 1971 conference which read A womans right to her own person includes the right to define and express her own sexuality and to choose her own lifestyle and be it further resolved that NOW acknowledge the oppression of lesbians as a legitimate concern of feminism New Words Appear As the movement  and the controversies surrounding it  have grown it has received widespread publicity A number of national magazines have devoted entire issues to it and a new feminist magazine MS says it sold out its first three issues with sales ranging from 300000 to almost 500000 A number of celebrities such as Germaine Greer and Kate Millet surfaced suddenly when they wrote feminist books One of the major voices in the movement is still Simone de Beauvoirs whose The Second Sex published in the nineteenfifties was a precursor of the movement A new vocabulary has also erupted with such words as chairperson instead of chairman and the designation Ms pronounced Miz or spelled out loud which many feminists prefer to Miss or Mrs because they say a woman should not be identified by her marital status There have been many tangible victories but feminists say that the biggest victory is the overall impact that the movement has had Womens lib  a phrase known only to the elite in the feminist movement two years ago  has become a household word although it no longer seems to be used by women in the movement By the very force of its existence the movement gives moral support and credibility to every woman who sets out on her own to amend inequities in her marriage or in her job No woman no man no child who is aware of the issues of this movement can ever be the same again said Wilma Scott Heide president of NOW

IN THE NATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/22/archives/something-funnys-going-on.html,MIAMI BEACH Aug 21No American political party has been more confident since the Republicans went forth to elect Tom Dewey in 1948 Not even Lyndon Johnsons Democrats in 1964 were more certain they had made than Is the party of Richard Nixon and Spiro T Agnew in 1972 Yet an air of incongruity hangs over this convention something funny going on here It is not just that Nelson Rockefeller will be putting Mr Nixon into nomination or that American politics onetime born loser is now rated the surest thing since War Admiral or even that peace is the theme here while bombs fall on Indochina at a rate surpassing that of World War II Nor the unreality essentially the product of such farcical matters as the security regulations that require Republicans at their headquarters sanctum the Doral Beach Hotel to wear badges while sunning themselves at the swimming pool The incongruity is in the situation itselfthat this party led by these men financed ostentatiously and in part secretly by the American corporate elite should be so universally favored even to win a landslide Every measure after all shows the Republicans still the minority party no magic has transformed Mr Nixon into the charismatic and lovable figure no one has ever pretended he is the support of big business is not as yet the same as the love of the masses and the rug Mr Nixon promised to pull from under those who thought the war in Vietnam would be an issue is still prominently on the floor Whats more in an age when voters everywhere are rebelling against dominant institutions and demanding voice in decisions that affect their lives it was the Democrats who went through the spasms of reform and unseated the old kings There will be no duplication among these satisfied Republicans of the earnest allnight platform debate in which the Democrats more or less came to grips with such matters of genuine concern as abortion and radical tax reform This convention is even giving clear preference for future years to the likes of Alabama and Louisiana and the back of its hand to the major population states Yet there are as many reasons why the optimismeven complacencyof this convention may be justified Mr Nixon for one thing is the incumbent that means that he has in his hands the single most valuable tool in American politicsthe Presidency itself And as Henry Kissinger flits about the world it is evident that few Presidents have been more skillful at using their powers in order to campaign without really seeming to campaign Beginning with the first California debate against Hubert Humphrey moreover George McGovern has capped his nearly flawless Democratic primary campaign with one glaring error after anothermost recently his remarkable statement that he expected South Vietnam to go Communist immediately after his election If that is candor Mr McGoverns supporters ought to bring back the credibility gap and their only consolation must he that perhaps the Senator is getting all his blunders out of the way early Not least because of these troubles Mr McGovern does not appear to have made much headway in unifying his divided party as he had hoped to do in the summer months Polls show 30 to 40 per cent of Democrats now planning to vote for Mr Nixon and with George Wallace not running a third party campaign the once solidly Democratic South looks solidly NixonAgnew for 1972 Mr Nixons foreign policy achievementsprimarily his visits to Moscow and China and the nuclear arms limitationhave been of the most spectacular variety together with his withdrawal of American ground combat troops from Vietnam they give some substance to his peace theme And whatever one thinks of either the morality or the longterm utility of the Presidents busing stance there seems little doubt that he derives considerable shortterm political advantage from itwith more to come the Democratic Senate kills or buries the hysterical House antibusing bill All of this has combined to make Mr Nixon a favorite on the order of Dewey and Johnson but it may be well to remember that it is still August and that after all something did happen to Dewey on the way to the White House For one thing it is not really likely that all of those defecting Democrats actually will go into the polling booths and vote for Richard Nixon whatever they say now For another Mr McGoverns current troubles do not change the fact that at its best his campaign too rides a demonstrable tide of opinion in contemporary America Finally from Dewey to Muskic political punditry has shown its persistent tendency to the herd instinct and the conventional view Whatever you hear from Miami Beach this week there really will he an election this year
Feminists Shifting Emphasis From Persons to Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/22/archives/feminists-shifting-emphasis-from-persons-to-politics-feminists-are.html,The womens liberation movement  a massive behavioral revolution aimed at overturning the very structures of a maledominated societyhas entered a new stage of development It is now concentrating its energies on legislative lobbying and politics Many women have passed through the movements consciousnessraising phase However there are still thousands of women meeting in groups after breakfast in suburban kitchens and after work in offices sipping sherry in living rooms with chintz curtains and smoking pot in lofts without curtains to discuss the measure of their personal oppression in a patriarchal society Women have held these sessions to help purge themselves of the belief that they are inferior to men and that the roles decreed for them are inevitable As consciousness was in fact raised the emphasis shifted to specific issues such as equal pay for equal work daycare centers and the repeal of abortion laws For many women the next logical step was to move into politics Once women step out of that troubled silence they cant step back said the author of Memoirs of an ExProm Queen Alix Kates Shulman Once women become politicized over something like the abortion issue they remain politicized Today with women making up 513 per cent of the countrys population thousands of women across the country are organizing to celebrate the third annual womens Strike for Justice and Equality this Friday and Saturday Saturday which is the Bastille Day of the feminist movement is the 52d anniversary of the 19th Amendment which gave women the right to vote The womens movement is now so large and so fragmented that it can no longer properly be referred to as single movement It has become multilayered multifaceted multipurposed Its membership now ranges from women who are getting their husbands to help with the housework to women espousing gynocracy where women would hold the power and would have such choices as whether to bear children in utero or in test tubesa world in the words of radical feminist Robin Morgan which would make 1984 look like Mary Poppins The largest of the groups the National Organization for Women NOW has about 20000 members and there are so many feminist groups ranging from Older Womens Liberation OWL to Radicalesbiansthat it is impossible to count them all Many of these groups do not fall into neat pigeonholes of radical or reformist NOW started out as a reformist organization although many of the first women were masking as reformists whereas they were really revolutionaries says Jacqueline Ceballos its eastern regional director Then as radical women became louder NOW became more acceptable Feminist accomplishments have ranged from a vast lobbying effort that culminated in passage of the Equal Rights Amendment this year to establishment of daycare centers and commitments from companies throughout the country to hire and promote more women Perhaps most important however in the opinion of most feminists is a new awareness demonstrated in part by a flood of books and television programs that presented the movements case Convention a Milestone A recent milestone of the movement was the Democratic National Convention last month where women made up almost 40 per cent of the delegates as opposed to 13 per cent in 1968 It was a heady experience for them Representative Shirley Chisholm received 151 votes for President Frances Farenthold of Corpus Christi Tex who had been defeated in her bid to become Governor received 408 votes from delegates in 42 states and territories to make her runnerup for the nomination for Vice President Mrs Jean Westwood was unanimously selected by the 303 members of the Democratic National Committee as its chairwoman the first time either the Some Legislative Breakthroughs Among the legislative breakthroughs cited by feminists that have changed or will change the status of women are Passage of the Equal Rights Amendment by Congress in March The amendment which must be ratified by 38 states would prohibit discrimination based on sex by any law or action of Federal state or local government Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which added sex discrimination to the ban against race bias Strengthening powers of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to enforce nondiscrimination in employment Revised Order 4 issued last December by the Department of Labor which applies to companies having least 50 employes and doing at least 50000 in Federal Government business a year The order requires companies to submit affirmative action plans to move women into job categories where they are underrepresented The goals and timetables must relate to the number women potentially available for these jobs Extension of the Equal Pay Act of the Department Labor The extension provides additional economic benefits to an estimated 15 million executive administrative and professional employes This will benefit women because the new law requires the same pay for men and women doing substantially the same work New rules of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission giving more rights to pregnant women employes The new rules say that to deny a woman a job because she is pregnant is a violation of the Civil Rights Act 1964 They also say that pregnancy must be regarded an illness and therefore women who leave to give birth must he eligible for sick pay Democratic or Republican party had given the job to a woman and the convenz tion passed a rules change that calls for a woman to chair the 1976 convention and every alternate convention thereafter Women were the most together group at the convention Representative Bella Abzug New York Democrat said the other day in a telephone interview from the Ladies Retirement Room I must do something about that name she said in the House of Representatives We showed we could put something together politically said Mrs Abzug who was defeated in the Democratic primary by Representative William F Ryan I think that its fair to say that what has happened in the last year or so is the first real political movement by women of any national scope since the suffrage movement There were some defeats for feminists at the convention however when their intensive backstage maneuvering failed to pass either the South Carolina challenge which would have put more women in that states delegation or a proabortion minority plank However the fact that the emotional issue of abortion even reached the floor despite the tough lobbying against it indicated the power of women at the convention You cant count success by either winning or losing the abortion votes said Brenda Feigen Fasteau coordinator of the womens rights project of the American Civil Liberties Union and a member of the policy council of the National Womens Political Caucus That whole convention was an enormous victoryjust to have 40 per cent of the delegates be women not just sitting there but actively participating Much of the success was attributable to a mammoth drive launched by the National Womens Political Caucus which was formed last summer by Mrs Abzug Mrs Chisholm Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan to awaken organize and assert the vast political power represented by women Through its taxexempt arm Womens Education for Delegate Selection the caucus held seminars around the country to teach women how to become convention delegates At the Republican National Convention which opened in Miami Beach yesterday 35 per cent of the delegates are women 469 of a total of 1348 Many of the women have been active in politics participating on county and state levels as vice chairwomen Mrs Anne Armstrong cochairwoman of the Republican party is the conventions secretary and five women and nine men hold positions as chairpersons or cochairpersons of the seven subcommittees of the platform committee It is six years now since the birth of the movement The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan had been published that year and it made millions of women realize that they were not alone in the frustration of trying to reconcile their potential as educated women with the demands of housewifery At the same time young women from the New Left who had joined the civil rights movement and flocked to the South to combat injustice were beginning to pour out their wrath to one another over the fact that their male colleagues had banned them from the front lines and relegated them to the kitchen the mimeograph machine and the bed America was in the throes of a sexual revolution at the time spurred by the advent of the pill and the old morality was challenged as never before A Rapid Spread The movement has grown enormously since those days when small numbers of young women met to discuss radical feminist concepts and a handful of women formed NOW to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American Societyin truly equal partnership with men The movement has spread abroad and although no one knows how extensive the impact is groups of women are getting together in a number of countries and a NOW chapter was recently opened in Paris At first the movement appealed predominantly to white upper middle class women and in a lesser way to black middleclass women But there are signs now that white ethnic workingclass women and poor blacks Chicanos and American Indians are being drawn into it by its emphasis on rights for welfare women daycare centers and equal pay The small radical groups have split and split again because of ideological differences and the names of groups that gave such flavor to the early part of the movement  Red Stockings WITCH Bread and Rosesare no longer bandied about In some cases they have simply dissolved because they tried to stick to one of the original tenets of the movement which was that there would be no leaders and it did not work As the extremists in the movement became more radicalized NOW appeared more moderate until it was dubbed by many the NAACP of the womens liberation movement The big difference within the movement is that the reform movement is after equality within the system and the radical movement is after changing the systemand by the system I dont just mean capitalism but patriarchy said Robin Morgan author of Sisterhood Is Powerful a womens liberation anthology The visible victories and breakthroughs those that can be enumerated are mainly the result of the new thrust toward politics and legislation although some of the specific efforts date back years The passage of the Equal Rights Amendment by Congress last March was per haps the most significant signpost of womens gains The amendment for which feminists have struggled for 49 years would pisohibit discrimination based on sex by any law or action of Federal state or local government An intensive and organized lobbying effort is now being directed at ratification into law by the states So far 20 states have ratified the amendment out of the 38 necessary to amend the Constitution We got this far only because of our nuisance value says Gloria Steinem one of the organizers of the National Womens Political Caucus Youve got to get to the state where your legislators say Call your people off The more radical elements of the movement who say they refuse to work within the political system are however holding conferences on rape and prostitutions establishing selfhelp clinics where women can get free or lowcost medical care from women doctors and nurses starting law clinics to deal with legal questions of particular interest to women and forming womens centers and action alliances to give information on childcare projects welfare rights and abortion Probably the most important and most emotional issue that unites the reformers with the radicals is the proposed repeal of all abortion laws A vital tenet of womens liberation is that a woman has the right to control her own body and many feminists feel that there should be repeal of all governmental interference in reproductive and sexual matters Feminists are also turning their energies toward reforming marriage and divorce laws The more revolutionary denigrate efforts to achieve change through the legislative process because they believe that to attempt to reform society is to perpetuate an oppressive patriarchy To give women full participation In society they say it is necessary to overthrow the structures on which the system is based The first things to go would be the political institutions that perpetuate the system such as institutional marriage which they assert enslaves women for economic reasons A Divided View Many women who are still trying to define their own feminist consciousness are struggling with the questions of marriage and children and their feelings toward men in general These women find it difficult to reconcile their intellectual view of man as the oppressor to their individual relationships with the men in their lives Its quite rational for me to say that I am a manhaterintellectually I am quite committed to being a manhater even though I like individual men says Susan Brownmiller an author and one of the early radical feminists who is researching a book

"Survey Finds Majority, in Shift, Now Favors Liberalized Laws",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/25/archives/survey-finds-majority-in-shift-now-favors-liberalized-laws-survey.html,WASHINGTON Aug 24In a rapid shift on a politically tempestuous issue the American public now appears to strongly favor full liberalization of laws that restrict abortions According to a new Gallup Poll 64 per cent of the public and even a majority of Roman Catholics now believe that the decision to have an abortion should be left solely to the woman and her doctor As recently as 1968 survey data showed that less than 15 per cent of the public approved of liberalized abortion laws In November 1969 another Gallup study found the approval level had climbed to 40 per cent Last October a survey for a Federal population commission found that 50 per cent of the public approved The new Gallup survey conducted in June and published today showed even higher levels of public support on a related controversial issueproviding birth control services and information to teenagers Three fourths of Gallups national sample and 68 per cent of the Catholics interviewed expressed support for such action The two questions have been deeply involved in political controversy this year both in New York and nationally In its report last spring the Presidents Commission on Population Growth and the American Future urged support for both liberalized abortion laws and contraceptive services for teenagers President Nixon rejected the abortion recommendation when he received the commissions report on May 5 saying Unrestricted abortion policies would demean human life He also criticized contraceptive services to minors The next week in a letter to Cardinal Cooke Mr Nixon voiced his support for efforts to repeal New Yorks liberal abortion law Approval by Catholics The abortion issue has also figured in the Democratic Presidential campaign of Senator George McGovern Some of his critics have asserted that he favors unrestricted abortion His response has been that he believes the issue is one for the states not the Federal Government The new Gallup survey showed that a majority of virtually every category of those interviewed favored liberalizing the abortion laws Among college graduates the approval rate rose to 74 per cent as against the 64 per cent overall figure Among higherincome persons it was also 74 per cent In the West it was 73 per cent Among Catholics 56 per cent agreed with the statement in which Gallup asked whether the respondent agreed or disagreed The decision to have an abortion should be made solely by a woman and her physician The Roman Catholic Church has long opposed abortion After the population commission recommended easing the abortion laws the United States Catholic Conference accused it of entering an ideological valley of death The only category of persons in the Gallup survey who did not give at least majority approval to liberalized abortion was those with less than a high school education These split 47 for 45 against The second survey question asked whether people agreed with the statement Professional birth control information services and counseling should be made available to unmarried teenagers who are sexually active The proportion of persons who agreed wds far higher in some categories than the 73 per cent total Among collegeeducated persons the approval figure was 87 per cent among those under 30 years old it was 82 per cent The Gallup findings were based on personal interviews with 1574 persons 18 and over in a statistical crosssection of 300 localities around the country
Says State Rule Denied Equal Protection to Indigent Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/25/archives/says-state-rule-denied-equal-protection-to-indigent-women-ban-on.html,A threejudge constitutional court yesterday rejected a directive by the states Social Services Commissioner banning Medicaid payments to hospitals for women who elect to undergo abortions The court held that the order given by former Commissioner George K Wyman on April 8 1971 would deny indigent women the equal protection Of the laws to which they are constitutionally entitled The unanimous ruling by Judge J Edward Lumbard of the United States Second Circuit Court and District Court Judges John F Dooling Jr and Edward R Neaher ordered the Nassau County Medical Center a defendant in the action to comply It said center officials must treat requests for medical assistance from eligible women desiring to terminate a pregnancy within 24 weeks on the same basis as they would requests for medical services and hospital care for other qualified conditions The court took notice that the State Court of Appeals on Feb 10 had ruled 4 to 1 that Medicaid funds could not be used to pay for elective abortionsthose not vital to the womans health That decision had overturned lower court decisions that the Commissioners directive was unconstitutional and violated the legislative intent of the liberalized abortion law of 1970 The Federal panel found however that the state rule must yield to Federal statutes The judges held that medical assistance for pregnancy was undeniably provided for under the Medicaid program as necessary medical assistance They said that medical assistance for abortion was not less necessary and that the pregnant woman may not be denied such assistance because she has made an unwarrantedly disfavored choice and no other basis appears here for denying medical assistance Discrimination Charged The court said indigent women alone are subjected to state coercion to bear children which they do not want to bear Women who can afford either a justifiable abortion or a fullterm childbirth are free to make the choice in the light of the manifold of considerations directly relevant to the problem uninhibited by any state action the panel said The opinion held further that the indigent was advised by the state that she would be denied medical assistance unless she resigns her freedom of choice and bears the child She is thus discriminated against both by reason of her poverty and by reason of her behavioral choice the panel ruled No interest of the state is served by the arbitrary discrimination it reflects no genuine exclusion from benefit by operation of a classification founded on an identifiable state interest served by the denial of medical assistance The court turned down the contention that the fetus has legal protection under the Constitution That issue it said had been settled in a suit against the citys Health and Hospitals Corporation The Federal panel had heard arguments leading to yesterdays decision on July 26 The action was filed on behalf of Mrs Elizabeth Lina Klein and as a class action on behalf of all other similarly situated women who receive Medicaid from the state and from Nassau and Suffolk Counties Named as defendants were the Nassau County Medical Center the Nassau County Executive and the states Department of Social Services A spokesman for the Nassau County Executives office said the opinion was being studied to determine if an appeal would be filed in the United States Supreme Court Lawyers in the office of State Attorney General Louis J Lefkowitz were unavailable for comment
Women: Correcting the Myths,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/26/archives/women-correcting-the-myths.html,Now that the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution has been passed by the Senate after a 49year struggle and twenty of the required 38 states have ratified this historic amendment can we conclude that womens equality is now guaranteed Far from it As the blacks have discovered correcting legal inequities is only one part of the struggle Changing ingrained attitudes and opinions and correcting myths is the greater challenge I believe that one of the serious battlegrounds upon which the womens struggle will be fought is in the communications media The stereotyped images of women beamed at us hourly and daily by the newspapers womens magazines radio television films and advertising are limiting and demeaning and keep us from experiencing our full possibilities Women themselves must begin to take a more active role in influencing the communications powerstructures Since shockingly few women are to be found in decisionmaking capacities in the communications world we must begin to make ourselves heard through letters and phone calls  and through protests if necessary In the world of films for example we must let the movie producers know the way we feel about the violence and rape of women so popular now in films such as Bluebeard A Clockwork Orange Straw Dogs and Frenzy These movies treat women as victims and glorify violence against women at a time when rape is on the increase in our country Television too is a wasteland for women We must let the networks know how we feel about having so few women hosts of progranisespecially during the evening hours so few documentaries about serious social issues that women are concerned about such as day care centers changing life styles for women the matter of abortion the emergence of women as a political power Our daughters require positive images and role models to inspire them images of independent achieving women Instead we get Lucy Bewitched and Archie Bunkers wife the Dingbat mockingly prejudiced images of women Judging by the new fall lineup of programs there is an almost total lack of consciousness on the part of our TV executives as to the changing role of women in our society Many shows such as Marcus Welby for example continue to feature two strong male leads These exemplary men straighten out the problems of their patients The patients are often emotional females Professional women seldom appear in the story line When they do they are often pregnant though single or in some other difficulty that keeps them from performing their functions The television coverage of women and womens issues at the recent Democratic convention in Miami is a textbook example of male bias on the airwaved Sissy Farentholds nomination for the VicePresidency represented a giant step forwardfor women How disappointing to have CBS bypass Gloria Steinems nominating speech for Farenthold in favor of a commercial And there was little merit in the snide commentary of Teddy White about the nylon revolution In news reporting we must press for the women reporters to handle hardcore news and not the trivia of the day Weve taken for granted all too long the use of the male voice of authority In Sweden France and many other European countries women handle the news programs and host their own programs in prime time as well Our newspapers too in their home and fashion pages perpetuate the myths about women and their true role in society stressing their function as mothers wives and servants of mento the exclusion of all other possibilities News reporting about women in the front part of the newspaper also leaves much to be desired When wo men do achieve some status the attitude of the reporter often seems to be not bad for a woman Bill Moyers former Presidential press secretary and publisher of Newsday wrote recently in McCalls June 1972 The obsolete treatment of women in the press has I think contributed greatly to the anger many women feel Why does the press identify Golda Meir as a grandmother but not Georges Pompidou as a grandfather Why does the press talk of a female politicians hair coloring and dress style but not the hair dye or tailor used by a Presidential candidate or Senator Advertising has yet to awake from its long sleep to recognize the changing roles of women Women in ads are seldom if ever shown working though almost half of all adult women are now in the work These are but a few examples of the image problem that women will have to address themselves to as this decade progresses Let us get up off our apathy cease being a silent majority and work toward full participation for women in the allimportant communications media that represent us so poorly
Officials Hail Court Restoration Of Medicaid Abortion Payments,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/26/archives/officials-hail-court-restoration-of-medicaid-abortion-payments.html,The Federal Court ruling this week restoring Medical payments to hospitals for performing elective abortions was praised by hospital and city officials yesterday as removing a barrier to the full implementation of New York States liberal abortion law In fact though that barrier appears to have been more symbolic than actual in the nearly 17 months since George K Wyman the former State Social Services Commissioner barred Medicaid reimbursement for all but medically indicated abortions We dont have the hard statistics yet said Dr Jean Pakter director of the New York City Bureau of Maternity Services and Family Planning but I wonder if there hasnt been a little flurry upward of medical indications Indications are always a question of interpretation Were coming to take more comprehensive view of medical care Dr Pakter said Social factors are looming up as more and more important in medicines view of the needs of a patient About 31 per cent of New York State women receiving abortions in New York City hospitals are Medicaid patients a proportion that has changed little if at all in the two years since the law was liberalized A Matter of Semantics There have been some worried phone calls said Dr Pakter who keeps abortion statistics covering both the municipal and voluntary hospitals But most hospitals were just going ahead and doing abortions as they were before It became matter of semantics Were relieved that this kind of nonsense can now come to an end A spokesman for the State Department of Social Services confirmed that Commissioner Wymans directive had never had much practical effect on Medicaid reimbursement According to the departments regulations he said medical care is defined as necessary services provided by qualified medical personnel Any service administered by a doctor is assumed to be necessary the spokesman said Attorney General Louis J Lefkowitz said yesterday that he would read the court decision over the weekend and decide next week whether to appeal to the United States Supreme Court Test Made in Nassau At the Nassau County Medical Center the defendant in the action that led to the court decision there was considerable confusion yesterday morning when Bill Baird the abortion and birthcontrol advocate arrived with three pregnant welfare clients He said he wanted to test the county hospitals willingness to comply with the decision but was ordered off the grounds A hospital spokesman said the institution was awaiting an interpretation by the Nassau County Attorney Jerome Seidel Mr Bairds lawyer who brought the original suit said he would sue Nassau County for contempt of court unless it either complied with the court decision or filed an appeal by Monday

A woman anthropologist offers a solution to the woman problem,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/27/archives/a-woman-anthropologist-offers-a-solution-to-the-woman-problem-women.html,The first time I ever stood up in front of a class to lecture about anthropology was several years ago at San Francisco State College It was not long after the campus had been seriously disrupted by Black Panthers and others trying to reconstitute the college and some of my fellow teachers were worried that I as a novice might be hassled by revolutionaries I was a little nervous about this myself but I delivered a wholly uneventful first lecture describing the topics I planned cover marriage the family kinship social organizationin other words the stockintrade of any basic course in social anthropology No Panthers raised their fists no Maoists heckled me At the end of my lecture however a very sweetfaced longhaired boy came up to the podium and demanded with unmistakable iciness Mrs Johnson are you planning to teach this course from a heterosexual point of view Because you see Im gay and I want to know how youre going to relate this material to my lifestyle I tried to reassure my student who turned out to be the head of the campus branch of the Gay Liberation Front that anthropology had a good deal to say about homosexuality in various societies and that I thought I could relate it to his lifestyle At the same time I had to admit that I had no intention of teaching the course from either a heterosexual or a homosexual point of view I said I was a social scientist I believed social science could and ought to be dispassionate in matters of sex as well as politics In fact my students inquiry as to the sexual nature of my approach drove home to me the folly of trying to teach courses from any specialized point of view black Chicano native American Womens Lib or whatever Such partisan approaches to knowledge remind me of Robert Benchleys famous solution to a Harvard internationallaw exam when having been asked to discuss the Newfoundland fisheries dispute between the United States and Great Britain and knowing nothing about it he decided to answer the question from the point of view of All this is by way of saying that when it comes to discussing the role of women in our own society I do so not from the standpoint of a woman but as an anthropologist Anthropology which includes both the physical and the social study of man or as the old schoolroom joke has it of man embracing woman has contributed at least two major insights concerning sex roles One is that men and women are different physiologically endocrinologically and as a result perhaps also psychologically A female anthropology professor of mine once said half jokingly that she was convinced all women were psychotic at least once a monthwhich drew appreciative laughter from most of the women in the room and rather blank stares from the young men The other is that all known societies assign certain tasks on the basis of the distinction between the sexes The jobs that are considered appropriate to males and females may differ greatly from group to group in one society men may be the weavers and potters whereas in another women perform these tasks However there also appear to be certain broad cultural regularities in the division of labor between the sexes that build directly upon physiological differences Women if they are engaged in food gathering or food production are usually assigned the lighter tasks and tasks that keep them close to home where they are also the chief caretakers of young children Men are usually assigned the heavier and more dangerous tasks such as hunting housebuilding and fighting on behalf of the community Now if one accepts these two insights or if one prefers premises that there are inborn sexual differences and that all cultures pattern roles on the basis of sexthen why has the role of women in our own society become such an issue all of a sudden Why are so many women in the United States and to a lesser extent in Western Europe and other industrialized countries arguing that men are oppressors and they are the oppressed To begin with the traditional division of labor between the sexes in primitive societies has been radically altered in industrial societies by modern technology Once upon a time it may have made sense for men to hunt buffalo or wildebeest because they were brawnier than women and for women to be tied to babytending because they had milkgiving breasts But modern technology has largely freed us from these considerations a woman can drive a pickup truck with power steering as readily as a man and a man is as capable of filling and heating a formula bottle as a woman A second reason presentday women have become dissatisfied with the traditional roles stems from a combination of increased longevity and reduced fertility The life expectancy of women in the United States today is 74 and the birthrate has recently fallen to 2136 children per family American women are also tending to marry youngtheir average age at marriage is 208and to have their children early and closely spaced An average woman who marries at 21 and has her first child at 23 may have her second and last at 25 She will thus be only 30 years old when her youngest child enters kindergarten leaving her partly bereft of her role as a fulltime mother and she will be between 42 and 45 years old when her last child leaves the nest entirely either to enter college or marriage or both These demographic facts have a great deal to do with the increasing numbers of middleaged women who want to finish their educations or find work outside the home Some sociologists also think that they may help to explain the increasing number of divorces among middleaged couples As little as 50 years ago a woman could expect to be widowed before her last child had married and left home Today although a married woman who lives to be 74 can expect to be a widow for at least 10 years men have shorter life expectancies and women usually marry older men she and her husband are nevertheless faced with some 20 years together as a couple after they have finished raising their children If the marriage is not a happy one or if the partners have simply grown apart divorce becomes the increasingly common solutionwith the usual sideeffect that the woman will at least for a time want a job A third reason sometimes cited for increased dissatisfaction of women with their traditional roles is that housework has become less timeconsuming therefore less important therefore less fulfilling than it once was Even if being a mother were still major role for women so the argument goes the tasks associated with raising children and running a house have been greatly simplified by a variety of gadgets and services A housewife is no longer obliged to make soap bake bread can vegetables spin weave and make the familys clothes On the other hand a housewife no longer has servents or female relatives or even older children to help and laborsaving devices still require someone to operate them Womens Lib itself seems to vacillate between the view that housework has shrunk in scope and is therefore unsatisfying and the view that it remains one of the last vestiges of the 18hour day The truth lies somewhere in the middle It has been estimated that the average American woman devotes 60 or more hours a week to household maintenance purely aside from the time she spends with her husband and children At the same time the role of a modern housewife is far from being as onedimensional and stultifying as Womens Lib often makes it out to be In a recent study entitled Occupation Housewife sociologist Helena Z Lopata analyzes the relationships that a housewife maintains  with her husband children parents inlaws friends neighbors repairmen shop clerks childrens teachers childrens friends doctors and so forth until the mind grows dizzy with the complexity of it all And indeed many busy housewives find that their lives are a good deal more varied than their husbands working day Moreover as modern technology has simplified certain aspects of housekeeping it has also made possible the creative elaboration of other aspects For example the advent of frozen foods which has made it unnecessary for a wife to cook fullfledged meals every single day has gone handinhand with the burgeoning interest in gourmet cooking And with the disappearance of the need to make all of a familys clothing many women have turned to knitting crocheting and needlework as hobbies To deride such pursuits as timekillersas many ardent feminists dois to overlook the fact that for many women they are a source of genuine satisfaction and pride After all long before Julia Child became an author and a TV celebrity she was quite simply a housewife whose hobby was gourmet cooking The fourth explanation often cited for the dissatisfactions of women is the nature of the prestige system In very small primitive tribes there is virtual equality among all adult members One man may have more prestige because he is a good hunter one woman may have more prestige because she has borne many healthy children But in general the sexes are equally respected within the framework of their respective competences In more complex but still preindustrial societies there are major prestige differences but these may be ascribed to people at birth some being born into noble or highcaste families and others as serfs Both men and women alike are subject to this prestige system and a woman may even have a slightly better chance than a man of improving her lot since in highly stratified societies hypergamythe marriage of a lowerclass or lowercaste woman to a man of a higher social groupis common The reverse hypogamy is rare because with marriage a woman and her future offspring take on the social position of the husband and so an upperclass woman marrying a lowerclass man reduces her position as well as that of her children In industrial societies although there are vestiges of this older inherited prestige system first families and the like the basic class distinctions are determined by the amount of education the type of job professional whitecollar bluecollar and the amount of money that a man has Just as in the preindustrial societies a woman derives her status first from her father and then from the man she marries and just as in these more traditional societies she can rise in status by marrying upwardthe chorus girl who nabs herself a millionaire What seems to rankle with many women today is that their own position in society has remained derivative and ascribed to them by virtue of their birth or marriage whereas a mans status is something that he can affect by his own achievements Now it is true many women are not in the least anxious to enter the marketplace on their own merits The wife of a highpowered industrialist or a famous surgeon is usually only too happy to accept the social position and income that go with her husbands job in exchange for raising the children running the home and entertaining mutual friends Moreover many wives become deeply involved in their husbands careers either in a purely emotional way or in actual fact as with politicians or diplomats wives thus satisfying their own ambitions vicariously However there are certain psychological risks involved in doing this What if the husband decides in midcareer to dump his wife in favor of a nubile secretary Or what if because of overstriving he drops dead of a heart attack at 45 The middleaged collegeeducated former wife of a businessman even if he leaves her with a handsome alimony or insurance checkis suddenly cast adrift She has lost not only her husband but also her identity And this is something about which Womens Lib is quite properly concerned How then might one go about altering the present unsatisfying status of women in our society One solution sometimes dreamed about by men would be a blissful return to the status quo anteto the time when men were men and women knew their place I do not know of any serious advocates of this solution or at least of anyone who can explain how to go about turning back the social clocks The physical changes that industrial society has wrought in the lives of women are simply too great not to produce some parallel adjustments in the way their roles are conceived A second possible solution is one that I call maleoriented because it is based on the assumption that the male role in our society is the more valuable and the more desirable One would think that such an approach would strike women as outrageously sexist rather like Henry Higgins asking Why cant a woman be more like a man But strange to say many women today ardently embrace this point of view Even Margaret Mead in her pioneering study Male and Female ultimately opts for the maleoriented solution After describing both the physiological development of the two sexes and the ways in which various societies go on to define the scope of male and female adult roles she nevertheless concludes with a plea for greater female access to traditionally maledefined roles in our own society As Diana Trilling has pointed out in a sensitive and toolittleknown essay Dr Mead would seem to share with our society its low estimate of the female role And when she asks that each sex be indulged in its special work aptitudes she is not restoring to women their lost pride in their female function She is merely attempting to minimize the contradictions between her case for sexual differentiation and her true feminist preference Basically the maleoriented solution calls for all women to enter the labor force just as men do and for children to be raised in nurseries However unless sextyping in jobs also disappears part of a more radical proposal that I call the androgynous solution which I shall consider in a moment it seems likely that such nurseries would in fact be largely staffed with women This is precisely what happened in Israel with the formation of the kibbutzim Designed in part to liberate women and put them on an equal footing with men the kibbutzim nevertheless ended up assigning the heavier work in the fields and orchards to men and leaving most of the jobs in the laundries kitchens and childrens houses in the hands of women The reasons for this were not at all sexist but had to do with practical matters such as physical stamina and the desire of nursing mothers to work near the infants house where they could nurse their children every few hours Even given such differential job allocations proponents of the maleoriented solution insist that women will be happier working outside of the home because they will be cooking ironing or caring for children as professionals rather than as mere housewives However it strikes me as equally possible that at least some women will find 9to5 child care or 9to5 jobs of any sort more stultifying than the greater variety of chores and freedom from scheduling they enjoy at home The whole problem of boring unfulfilling jobs currently held by men is ducked by the maleoriented solution Feminists when they lobby for greater access to male occupations always seem to cast their argument in terms of highly visible satisfying careers such as those of doctors lawyers university professors or journalists They never stop to consider that for every one such job there are at least 10 which consist of working on an assembly line driving a truck or bus or clerking in a store Just as not every man either aspires to or can qualify for a profession neither does every woman Many who are being urged to and often do enter the labor force do so as typists salesgirls and waitresses Whether they take such jobs in order to fulfill themselves or merely for the extra money is something only they could answer but I suspect it is the latter Some sociologists have sug gested that the whole feminist thrust toward male roles is misguided because we are moving into a postindustrial society in which all work will be highly mechanized and alienating In such a world it is argued the entire puritan ethic will have to be abandoned Men while their jobs may be routine and dull will have an increasingly shorter work week and they will develop their selfimage not in terms of their work but in terms of the way they use their leisure time woodworking civic responsibilities stamp collecting whatever precisely as most women do today It may be that the presentday female role with its greater flexibility will prove to be the model for both male and female roles in the future and I often think when I hear feminists argue the maleoriented position of James Baldwins crack about blackandwhite integration Do I really want to be integrated into a burning house At the same time I would not want to push this argument all the way into what I call the femaleoriented solution which basically proposes not that women should act more like men but that men should act more like women Men should stop being chauvinistic pigs give rein to their nurtural impulses take halftime or undemanding jobs and become involved with caring for their children and homes I do not know of any social scientist who has seriously proposed this solution but it is in fact the lifestyle adopted by many young collegeeducated or collegedropout couples Whether this lifestyle is merely a temporary or a youthful phenomenon remains to be seen But it may be just close enough to the highleisure lowjobinvolvement ethic that has been predicted for the future to remain viable I suspect however that it will be the lifestyle of bluecollar and lowerechelon whitecollar workers I do not think it will work for the professions Even or perhaps particularly in a highly automated society there will still be jobs requiring long periods of training and specialized skills The femaleoriented solution ignores the fact that once people have been so extensively and expensively trained it is not sensible to use them on a less than fulltime basis Jobs which require such training are also likely to have very high rewardsfinan cially and emotionally Many sociological studies have demonstrated that executives doctors and other professionals work many more hours a day than men who punch a time clock and they do so voluntarily because they are stimulated by the work itself It is the nature of these highstatus jobs that makes it impractical for men to fill them on a halftime or onagainoffagain basis and this is also why with these particular jobs there is often great resistance to opening them up to women It Is not I think that male doctors lawyers scientists and journalists doubt that females can make excellent colleagues there are already too many women in each of these fields to make a viable argument But professional men do want the same criteria applied to women that are applied to them and they want to have the same expectations of women in their field that they do of men This is why for example there is great resistance in medical schools to adjusting interneships so that women internes can care for their children If you want to be a doctor the attitude seems to be you should get used to long and difficult hours just as male doctors do For the same sort of reasons major companies are reluctant to promote women to high executive positions because they doubt that most women are really prepared to undertake everything that goes with such jobs extensive travel evening and weekend work and often the necessity of moving It is useless to argue as some feminists do that not all male executives are willing to pay this price either It is true that some men are not but they usually find this reflected in their promotions and paychecks do not find either the maleoriented or the femaleoriented position wholly satisfactory as a model to which both sexes should aspire I do not find the vision of a society in which all men and women have fulltime jobs entirely credible nor can I envision a society where all men and women have parttime or intermittent jobs I think society needs both sorts of lifestyles and I think it is not entirely accidental that one has become associated with the female sex and the other with the male sex It would be possible to break this association however and this brings us to the fourth solution the androgynous solution which takes it name from an important article by the sociologist Alice S Rossi It is basically the position of many members of Womens Lib writing today They argue that the physiological differences between men and women are minimal or nonexistent and that sex roles are a cultural product inappropriate to the kind of world we live in in the second half of the 20th century The old distinctions between masculine and feminine should be abandoned and children of both sexes should be raised precisely the same way to have the same expectations and the same goals It is enough to make a Frenchman weep and perhaps some women too The women who espouse the androgynous solution point correctly to the fact that Americans already train female children in highly inconsistent ways They urge their girls to excel in school and go to college and yet they expect these same girls somehow to abandon their academic interests and become pliable wives Supporters of the androgynous solution also point out that sexlinked occupations nurses are female doctors are male secretaries are female executives are male are largely traditional In newer occupations such as computer programing or being a laboratory technician the sex barriers are either nonexistent or much less rigid Yet I wonder whether the solution to these inconsistencies is to do away with sex roles altogether I am inclined to agree with Margaret Mead that there may well be certain jobs that are more congenial to one sex than the other and would hate to see such human potential denied simply in the name of a programmatic conviction that equality means similarity Finally therefore I want to offer my own solution to the woman problem although since I am a social analyst rather than an advocate it is a statement more of where we are today than where I think we ought to be going I call it the alternative lifestyles solution The United States is already a pluralistic society in terms of its ethnic groups its religious groups its regions and the types of lifestyles that go with these various groupings Why not accept a pluralistic view of male and female roles as well According to this view women who want careers should have them and get equal pay with men for the work they choose to do and women who want to stay at home should do so and not be despised for it Men who want to continue being aggressive male chauvinist pigs should feel free to do so not least because there are some women who are wildly attracted to this type of behavior but men who want to give rein to their passive impulses should also be encouraged since there are plenty of women who like that sort of man too Under this liveandletlive rubric it should even be possible for society to accommodate itself comfortably to those women who prefer the company of other women and to men who prefer other men I realize that this laissezfaire approach is too noncom bative to please most ardent feminists And it can be faulted by them for failing to take adequate account of the dead weight of tradition What about those professions that women are genuinely prevented from entering What about those jobs that a woman can get only by being twice as good as the nearest competing man I am probably too sanguine about these problems because my own field anthropology has never discriminated against women Any list of prominent anthropologists would have to include such names as Ruth Benedict Margaret Mead Cora du Bois Hortense Powdermaker Lucy Mair Monica Wilson Florence Kluckhohn Dorothy Lee Elizabeth Coland So I have been lucky and indeed for women whose interests lie in maledominated fields the road may be much harder The answer I think lies in legislation to insure nondiscriminatory hiring and equal pay for women The answer does not lie in the promotion of quotas the notion that because women represent 51 per cent of the population they must have close to that number in all occupations political bodies and private clubs If the foregoing analysis has any validity at all it should have established that 1 some occupations will continue to attract more males and others to attract more females because of certain sexually determined psychological predispositions women make better kindergarten teachers than men and 2 not all women will want The enter the 9to5 rat race The beauty of a pluralistic approach is that it frees men and women from rigidly sexdefined roles without either destroying the distinction between the sexes or casting them in new equally rigid sex roles Even if pluralism in male and female roles becomes an entirely accepted fact it will not be without its cost When there are no longer any absolute cultural values to guide men and women in how they should shape their lives it takes a good deal of individualism and strength of character to map a course of ones own The costs even for an outwardly successful individual may be selfdoubt and perpetual tension One reason for the tension is that with every individual free to do his own thing there is no one else to blame if one choice For ex ample one of the dilemmas created by effective birthcontrol methods backstopped by the availability of safe abortions is that a womanor a couple  must actively decide to have children Even to abdicate that decision to let nature take its course or to take a chance is to choose when alternatives are available Many women find this an acuely uncomfortable position to be in It is after all much easier to say that you never managed to finish college because the babies started coming It is even relatively easy given a little help from Womens Lib organizations to argue that you cannot finish college now because the Administration refuses to establish childcare centers What is hard is to choose among availableand sometimes competing  alternatives I do not mean to imply that maternity and a career are necessarily alternative choices although for some women they unquestionably are Certainly the shortened period of the mother role in the context of a womans entire lifespan means that other meaningful substitutes must be found Whether they are to be continuous or discontinuous paid or unpaid careers or avocations is think an open question Grandma Moses managed to start a quite amazing career as a painter in her late 70s and I will always remember an art teacher of mine who argued that Grandma Moses would have been ruined had she ever taken lessons or for that matter set brush to canvas any sooner than she did She was in an extreme way a late bloomer I myself had a solution to womens roles all worked out when I was 4 years old When one of my mothers friends asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up I said I wanted to be a ballerina and a fishwife I should perhaps explain that I grew up in Holland where the women who sold fresh herring on the streets wore wonderfully voluminous costumes and white starched butterfly caps anchored to their foreheads with goldfiligree hat pins When my mothers friend somewhat startled asked me how I planned to combine these two professions I explained that I would be a ballerina until I got too old to dance and then I would become a fishwife It didnt quite work out that way but I still think its not a bad solution
Nixon Proclaims ‘Women's Day’ After Accusation by McGovern,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/27/archives/nixon-proclaims-womens-day-after-accusation-by-mcgovern.html,SAN CLEMENTE Calif Aug 26  President Nixon today issued a proclamation naming today Womens Rights Day and indirectly attempted to answer Senator George McGoverns charge that the Administration has treated the womens moveas a joke In the proclamation which marked the 52d anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment extending suffrage to women the President said In recent years there have been great strides in extending the protection of law to the rights of women and in pro moting equal opportunities for women Today more women than ever before serve in poiicymaking positions in the executive branch of our Government He also pledged to continue his efforts to insure women every opportunity to make the fullest contribution to our progress as a nation In Washington yesterday Senator McGovern the Democratic Presidential nominee named two prominent womenShiriey MacLaine the actress and Representative Bella S Abzugto his staff while charging that out of 12000 top policy jobs in the Federal Government only 105 had been filled by women under the Nixon Administration The White House in an elaborate fact sheet issued along with the proclamation put the figure at 118 and said that this was three times the number of women in top jobs at the beginning of Mr Nixons term The fact sheet defined top policymaking jobs as those at the GS 16 level and up which pay a minimum of 28000 annually The fact sheet also reported a significant increase in the number of women occupying middlemanagement jobs in the Federal Government Recalling that Mr Nixon in 1971 had appointed a fulltime staff assistant to recruit women for high Federal posts the White House pointed out that for the first time two women were now chairing regulatory agencies simultaneously and that the President had nominated the first six women to the rank of general in the armed forces The two Commissioners are Catherine May Bedell head of the Tariff Commission and Helen Delich Bentley head of the Maritime Commission The fact sheet also cited the Presidents support of various administrative and legislative actions aimed at reducing sex discrimination The exchange between Mr McGovern and the President was a sharp reminder of the fact that women constitute half of the voting population Mr McGovern angered many women by his tactical maneuvers at the Democratic National Convention and Mr Nixons strong stand against liberalized abortion laws has drawn criticism from some segments of the womens movement Both men are clearly moving to repair the damage by displaying their sympathy for womens charges of job discrimination MrNixon spent today conferring with aides reading and relaxing with his family Tomorrow he will be host at reception at the Western White House for 400 actors actresses and other show business personalities
Women's Unit Broke And Split on Future,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/28/archives/womens-unit-broke-and-split-on-future.html,WASHINGTON Aug 27The National Womens Politieal Caucus after achieving some significant victories at both national political conventions is broke and uncertain about its future course There is no lack of ideas among the members of the yearold organization about what the caucus should be doing both in the political campaign and afterwards And there is disagreement in its ranks on only one significant question But without money which has proved almost impossible to raise in this election year the caucus is in danger of not being able to continue at all Its five staff members at national headquarters here whose stated salaries range from 9100 a year to 12000all but one is a college graduatehave been paid only a few hundred dollars each since May The major policy dispute that lies ahead for the caucus involves its role in the political campaign Separate Political Aims Some of the members of its national policy council notably Representative Bella S Abzug Democrat of Manhattan believe that the caucus should set up two separate political arms one Democratic and one Republican for the duration of the campaign Mrs Abzug believes that this is the only way that women are going to be able to continue to make a drive toward greater representation in government Unless we utilize the political power of women in the national political campaign we will not have any basis on which to say We helped to elect you and we are entitled to be represented in your government in your cabinet  Mrs Abzug declared One of those who disagrees with Mrs Abzug is Midge Miler a Democratic state legislator in Wisconsin who is also a member of the national policy council of the caucus Power in Unified Stand While individual caucus members will obviously work for specific candidates she says the caucus is a great deal more of a threat to the establishment if we stay together as a multipartisan organization because that always implies a threat to cross party lines if one party or the other wont pay attention to our desires There are other reasons too why she wants the caucus to stay united and multipartisan It really helped me for exrdnple when I was trying to pass the equal rights amendeient here in Wisconsin to be able to call Republican women in other states that I knew through the caucus and ask them to call their Republican legislators here Wisconsin has ratified the amndment Exactly when the issue of splitting into partisan subdivisions may come before the caucus is not altogether clear The policy council may not meet again until the end of September by which time it could be rather late to establish any major campaign structures Ideas for Campaign Women in the caucus have dozens of ideas of things they would like to do during the campaign if they had the financial resources Among them are the following Start compiling lists of women who are qualified for appointive jobs at every level of government so that these can be presented right after the election to the victorious candidates for governor mayor county executive and legislative bodies all over the country Set up a speakers bureau to dispatch the stars of the womens movement to speak anywhere in the country for women candidates who want such help at least paying the expenses of these figures  Put professional organizers in the field to help womens groups that want to work as women in campaigns Copy everywhere what the caucus leaders consider a model job of candidaterating done in Michigan by LaVonne Bleisner who worked for the Republican central committee there The Michigan brochure identifies 14 issues regarded as important to womenranging from welfare to the equal rights amendmentand rated all current members of the Legislature according to their votes on these issues Most of the women members incidentally got indifferent scores Establish a clearing house to exchange information among the different state and local caucuses about programs and tactics that have proved effective Set up a formal coordination with other womens groups such as the business and professional women the League of Women Voters and the Womens Equity Action League to exchange information and stop the duplication of effort that is currently going into such activities as analysis of the impact on women of pending legislation both national and state Money Is Crucial Need None of this will be possible without money however And the most urgent financial question facing the caucus at the moment is whether it will even be able to continue to operate its Washington headquarters t is behind in its 650 monthly rental for its office in an old building at 1302 18th Street NW in the Dupont Circle area Several staff members have given notice because they say what they are getting paid does not even cover their expenses of working Several small fundraisers that have been attempted lately one in New York and one during the Republican convention in Miami Beachhave flopped with only a few hundred dollars collected Elizabeth Carpenter the former aide to President and Mrs Johnson also a national policy council member explained the problem this way There are many women here in Washington and elsewhere who are making good salaries in spite of discrimination in pay Were fighting their fight and they know it But theyre just not used to paying 25 for a ticket to a cocktail party to benefit a cause They can afford it Mahy of them have three pairs of 40 boots in their closet We have to make paying for a cause part of their lifes experience Fund Events Pondered Various fundraising events are under consideration at the moment largely under the direction of Ronnie Feit a New York member of the policy council The caucus may also decide to sell a national member ship though individuals would still be able to be members of state and local caucuses without paying dues to the national organization The caucus does not want to impose charges that would discourage membership by poor women The caucus has also received feelers from two large corporations that are offering it money to keep going But caucus leaders are not yet sure just how much the companies will want in return by way of public identification with the caucus and thus they are not sure whether they will feel able to accept the money There is a very strong sense of the need to keep the caucus in operation on the part of politically active women All mention its key role in raising the proportion of women delegates at the party conventions from 13 per cent and 17 per cent for the Democrats and Republicans respectively in 1968 to 39 per cent and 30 per cent this year Successes Recounted Jill Ruckelshaus one of the leading Republican women on the policy council speaks glowingly of other caucus successes I dont think theres any question that we would not have had a womens plank in either party platform without the womens political caucus she said I think both parties were stunned at just how organized and determined the women were We got everything we wanted except planks on abortion and we started lot of people thinking about the abortion issue who had never thought about it before Mrs Ruckelshaus was particularly pleased that the Republican platform had made a commitment to ratification of the equal rights amendment since there seemed to be some question about our partys commitment to it and also that the party committed itself to placement of qualified women in the cabinet and on the Supreme Court I think well beat both of those things in the next four years she said Others in the caucus noted that the platform plank sponsored by women demanding expanded daycare facilities was the only in the Republican platform that even implicitly criticized any action by President Nixon He had vetoed major daycare bill calling too expensive and a threat to family life

McGovern Calls on Jews To Judge Him by His Acts,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/31/archives/mcgovern-calls-on-jews-to-judge-him-by-his-acts-tells-board-of.html,Acknowledging that he has a Jewish problem in New York Senator George McGovern yesterday urged an enthusiastic audience of rabbis and their families to judge me today and in the weeks ahead on the basis of all my actions and not on the basis of what the opposition says or prints or whispers In a speech interrupted by applause 24 times the Democratic Presidential nominee told members of the New York Board of Rabbis that the security of Israel is not a partisan issue But the issue has been raised and it must be put to rest Mr McGovern said issuing partisan critique of the positions that President Nixon has taken on Israel over the years Most of Mr McGoverns day in the city was spent trying to dissipate some of the uncertainty among Jewish voters about the Senators record on Israel an uncertainty that his strategists feel Mr Nixon has been trying to capitalize on Richard Cohen who heads Mr McGoverns Jewish affairs unit has said that before the Senator can persuade Jews of his ability to deal with other issues he must first overcome a residue of doubt about the Senators attitude toward Israel and Soviet Jewry Mr McGovern won applause from the audience of 700 persons assembled at Temple Bnai Jeshurun 270 West 89th Street when he said that if he had gone to a summit meeting in Moscow as Mr Nixon did I would have told the Russian leaders in the strongest possible terms how deeply the American people feel about the Soviet Jewish struggle and that should have been done While he was in Moscow Mr McGovern said The President apparently concurred in the Russian view that this is an internal matter Since the summit meeting Mr McGovern declared there has been a deterioration in the situation faced by Soviet Jews Their plight he said was not an internal matter any more than what was going on in Germany in 1930 was an internal matter Mr McGovern arrived at the temple at 1030 AM accompanied by former Mayor Robert F Wagner Bronx Borough President Robert Abrams and Mr Cohen who is on leave from the American Jewish Congress The Board of Rabbis has about 1000 members representing all three branches of JudaismOrthodox Conservative and Reformin New York State It has been said that I have a Jewish problem in New York the Senator told the board members and their families and I have just as John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy had when they first ran in this state Just as Jewish and other voters needed to know more about their views before supporting them Mr McGovern said you have a right to know mine The Senator said he deplored what he saw as the effort of some of the opposition to make a political football out of Israel He went on I invite comparison between myself and my opponent on the subject of Israel as far back as anyone would like to trace our records My commitment to Israel is a moral commitment that began with my entry into public life in 1957 the first year was in Congress Mr McGovern said In contrast he continued the Administrations commitment has been an instrument largely of power politics that really began with the Soviet military buildup in the Mediterranean I was not the President who imposed the long and dangerous delay in the shipment of Phantom Jets and other vital arms to Israel the Senator said I was not part of an Administration that voted with the SovietArab bloc to condemn Israel five times in the United Nations over the last four years It was not I who tried to impose a bigpower settlement on the Middle East And while the present Administration has consistently sought to tie American aid to Israel with appropriations for the Vietnam war Mr McGovern continued I have argued that any hint at all of similarity between our disastrous involvement in Indochina and our reponsibilities in the Middle East was a sadly and dangerously mistaken comparison Mr McGoverns speech also touched on crime in the streets drug addiction urban decay and the disruption of neighborhood life Where people live in a metropolitan area they want neighborhoods that are safe that are clean and that offer that sense of community that the human soul so desperately needs the Senator said They should be protected from projects that destroy the familiarity and identity that go with the concept of home The president of the Board of Rabbis Rabbi William Berkowitz who introduced Mr McGovern is a stanch foe of the controversial lowincome housing project now going up in Forest Hills Queens But a spokesman for Mr McGovern said that it was not the Senators intention to specificially allude to Forest Hills in his statement Rabbi Berkowitz assessed the Senators speech for newsmen as an excellent talk an excellent address Mr McGovern continued his wooing of Jewish voters at an outdoor noontime rally for Soviet Jews at the corner of 40th Street and Seventh Avenue I am here today because as long as men and women are jailed for loving freedom no one of us can be free the Senator told a crowd of several thousand Again the response was enthusiastic although there were a few catcalls After an appearance on the Today show yesterday morning Mr McGovern said that if President Nguyen Van Thieu of South Vietnam felt endangered by a political settlement of the Vietnam war he should be granted asylum in the United States Hes been our man in Saigon we put him there Mr McGovern said continuing He may not represent the ideals of democracy but he is our man If he and some of his friends feel endangered by a political settlement we ought to welcome him here Before returning to Washington late in the afternoon the Senator visited privately for 25 minutes with Cardinal Cooke Afterward the two men posed for pictures Richard Doherty Mr McGoverns press secretary said they discussed the fiscal plight of parochial schools urban problems and the issue of abortion In another development representatives of23 Long Island labor unions met in Wantagh to form a coalition in support of the McGovern candidacy More than 50 representatives of 20 labor unions in the city and upstate met at the Biltmore Hotel late yesterday to organize a New York Labor Committee for Senator McGovern

A Smart Approach to Dope,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/01/archives/a-smart-approach-to-dope.html,URBANA IllWhy is so little said about the possibility of supplying drug addicts with the stuff they need bought by official clinics at uninflated normal pharmaceutical prices I am not suggesting that we legalize dope or let the corner drugstore go into the heroin business I am not suggesting that supplying legal heroin to an addict will be good for him The addict will still be his own victim but innocent people will not be victimized by him A clinic system utilizing pharmacies exists now in Britain a country which has a drug abuse problem but nowhere near the addictcaused fear and violence we have Consider the following benefits which could reasonably be expected to come about under a well run clinic system  Robberies of all sorts will decrease and robberies involving violence will decrease greatly No addict will need to steal because of his addiction Some addicts who have found easy ways to steal will continue to do so but they will not need to risk their own lives in armed robberies They will opt for the kinds of crimes which bring lower prison sentences to them if they are caught as many nonaddict burglars do now Addicts who continue to steal will spend their money on legitimate commodities instead of on drugs The huge amount of money now spent on police investigation of drugrelated crime will eventually be diverted to other needs of the Police Department  Most dope pushers will go out of business very quickly having lost their clientele Pushers who sell heroin mainly to support their own habits will not care about this loss It will still be illegal to sell drugs outside of the clinics  The number of addicts will decrease slightly Most pushers will not be around to entice new victims Some adolescents will decide that it is all right to get hooked because the clinics will be there to take care of them The number of persons who follow this line of reasoning will not be as large as the number who now get hooked by desperate pushers wln give them free samples As the number of pushers declines the availability of first shots will diminish The clinics will under no condition start off an unaddicted person When newly addicted patients show up the clinicians will try to get them to stop while there is still a chance  Prostitution will decrease No teenager or woman will need to turn to prostitution to support her drug habit Some addicted women who are now prostitutes will continue to be prostitutes but they will spend the money they receive on better lodgings and better food on clothing and comforts and on better care for children they might have As fewer women are driven to prostitution the spread of venereal disease will decrease and abortions and illegitimate births will be somewhat reduced  The incidence of hepatitis will decrease greatly The current use and reuse of dirty needles and other gear in fixes will diminish and with it the spread of hepatitis as well as tetanus Addicts will no longer need to sell their blood which is so often infected with hepatitis  The identification and daily treatment of large numbers of addicts will provide a mechanism for ushering some addicts into cures or attempts at cures Some addicts will decide to use the security of the clinics as a stepping stone to methadone trees ment or to other less debilitating substitutes for heroin Drug education programs aimed at preventing addiction will need to continue Although these prophesies seem reasonable to rne undoubtedly there will be critics who disagree It will be necessary to distinguish between critics who honestly see flaws in this idea and those who complain about it because they are now profiting in some way from the illegal drug market and will stand to lose if a clinic system is instituted
Why George Meany Did It,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/02/archives/why-george-meany-did-it.html,WASHINGTONLooking back now at the MeanyMcGovern contretemps one gets this flavor An arrogant and geriatric cabal of labor bosses and Meany henchmensenile hawkish old men out of touch with American workingmen and searching for Commies under their bed ensconced first in a pleasure palace in Miami and then in a marble palace in Washington chomping on frayed cigarsconspired irrationally and vindictively to deprive an honest patriot of a prized endorsement that he richly and rightly deserved One need not agree with the MeanyAFLCIO decision to note at least that such gross caricature is gross caricature and that in fact there was a sensible argument to be made for labors decision That argument was not generally prermted in the media For example Perhaps George Meany felt honorbound to be responsive ie in touch to the rankandfile workers of America The Gallup Poll at the time showed labor union families favoring Nixon over McGovern by 52 per cent to 42 per cent Perhaps Meany felt that McGovern was a sure loser no matter what the AFLCIO did The Gallup figures then showed Nixon ahead by 19 per cent nationwide Accordingly perhaps Meany and the AFLXIO felt that they should make the most advantageous deal possible with the man who would inevitably be the next Presidentwhile simultaneously working to retain a Democratic Congress Perhaps senile George Meany and the senile executive board of the AFLCIO can still read newspapers in braille and that during the last five or so years these doddering fools had noted that many of the ideologues of the new politics wing of the Democratic party have characterized labors leadership as racist reactionary and imperialist and caricatured its membership as beery hawkish ethnic slobs Perhaps the AFLCIO leadership did not agree with those characterizations Perhaps they felt instead that while some of the new politics was concentrating on Vietnam and the chic antimaterialist liberalism of the counterculture amnesty abortion gay lib and marijuanathey the labor skates were up to more productive pursuits Perhaps they take pride that the American labor movement has been the point of the lance for every decent progressive and humanitarian piece of legislation that has actually passed into law over the last decade That includes not only unionoriented measures but also civil rights civil liberties the environment medical care poverty welfare aid to educa tion mass transportation and so on down an extremely long list Perhaps these old labor curmudgeons felt that if they had indeed been unresponsive their unresponsiveness deals with moving ahead of their constituency Perhaps then labor felt that at least a sizable segment of the Democratic party was now unappreciative unresponsive and indeed hostile to the labor movement Perhaps if they had any doubt about such hostility such doubts were in part confirmed by the vigorous antiunion commentary that emanated from that part of the press that can be viewed as favorable to the new politics Accordingly perhaps labor felt that they ought to take lesson from the new politics and show some political muscle so that things might get better the next time around That after all was the stated plan of many McGovernitesincluding McGovernin the event that the new politics lost out Against all of this of course were some heavy counterweights George McGovems labor record is not badand Richard Nixons is not good In the long run labor is likely to get more of its members from the Democrats than the Republicans The question labor must weigh is How long a run and from which Democrats It must surely have been a difficult decision to make The only point offered here is that serious considerations were involved in that decision The parody of such decisionmaking offered up by so a much of the interpretive pressas convulsive final spasm by an unresponsive imperious and geriatric giantwas patently phony As an active and occasionally professional Democrat I must confess to a number of real problems regarding the MeanyAFLCIO decision After all it was nice while it lasted to have big labor sewed up in the Democratic pocket Now well have to work hard for their support
Light on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/04/archives/light-on-abortion.html,The fact that the emotionfilled debate over abortion in New York State is far from over makes particularly valuable the statistical analysis of the 1971 experience just released by the states Department of Health Both sides in the debate will have to take account of the rich supply of data now available about the first full calendar year of legal abortion in this state Over 262000 pregnancies were artificially terminated here during 1971 almost 90 per cent of them in New York City plus Nassau and Westchester Counties This disturbingly large figure testifies to the magnitude of the task still undone in educating people especially young people to use the available alternative means of contraception Almost two of three of the women who underwent abortions were under 25 years of age and well over a quarter of the total were under twenty Since a large proportion of these women were unmarried it is certain that many would have tried to end their pregnancies through illegal operations or selfabortion techniquesboth far more dangerous than legal abortion in proper surroundings34re New York States facilities not available One can only conjecture at how many women were spared death or serious injury through the change in the states archaic antiabortion law two years ago Enlightening too is the fact that more than 60 per cent of the abortions here last year were performed on women who came from other states some from as far away as Alaska and the West Coast The demand for abortions is a national phenomenon and so long as most other states retain virtually impenetrable legal barriers to such operations except under emergency conditions New York can expect a continuation of this medical migration An unfortunate corollary is that the need for traveling long distances for an abortion inevitably implies discrimination between relatively affluent outofstate women who can afford to come here and their povertystricken sisters who cannot Even here for a time the state endeavored to deny indigent women abortions by barring the use of Medicaid funds but a threejudge Federal court has wisely branded that maneuver unconstitutional A distressing element in the new report is the disclosure that a byproduct of 49 of these abortion procedures was the birth last year of live babies all but two whom died within hours after leaving their mothers wombs These tragedies occurred in only a minuscule percentage of the 262807 abortions but they will undoubtedly provide ammunition for those who believe that there should be at least an upper limit on the period of pregnancy for which abortions are permitted

M'GOVERN SCORES NIXON JOB STAND IN A BID TO LABOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/05/archives/mgovern-scores-nixon-job-stand-in-a-bid-to-labor-officially-begins.html,CHIPPEWA LAKE Ohio Sept 4Senator George McGo fern opened the official phase of his national campaign in this key industrial state with a promise to bring the real George McGovern to the people In opening his Presidential campaign in Ohio Senator McGovern broke a longstanding Democratic tradition Cadillac Square in Detroit has been the favorite location for Labor Day openings of Democratic candidates in the past and reflected the partys identification with organized labor Pointing up the task that lies ahead for Senator McGovern Louis Harris Poll released today indicated that union members were inclined to prefer President Nixon over Mr McGovern by 49 per cent to 40 per cent Importance of Ohio Senator McGovern retained the labor flavor of the campaign opening today but his choice of the locale indicates the Importance he places on this state in his election strategy With a large union membership Ohio represents the combination of urbanruralsuburban elements in the industrial states he must win to gather enough electoral votes for victory As one staff member observed If we can win in Ohio we can win the election Senator McGovern set about immediately to try to correct what is seen here as his major problem in the campaignclarifying his several emotional issues Departing often from a prepared text Senator McGovern told his audience he wanted to put down Republican distortions He assured his listeners he would leave abortion laws to the states that he did not wish to legalize marijuana and that he would grant amnesty to draft evaders only after the war ended and United Stites prisoners had been returned Attack on Nixon Hailed The most enthusiastic response however came when he turned another charge into an attack on the Nixon Administration It takes a lot of gall for the man who has been President of the United States the last three and a half years to say he advocates workfare rather than welfare he said He has been President at a time when six million people have been added to the welfare rolls He talks about George McGovern wanting to increase welfare I want to take people off of welfare and put them to work by providing decent jobs for every me and woman able to work Mr McGovern later flew to Oakland Calif and then made a short flight by helicopter to Pleasanton where at a laborsponsored rally at the Alameda County Fairgrounds he again criticized the economic policies of President Nixon Senator McGovern flew to Ohio after a visit to the Southern Governors Conference to find more than 1000 enthusiastic supporters who had waited at the AkronCanton Airport from 1130 PM yesterday until his plane arrived shortly after 130 oclock this morning Early today he was joined in a public appearance by the United Autombbile Workers president Leonard Woodcock and Ohios Democratic Governor John J Gilligan and by other state and local cratic officeholders in a show of party unity The reception by several thousand at the annual Barberton Labor Day Pionic was warm and attentive and Senator McGovern took advantage of the opportunity to deliVer an at tack on the economic polleies of the Nixon Administration to assert that the President planned a national sates tax next year if reelected that would cost each family an additional 200 in taxes and to link himself with the former Democratic Presidents whom the Republicans have denounced as radicals Later at sunsplashed Chippewa Lake an amusement park that has seen its best days he was cheered by auto workers at the annual UAW picnic They had been warmed up by Mr Woodcock who declared We are sick of government by trickery We always lose elections in August but we usually win them in November Briefing on Ohio Between stops Senator McGovern was briefed on the Ohio situation by Governor Gilligan and local labor leaders Their advice included suggestions that the Republicans had successfully clouded Senator McGoverns best economic issues and his personal image and urgedhim to use this occasion to reassert himself and reclaim the issues The McGovern organization here is counting on todays appearance to fire up a campaign that is lagging behind schedule Largely because of the confusion that followed the national convention none of the three prongs of the plannpd organization  the McGovernShriver operation based on young volunteers the labor committee and the traditional party anparatusis at the effectiveness hoped for by Labor Day As one McGovern organizer who has covered the state the last two weeks summed up his impression Were just about two weeks behind where we ought to be organizing at the local level the labor organization is shaping up but later than we had hoped But theyre both working hard I cant say the same for the regular party organization Theyve helped some but not nearly as much as they could Key State in Campaign Both the labor committee and the McGovernShriver organization intend to spend the next 35 days on an intensive registration drive to reach an estimated 13 million unregistered voters mostly in the 18to25 age group In addition they hope to cash in on the personal importance Senator McGovern seemed to attach to the Ohio effort The race Dick Sklar the campaign coordinator says is considered second only to that in New York and the organization here has a promise that either the Senator or Mr Shriver will be in the state every week until the election Meanwhile Senator McGdvern made his first substantial in the South today when Gov Robert C Scott of North Carolina announced that he would head the McGovern campaing committee in his state Clear evidence of party de tachinent here in Ohio could be seen yesterday at the county fair of Stark County which includes the strongly Democratic city of Canton Unlike the Republicans who have one large booth for national and local candidates local Democratic officeholders who represent the power of the party rented individual booths separate from the one the party set up for the McGovernShriver ticket One young candidate who did share the McGovern booth explained it this way The only ones willing to use this booth are those of us who have never been elected The others will allow their literature to be passed out at McGovern headquarters but theyre staying away from him at least for now They just dont know how people are going to take him and theyre afraid to take a Chance Senator McGoverns meeting with Governor Gilligan and other party leaders today should help the situation but labor holds the key to Ohio for Senator McGovern Our biggest single job Mr Sklar said is persuasion persuading the traditional voteto stay with the Democratic nominee and labors going to have to do the bulk of that work because thats where most of the repeater Democratic votes are With nearly 15 million members organized labor is an obvious force in a state that cast 39 million votes in the 1968 election that President Nixon won by just over 90000 votes Despite the national AFLCIO policy of neutrality in the current race a strong labor representation for Senator McGovern is shaping up here
European Money Views Held Divided,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/06/archives/european-money-views-held-divided-europeans-monetary-views-termed.html,ALPBACH Austria Sept 5The president of the Austrian National Bank said today that major European nations would come to the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund at the end of this month divided and uncertain as to their views on longterm reform of the world financial system The negotiations to reform the financial system are one result of President Nixons decision in August 1971 to cut the link between the dollar and gold and to devalue the dollar Formal talks are slated to begin in Washington in connection with the IMF meeting In an interview following the closing session of the 1972 Alpbach European Forum Wolfgang Schmitz the head of the Austrian central bank said that only the pressure of events would bring the 10 nations of the enlarged European Common Market to a unified position on overhaul of international money mechanics Each crisis each threat of crisis he said brings new pressure Separately European financial experts here appeared to be in agreement that the deficits in both the United States balance of international trade and its overall balance of payments would be gradually reduced in the months ahead although the amount and timing of this improvement was not specified But experts warned that the days of automatic surpluses in the nations balance of trade which the United States enjoyed prior to 1971were not likely to return Meanwhile a high European financial official predicted here in a separate interview that the United States would advocate an automatic crawlingpeg system for adjusting currency values when the IMF meeting convened in Washington In rough outline in such a systemwhich has been strongly advocated by Fritz Machlup who recently retired as a professor of economics at Princeton University and who has been acting as an adviser to the Treasury Departmentcurrency values would be changed by small regular amounts in accordance with the terms of a predetermined formula Such a formula might include for instance data on a countrys international balance of payments its rate of increase in prices the performance of its currency in the foreignexchange markets and so forth If the formula indicated say that a certain currency should be reduced in value relative to other currencies then the change would be more in small steps at predictable intervals to provide a smooth transition in foreignexchange markets At the same time the official who asked not to be identifiedindicated serious concern that a new dollar crisis could erupt around the end of this year Should a new run on the dollar develop this official said the major European central banksfor example the Bundesbank West Germanys central bankwould be faced with three main choices of action In the opinion of this official these choices would be the following Absorb additional dollars over and above holdings already swollen by past foreignexchange crises to preserve the interim pattern of foreignexchange rates that was agreed to at the Smithsonian Institution last December Allow currencies to float upward thus further widening the longterm trade advantage that the United States gained last year with its devaluation of about 12 per cent in the international value of the dollar Impose further controls on the movement of international capital to preserve existing rate relationships and yet avoid further massive dollar inflows The Most Probable Course Of the three courses the official said the third is both the most probable and the most likely to be damaging to the growth of world trade and investment In the closing discussions of the Alpbach Forum at which European leaders gather annually to consider broad social economic and political issues a wide range of views were expressed on the likelihood of the formation of a meaningful monetary union in Europe widely regarded as an essential first step on the road to the creation of a common currency here In an European monetary union currencies of nations here might be tightly locked together while as a bloc they might float in relation to say the dollar and the Japanese yen George H Chittenden senior vice president of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York and one of Americas leading international bankers described European monetary union as an intellectual abortion Mr Chittenden while recognizing the pressures in Europe for monetary unity expressed grave doubts that such a system would work given the deep differences on financial matters among the major nations here Mr Chittenden who was one of a small number of Americans invited to the conference also expressed a view that chaos has played an important role as a catalyst in producing agreement among nations on international financial matters Mr Chittenden predicted that the current calm in international money markets would continue in the months ahead so that in a perverse sense an important spur to agreement on world money overhaul would be lacking Dr Schmitz of the Austrian National Bank as well as many other speakers took a different view of the probability that the main nations in Europe would be able eventually to link their currencies tightly He answered yes when asked whether European monetary union was an idea whose time has come The time is ripe he said Dr Schmitz added that Austria and Switzerlandwhich as political neutrals are not allowed to join the Common Markethad already taken steps to tie their currencies closely to those of the nations within the market with which they do the bulk of their trade The Common Market countries are France Italy West Germany the Netherlands Belgium and Luxembourg Sir Brandon Rhys Williams a Conservative member of the British Parliament made much the same point in summarizing a panel discussion held this morning The will for monetary unity was present Sir Brandon asserted and the timetable for its accomplishment was less important than that the right steps be taken in getting to that goal He did not elaborate Britain plans to join the market as do Ireland Denmark and Sweden The major issue Dr Schmitz said was whether the European bloc as it took shape would be inwardlooking and protectionist in its trade policies or outwardlooking and liberal Especially for small nations such as Asutria he asserted free trade is vital if they are to prosper
A talk with Eleanor Mc Govern,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/10/archives/a-talk-with-eleanor-mcgovern-eleanor.html,Eleanor McGovern was midway through one the more hectic days of her year She and the children were leaving for Miami the next day and there were still a million things to be done Phone calls shopping packing Steve needed shoes and Mary needed stockings and someone had to take Atticus to the vet And to top it all off here was this magazine writer sitting in her living room peering at her through dark glasses asking endless questions about things like birth control and how you mix politics and marriage and her daughter Terrys marijuana arrest She had very mixed feelings about this interview It was nice to be asked something besides whos your favorite dress designer or what color youd paint the Blue Room but still some of the questions were so personal That was the hardest thing about dealing with the press trying to decide how much of your life should be public and how much you could cling to as private Whats your feeling on the abortion issue the writer asked Mom wheres the iron her daughter Ann called from the kitchen Look in the closet Eleanor McGovern called back Then to the writer Abortion A little sigh Im not sure Ive got my head together on that Just then Mary her 16yearold wandered in tall girl in a short skirt a girl who not long ago left the McGovern familys traditional Methodism for the Roman Catholic Church Mom Ive got to go get some stockings Do you have any money I can charge it Mary our bills so huge already Mother its only two pair of stockings All right But no dresses Only the stockings Mary departs and Eleanor McGovern turns back to the interviewer Excuse me Where were we On abortion Oh yes Well I think the issue should be handled at the state level Then you agree with your husbands position Eleanor McGovern hesitated The safest thing was just to say yes But she wasnt entirely sure she did agree with her husbands positionhis position essentially being to avoid the issue I have mixed feelings about abortion she said finally I wish the stress could be on contraception I have to admit that dislike abortion except in extreme cases I read a study of whats happening in England A high percentage of the women who have abortions there never bothered with contraception I dont like that casual attitude toward human life Abortion should be a last resort Eleanor The interviewer asked Mrs McGovern about her disagreement with her husband on the amnesty issue She smiled We do have a difference on amnesty and neither of us will relent George thinks that boys who left the country to avoid the draft should just be allowed to return and resume their lives but I think they should be required to serve a year or two of alternative service The reason I came to that opinion was from visiting childcare centers and seeing COs performing alternative service there and how much good they were doing We both get mail on the issue People write to him and say Dont let your wife mind  The next question was about birth controlhow does Mrs McGovern as the mother of five feel about it If I were married now I wouldnt have five but Im glad I did My children have all decided theyre not going to have more than two But after the war we had the baby boommost of my friends have large families Knowing what we know now about the overpopulation problem I think its almost irresponsible to have so many But I wanted a large family All our children were planned I wanted six and George wanted four so we had five Atticus whod been monitoring the interview groaned and rolled over Atticus is a huge 3yearold Newfoundland whos had a lot of problems He was hit by a car and his hip was bothering him again and it looked as if hed have to go back to the vet and into traction again The talk turned to campaigning and the strain it put on family life Since January Ive usually spent four days a week campaigning and three days at home My two older daughters have taken turns managing the household while Im away When Im campaigning an average day starts at 7 in the morning and ends at midnight Then I come home and my children meet me at the door with their problems Whichever place I am Im not quite sure its the right one Its been difficult I dont change my environment easily Each time is a jolt My life is a little bit out of control now and I dont quite like it Ive always been in control of life before Atticus groaned again one of her sonsinlaw came in the writer finally left and Eleanor McGovern returned to her shopping and packing and telephoning Somehow the next afternoon they all caught the plane for Miami And Miami was a good week a very good week the kind of week that made it all seem worthwhile The weekly transition from mother to political campaigner has often agonized Eleanor McGovern but her political value is beyond dispute The spectacle of a candidates wife who is attractive articulate and willing to address the issues has impressed voters and the media On one of her August campaign trips Mrs McGovern had 15 reporters traveling with her and her press aide Mary Hoyt now talks of chartering a plane for the candidates wife and her entourage just as they do for the candidate At this writing Mrs McGovern is involved in negotiations with both Meet the Press and Issues and Answers and her appearance on either television program would be unprecedented for candidates wife Theres also been some banter about debate between Mrs McGovern and Mrs Nixon It would be to say the least an inter Mrs McGovern has surfaced as a national figure since her husbands nomination in July but her value to his Presidential hopes goes back to the early primary months This years primaries were different from all those before in that there were simply so many of them No can The life of a candidates wife didate could give much time to all 20odd states But if he had an acceptable standin he could in effect be in two places at once And Eleanor McGovern is a most acceptable standin She says essentially the same things her husband says and many people think she says them better Her main campaign activities have been her interviews her listening tours and to a lesser extent her speechmaking Shes probably beeri interviewed a thousand times this year an ordeal that has paid off with endless priceless publicity for the McGovern cause In her interviews shes patient softspoken factual and unflappable The question shes most often asked seems to be What question are you most often asked followed by questions on the war the economy and her dress size An altered 4 Her husbands advisers are unanimous in their respect for her political abilities One of them says I think shes a lot like him in that curious combination of political shrewdness thats almost hidden by an unsophisticated appearance She has good instincts Theyre not confused by all the scars you pick up if you go through the tong wars in a state like New York You can preserve more of your innocence in South Dakota politics The Senator listens to her She doesnt press him like some Washington wives think she picks and chooses her issues And she has good instincts on people Shes loyal to the people who were loyal to him She doesnt forget her friends or forget those who werent friends either Like him shes tougher than she looks Another McGovern adviser adds The funny thing is that she doubts herself and worries every time she has to give a speech and all that She doesnt realize how good she is For all her political activity Mrs McGovern sees herself as a woman playing supportive role to her husbands career rather than as a liberated woman in the sense that feminists use the term Im for womens liberation in the fullest sense of the word she says A woman should have the right to fulfill her potential as much as a man Obviously that means equal pay for equal work and equal access to education But if a woman wants to be a wife and mother she should be able to do that without being scorned by other women who want a career have a daughter who worked in the womens liberation movement Now shes married and has children and sees that it is part of her life but not all of her life I agreed with my husband on the The first thing you notice about Eleanor McGovern is that she is very pretty and very small She was a cheerleader in high school naturally to be elected a cheerleader is an American girls first step toward success its like those exams they used to give all English schoolboys at age II and there are pictures of her in her 20s looking like a movie starlet the Vera Ellen type full of bounce and sparkle She remains at 50 a strikingly attractive woman with luminous blue eyes an easy amused smile and a trim figure that she keeps trim by nightly calisthentics Shes barely five feet tall and the rigors of campaigning have her down to 94 pounds from her accustomed 100 She seems more accessible than her husband He once wanted to be a clergyman and he maintains that moralistic Methodist preachers set to his jaw but she seems somehow more sophisticated more able to accept life as it comes She grew up in a political family Unlike George I grew up a DemocratI tease him about that and she fully shares his political concerns For a husband and wife to be happy in political life she says its indispensable that she be as interested in politics as he is I think that in our family politics has been cohesive We discuss the issues day and night Sometimes I think we discuss them too muchour children think they grew up in world with nothing but problems The domestic issue that most concerns her is child care Id like to be the White House childrens advocate she says We think of ourselves as a childoriented society but actually weve neglected our very small children I mean from birth to 5 Head Start taught us that starting at 4 or 5 isnt early enough We need to start with prenatal care and then think of the childs environment and nutrition and how much hes learning ia the early months She has worked as a volunteer with the Parent and Child Care Center in Washington going into lowincome homes with a professional worker and teaching mothers the basics of caring for their children She often visits childcare centers around the country and consults with experts in the field No one who knows her doubts that should she become First Lady she would be an activist in the tradition of Eleanor Roosevelt and Lady Bird Johnson There is something of deeper interest about Eleanor McGovern than either her personal qualities or her political opinions She and her husband as much as anyone in politics today have been caught up in what Justice Holmes once called the passion and action of their time Theyre seventies people their lives have reflected the uncertainties and frustrations known to millions of Americans in recent years They came out of Middle America were married during the war were caught up in the political optimism that Stevenson and Kennedy and Johnson brought to their party Then came Vietnam political disillusion the everwidening generation gap and finally as old hopes died new realities The McGoverns have watched as their children accepted ideas and values different from their own Theyve stood by helplessly while their son wrestled with his conscience over the draft Theyve been shattered by the news that their daughter was in jail on a marijuana charge It isnt the serene confident allknowing image that politicians like to project yet one might say that their lives have been very close to the American reality in a time of torment and change The contrast with the Nixons is clear and inevitable The Nixons are fifties people a portrait by Normal Rockwell a family that whatever its political ups and downs has seemed immune to the woes and anxieties that have beset so many others One does not say this scornfully The Nixons embody traditional values values that the McGoverns respect as well But in a time of change the Nixons and the people they represent have clung to the old certitudes while the McGoverns and the people they represent have struggled with the new uncertainties This years election will offer a choice that is as much cultural as political a choice between two views of the American reality Eleanor McGoverns rootsare deep in Middle AmericaShe was born Eleanor Stegeberg on a farm near Woonsocket S D and at age 13she could milk a cow as fastas her father In high schoolshe was a debater as well asa cheerleader and she firstmet her husband when theywere on rival debate teamsLegend has it that she andher twin sister Ila defeatedMcGovern and his partner inthis first debate but she saysnow that she doesnt thinkthat was the case The twoteams debated several timesshe says and all she remembers is that she and Ila wononce When she enrolled at Dakota Wesleyan UniversityMcGovern was there stardebater and class leader andthey began to date By thetime he entered the Air Force early in 1943 they were engaged We planned not to marry until the war was over and he had his degrees she says We were going to be very sensible But when he got to basic training he wrote and suggested we get married earlier instead of waiting Id been eagerly awaiting that letterI wanted so much to marry him But for me to say so in that day would have been much too forward might have hinted but Id never have asked him to marry me They were married on Halloween 1943 and spent several hectic months moving from one Air Force base to another until he was sent to Europe to fly B24s Eleanor went back to Woonsocket pregnant and frightened for his safety She still remembers her fear whenever someone knocked on the door or the phone rang Finally her husband came home but changed even more serious than before For a while he had nightmares about planes crashing friends dying and then he decided to study for the ministry She wasnt sure she was cut out to be a ministers wife She liked to have fun and it wasnt any fun when their friends would want to go bowling and he didnt think bowling was quite proper for a ministerial student Then he switched back to teaching and she guessed her future was as a professors wife and then he switched again to politics as a Democratic organizer in South Dakota The babies kept coming alongAnn in 1945 Susan in 1946 Terry in 1949 Steven in 1952 and Mary in 1955and there was never much money In college they had the GI bill and she worked as a secretary and when things were really tight theyd search the campus for empty sodapop bottles they could turn in for the 2cent deposit For this reason Mrs McGovern finds it hard to understand the ambivalence toward college of her two younger children Mary isnt sure she wants to goSteve after a period of vacillation will enter Dakota Wesleyan this fall When McGovern became a Democratic organizer there wasnt any salary unless he could raise it himselfa good fundraising dinner she says meant more meat in her casserole Daughter No 3 There wasnt any real financial security until 1956 when McGovern got himself elected to Congress But political success brought new problems During his campaign she would sometimes cry when she saw the newspaper editorials calling him a Communist dupe because he favored the admission of China to the UN Finally she quit reading the editorials Today she says she doesnt cry Im tougher now Im not so hurt by what people say But sometimes I get very angry I think I respond more strongly than George does Sometimes I just quit reading certain columnists Finally there were the problems of reconciling political life and family life Mrs McGovern long ago decided that some personal sacrifice is necessary to advance the causes she and her husband both believe in Yet she is the first to admit that it hasnt been easy particularly where the children were concerned The worst year she says was 1961 Her husband had been defeated in his 1960 race for the Senate and had accepted John Kennedys offer to be director of his Food for Peace program The question was what Eleanor and the children should do Our children had changed schools so often she says So we decided I should stay in South Dakota and he would visit us when he could Our oldest was 16 then and with all the problems 16 entails I wasnt prepared for her adolescence and all its problems and had to cope with it alone She so All of the children have gone through periods of resenting Georges career The next year McGovern was elected to the Senate Eleanor and the children moved back to Washington and the new Senator promised to stop working nights and weekends and spend more time with his family Their future might have been relatively serene were not their lives soon to be shaken by a force that would shatter so many lives the war in Vietnam The war changed us she says Our concern was so deep I came to feel so strongly that I felt I had to escape I gave up watching the 11 oclock news because if I saw something about the war might not be able to sleep By the midsixties as McGovern emerged as a leading antiwar spokesman his pledge to restrict his travels was forgotten And when he was home he increasingly saw the wars impact on his own children Steve was only 11 years old when George first spoke against the war Mrs McGovern recalls We didnt dream it would go on so long that he would be involved but then it was time for him to register for the draft and he wasnt sure what he wanted to do We found out that theres little a parent can do except say We support you Steve thought about applying for CO status We made two appointments for him to see a draft counselor but he didnt show up for either one We felt so helpless We felt there was nothing we could do to help him He never did apply for CO status but he drew a high number in the draft lottery 235 I think so he wont be drafted I dont know what he would have done if hed drawn a low McGoverns public and private lives were also joined in the summer of 1968 when while he was trying to decide whether or not to challenge Hubert Humphrey for the Democratic nomination his daughter Terry was arrested for possession of marijuana She was arrested in a motel in Rapid City where she and some friends had been canvassing for her fathers reelection campaign The manager of the motel uncovered some marijuana while cleaning her room and called the police Terry was taken to jail and when she was allowed to place a call she called her mother who was in Washington The Senator was in California meeting with Kennedy supporters who were urging him to run for President I was here at home Mrs McGovern recalls and Terrys call came in the middle of the night just like in the movies I called a lawyer out there Then I had to decide whether to call George or not I knew he had a very important speech the next day I asked our lawyer if the press knew about the arrest He said they did So I did call George that nightI didnt want him to hear about it from the press My daughter Ann and I flew out the next morning Steve and Sue got into the car and drove out all the way from Washington George came out the next day All we knew then was that the State Legislature had just made possession a felony I think Terry had no conception of the deep trouble she was in She was still in a state of shock She was unapproachable for several days We were all devastated George was too more than we knew He was magnificent He devoted full time to Terry and the lawyers We all drew together and learned some lessons about loyalty and priorities The charge against Terry was eventually dropped because of a flaw in the warrant But before that was known the McGoverns had gone to a resort in the Black Hills to be with Terry and also for the Senator to decide whether or not to challenge Humphrey At one point he told his wife If the country is so mixed up that even our daughter is playing with drugs maybe I ought to run Since her daughters arrest Mrs McGovern has read reports and talked to experts about marijuana and has been frustrated by the conflicting opinions she has encountered She believes that until marijuana has been proved harmless it should be decriminalized but not legalized She would also like to see a crackdown on those who sell hard drugs as well as mandatory treatment for addicts McGovern did run in 1968 briefly and unsuccessfully and after that the question was whether he should launch a serious campaign for the 1972 nomination By 1969 I had to face up to it Mrs McGovern says I admit I was reluctant for various reasons some of them selfish but not all I wanted to feel sure he was the man for the time that the country was ready for him I didnt want him to go through all that unless he could win would ask him Why Why do you want to do this Once he thought a long time and said I dont know Its just something I feel I have to do I think that was a good The kids werent urging him to run They had ambivalent feelings then and still do today Ann said I dont want dad to run but I think he should In the past few months Ive had my other question answeredhe is the man for the timebut I wasnt so sure at first I dont have the sensitivity to see trends in the country that George sees Its instinctive with him It was enhanced by his study of history but the basic instinct is there and I trust it

How to talk with Barbara Walters about practically anything,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/10/archives/how-to-talk-with-barbara-walters-about-practically-anything-roy.html,Each weekday morning between the hours of and 9 more than eight million Americans switch on their television sets and accept the National Broadcasting Companys chatty initiation into another round of human events The show is appropriately called Today It is now in its 20th year the most familiar face belongs to a wellgroomed 40yearold woman with a curiously rigid upper lip and an accent that seems to have foundered somewhere between Boston and the Bronx She is Barbara Walters for eight years a prominent if supportive member of the Today cast and the only woman in television to occupy such an exalted position on a regular network program of news and commentary This is Barbara Walters Were just breaking her in RICHARD NIXON TO CHOU ENLAI In the last three years her reputation has grown disproportionately to that of the show and the others making up todays Today triumvirateFrank McGee the official host and Joe Garagiola an excatcher with the National League She has managed to obtain exclusive filmed interviews with important and heretofore unapproachable peopleRichard Nixon former Secretary of State Dean Rusk Prince Philip Henry Ford She was the only woman reporting on the Presidents trip to Peking on American television She has transformed the Today girl from an adornment parroting predigested scriptsbefore her women on the show were predominantly actresses with a remarkably high mortality rate known contemptuously as tea passersto an integral member exercising critical judgment and politely manipulating interviewees She also hosts her own local television show Not for Women Only  daily halfhour panel discussions that have become so popular NBC would like to syndicate the series in the fall Her seventhfloor office overlooks a sea of limegreen umbrellas in the pit of Rockefeller Center The walls are occupied by photographs of Barbara Walters interviewing Lyndon Johnson Golda Meir Ted Kennedy and the Shah of Iran and framed letters of appreciation Hubert Humphrey Wont you call on me whenever I can be of assistance Dean Rusk If NBC vice presidents ever begin to bother you show them this letter and others like it and tell them to leave you alone A fulllength mirror hangs on the back of the door facing an enlarged snapshot of her 4yearold adopted daughter Jacqueline in yellow rain gear is 915 AM and she is already seated at her desk eating a bagel and going over mail that includes some of the hundreds of fan letters Today receives each week Her makeup and hairstreaked strawberry blond arranged by the hairdresser three hours beforeremain precise She has just participated in an interview with Averell Harriman in which she was so eager to ask her questions that back in the control room Todays producer Stuart Schulberg shouted For Gods sake Barbara leave the man alone Her manner reflects none of the pressures of a harried professional life Nothing is more beguiling in this age of kooks and neurotics than the sunniness of a good mood she wrote in her autobiographical book How to Talk With Practically Anybody About Practically Anything The book is dedicated to the men I have always found it easiest to talk withmy husband Lee Guber my father Lou Waltersand the enlightened males at NBC who took a chance on an unknown girl and ultimately made this book possible In a few minutes she must go downstairs to a studio full of eager heavily dressed women and moderate five sessions of Not for Women Only She briefly discusses an upcoming program on new marriage styles with Jane Murphy the book editor and says Keep out the hominess Well find a young couple living together I can ask those cryptic conservative questions like what will happen when they grow old Jane Murphy asks if Barbara at the age of 22 worried about what would happen when she was 40 and Barbara tells her pleasantly I did but thats my problem Barbara Walters has talked with many people about many things Indeed those conversations and the lessons to be drawn from them are the meat of her book which begins A few years ago I found myself at lunch with Aristotle Onassis and the indicators of her considerable success The one conversation not included in the book is that of an interviewer being interviewedadmittedly an unhappy situation Before I met Barbara Walters she called me by telephone to discuss granting me an interview She said Me in The New York Times Magazine Wow Im smiling and kind of frightened I dont expect anybody to do a puff piece but some nice things have happened to me Ill talk to you if youre a friend I guess I want you to promise to like me When we did meet she said But I want to know about you and then suggested that I postpone writing the article so that it wouldnt be published at a time when many New Yorkers were away on vacation and might not read it At lunch at the Promenade Cafe she wept over quiche Gruyere while confessing to an unhappy childhood At one point she asked me Will I be interviewing you some day The trouble with such an arrangement is that it places the interviewer in an awkward position and inevitably leads to the subjects being upsetas Barbara eventually waswhen the interviewer asks undiplomatic questions Barbara badly wants her own network television show and she thinks she may eventually get it because among other things people write articles about me A great many people have done just that the articles are remarkably similar The inter viewer experiences more than dj vu when Barbara tells him in serious considered tones fingertips pressed together that she wore bobby socks and Cuban heels the first time she entered a New York private school that when she married for the second time shortly after John F Kennedys assassination she and Lee Guber didnt really want to be married but just to cling together stormily that she would like to lead a normal life in which she would not have to rise at 445 AM and could stay up all night reading a trashy novel She declined to give an example of a trashy novel Her friend the novelist Jacqueline Susann when asked Barbaras taste in novels said We never discuss literature Barbara is concerned about her image She defers to the men on the Today show allows them to ask their questions first tries not to be too authoritative or people will say Im aggressive When Life magazine published a photograph two years ago of Barbara wearing a midislcirt under the line When I wear a midi thats it she was very concerned about its effect upon the attitude of her viewers Life later published Barbaras letter denying the remark  the confident zany or sexy image that the performer projects to the public is often a piece of fictionHow to Talk With Practically Anyone About Practically Anything She believes women watching television identify with me because Im not beautiful or remote When questioned about her politics Barbara says I dont see what that has to do with my image It pleases me that no one in the audience knows my political beliefs She later described herself as a liberal Democrat Jacqueline Susann describes Barbaras television image as superclippeda fair working definition On the screen Barbara is not cool but assiduously almost painfully tailored Her style is persistent not aggressive and it is this unrelenting effort to keep the confabulatory ball bouncing that puts some viewers on edge Cyclops said in a review of the Today show in Life magazine She is afraid of silence she flails about in conversations as though they were trapdoors and the bottom might fall out Helen Gurley Brown the writer and editor apparently means to compliment her friend Barbara when she says I think theres a real cache of bitchiness lurking but Ive never seen it Neither have the millions of her regular viewers one of whom is Dean Rusk He says of the public Barbara Walters She manages to be feminine without being mincing Reaction to the Walters image varies Some housewives consider her their representative who asks the questions they would like to ask once woman shouted after Barbara had spoken publicly Thank God for Barbara Walters others resent the fact that she is so wellappointed so early in the morning think that her job is easy and that she talks too much during interviews Professional opinion is as various Critic Judith Crist says I respect Barbara mightily as a journalist and as a person A wellknown television personality and a man who hosts a popular nonnetwork talk show says Barbara Walters has the most abrasive personality this side of Yenan Its like your fingernail scraping on a frosted window pane The degree of her success is the mystery of the decade The real Barbara Walters was born into a family with little money and an unhappy history An older brother died her older sister Jacqueline suffered slight mental retardation Barbara grew up believing that God afflicted at least one member of every family Her mother was a straight lady who liked her privacy Her father was Lou Walters  a sensitive bookish Englishman and a vaude Dignity is a classy coinmodityIbid ville booking agent who during the nineteenthirties started a nightclub in an old Boston church and called it the Latin Quarter He made a lot of money quickly founded other clubs in Miami and New York Barbara was shuttled between cities and schools without time to form close friendships with other students in Florida she often spent nights in the clubs light booth watching the performers  Willie Howard Emile Boreal Milton Berle Sophie Tucker I always felt that I was on the outside looking in at a normal family situation didnt know fathers were supposed to come home for supper I wanted to be normal to live in the suburbs was conscientious  I made good gradesbut I wasnt an easy kid I was too introspective In New York she went to Fieldston and Birch Wathen private schools which a lot of Jewish girls attend but she felt out of place Her father developed what she calls a Mike Todd syndrome He had no regard for money We spent it when we had it The Walterses lived in penthouses took a grand tour of Europe by car they remained preoccupied with Jacqueline With that particular family problem Barbara was torn between duty and release When we got older my sister would ask me to fix her up with boys as I did my other girl friends It was a difficult situation I always had this insecurity partly because of that and partly because I knew how quickly the money could come and go She attended Sarah Lawrence where she majored in French and continued to make good grades A schoolmate and still a close friend Dorothy Sheckman says Barbara would elicit things from other people instead of talking about herself She was more of an observer than a participator She didnt go in much for college weekends and things like that Following graduation she married a successful young Jewish businessman who would provide what I thought I wanteda normal suburban life The marriage was annulled after a year She attended secretarial school went to Europe returned to work briefly on the CBS program with Walter Cronkite before taking a publicists job with Tex McCrary Inc Her father went bankrupt and suffered a heart attack after the sumptuous Cafe de Paris failed and the family was broke again That was a real education Barbara says We were suddenly bereft I probably would have stayed married if I had anticipated that I would have been too scared to call it off She worked hard at McCrary where I had to plant news items and be aggressive I hated it but I was very good at it She applied for and received a job on Today as a writer and researcher and there she learned the basics of television production A close friend at that time was Roy Cohn the attorney closely associated with Senator Joseph McCarthys hearings in the early nineteenfifties who had met Barbara at her fathers Miami Latin Quarter several years before Cohn remembers being introduced by Lou Walters who said My daughter wanted to meet you Shes a great admirer of yours Barbara then said I wanted to meet you Shes a great admirer of yours Barbara then said I wanted to meet you Period Cohn found Barbara a standup girl all the way very independent but very soft She had a mind like a steel trap She and my mother never got along They were both strong women My mother always wanted me to get married as long as I didnt get married to anybody The copy of Cohns book A Fool for a Client in Barbaras office bears the inscription For ChickieWho I always knew would accomplish Joe vlcCarthys dream of restoring me to daytime television Barbara prospered at Today she received occasional assignments on the air Then she was sent to cover Jacqueline Kennedys trip to India She began to appear regularly on the show with Judith Crist the film and theater critic and the late Aline Saarinen the art critic and developed a competent oncamera presence Judith Crist remembers their conversations in the makeup room before the shows We said very witty bitchy things about people Barbara was a typical New Yorkervery quick on the uptake and I like that She wasnt just another cutesypooh girl reporter The man generally given the credit for discovering Barbara Walters was To It may be that really threatening women are passed over for promotion and leadershipIbid days producer Al Morgan He first considered using her as the regular woman on the show when she reported from Washington following the assassination of John F Kennedy Barbara was the only woman I could have sent She reflected intelligence and maturity She did have a lateral lispthe Ws came out sounding like Ss or Vs Boris Karloff had the same kind of lisp We sent her to remedial speech school for that and the Boston accent She cold bloodedly educated herself and eventually took over the position of the Today girl Through prescience not glamour she survived in an essentially predatory industry In this business says a veteran writer you need eyes in your back and your own sharp knife She met Guber in 1961 on a blind date and married him two years later Cohn claims to have proposed to her the night before she married Gu Roy Cohn who knows them both thinks Barbara Walters and Richard Nixon are two of a kind Both have a crisp factuality a noglamour approach ber but Barbara denies it There I was at Chez Vitos Cohn says talking to her on the telephone for an hour told her Id marry her She said she couldnt marry me because she and Guber had already given a present to the judge The Gubers maintained separate apartments for six months before moving in together Much has been written about the fact that the Gubers stayed together although both led demanding disparate lives he owns a string of suburban theaters on the East Coast and was away from home for a part of almost every week Some people were surprised when Barbara and her husband agreed to a temporary separation in July The household had seemed to function smoothly with Ichodel Richards a Jamaican woman doing the cooking and cleaning and Zelle short for Mademoiselle to care for the Gubers daughter As recently as June Guber said that their lives had settled since Jacqueline was adopted Barbara has declined to talk about the separation but a close personal friend said They are trying desperately to work it out They still have tremendous The living room of Barbaras threebedroom apartment is a blend of bright contemporaneity  scarlet sofas shag rugs an arching aluminum lampand a kind of Victorian stolidness reflected in the furniture they acquired from Barbaras parents who now live in Miami with her sister an ornate bronze clock a pillow covered with partridge feathers A wellbehaved Jacqueline is allowed to have cheese and crackers in the presence of a guest before being whisked away to supper she appears again for dessert after being bathed and dressed for bed by Zelle Her mother sings her songs from a childs picture book in a nursery lined with an army of stuffed animals They were all presdidnt Inevitably Barbara must go to bed early to be up fore dawn and begin the by nowmuchpublicized routine of dressing in clothes laid out the night before  brightly colored blouses skirts long enough to cover her knees when she sits She leaves the apartment without waking her child a limousine provided by NBC drives her eight blocks to the studios so familiar in various stages of halflight that she has developed a proprietorial feeling for the whole block around Radio City Music Hall Once she casually mentioned to Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy that people were sometimes mugged there at dawn and the next day the area was swarming with patrolmen Upstairs at NBC she sits gripping a styrofoam cup of coffee while she is made up and her hair arranged She discusses lastminute problems with Schulberg with the Today location writer and the other principals taking her seat behind the table just before the birdNBCs manycolored She describes Today as the only game in town Its hard to make a place in television for a woman If I just came into the studio every morning I would never be chosen as the interviewer instead of another man I have to get my own interviews Im not whining or bitter feel no competition with the other menthat would ruin the show But there are certain things I have to do to maintain my position dont have a specialtyan art but I have developed a particular type of interview Im good at drawing people outtheres a thin line between asking critical questions well and making someone mad Also Im here to provide some femininity She describes herself as a pragmatist not a romantic I hate grossness and toughness but Ill step on someones sensibilities if the interview demands it Her values are conventional whether they pertain to the structure of a television program It should have a hooker a teaser and a conclusion social intercourse The wife of a prominent newspaperman told Henry Kissinger at a dinner party that he was a murderer because of his policy on Vietnam I dont think that was proper or society in general I suppose we need the mid Ive confronted my own stuffiness and Ive decided to keep it Ibid die will change But she is in favor of legalized abortion  Because of my image as a reporter I cant take a public stand Ive been criticized for not being up front Ms [magazine] wanted me to sign a paper saying that I had an abortion I didnt sign it because I havent had an abortion but then I wouldnt have signed it anyway Militant feminists have done a lot but theyve also given American kind of national inferiority complex Theres something unattractive about the way they spar on television  Writer Gloria Steinem sees Barbara Walters as a transitional person In an earHer state of consciousness she was one of the few women on television not just serving coffee She asks the same questions as a male interviewer but women realize that shes sympathetic She feels she has to ask those roundeyed male NBC questions because the adult world has male values Letty Pogrebin a founding editor of Ms says Barbara is in an uncomfortable position as a token The Today show represents the general media myopia concerning women were still sidebar stuff to them She doesnt want to bite the hand that feeds her and I dont blame her It is interesting to note that the only people with uncomlimentary things to say about Barbara Walters and who were willing to be identified were women This may say something about the nature of women in general it certainly says something about her influence Journalist Nora Ephron admitted that she didnt want to say anything detrimental about Barbara beit might keep me form journalist and a critic describes Barbara as chameleonlike At first she was antistudent and antifeminist She was even against women wearing slacks Today is one of the most mindcontrolling programs and the banal patter on the show is appalling She exercises a mockcritical role Everything is mediocritized I dont know if its her or the medium Today in Miami Beach Most prominent male television personalities in New York declined to comment upon Barbara either personally or through their secretaries Jack Lescoulie said I have nothing to say about Barbara Walters either on or off the record The nonnetwork talkshow host who spoke of her abrasive personality said Youre going to write another puff piece For some reason people are terribly afraid of Barbara and then asked not to be quoted A man who used to write for Today offers an explanation Barbaras not important enough for important people to attack People are afraid of her not because shes an ogre but because of economic reprisals  failure to get on the show failure to get a job Hugh Downs for years the Today host says Insecure males always get upset by competition in their own baili Weve emerged so abruptly from kitchens and nurseries that many of us are unsure of the right verbal fork to use Ibid wick Working with Barbara is like working with a jazz musiciantheres mutual support a kind of symbiosis Shes real The interview that brought her the most celebrity was the one with President Nixon more than a year ago She had met the President while covering events at the White House she had interviewed Tricia Nixon and proved she wasnt just an emptyheaded Goldilocks The President had been instrumental in securing Barbara an interview with Prince Philip When he decided to pay tribute to his wife and other First Ladies Barbara received a phone call from press secretary Ron Ziegler to come to Washington Her detractors claim the Nixon interview illustrates the fact that Barbara is an easy interviewer that she doesnt press crucial questions and force the subject to reveal himself through adversity She claims that she did get Nixon to reveal himselfthat he mentioned the war briefly and drugs American youth and his own imagebut that she accomplished it in a discreet and oblique manner The following she considers their most crucial exchange BARBARA WALTERS There has been a lot of talk Mr President about your image and the fact that the American publicforgive me Mr Presidentsees you as rather a stuffy man and not a human man Are youoh dearare you worried about your image Mr President RICHARD NIXON Not at all In her book she said Nixon has sex appealhes slim and suntanned and well hes just sexy thats all And I call that charming In private she says that the President is tremendously loyal I dont want to lose my credentials as a reporter so dont want to be identified too closely with the Nixons Some people think Im the Nixon girl the White House pet That depends on your point of view Remember I was the first one to get an interview with Teddy Kennedy after Chappaquiddick Questions about Nixons policies make her uneasy I have a certain position If you misquote me it could make things difficult I think we should get right out of Vietnam I dont think the President has done much domestically The fact that he ignored his own committees report on population leaves me cold I dont think we realize how deeply conservative the President is A man who knows both Barbara Walters and Richard Nixon is Roy Cohn who thinks they are two of kind Both have a crisp factu ality a noglamour approach Both have a cool fast undramatic presentation Never underestimate the power of a President Ibid Barbara defines power as the ability to control to direct or coerce Television personalities have a certain amount of power If I thought about the power I couldnt sit up there on the Today show every morning It scares me but Im not going to kvetch Easily discernible among the froth and dropped names of How to Talk With Practically Anybody About Practically Anything is the fact that the author understands and is basically sympathetic to the needs and anxieties of others The book is a grateful testament to the discovery that her world functions in a fairly rational and unthreatening manner The trouble is that even that world is imperfect She has written  when approaching a celebrity who makes his or her living in Front of a camera

HUMANIZING ROLE OF RELIGION EYED,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/10/archives/humanizing-role-of-religion-eyed-3000-scholars-weigh-issue-in.html,LOS ANGELES Sept 9 More than 3000 Biblical scholars and theologians spent five days at an international congress here this week discussing Religion and the Humanizing of Man Theologians representing 15 learned societies participated in the general sessions and the presentation of 450 scholarly papers Dr James M Robinson professor of religion at Claremont Calif Graduate School was the organizer and chairman of the event called the International Congress of Learned Societies in the Field of Religion We pushed toward a new focus  the humanizing of man Dr Robinson said and the womens lib thing really happened here A female theology student delivered a paper calling for feminist ethic on abortion that would free women from alleged maleimposed morality Women with unwanted pregnancies are forced to act out the drama of sin punishment and absolution the script for which has been written by men charged Jean MacRae of Harvard Divinity School Thus she said women are pressured to think of their welfare as secondary to that of a barely beginning life 26 Countries Represented Fourteen internationally known religious scholars addressed the general sessions They used the congress theme in exploring war ecology politics education black America American Indians technology Buddhist and Christian views of man and modern concepts of salvation The theologians meeting in the Century Plaza Hotel came from 26 countries and Vatican City There were more than 200 European scholars and at least 20 from the Far East The 15 learned societies most of which held their annual meetings in conjunction with the congress represented Catholic Protestant and unaffiliated groups making up a broad spectrum of the worlds intellectual bodies concerned with religious thought Dr Robinson explaining the theme declared At a time when the place of religion is far from clear the urgent need to humanize mankind is thoroughly apparent Ultimately youve got to justify before our culture what youre doing Religion must come to a new way of looking at itself in Western civilization Dr Robinson said that each religion came to terms in some way with the concepts of sin and salvation But when this becomes rooted in talking primarily about the next life he said faith deteriorates and civilization is impeded The congress presupposes that religion is meant to grapple with this life Dr Robinson concluded Renewal Urged A renowned theologian at the University of Tubingen Germany warned against theology that has been reduced to anthropology Dr Walter Kasper called for a renewed theology a theology for man Man is not an abstract being who sits apart from the world he said Theology of man is not only transcendental and personal theology but also theology of the world theology of history and political theology A colleague Dr Ernst Kasemann a retired professor of New Testament at Tubingen and a longtime leader in German New Testament studies stressed the on going nature of Christian discipleship Today as never before he said faith has to develop reason and imagination The struggle against stupidity is even more strenuous and apparently more hopeless than the struggle against obvious wickedness since it is conducted below the surface of society and arouses hostility among the majority of the people Without reason and imagination the earth will sink back into chaos humanity will be lost and brutality will forever claim new victims

Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/15/archives/letter-to-the-editor-1-no-title.html,To the Editor I would like to raise the following question Who is the true subversive Nixon or McGovern Nixons acceptance speech fostered what has by this time become a national delusion that McGoverns campaign position is alien and dangerously radical He states for example they would destroy the system which has made America No1 in the world economically and [they] would take a sharp detour to the left which would lead to a dead end The characterization of McGovern as left of center is widely accepted by the press corps and seems unfortunately to be accepted to an increasing degree by McGovern himself and his campaign staff In fact McGovern provides a fullthroated exposition of the principles of liberal democracy His position is basically reformist he proposes to restore our national society to certain principles from which recent experience constitutes an unfortunate departure Each of McGoverns campaign positions is profoundly conservative in aim Through tax reform it is possible to reposition the members of society in their individual efforts to secure the amenities of life Since education is an essential element in achieving relative equality busing to produce racial balance in the schools is necessary McGoverns positions on marijuana and abortion do no more than restate the liberals belief that the state should not make in the individuals behalf decisions aiming to improve his moral conduct The absolute rights of private conscience are protected by McGoverns stand on amnesty for draft resisters Whether this oldfashioned often fervent statement of the liberal democratic faith is fully adequate to the problems which America faces is not an issue here The point is that McGovern is not left of center socialist half socialist or the like but occupies the dead center of American political tradition By way of contrast Mr Nixon provides a collapsed statement of the American credo The principle which is most proininently mentioned in Mr Nixons acceptance speech and elsewhere is the principle of possessive individualism This is an assertion of the right of the individual to be the sole owner of his talents and capacities owing nothing to society for them Applying this principle to wel fare for example Mr Nixon stated Let us be generous to those who cant work without increasing the tax burden of those who do work The statement is not calculated to produce a fresh awareness of the need for social generosity Missing from Mr Nixons publicly expressed concerns is a need to protect ingredients of the liberal faith such as procedural due process an independent judiciary and the right of conscientious political action President Nixon enthusiastically supports only one of the rights which Americans have traditionally enjoyed the right of possessive individualism Whether this truncated expression of liberal democracy has its sources in a genuine fear of subversion or in political expediency the point is Mr Nixons position is reactionary If Nixons view of the permissible boundaries of public opinion is allowed to prevail in this years general elections if his view is indeed extended and amplified by the press then much of the meaning of liberal democracy in America may be irretrievably lost It is therefore conceivable that Mr Nixon is the authentic subversive in this years Presidential campaign since he presents a substantial threat that the national debate will be forever impoverished and the character of American political institutions subtly and permanently transformed Asst Prof FRANK M COLEMAN State University College at Geneseo Geneseo N Y Sept 3 1972
Doctors’ Unlicensed Clinic Ordered to Halt Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/15/archives/doctors-unlicensed-clinic-ordered-to-halt-abortions.html,WHITE PLAINS Sept 14The State Supreme Court here has ruled that the Dobbs Ferry Medical Pavilion Inc is an unlicensed abortion clinic and has ordered it to stop performing abortions Justice John J Dillons decision is the first in the state to offer a definition of the boundary between privat medical practice and the running of an abortion clinic It is thus expected to set a precedent for the states prosecution of abortion clinic cases The distinction is important because although New Yorks liberal abortion law sets no limit on where a doctor may perform the operation the public health law requires all clinics and hospitals to be licensed The three doctors in the Dobbs Ferry case maintained that they were simply practicing private medicine not operating a clinic and so did not need a hospital license Their office at 88 Ashford Avenue was the object of controversy in Dobbs Ferry earlier this year as residents opposed to abortion sought unsuccessfully to change local zoning laws to exclude abortion clinics In his decision dated Sept 8 but not yet officially published Justice Dillon concluded that the medical pavilion falls within the classification of hospital because among other reasons the circumstances commonly indicating a doctorpatient relationship are nonexistant The judge described procedures at the facility as on an assembly line basis and wrote that the relationship more nearly resembles that existing on a field of battle He said that 3250 fetal death certificates were filed in the first four months of the year and that the office arranged for airport limousine service for its patients most of whom come from out of state The quality of medical care at the pavilion was never questioned during the trial Although Justice Dillon granted a permanent injunction against Dobbs Ferry Medical Pavilion Inc a legal technicality makes the immediate effect of the ruling unclear He wrote that he could not enjoin the three doctors themselves because the state had not named them as defendants in its suit Frank Bonem lawyer for the doctors said that as a result the situation at the office would remain unchanged until the state brought a new suit naming the doctors themselves as defendants However Assistant Attorney General Joel Sachs who handled the case said that in his interpretation the office would have to be closed although the doctors would be free to perform abortions elsewhere Mr Sachs said that he would soon draw up an order embodying that interpretation and that if the pavilion remained open the doctors would face contemptofcourt proceedings In the last year the State Attorney Generals office has obtained injunctions against four unlicensed abortion clinics in New York City The defendants in those cases did not appeal so the courts were not forced to draw the distinction between clinic and private practice A temporary injunction against the Pelham Medical group was reversed in the State Supreme Court Appellate Division and the state is appealing To be licensed as a hospital a facility must meet a number of structural requirements as well as medical and financial standards The State Public Health Council grants licenses after several inspections a process that can take nine months or longer

the District Both men were in Brooklyns 14th District yesterday cam paigning for votes in the second primary which was ordered Sept 12 by the State Court of Appeals because the first on June 20 had been marred by many irregularities The 68yearold Congressman met with several prominent members of Brooklyns black community early in the morn ing and they reportedly agreed to draft a letter of support for him that could be circulated Monday the day before the special election to rebut charges that Mr Rooney is antiblack Afterwards Mr Rooney at tended a series of private meet ings with friends and support ers in the lowkeyed nonpublic manner that has traditionally marked his campaigns In contrast Mr Lowenstein opened a day of campaigning in a fastpaced but frustrating fight against time and voter apathy with a foray into Brook lyns Carroll Gardens area con sidered a stronghold of his op ponent Arriving in the 200 block of De Graw Street shortly after 11 AM Mr Lowenstein learned that Mr Rooney was scheduled to make an address before sev eral hundred members of a block association gathered for a celebration outside the Brook lyn Fire Departments Engine Company 204 Mr

expenditures reported by Rooney campaign committees under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 Some of the Lowenstein spending would be attributed to the cost of maintaining a skeleton campaign

expenses and maintenance of the campaign organization Mr Lowensteins committees reported receiving 192247 in contributions Among the major contributors were Mr Lowen stein himself 12500 Frank lin D

Stormy Hearing Ahead On Fluoridating Water,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/17/archives/stormy-hearing-ahead-on-fluoridating-water-stormy-hearings-ahead-on.html,TRENTON  It seems that New Jersey has never had to wait very long for one burn ing state issue to follow an other During the last few years the State House has witnessed angry hearings on guncontrol legislative con troversies involving school busing abortion organized crime and political corrup tion and of course this years taxreform debate Now wa ter fluoridation is the issue whose time has comeagain The State Fluoridation Study Commission will con duct what promises to be a stormy public hearing here Wednesday in the Assembly chamber in an effort to gauge public reaction to a number of fluoridation proposals One of them would require all of New Jerseys 567 communities to introduce fluoride into their water sup plies to reduce tooth decay in children and strengthen their resistance to cavities the rest of their lives A Simmering Issue The proposal for mandato ry fluoridation has always created a storm here and in most other states where it has been introduced It has marshalled medical authori ties and other public health advocates in favor while prompting dozens of groups in ad hoc organizations to fight back Ever since the Union Coun ty community of Rahway be came the first one in the state to introduce fluoride into its municipal water sup ply the debate has simmered steadily boiling over when ever the issue popped up in the Legislature or whenever any state agency made any move to seek a mandate re quiring fluoridation The fluoridation issue came up again this summer when the state Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision on June 23 that four Somerset County communi tiesRaritan Somerville Branchberg and Bridgewater had the power to request that their common water supplier the Somerville Wa ter Company to introduce one part fluoride to every million parts of their drink ing water The move by the commu nities was contested in a tax payers suit that contended that the municipalities lacked the authority to adopt such an order The court here ruled that the communities were au thorized to carry out clearly stated public health policy Studies and experiments made over the past quarter century the court said have established with con siderable scientific certainty that in communities where public drinking water con tains amounts of fluoride the incidence of dental caries [tooth decay] is dramatically less than in communities where the drinking water lacks this ingredient Apparently fluoride in drinking water tends to hard en tooth enamel making teeth more resistant to decay This beneficial effect is far more noticeable in children than in adults With the addi tion in 1967 of New York Citys 8 million residents the number of persons drinking fluoridated water in the Unit ed States reached a total of 65million The court added that de spite evidence that no harm had been discovered in com munities that have adopted fluoridation proposals to achieve it in New Jersey have encountered extraordi nary opposition and antago nism In past controversies mem bers of the John Birch Soci ety have charged that fluori dation was a Communist plot to poison the water system Other opponents said it caused disease brought on blindness and crippled the elderly Some religious groups have contended that manda tory fluoridation violates the Constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion by forc ing mass medication upon those whose church forbids such treatment Others have argued that it is an abusive exercise of state police power although the courts have been virtual ly unanimous throughout the country in upholding the states rights to impose fluo ridation States Fluoridate According to state health officials here seven states have done so Connecticut Delaware Ohio Michigan Illinois South Dakota and Minnesota Ten years ago New Jer sey ranked 45th among the states with only 7 per cent of its population drink ing fluoridated water This was far below the national average of 34 per cent As of today 34 communi ties in the state have joined Rahway in treating their wa ter with fluoride while ap proximately 15 others most of them in southern New Jer sey have the chemical natu rally present in the water they drink Fluorides in one part per million are odorless colorless and tasteless The study commission es tablished in 1970 by the Legis lature was requested to pro pose what should be done in New Jersey The commis sions chairman Assembly man Hebert H Kiehn a Rah way Republican who says hes been drinking his com munitys water without any ill effects for 20 years said the commission had several alternatives Referendum Urged After holding the public hearings and listening to all the predictable opposition and support the commission could recommend that the state be required to submit a mandatory fluoridation proposal to the voters in a referendum This recommendation is opposed by some commission members and state authori ties who insist that a pro posal dealing with the states right to regulate public health does not require a referendum According to Mr Kiehn the commission could also urge a status quo under which communities decide for themselves whether or not to fluoridate on their own However since many commu nities are tied to one water source this robs them of their power to act unilater ally The most controversial proposal of course would be for the commission to recom mend that the Legislature ap prove a law that would re quire every community to fluoridate its water supply This one is backed by most state health officials and medical and dental author ities
THE 1972 CAMPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/19/archives/meany-criticizes-elite-democrats-says-party-that-nominated-mcgovern.html,LAS VEGAS Nev Sept 18 George Meany president of the AFLCIO bitterly assailed the Democratic party that nom inated Senator George McGov ern for the Presidency as elitist and antilabor Speaking to the biennial con vention of the United Steel workers of America Mr Meany reaffirmed the decision of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Or ganizations to remain neutral in the Presidential race However while he heaped in vectives on the reformed Demo cratic party he had little nega tive to say about the Nixon Administration except for con demning the wage and price control system In his speech which was lis tened to quietly by the steel worker delegates Mr Meany commented on the fact that a large number of the delegates at the Democratic convention in Miami Beach had advanced college degrees and had in comes of over 25000 a year It was a classy convention of the lite he said And Other Factions He said 300 other delegates from labor unions were at the Democratic convention but there were also many Gay Libera tion advocates and people who want to liberalize abortions Mr Meany also assailed what he called economic jitter bugs such as Walter W Heller and John Kenneth Galbraith advisers to Mr McGovern and Arthur F Burns chairman of the Federal Reserve Board Working people are the backbone of America he said We will not be shunted aside by any lite Mr Meany also referred to a statement he said Senator McGovern made after the Miami Beach convention pledging a campaign against what he said was the excessive power of big business and big labor This was after his nomina tion and he had no reason to act stupid the labor leader said McGovern was talking about you and about me He was talking about the steel workers union Well I resent association with General Elec tric and General Motors and U S Steel If we have power it is the power to improve the condition of people Despite the opposition to Mr McGovern by Mr Meany and the unions own leaders a number of steelworker dele gates promised an allout floor fight to win the unions en dorsement for the Democratic Presidential ticket I W Abel president of the union reiterated in his key note address to the gathering which opened in the Conven tion Center here today that neither party is offering us the kind of candidate that has earned or would warrant our endorsement or support Mr Abel reminded the more than 3300 delegates that the unions executive board voted last month to emulate the AFLCIO and remain neu tral in the Presidential cam paign He urged that the unions members work only for the election of members of Congress and local officials friendly to labor But outside the hall local steelworker officers and rank andfile members were passing out McGovernShriver buttons and fliers describing what was said to be Senator McGoverns long history of support for labor Office Is Set Up A Steelworkers for McGovern office has been set up at a hotel across Paradise Road from the Convention Center and the Las Vegas Hilton the plush hotel casino where most of the union delegates and leaders are stay ing Most of the delegates ques tioned said they felt that there was little chance that the pro McGovern forces could prevail over Mr Abel who is a popu lar leader of his union When Mr Abel reiterated his neutral position today there was luke warm applause and a few shouts of No and Mc Govern Despite the neutrality rule voted by the unions executive board many delegates wore their McGovern buttons on the floor of the convention hall Unlike Mr Meany Mr Abel did not directly criticize Mr McGovern However he did assail those who condemn big labor and big business in the same breath and who ar rogantly lump our great union with the titans of big business for their own devious reasons Some observers saw this statement as a reference to Mr McGoverns attacks on big labor bosses during the pri mary campaigns remarks that did much to inspire the enmity of some labor leaders to his candidacy Mr Abel sought to persuade the delegates that Congress was more important than the Presi dency in terms of the interest of labor and of social issues in general The President proposes but Congress disposes he said If we once again roll up our sleeves there is no reason why we cannot in 1972 elect the best Congress we ever had he added At the end of his speech Mr Abel was enthusiastically cheered by the delegates in cluding those wearing McGov ern buttons
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/19/archives/can-money-buy-unhappiness.html,NECESSARY OBJECTS By Lois Gould 271 pages Random House 695 I think Lois Goulds first novel Such Good Friends was almost as much under estimated as Joan Didions Play It as It Lays was overestimated Though Miss Didions book has always been considered some sort of first or turning point in recent womens novels her heroine was almost catatonically dispirited and we were forced for lack of evidence to take her condition for granted She went through all the current clichsdropping out a sleazy abortion utter unwillingness to communicate attempted suicideand there was even a retarded childthe sym bolic reward of marriage just as the sleazy abortion was the symbolic reward for love affairover which she maundered just like any Jane Doe Miss Didions twopage and threepage chapters successfully avoided any meaningful contact confron tation or exchanges and the book ended on the requisite negative enigma Such Good Friends which was rarely compared favorably with Play It as It Lays was a much better book but so many of Mrs Goulds ironies were de livered sotto voce were so subtle that they were read straight and she was accused of slicknessthe worst thing you can say about a serious writer To write well has become suspectalmost a sign of old fashioned esthetics Why isnt she experi menting more flattening sentences vio lating structures freakingup her char acters motivations Also since Such Good Friends was about a woman whose first husband died as a result of a hospitals mistakeand since many people read in the newspapers about Mrs Goulds winning such a suit in real lifeher book was said to have been written in anger and this was glibly supposed to have given it whatever au thenticity it had Some Anger Still Left Over Well after reading Necessary Objects Im ready to announce that Mrs Gould has plenty of anger left over enough for at least a dozen more novels The book is convincing evidence too that the good things in Such Good Friends were neither accidental nor merely circumstantial Mrs Gould is a writer who knows exactly what she is doing She is being brilliantly bitchy among other things Bitchiness is in danger of going out of style One wishes more womens liberation writers for example had more of it to enliven their pages At considerable personal risk I would define bitchiness as certain womens or certain homosexuals sort of irony It is sharper edged and narrower in scope than say the irony of Thomas Mann or Ford Madox Ford but it is often good anthro pologyextremely accurate and witty personal observations Since so few people qualify for genuine irony bitchiness is a necessary scaling down of this sublimely tonic quality a recognition that the tragic dimension is absent Its tone seems to have evolved naturally out of the people and the texture of life in New York And there are few writers more skilled in using it than Mrs Gould What matters most is that the author makes it work We believe in her people we are persuaded of their various forms of failure or distress and we know that they speak for their peculiar cultural strata Necessary Objects is about four sisters rich spoiled attractive Jewish girls in their middle or late thirties When encountered these four sisters I thought Now why the hell does she want to do that Four women Why dilute her etchers acid spread herself out like that Getting Men They Deserve But Mrs Gould has not stretched her talent thin over her four characters she has simply given herself more opportuni ties a tighter case Case against whom Against narcissistic destructive competi tive cold consumptioncrazed women Surprisingly enoughfor Mrs Gould and her psychiatrist husband are intertested in the womens liberation movementthe fe males come off even worse than the males in her book She is one of the few people in the movement who suggest that women ought to change not only in regard to the inequities of their relation to men but also in relation to themselves She even seems to imply that they get the men they deserve the only men who could tolerate or be tolerated bythem The four sisters In Necessary Objects are heiresses of a Fifth Avenue department store chain and Mrs Gould has drawn unmercifully on her background in news paper and magazine work to make these particular mannequins breathe fire There are shriveling insights into love sex parenthood commerce and quite a few other subjects and the author is a master of the throwaway summing up One man has boyish charm with charcoal pinstriped temples and when he is introduced to his fiances adolescent daughter and asks So youd be Jill she answers Not if I had a choice actually The book doesnt end so much as run down which is exactly I think what the author intended New York as we have known it is nothing if not running down Since Necessary Objects is ostensibly at least about the sexual and emotional difficulties of four rich and pampered women there will naturally be those who will cry that it is irrelevant If it is so is Fifth Avenue and Madison and Park and all the peoplenot I believe a small minoritywho are unhappy there Mrs Gould is not relentless There are three sympathetic characters in the book a charming 37yearold loser and a 15 yearold girl and a boy All three mis behave beautifully in their individual ways and if you look carefully enough at that misbehavior I think youll find a bittersweet love letter tucked in these fierce pages

2d Connecticut Law On Abortion Voided,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/21/archives/2d-connecticut-law-on-abortion-voided-a-connecticut-law-curbing.html,HARTFORD Sept 20for the second time this year a Federal district court declared Connecticuts abortion statutes unconstitutional saying they abridged the rights of a woman to privacy and personal choice in matters of sex and family life Last April the same three judge panel struck down the states 19thcentury abortion law by a 2to1 decision Today the judges voted 2to1 to invalidate the abortion stat utes passed by a special Gen eral Assembly session on May 23 The new law is stronger than the old one passed in 1860 in that it allows an abortion only when the physical life of the mother is threatened The aim of this wording was to thwart the practice of performing abortions to preserve what doc tors said was the mothers mental health Preserving Human Life Gov Thomas J Meskill and the legislative leaders who pushed through the new law had hoped it would withstand a court challenge because un like the old law it included a preamble stating that the in tention of the state was to protect and preserve human life from the moment of con ception Governor Meskill was out of state today and not available for comment But Attorney General Robert K Killian said that the state would seek a stay of execution of the courts decision before the week is out United States District Court Juage Jon O Newman who wrote the majority opinion re jected the states contention that a fetus was a legal person entitled to constitutional rights The 16page opinion which was supported by United States Senior Circuit Judge J Edward Lumbard said Our conclusion based on the text and the history of the Constitution and on cases in terpreting it is that a fetus is not a person within the mean ing of the 14th Amendment There is nothing in the his tory of that amendment nor in its interpretation by the Su preme Court to give any sup port whatever to the contention that a fetus has constitutional rights The majority concluded that the substantive provisions of the 1972 legislation prohibiting abortions only to preserve the physical life of the mother and set stiffer penalties for violations Critics of the new law con tended that its strictness re flected strong pressure on legis lators from the Catholic Church and the Republican Governor who himself once studied for the priesthood About 43 per cent of the states residents are Catholics But in one passage the court decision asserted that there was no room for such consideration in the lawmaking process No doubt in the opinion of many people the nature of the fetus as a human being is a matter of absolute moral cer tainty We do not doubt the sincerity of those who hold this view But under the Constitution their judgment must remain a personal judgment one that they may follow in their per sonal lives and seek to per suade other to follow but a judgment they may not impose upon others by force of law In affirming a womans con stitutional right to privacy and personal choice in sexual and family matters the majority cited two recent Supreme Court casesGriswold v Connecticut 1965 which lifted the states ban on contraceptive devices and Eisenstadt v Baird 1972 Quoting from the 1972 de cision Judge Newan said If the right of privacy means anything it is the right of the individual married or single to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally of fecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child Leaders of Opposition United States District Court Judge T Emmet Clarie who wrote the dissenting opinion last April again objected to the majority arguments on the ground that they represented Federal judicial intrusion into the legislative sphere The Legislature but not the judiciary asserted Judge Clarie was designed by our founding fathers to reflect the standards of human decency which must be weighed in any choice between the competing moral values which are to guide governmental policy The challenge to the law came from Women vs Connec ticut the organization that filed a successful suit against the 1860 statute in April The group represents several hundred women including doc tors nurses and social workers as well as women who wish to have abortions Marilyn Seichter a lawyer for the group hailed todays decision for clearly spelling out the rights of a woman un der the Constitution to make her own decision without the state acting as a guardian In declaring the new abortion statutes unconstitutional the court noted that the state still had the power to enact reason able regulations specifying the facilities at which abortions could be performed or the per sonnel qualified to perform them The General Assembly which is now in special session to con sider possible tax cuts and aid to bus companies could possi bly consider the abortion ques tion again But legislative leaders today would not predict whether the body would act or await a pos sible state appeal to the higher courts

leaping out in black capital letters the length of its fuselage QUESTION Mrs Nixon do you think you are helping your husband politically MRS NIXON I dont come to places like this for political reasons QUESTION Dont you re gard this as a political trip MRS NIXON Anything you do at this time of year is political The Presidents wife was midway through a sixday swing across the country that when it ends tomorrow will have taken her and her en tourage of 30 reporters and cameramen six crew members five stewards six Secret Serv ice agents nine White House employes and one hairdresser from Elizabeth Arden 5500 miles through seven states Advance Army An invisible army of other persons preceded Mrs Nixon arranging airport welcomes motorcades rallies policing credentials hotel rooms and a thousand additional details During this trip an unusually prolonged one even for a Presi dential candidate Mrs Nixon was seen by roughly 15000 Americans perhaps onethird to onehalf of them not old enough to vote She made no speechesre marks would be a better word  mentioned the accomplish ments of her husbands Admin istration just once gave no in terviews held one impromptu news conference at the vey beginning that she lived to re gret and did not repeat and never never talked politics For example Ed Reimers the master of ceremonies for an American Cancer Society dinner honoring Mrs Nixon last night warned off report ers and photographers gathered beforehand to see her Its not a press conference he said and I have been asked to announce that the only question we will entertain is Can we take another pic ture please  Hazards of Touring Is it written into her job re quirements that a First Lady must endure freezing rain gale force winds sleet snow hail and temperatures ranging from 23 to 102 degrees all of which Mrs Nixon endured this week Couldnt she brag a little bit about her husband what he has done and wishes to do if elected Mrs Nixon gave an answer satisfactory to herself last Mon day the first day of her cross country tour Moving with all the panoply and power of the Presidency she was showing the flag or to put it in her own words Im taking the White House to the people At airports in Billings and West Yellowstone Mont and Idaho Falls Idaho she worked slowly along chainlink fences holding back the crowds clutching at their hands with both of hers while they called out We love you Pat and Four more years She sat along with 1500 other spectators through an outdoor dedication of Yellow stone National Parks Second Century that was mercilessly pelted by freezing rain hail and snow To the end she wore her best carry on face while Secretary of the Interior Rogers CB Morton finished his speech Despite the weather with even the band scampering for cover it had been a most wondrous day she told them Only once on this long jour ney was Mrs Nixon forced to tackle or at least parry the issues At a press coffee in Chicago that turned into a press conference she turned tense and anxious as she was asked about the war abortion am nesty the Watergate bugging equal rights Martha Mitchells woes and other thorny topics It was everyone who has fol lowed Mrs Nixon for years agreed the toughest grilling she has ever undergone Her discomfort was obvious So was her relief when a reporter asked the type of question that has usually been her lot Mrs Nixon how do you keep your Vitality One aspect of this trip that puzzled those who are familiar with Mrs Nixons iron disci pline and seemingly inexhausti ble capacity for work was her light schedule At a time when her husband is running to keep the highest office in the nation she retired fairly early and sal lied forth on the hustings which she refused to say she was onaround noontime each day In Chicago and Los Angeles the most populous cities she visited her plane avoided the main airport terminals  with the possibility of big welcom ing crowds or hecklers who were not seen this weekand taxied instead to remote build ings Mrs Nixon did not mention her husbands programs until yesterday in Riverside Calif a town with 30000 retired citi zens on the deserts edge This rally a dedication of a cornerstone to the memory of Hannah M Nixon the Presi dents mother had a distinctly political excitement There were costumed Nix onettes a Republican state senator and local United States Renresentatives Gov Ronald Reagan sent a telegram The Rev Ber Turner a Southern Baptist minister shouted fore finger in air that Mr Nixon is a great President His name will go down in the history of the United States of America The Presidents wife then stepped forward Under the Nixon Adminis tration the senior citizen is not forgotten she said Instead he is the remembered one So far there have been improve ments in every segment Under the Older Americans Act she said Federal funding has increased eightfold Applause a few amens Nixon placards hoisted In three minutes for the first and only time on her trip Pat Nixon had made a partisan po litical statement
The World,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/24/archives/britain-lord-porn-makes-his-report.html,LONDONOne of the best selling books in Britain last week was a 520 page paperback called Pornography a title emblazoned on the cover in twoinch red letters Its critics insist ed it was selling well because people thought it was dirty and even seedy shops stocked it Its defenders at tributed the public interest to a seri ous and widespread concern about the rise in pornography Whatever the reason for the ex citement inside the paperback was the voluminous result of a yearlong pri vate study of pornography in Britain It was undertaken at the instigation of the Earl of Longford who was helped in the preparation by a num ber of leading jurists clergymen so cial workers a pop singer profes sors and writers including Kingsley Ands and Malcolm Muggeridge Its main conclusionthat the coun try needs tougher laws against ob scenitytouched off an intense de bate among antipornographers civil libertarians Members of Parliament broadcasters magazine publishers and the public Ironically the report has no official status Nobody asked Lord Longford a 66yearold Labor peer who says he likes to swim nude with his wife enjoys publicity and hates smutto do it but he persuaded the others to join him in the project In a hotel next to a theater pre senting No Sex PleaseWere Brit ish Lord Longford told a news con ference it was time to end the per missive society And he said if the cause makes him the subject of ridi culethe press has dubbed him Lord Pornthen so be it The report financed by private con tributions suggested heavier fines for pornography dealers called for higher moral standards in television and radio and proposed a new legal defi nition of obscenity that would apply even to sex education in the schools It said that pornography exploits and dehumanizes sex so that human be ings are treated as things and women in particular as sex objects The proposals which provoked no comment from the Government would reverse recent trends in British life In recent years Britain has legalized homosexuality between consenting adults made divorce almost as easy as marriage and approved quick abortions even under the National Health Service Moreover the censorship that guard ed the morals and politics of the English stage for nearly 400 years was ended A law took the job away from the Lord Chamberlain who has been the censor since the 16th cen tury in addition to his duties as Mu ter of the Royal Household All this has not been translated into an anything goes society The magazines and books openly on sale not counting those hidden in the backroomare less explicit than those seen in windows around Times Square Censorship of motion pictures is probably stricter here than in New York But in contrast television and radio are less inhibited than in the United States Television plays often include a nude scene and colorful language rarely heard on programs in the United States is rather commonplace The proposals for a tighter rein ran into immediate opposition from those who argued that the suggested legis lation would unduly restrict freedom Broadcasters including the British Broadcasting Corporation said they needed no new procedures to guard against smut A civil liberties group said the report represented a threat to freedom of speech and the expres sion of nonconformist opinion The main focus of attack was the proposed redefinition of obscenity At present the British concept holds as obscene anything that has the tendency to deprave or corrupt The Longford group suggested that obscenity be regarded legally as that which outrages contemporary stand ards of decency or humanity accepted by the public at large It said this new wording would lead to more con victions In general the legal test of obscen ity in the United States as long de fined by the Supreme Court hinges on the question of whether to the average person the dominant theme taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest This is decided within the context of contemporary community standards Three years ago the court ruled that keeping ob scene material in the home is legal under the Constitutions First Amend ment As the debate raged here last week the police acted Twenty detectives from Scotland Yards branch that deals with obscene publications impounded thousands of copies of magazines books and photographs Lord Longford approved
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/24/archives/not-yet-the-last-word-polls.html,CLEVELANDI think the polls are rubbish In Columbus Ohio last week Senator McGovern snapped at the sofamiliar question Why are you 34 points behind I dont know where they conduct these polls I think they make these things up in the back room some where The Senators reaction is understand able enough The most recent Gallup Poll shows him trailing President Nix on 64 to 30 with 6 per cent undecided The Harris Poll has the President lead ing 59 to 25 with 16 per cent unsure But there are others with their doubts about pollsa fact that led to hearings on the subject last week before a Con gressional subcommittee Both Dr George Gallup and Louis Harris testi fied The pollsters insisted that surveys are not guilty of one charge leveled by criticsthe creation of a band wagon effect Indeed Mr Harris suggested that they might even help the underdog by fostering complac ency in the camp of the leader If were Mr Nixon today he said Id be worried that people would look at the latest polls and say theyre for him but they dont want him to win by that much There was little argument however with another criticism Polls can dam age financially the candidate on the short end of the findings As a Demo cratic adviser commented People want to invest in a winner Only about 1 in 5 is altruistic No resolution of the controversy over the polls seems in sight And there are those who would ignore their results Sargent Shriver in Chi cago last week told a television inter viewer The important issues are being obscured by people like us talk ing about the polls But many poli tical experts take a middle course Polls have potential value but they should be read in different ways in different elections and at different times of the political year Gallup and Harris produce national figures but each state election is decided separately And it is the state polls that really matter Senator Mc Govern could be losing Idaho or Ala bama by 50 points in the polls but that may not mean much if he is close in Ohio and Michigan with their much larger clout in the electoral col lege In the end experts believe the election will be decided by eight key states New York New Jersey Penn sylvania Ohio Michigan Illinois Texas and California For the time being the Democrats are largely ignor ing the rest of the country and follow ing the advice of political consultant Matt Reese who once said Pick the cherries where the cherries is The candidates have been through Pittsburgh so often that leaders of the local organization are grumbling They say theyre so busy organizing recep tions and motorcades that they have no time to organize a voter registration drive Here in Ohio the schedule last week put Senator McGovern into Cin cinnati on Monday and Columbus on Tuesday and Cleveland yesterday Mr Shriver visited Cleveland on Thursday Even in these states the polls are not good for the Democrats but the race is tighter than the national figures would indicate For instance the Field poll in California showed President Nixon ahead by only 49 to 41 several weeks ago In Michigan a Detroit News survey put the margin at only 16 points 54 per cent for President Nixon to 38 per cent for Senator McGovern In Illinois the Democratic party tested Montgomery County a bellwether district and found Mr McGovern ahead by 34 to 24 The 42 pet cent undecided shows that all early polls contain considerable softness the Democrats said What in fact do the polls actually measure Looking back it is clear that Senator McGovern ran so badly in January because he was unknown not because people did not like him And in an important way that is still true today Most voters do not focus on politics until the last weeks of the campaign As John Shea leader in the Philadelphia party or ganization put it A lot of people feel they didnt know McGovern they thought he was a stranger What is he Hes just be ginning to spell it out hes just begin ning to get people to stop and think and listen They were not listening till now Trends like the one mentioned by Mr Sheaif it is really happening take time to filter through the elec torate And then it takes another few weeks between the day a pollster starts collecting his data and the day he publishes them And thus it inevi tably would be a while before a survey could reflect the feelings expressed last weekend by a New Jersey tavern owner who was attending a Demo cratic party picnic Ill probably pull the Democratic lever said the man after bitterly denouncing Senator Mc Govern Were diehard Democrats here and too many local candidates might get hurt because of all this switching Well go Democrat all the waywe have to Many voters have still not faced the fact that they are voting for President Many are still voicing their feelings and protests and that is not necessarily the way they will finally vote Four years ago half the voters who agreed with George Wallace in September deserted him in November and the same thing could happen to President Nixon Bill Casstevens head of the United Automobile Workers here in Ohio made this point the other day Our menibers are hungup on emotional issuesthey shouldnt be but they areamnesty abortion dope But theyre starting to talk about the really important issues the economy and the war They werent before
THE 1972 CAMPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/24/archives/both-parties-stepping-up-campaigns-for-the-allegiance-of-ethnic.html,ERIE PaStanley Franzcyk an ethnic organizer for the Mc Govern  Shriver ticket spoke passionately recently to a group of PolishAmericans here of their time for a day in the sun PolishAmericans he told them have always found the Democratic party their only real friend in politics and he cited the following statistics 10 of 12 PolishAmerican Congressmen are Democrats 90 per cent of all PolishAmerican state legislators are Democrats The group of 20 business social and political leaders of the Polish community of Erie County all traditional Demo crats sipped drinks and listened politely until he finished Then Edward Szparaga a businessman stood and said What you say is good but Im concerned about Senator McGoverns welfare program this talk of 1000 He puts too much emphasis on welfare and not enough on concrete pro posals for work For the next half hour the Democratic Presidential candi dates positions on welfare taxes and amnesty were care fully discussed and analyzed A meeting that had begun as an effort of a PolishAmerican to rally fellow ethnics behind the McGovernShriver ticket had become instead an effort to defend and explain Senator McGovern and his stands to those who have in the past voted Democratic with a dog ged loyalty Few observers here doubt that Senator McGovern will carry Erie County since the Democrats nearly always carry the county Neither do the ob servers doubt the loyalty of the ethnic community but the fact that a special effort had to be made emphasizes a growing Democratic concern over the continued party loyalty of ethnic voters GOP Presence Grows Quietly almost invisibly the Republican party has been de veloping a presence and a voice in ethnic neighborhoods in urban centers since 1968 It is now growing clear that inroads have been made by the Republi cans and the votes of the hyphenated Americans are being fought for as never be fore in a Presidential election Recent reports have sug gested that the Republican party has allocated half of its 40million campaign budget to the effort to win ethnic voters Laszlo Pasztor a Hungarian immigrant who directs the Re publican National Committee ethnic operation through the National Republican Heritage Groups Council dismisses such reports He does however con cede that in states like New York Michigan Ohio Pennsyl vania and Illinois ethnic voters make up about half of the population On that basis he says you could conclude that half of the money spent on the cam paign in such statesfor store fronts advertising voter regis tration and so forthsis being spent on ethnic voters but only in that sense Whatever the total invest ment in the process becomes it is clear that the ethnic com munity is a primary target in the Republican partys effort to build their own laborethnic alliance and break the back of the Democratic party in the industrial states Census of Ethnics The center of this attention is a community of recent immi grants and their children whose numbers depending upon definitions run as high as 80 million according to a special United States Census in 1969 of selfidentified ethnics Since both political parties maintain separate operations for Jewish Spanishspeaking and black groups the remain ing ethnic community is com posed primarily of white Euro pean immigrants  predomi nantly Roman Catholic blue collar workers clustered in and around the major cities of the industrial states of the North east This concentration in the states with large electoral votes increases the value of this reservoir of voters Since 1932 when President Roosevelt organized an ethnic office in the Democratic Na tional Committee ethnic voters have voted overwhelmingly Democratic Both Presidents Truman and Kennedy credited their election victories to the loyalty of the ethnic voter President Nixon who could claim only about 7000 volun teers working for him in their ethnic communities in 1968 has recognized this strength and ap proved the establishment of the first permanent ethnic office in the Republican National Committee during the 1968 campaign Republican Tactics Even before Mr Nixon was inaugurated the newly formed Heritage office had scoured ethnic communities for the names of prominent residents to submit to the newly elected President Since then a constant stream of ethnic names have appeared as Presidential appointees on governmental advisory commit tees Each appointment has been widely publicized in the ethnic press and usually ac companied by a banquet in the appointees community attende by a wellknown Republican speaker White House aides and the Heritage Council are aware of all ethnic holidays and con ferences In Chicago alone the White House has committed itself to sending a representative to 13 separate ethnic functions this year like the recent Lithuanian folk festival at which Mrs Nixon appeared and an Italian fall festival in Maryland that the President attended when his daughter Mrs Edward F Cox could not attend All the while Republican Heritage groups were being or ganized The party that could report only 7000 ethnic mem bers at Republican clubs in 1968 now reports 50000 mem bers in 1000 local Heritage Councils directed by state coun cils in 18 states Six other states including Texas and New York are in the process of forming state councils Nixon Support Organized There are in addition 700 ethnic organizations involved in a program called Administra tion Alert whose members are willing to write letters to Congressmen and newspaper editors supporting the Presi dent on key legislation of con troversial issues such as Supreme Court appointments We have designed our local Heritage councils not just as meeting places for ethnics says Mr Pasztor but as vehicles to give them a voice in party matters and hopefully to bring them permanently into the Republican party In catering to 32 different nationality groups Mr Pasztors office provides press releases for 600 ethnic newspapers in either English or the native tongue makes radio tapes available suggests names for invitations to White House af fairs and sets up special State Department briefings for ethnic delegations on current events in their homeland Beyond all this political ad vantages are pressed through the Presidents positions on basic issues that affect the ethnic community One dismayed Democrat de scribed this as follows He does it by signs and symbols He turns up in Phila delphia with Cardinal Krol to support Federal aid to Catholic schools he writes a letter to Cardinal Cooke of New York opposing abortion he rejects quota hiring and downplays the Philadelphia Plan of minority hiring on federally financed construction It makes no difference that in almost four years in office he has introduced no bill to support Catholic schools that he didnt write his friend Gov Nelson Rockefeller who had the power to veto the New York abortion bill that his Ad ministration nursed the Phila delphia Plan along The ethnics see his support of their position and they have no idea where McGovern stands or if they do they think hes against their interests The Democrats have reacted to this challenge slowly and are only just getting an ethnic oriented effort under way An urbanethnic office was opened in the McGovern campaign headquarters only after Sargent Shriver was added to the ticket and a major part of the VicePresidential candi dates role in the campaign is to woo black ethnic voters The ethnic division of the Democratic National Commit tee is trying to reconstitute it self after having been abolished by Mrs Jean Westwood when she became National Chairman of the party in July Its tough and we lost a lot of time concedes Andrew Valuchek who heads the Demo cratic National Committees ethnic division but I think we can come back Our friends have been with us for a lot of years and we just need to remind them Senator McGovern is a Democrat and that the Democratic party is the party that has led their fight for the last 40 years To convince them that they are not forgotten the ethnic division is planning a big event in New York City on Sept 28 to revive the All Americans Council Catholic Vote Sought In the McGovernShriver cam paign headquarters a separate Catholic affairs division is now functioning in an effort to get the Catholic community in volved in the campaign This office is recruiting nuns priests and laymen active in social movements to organize voter registration and education drives in the Catholic communities The major effort now is aimed at heading off a frontal assault on Senator McGovern in the Catholic communities during Respect Life Week be ginning Oct 1 The week designated by the American Bishops will be devoted to dis cussions in church groups on the respect for life The Mc Govern strategy is aimed at keeping the discussions from focusing on abortion alone by broadening it to include issues of poverty hunger the elderly and the war in Vietnam We can said Peggy Roach a director of the McGovern effort turn the issues to our advantage if the perspective is broadened because Senator Mc Governs stand on hunger poverty and the war is so close to that of the Church Beyond these special efforts the McGovern  Shriver cam paign is relying heavily on two things to avert wide defections among ethnics to the Republi can party traditional ethnic loyalty to the Democratic party and Senator McGoverns posi tion on such issues as tax reform Leaders in communities like Erie County where the East European ethnic base is de scribed as the heart and soul of the Democratic party agree But as Democratic Erie County chairman Roger N Fischer pointed out at the PolishAmerican meeting recently The word of Senator Mc Governs position on those issues just isnt getting out Theres no question that man to man Senator McGovern could win all of their votes but hes not coming through to a mass audience Everything we do has to be done word of mouth and it takes tre mendous amounts of time and an awful lot of people
THE 1972 CAMPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/25/archives/mcgovern-charges-distortion.html,SIOUX FALLS SD Sept 24 Senator McGovern came home tonight to accuse the Nixon Administration of distorting his Presidential campaign positions and attemping to unleash upon him the forces of fear and division The Democratic nominee told 1180 people at a fundraising dinner that the central issue of the 1972 campaign was whether we want a government of the special interest by the special interest and for the special in terest or do we want a govern ment in Lincolns phrase of the people by the people and for the people He discarded the text of an address in which he had planned to make a long denun ciation of the Administrations handling of the sale of Amer ican wheat to the Soviet Union The Senator touched upon the issue calling it a shabby case of favoritism to the big grain dealers at the expense of American farmers But he de voted nearly all of a 30minute address to a more broadscale attack on the Nixon Adminis tration as a political ally of special interests and suggested that the Republicans were ap pealing to what is mean and nasty and fearful and divisive Mr McGovern accused the Republicans of having deliber ately sought to distort his posi tions on abortion and welfare reform He said that Mr Nixon and I would do precisely the same on the abortion issue and thats exactly nothing to amend state laws He denied ever having specif ically sought to provide 1000 to every American as his pro gram on welfare reform saying that his use of that illustration of one possible approach during the Democratic primaries had been distorted and twisted all around In fact Mr McGovern said he seeks to provide a job for every American able to work and government aid for the aged blind and disabled or de pendent children who are with out the means of selfsupport Mr McGovern left later for Billings Mont

‘The Movement... Is Big Enough to Roll With All These Punches’,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/02/archives/-the-movement-is-big-enough-to-roll-with-all-these-punches.html,Is the issue of lesblanism splitting the womens movement in New York Thousands of women who last month watched the Womens March for Equal ity down Fifth Avenue were concerned that the highly visible and highly audible lesbian groups that appeared to dominate the parade were also achieving undue prominence in the movement as a whole Many feminists who had marched in the previous two years withheld their support this year in silent protest against what they considered a takeover by radical elements Despite the discussion speculation and even fear engendered by the parade leading spokesmen for the movement reject the possibility that any one issue at this particular time in history can deflect the principal objectives of wo mens rights The movement is not a monolithic one they pointed out and there is room in it for many issues Women should decide their own priority issues and work for them as long as they under stand that any one group could not dominate control and manipulate Balance of the March We thought abortion would split us and it didnt said Muriel Fox Aronson a founder and board member of the National Organization for Women This year the balance of the march got lost  one issue grew out of proportion and became too big a part of the pic ture This happened in one city at one particular time  in other cities there were different issues The movement now is big enough to roll with all these punches The important thing is that everyone see that a small group of women cannot ruin the movement said Jacqueline Ceballos Eastern regional director of NOW NOW is the largest of the wo mens rights groups with 300 chapters and about 20000 members nationally I do not like to be accused of putting down our sisters  it is difficult to speak out and not sound antilesbian but what I would call a lesbian power group did dominate the march it was a flop The march attracted about 4000 par ticipants this year as against 10000 in 1970 and about 6000 in 1971 Few feminists reject the concept of a womans right to express her own sexu ality But many wonder whether lesbi anism if too closely identified with the womens movement in the public con sciousness will perhaps alienate thou sands of as yet uncommitted women And many women sympathetic in terested and active have expressed con cern at what they describe as some lesbian women using the movement Most homosexual women who range from moderate to radical in their think ing agree on one thingtheir rights are of paramount importance Their dif ferences of opinion are on other matters including the tactics that should be used to attain their objective Some believe they should work within the existing framework in cooperation with other groups others favor more revolutionary methods Whatever their tactical approach few lesbians would disagree with the state ment made by Jean OLeary of the Lesbian Liberation Committee that les bians personify independent free liber ated women If your attachment Is first to a man and family a lot of your emotions go to that she said Lesbians are freer to act out the independence that every woman should have as a person We dont have to struggle with our loyalties to the male hierarchal system To Miss Ceballos the degree to which the demands of homosexual women should involve the movement as a whole and the divergence of opinion on the subject between some gay and straight women is a very tender subject Oth ers disagree I think it is a false hypothesis that women are scared away from the move ment by the issue of lesbianism said Barbara Buoncristiano a member of the womens liberation group at Colum bia University Maybe certain women at a certain time will be turned off for a little while but I think a feminist is a feminist is a feminist I have faith that straight women will not be turned off    I think the issue is largely a red herring I think it is up to the lesbian women to fight for what they want and they should be able to call on other groups for support One thing I trust about the movement is that there are a variety of interests but we are all fighting for the same thing There is no split in the movement on the lesbian issue said Gloria Steinem There are people who worry about it one way or the other but they tend to worry about it as a public rela tions problem that it will scare women away Its straight women who have made lesbian women feel unwanted and not lesbian women who started this now the lesbians are reacting and I dont blame them How dare we say anything about lesbian women when they have done so much for all women They have been on the front line Betty Jean Michelsen of the Ad Hoc committee for the march said she was considering writing a book on her ex periences coordinating the event and that it could be called The Building of a Paranoid It never occurred to me that there would be so many women with so many points of view said Miss Michelsen a member of the New York Radical Feminists My own growth through consciousness raising mandated that I allow every woman to say what she wanted lesbian or straight What one cares to do with oneself in the bedroom is up to the individual   it shouldnt be of that importance Miss OLeary said she was not con cerned about any split Its the old male tactic of using the word lesbian or dyke to frighten off and divide women We are all searching together   everyone has something to contribute From her own point of view she continued it was lesbians first You have to fight for where its at and thats where it is at People have to get their minds opened up  that every woman has the capacity to relate to other women in whatever way she chooses whether it is just warmth and affection or love But she added difference of opinion is a healthy vitalizing thing   our group is forming a coalition with NOW We want to work with them on all levels The NOW position on lesbians ac cording to Mrs Aronson is that because they are women and homosexual they are doubly oppressed by society We endorse their civil rights and civil liberties and think this is a legiti mate concern of the womens movement On the other hand we have not equated lesbianism with feminism A Variety of Opinions To Betty Friedan whose book The Feminine Mystique gave impetus to the womens liberation movement nine years ago the rights of lesbians are not at issue I believe adults have the right of privacy in private life as long as they are not hurting or exploiting others she said The danger to the movement as she sees it and as she announced earlier this summer is sex class polarization where women think of themselves as an oppressed class in sexual warfare against men The essence of womens liberation is equal opportunity and self determina tion and that battle is not over accord ing to Mrs Friedan Sexual politics makes man the enemy and ignores sexu al reality the relations between a man and a woman Lesbians for whatever reason have repudiated two aspectssexual feelings for men and child bearing They would alienate the women who cant identify with the rhetoric of sex class warfare and alienate men unnecessarily if their thinking were allowed to take over the movement If they are homosexuals first then they are a danger to the movement and will pervert the priorities We shouldnt bar anyone from the move ment but we shouldnt let the movement be disrupted either Radical lesbians are she said at one extreme of female chauvinism but the chauvinist position extentes far beyond homosexual women I warn against female chauvinism Mrs Friedan said and against the danger of taking an abstract ideology based on obsolete theories of class war or separatist racial theories and apply ing it to the situation of women   The question is will the womens move ment be a twosex movement of human revolution or will it be perverted by female chauvinists into sex class war fare These two diverging ideologies will become more and more clear

ISSUES 1972,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/03/archives/credibility-someone-isnt-telling-the-truth-mr-nixon-or-mr-mcgovern.html,WASHINGTON  Earlier this year parallels were drawn between the pre convention campaigns of George Mc Govern and Barry Goldwater The comparisons were neither invidious nor invalid Both menone of the left the other of the rightwere movement politicians Unlike a John F Kennedy or a Richard M Nixon who relent lessly pursued and won their partys nomination Senators Goldwater and McGovern had their nominations cap tured on their behalfcaptured by an army of volunteers motivated by ide ology hungrier better disciplined and better organized than the Establish ment they sought to displace  Unlike Presidents Kennedy and Nix on neither of these smallstate Sena tors could have seized their partys nomination and machinery had they not been chosen instruments of signifi cant political movements But the comparisons that were valid In the spring are demeaning to Senator Goldwater in the fall For agree or disagree Barry Goldwater went down to defeat in November 1964 unapolo getically uncompromising in his public commitment to conservative positions and principles Senator McGovern on the other hand has made public recantation the leitmotiv of his campaign Excepting only defense one is hard pressed to name a single position taken by Mr McGovern to win the nomination that has not since Miami Beach been trimmed or hedged or abandoned altogether The guaranteed income that Mr Mc Govern introduced in the Senate was put over the side with George Wiley in Miami Beach The 1000perperson grant with the concomitant tax pro gram to redistribute the wealth was quietly interred on Wall Street two months later As for the 100 per cent tax on estates followed by the 77 per cent on estatesneither of them has been heard from in weeks Abortion is no longer a matter between a doctor and his patient Today it is not even a matter worth discussion between a candidate and his constituency The pledges of quotas of Federal jobs to blacks and Chicanos were jettisoned when quotas became a national issue The space shuttle that was a fool ish project in the Florida primary does not seem so foolish when campaigning in Houston in September Unconditional amnesty for all who refused to serve in Vietnam is now fudged No longer should we consider regulating marijuana along the lines of alcohol On Southeast Asia there is ongoing debate among Republican researchers as to whether Mr McGovern will keep bases in Thailand and ships offshore until the prisoners are releasedor whether he will remove the troops and ships on the taith that the prisoners will subsequently be released Using primary sources alone each side has a cogent case Not for nothing is the McGovern speechwriting team labor ing under the sobriquet The Waffle Shop As for Mr McGoverns June declara tion Were not going to win in the fall if we forget the pledges and the commitments we made in the spring he should save it for the Al Smith Dinner it will bring down the house With his reputation for political con sistency and candor already in grave peril Mr McGoverns reputation for personal credibility seems headed in the same direction The solemn pledge to the women to support the South Carolina challenge was dishonored the evening of the day it was made The flat assertion that no instruction had been given to Mr Salinger was as flatly retracted and reversed not two hours later And the enormous gap between Mr McGoverns words and Mr McGoverns deeds in the Eagleton affair was summed up nicely by Garry Wills who wrote Senator McGovern is giving sanctity a bad name While he blessed the crowds with his right hand his left one was holding Eagletons head under water till the thrashing stopped Well all know were in trouble if he should be elected and take his oath of office by saying he supports the Constitu tion 1000 per cent In 1971 Mr McGovern in a fund raising letter wrote boldly to his pro spective constituents Quite frankly I am not a centrist candidate His awkward efforts in the past month to imitate one only call to mind Dr Johnsons dog trying to walk on its hind legs Instead of denying his convictions Senator McGovern might have done better by defending them Many commentators contended that had Mr McGovern continued to run as the candidate of the hew politics he would have been administered a shellacking by Mr Nixon Perhaps But the people who supported him were at the least entitled to have their somewhat unorthodox views on income redistribution neoisolationism and reversal of priorities aired and articulatedas they have not been by their erstwhile champion who has spent the last month running as though he coveted most the office ofnot Presi dent of the United States but Spe cial Prosecutor in the Waterbug Case It was impolitic of Senator Gold water to stand in the Cow Palace and summarily dismiss the recalcitrant Eastern liberals just defeated at the convention But assuredly the moment was a mere honest one than that un forgettable scene of George McGovern emerging from lunch at the LBJ Ranch to declare the meeting one of the most treasured moments of my life

Mrs Shirley Chisholm of Brook lyn this fall as the second and third black women in the House of Representatives  Like Mrs Chisholm both are Democrats Assemblywoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke 39 years old the Californian and State Senator Barbara Jordan 36 the Texan won hardfought primary battles in June and face no significant Republican opposition in November in their heavily Democratic dis tricts Like Mrs Chisholm who won her seat when the Bushwick and BedfordStuyvesant sections of Brooklyn were designed as a blackmajority district in 1968 both are seeking seats in districts that were recently carved out to embrace largely black communities Mrs Burke won 54 per cent of the vote against four male opponents in the primary in the heavily Democratic 37th district which includes Watts and much of the Los Angeles black community Senator Jordan trounced three men in the new 18th Dis trict a 52 per cent black dis trict in downtown Houston capturing 80 per cent of the vote Miami the High Point Mrs Burke achieved nation al prominence in July when she served as vice chairman of the Democratic National Convention in Miami an honor she describes as the high point of my political career but which she admits also caused her a bit of embarrass ment I dont want to be part of a cop out that keeps the black man where he has been for 200 yearstotally eliminated from moving up she explain ed in an interview before the convention Her cool good looks strik ing attire and calm handling of such controversial issues as the minority abortion plank won praise from Democratic delegates and television view ers across the country In California the combina tion had already proved its appeal In 1968 the woman whose highest political ambi tion had once been the local school board won her seat in the Assembly She had been re  elected twice and now served as chairman of the com mittee on urban development and housing Election to the Assembly came the year after Mrs Burke had served on the McCone Com mission investigating the Watts riots which she had watched from her back door She was born Oct 5 1932 the only child of a janitor at MGM studios and a real estate broker in poverty stricken East Los An geles She graduated from the University of California Los An geles which she attended on a scholarship from her fathers union but worked in garment factories libraries and at swim ming pools to pay her tuition to the University of Southern California law school When she passed the bar in 1956 the United States Supreme Court decision outlawing school seg regation was two years old Two weeks after her June victory she married Bill Burke a 33yearold black business man from exclusive Bel Air who was once an aide to her chief rival in the primary Al though she is listed on the November ballot as Yvonne Brathwaite she prefers to be known as Mrs Burke Ministers Daughter In 1966 the year Mrs Burke won her seat in the Assem bly Barbara Jordan the daugh ter of a Baptist minister from Houstons impoverished Fifth Ward won her State Senate seat after twice losing races for the state House She was reelected in 1968 for a four year term Although Senator Jordan is less well known nationally she is regarded in Texas as a bril liant politician even by her critics As President pro tern pore of the Senate she served as the nations first black gov ernor when both the Governor and Lieutenant Governor took the day off Her deep reasonant voice has been a politicial asset since 1960 when Harris County Houston Democratic head quarters moved her off the stamplicking brigade after a chance speech before voters at a local church Like Mrs Burke she had strong support from labor in the Congressional race probably as a response to her efforts in the state legis lature to extend workmens compensation benefits and to establish a minimum wage and a Fair Employment Practices Commission And like Mrs Burke she plans to be active in the Black Caucus but sees her interests as broader No Female Chauvinist If I got 80 per cent of the vote lots of white people voted for me and it was be cause they felt their interests would be included explained Senator Jordan in a recent interview in which she also said she did not intend to become a female chauvinist Barbara Jordan was born Feb 21 1936 She attended the Houston public schools graduated magna cum laude from predominantly black Texas Southern University and received her law degree from Boston University in 1959 Today she lives with her mother a few blocks from the house where she was born Her home is distinguished from the other modest houses on the street by a fresh coat of pink paint Down the street is her law office located over a print shop in a scruffy twostory building Pictures of John Ken nedy Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey decorate the walls Both women have their critics In this years primary for the first time Senator Jordan found herself fending off charges of being the Estab lishment candidate The redis tricting that gave blacks a seat on the national level de stroyed her state Senate seat and there was talk of a trade off Criticism of Mrs Burke on the other hand is less specific In a recent interview she dis played sensitivity to charges that she does not speak up enough on crucial issues I dont believe in grand standing she said but in the poverty areas if there is Isomething we need then Ill go after it She sees herself as a model for young blacks and is fond of telling a story about a 10 yearold girl who visited her office and found the small boned woman behind the desk Why how could you write the laws the child blurted You look like one of us In November Mrs Burke who says she will be disappointed if she does not get 75 per cent of the vote faces Republican Gregg Tria a 31yearold Greek Filipino who is an administra tor in the boardandcare in dustry and a recent graduate of a local law school Senator Jordan who is also considered a shooin

The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/08/archives/issues-fade-partys-getting-rough-the-campaign.html,WASHINGTON  This was to have been the year of the issues Only 10 weeks ago President Nixon told a news conference The is sues that divide the opposite side and this Administration are so wide in fact the clearest choice in this centurythat we must campaign on the issues George McGovern already had a track record in the primaries as an issueoriented can didate  Yet last week with only one month remaining before the elec tion the contest for the Presidency had turned into an ad hominem campaign marked by angry charges and bitter countercharges  with the issues all but overwhelmed On Monday Senator McGovern faced by polls showing that the majority of voters view President Nixon as the more sincere and trustworthy of the two candidates charged in speeches in Washington and New York that Richard Nixon is actually a man of no constant principles except opportunism and political manipulation He asserted that the Nixon Administration is the most corrupt in two centuries of American government And on Friday in Chicago he added the charge that Mr Nixon was follow ing murderous and barbaric poli cies in Southeast Asia On Wednesday Vice President Agnew who had started the cam paign in a subdued manner accused Senator McGovern of relying sole ly on a campaign of smear and innuendo and of promoting a philosophy of defeat that would make him popular in certain seg ments of North Vietnamese society On Thursday President Nixon called a press conference and dis missed the McGovern charge with calculated contempt After listing all of the things that the Presi dent of the United States had been accused of Mr Nixon in measured and almost inaudible tones said that although some of his advisers thought he should re spond in kind I shall not do so not now not throughout the cam paign I am not going to dignify such comments The campaign has turned into a contest not of issues but of per sonalitiesand a most strange one of its kind For Mr Nixon has suc ceeded in maintaining an image as the President to such a degree that his personality is not the issue Mr McGovern had hoped it would become Rather it is Mr McGovern who has become the issue in the campaign Ever since his nomination in July Mr McGovern has faced the problem of establishing his own credibilityso much so that what he said on the issues did not seem to matter to the majority of voters The appeals he made to the left wing of his party in the primaries branded him as a radical in the eyes of many in the center Then his efforts to shift to the center to attract the party leaders and other traditional Democrats dam aged the reputation for courage and forthrightness that he had built in the primaries And his back andforth performance on removing Senator Eagleton as his running mate raised questions for many as to his ability to make decisions as President Affecting the McGovern image too is the distortion in the way the voters perceive his positions particularly with regard to abor tion drugs and amnesty for draft evaders Long ago Senator Mc Govern moved toward the center of the electorate on these issues going out of his way to keep abor tion out of the party platform de clining to call for legalization of marijuana and saying the granting of amnesty should await the end of the war But all three issues continue to plague him In the Kentucky Senate race for example former Gov Louie B Nunn a Republican is attempting to tie his opponent Walter Huddle ston to Senator McGovern by charging that the two Democrats cannot be separated from a tripleA program of acid abortion and amnesty There are similar anomalies  Violent crimes as reported by the police have continued to rise at a record rate during the past three and a half years But as a Democratic Congressman said As an issue it is not important whether there is more or less crime but whether you are for the police Senator McGovern who has been painted as a man who would be permissive with regard to the tights of criminals began to get the mes sage last week calling for increased aid to crimetroubled cities with the assistance focused on increas ing the number of foot patrolmen  It has been a long time since the Senator talked about limiting inheritance for the very rich But a Democratic Congressman running for reelection a McGovern support er said he had encountered many bluecollar workers who were of fended by the proposal couples barely above the poverty Erie but so caught up in the American Dream that they hoped to some day be rich and leave their earn ings to their children  The Senator has been against the Vietnam war since 1963 yet polls conducted by Daniel Yankelo vich Inc for The New York Times iri late summer showed that Rich ard Nixon not George McGovern was viewed by most of those polled as the peace candidate  Thus it has come to pass that Senator McGovern the issueorient ed candidate finds himself unable to make his positions understood or accepted Confronted by dis heartening polls urged on by ad visers he has turned to frontal attacks upon the person of his op ponent And the Republicans in their own way are taking the same tack From all indications the next month is not likely to restore the faith Amerians in their po litical processes

would be taking earlier retirement and Wall Street might be a more exuberant environment As it is the forecasters and investment advisers are jig gling those 20to34yearold figures shuffling them with other factors and coming up with guesses and more ques tions Norma Pace director of industrial economics for Lionel D Edie  Co Inc who charts basic industries for Lionel Edie Inc says it is fairly easy to predict dynamic changes in the economy based on shifting age groups Take the labor force the mobility and absentee rate that are now distressing in dustry could have been calms culated 20 years ago by simply following those pro liferating babies on a grid she says A laborintensive industry should have planned its apprentice system for to day on a 1to4 rather than a 1to5 basis Companies are saying peo ple do not want to work any more Is the work ethic gone Mrs Pace is not so sure Known patterns of behavior should be tested against the changing popula tion flow she said con cluding that in the nineteen eighties there will probably be more stability in the work force because of those fam ily responsibilities the babies of the ninteenfifties will haye Contrasted with such iden tifiable predictable forces Mrs Pace admits are the unknown changes such as lifestyle Finding and not mis interpreting these changes is where the excitement of the future lies She mentions the muchtracked antimate rialistic stance of the young which like other tendencies of the now receding teenage monopoly could or could not be carried with them into maturity Mrs Pace wonders about how the young define mate rialism Certainly not by the automobile as anyone who has tried to find a parking space on a university cam pus should know Nor by television sets and highfidel ity equipment Mrs Pace a consultant to automobile makers speaks of the familiar sight on the highways of the MiddleWest a trailer pulling a jeep on which a motorcycle is loaded How many wheels does the average family need She recalls that in the early nine teensixties Chevrolet noticed a rise in the purchase of trucks for personal use and asked her to study the mean ing The truck segment of the business she says has since stretched under a growing number of products for a younger affluent and recrea tionminded market and dur ing the next dozen years will go on doing so What those young adults with small families mean to Detroit in the nineteen eighties she believes is that the station wagon will have to shrink into perhaps a pas senger car on a truck chassis The more the economic re searchers look at those young adult families the more they see At the annual meeting last month of the Confer ence Board a nonprofit busi nesssponsored research or ganization Fabian Linden the groups consumer economics chief stressed not only the age of this dominating new group of adults but their big spending influence By the end of the decade households headed by per sons under 35 will account for one out of every three dollars rung up on the na tions cash registers he said The ratio last year was one out of four But because two out of four teenagers goes on to college these days Mr Linden foresees these young householders as the more sophisticated consumers of 1980 Because more and more wives are leaving home to go to work 35 per cent now do compared with 25 per cent a decade ago these households will have at least two incomes to spend Mr Linden described an era of affluence of impos ing dimension with 42 per cent of all homes having in comes in excess of 15000 a year by 1980 Beyond that sum lies what economists call discretionary income for a family and it is projected to exceed 200billion or 23 per cent of total personal in come by 1980 What does the new lifestyle and lower birthrate of todays young adults augur for business in the US over the next decade It is expected that some of that income will be spent on those products a working wife needs such as cosmetics second cars convenience foods and meaningful vaca tions as well as on other luxuries for the family Unless of course as Mrs Pace interjects there should be a sharp change of values and women may not want to work again Putting aside social change such as liberated women who seem less eager to be mothersMr Linden expects a rise in marriages and in births because there will be a lot more women out there making them He projects 25 million marriages a year by 1980 half a million more than now though he added the qualification if marriages are still fashionable by then In 1960 the peak of the baby boom 43 million births were recorded but all it meant was that young child bearing women were 20 per cent more productive then in 1950 The current fertility rate drop indicates that more young women are bearing fewer children But still Mr Linden believes that in 1980 there will be a minimum of 43 million babies born This bodes bliss for pro ducers of onetime or dis posable products for the pre schoolage crowd such as the Procter  Gamble Com pany if it holds its share of the market with Pampers Pocket Books Inc which is the paperback publishers of Dr Benjamin Spocks Baby and Child Care and infant knitwear manufacturers Toy makers are being assured that richer parents will lavish more toys on their smaller broods In the meantime of course baby food companies like Gerber and BeechNut have been caught in the plunging birth rate as well as in price wars engendered by pre vious overcapacity the na tural food trend and food additive scares The Gerber Products Com pany has been trying to di versity BeechNut as a part of the Squibb Corporation a leader in the pharmaceutical and healthcare fields might conceivably move into the geriatric field as the cosmetic industry is laggardly think ing of doing Another result of the population shift is a 17 per cent increase by 1980 in the 65plus age group and a 13 per cent increase in those 55 and older It is the 35 to 54 year olds of the nineteenthirties lowbirth rate generation who will not change much as a population influence during the next decade Undeniably the young adult bulge signals interest in homerelated merchandise from appliances and furnish ings to howto decorating services in stores Presum ably the initial surge will be toward less expensive items and modern styling as sociated with first homes But as the bulge ages will tastes turn traditional and more ex pensive Whether those nineteen fifties babies will carry their nineteensixties teenage tastes and attitudes into their adulthood in the nineteen seventies and nineteeneight ies is one of the puzzlers Suzanne Grayson market ing consultant to the cosmet ics industry worries about the fact that those young adults who should be the prime users of cosmetics have grown up possibly painting their eyes but otherwise bare of makeup This nonhabit of the young she warns in the current issue of her monthly newsletter is the cosmetic industrys growth problem which should be tackledwith an aggressive campaign to change attitudes and behavior Harold Vogel leisure indus try analyst for Paine Web ber Jackson  Curtis Inc ponders the implications for the movie and record com panies When the under30 population that comprises 70 to 80 per cent of the movie and record audiences turns over 30 will they still go to the movies and listen to rock carrying their hab its until they are 40 or will they settle down and be lazy Americans wanting everything piped in the tube he asked The fundamentals are there the demographic fac tor the prosperity and the attitudes he said But he went on to point out where the picture clouded for the analyst and the investor A concept may be bid up to dizzying multiples as with the cabletelevision compan ies Or as with snowmobiles saturated markets and fierce competition may destroy profits Mary Wrenn the vice pres ident who directs consumer goods industry research for Merrill Lynch Pierce Fen ner  Smith Inc focuses on the longterm view for the investor and on the subtler shadings behind the obvious statistics She is often asked if the new young adults be so educated discriminating and wealthy should the discount stores be dropped from a portfolio and luxury purvey ors substituted Because they are able to identify quality they will go to discount stores for value and to luxury stores for other goods she replies Miss Wrenn has singled out concerns like the S S Kresge Company with its K Mart stores whose staple lines ap peal in periods of downturn but also draw affluent cus tomers looking for buys for their children BroadwayHale Stores Inc on the other hand has been recommended for its superior earnings its track record in operating chain stores in sub urban centers and for its de cision to go the highpriced specialty store route through its acquisition of Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Good man She stresses however that the market is paved with the wrecks of companies that read the statistical writing on the wall but lacked management talent capital or sophis ticated business systems To Prof Robert Grayson who teaches marketing at the New York University Graduate School of Business Administration and business policy at Fordham Univer sity the statistics on popula tion shift suggest that less faddish products and more solid benefits will be de manded by this aging young group Products will be less youth oriented more mature peo pleoriented though the trick will be to refer to youthful things like bicycling he said But marketing is the key The shotgun approach wont work Youll have to pick your market carefully seg ment more carefully Segmentation The word keeps popping up along with all those young adults Its now the real force says Mrs Pace the economist at Lionel Edie For her paper company clients it signifies more magazines catering to special segmented markets Segmentation was invent ed in the nineteenfifties in the baby boom she recalled Now its the key word

"Nursing, Maligned and Pitied And Yet It's a Growing Field",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/10/archives/nursing-maligned-and-pitied-and-yet-its-a-growing-field.html,When Mrs Bonnie Gremse a Cornell University graduate announced she was going to enroll at nursing school her mother said Youre too intelligent for that Her stepfather urged her to apply to medical school instead and her friends predicted that she would be committing intellectual suicide Alexandra OSheas friends at Barnard told her theyd never met a smart nurse If youre going into medicine do it right When approval does come it is often based on what many consider archaic reasoning People told Winifred Kirby Isnt that sweet youll look so pretty in your uniform Alice Bradys male acquaintances applauded her but that was because they thought of nursing as female and therefore subordinate she said Such reactions are not unusual ac cording to students who got together recently at the nursing departments of Herbert H Lehman College of the City University of New York and the Faculty of Medicine of Columbia University to discuss the reasons for their choice and the necessity of defending it And there is no doubt that nursing is increasingly on the defensive partly because it still carries the image of an overworked underpaid profession in fact nurses wages have more than dou bled in the last decade with New York municipal hospital salaries now under renegotiation starting at 10319 and the work week fixed at 40 hours and partly because it has gotten caught up in the maelstrom of the womens move ment for equality Reflects Secondary Status As Wilma Scott Heide president of the National Organization for Women who describes herself as a cardcarry ing registered nurse put it Nursing in my view and that of feminists and behavioral scientists reflects the secon dary status of women To the extent that physicians are male and nurses female you have the prototype of the malefemale relationship of the culture at large The doctor is presumably in charge the nurse serves Actually the nurse herself is not the target of womens liberation Its a bona fide and very noble profession what we object to is the fact that women are automatically tracked in that direction said Carol Kalinoski a vice president of New York NOW whose responsibili ties include employment opportunities If youre really keen on medicine why not be a doctor she asked As a result some feminist mothers choose female pediatricians as role mod els for their daughters and buy those daughters doctors kits instead of nurses kits Even Sesame Street aroused a furor when it depicted one female character as a former nurse rather than a surgeon Why then do statistics of the Na tional League for Nursing show an in crease of 17 per cent in the number of students enrolled in registered nurse programs in the last five months of 1971 over the same period of 1970 Beyond basic improvements in work ing conditions the attractions seem to have some roots in both womens liber ation and the youth revolution as well as in the upheavals occurring in nursing itself which is in the throes of rede fining and expanding its functions To the students Its less a matter of wanting to be an angel of mercy than wanting to be where the action is said Dr Claire M Fagin chairman of the twoyearold department of nursing at Lehman Nursing has become the level of where the action is while the doctor is at a level above the people Youll find as high a percentage of political activists here as in any law school said Palmer Blakley 22 a sec ondyear Columbia nursing student who earned her degree in philosophy at the University of Chicago Columbias twoyear program which leads to a bachelor of science degree requires its applicants to have a mini mum of two years of college and has a special section for college graduates Lehman offers a fouryear baccalaure ate course In her undergraduate days Miss Blak ley worked for the Presidential candi dacy of Eugene J McCarthy marched in antiwar moratoriums in Chicago and Washington and was involved in local reform Democratic politics Then you decide I cant cope with a societal problem on a onetomany basis because Im impotent to do any thing about it she said So then you decide to work on a onetoone basis because in that context you can do good for or with somebody For Alexandra OShea 22 the polit ioal turning point carne when she dropped out of Barnard I didnt feel I was accomplishing anything and taught on an Indian reservation I decided there was a cultural con flict [in teaching Indians] and I have very strong feelings about the destruc tion of culture I got mad at the Govern ment and decided there were two things I could do become President of the United States or work with people on a onetoone basis she said Ellen McTigue 21 a Lehman sopho more came to nursing from a different but no less political route womens lib eration She said she sees no conflicts between the movements tenets and nursing Miss McTigue a parttime gardener at the Bronx Botanical Gardens decided to enter college after working for sev eral years as a waitress I realized that I didnt want to do that for the rest of my life she said I wanted basically to work with wo men in the community and there is room for growth and change in the health system as far as women are concerned The abortion law and contraception have bombarded women with new and con fusing possibilities Sometimes the prospective nurses im petus comes not from politics but from religion A secondyear Columbia student Kay Shrman 27 had taken her vows and was on her way to becoming a nun but then chose to leave her order the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity I am now living the Gospels as I see them she said Nursing puts me in a position to help people Mrs Nancy Moore too found that nursing coincided with religious princi ples I have gone through a period of deepening religious faith said the 29 yearold mother of two but there are few opening in church work [Mrs Moore is a Methodist] I was seeking inner fulfillment and I became aware that the role of the nurse is changing that she is becoming more responsible more independent Of course when student populations are as diverse geographically economi cally and educationally as society at large not everyone is drawn to nursing by politics or liberation or religion As it always was the desire simply to help others remains a primary motive Motivated as a Child Sometimes that desire orginates In childhood as it did for Lillian Bertalen a 20yearold Columbia student I have Dr Kildare and Sue Barton to thank she said with a giggle Now I take a more realistic attitude but I still think this is a way of recognizing a persons significance At other times the motivation comes from adult experience as it did for Bar bara Felson 27 who is a political sci ence graduate of George Washington University but because she was mar ried in school was never career ori ented When she was separated from her husband in 1970 she moved from Cin cinnati to New York and to a fruitless job search She ultimately obtained a position as an au pair girl caring for two children whose mother she later learned was dying of cancer I became terribly involved I saw the way the family interracted and how it affected the children neighbors and friends said Mrs Felson who plans to specialize in cancer care when she graduates from Columbia One thing all the students have ac quired is a ready answer to that ques tion why not be a doctor I originally wanted to be one but it just doesnt offer what I want said Valerie Schneer 19 of Lehman The doctor makes rounds and rarely spends more than 15 minutes with the patient The nurse is not subordinate to the doctor said Jill Glatter another Leh man sophomore Its a specific profes sion You function independently and if you dont you shouldnt be a nurse

THE 1972 CAMPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/12/archives/hard-hats-spurred-nixon-labor-bid.html,WASHINGTON Oct 11I was elected to smash the labor bossesRepresentative Rich ard M Nixon quoted in an in terview on his first day in Con gress Jan 3 1947 There will be no antilabor plank in this platformPres ident Nixons instructions to the Republican platform com mittee August 1972 as quoted by an Administration aide President Nixon considered an adversary of organized labor for much of his long po litical career has now won substantial labor support in his bid for reelection How did he do it It was during the turmoil surrounding the United States invasion of Cambodia in 1970 that the President decided he could split a significant por tion of the labor vote away from the Democratic party ac cording to labor sources In the intervening two and a half years the President and his campaign aides have ener getically and systematically courted these labor votes The Events Recalled A wellplaced Administration source recalled the events dur ing the Cambodian crisis that led to the Presidents decision We were sitting around the White House feeling that the country was collapsing around us Thousands of kids were marching in Washington and then that Kent State thing hap pened Then we heard that 100000 hard hats were marching on Wall Street in New York in support of the President It had an electrifying effect on every body including the President It struck him that those work ers had the same feeling about the country he did It now appears that President Nixon has been more success ful in courting the political support of organized labor than any Republican Presidential candidate in recent history He has been endorsed by un ions or the leaders of unions representing about five million workers according to the Com mittee for the Reelection of the President Campaign aides expect that Mr Nixon will re ceive double the 25 to 35 per cent of the bluecollar vote he received in his race against Hubert H Humphrey In 1968 His formal support from labor is admittedly narrow so far It comes chieflyalthough not exclusivelyfrom the International Brotherhood of Teamsters the construction unions and the maritime trades These are unions on the rela tively affluent and conserva tive end of the labor spectrum Senator McGovern has been endorsed by even more unions with a total membership of more than eight million workers Unions that have endorsed the Democratic ticket moreover are those traditionally active in national politics But as one Democratic campaign official noted glumly the Democratic party must have solid labor support to win even in the close elections We havent lost all that much of labor but what weve lost is enough to fix our clock he said The reasons for Mr Nixons success with organized labor are many and complex Some will emerge only in the future But as Secretary of Labor James D Hodgson pointed out in a recent interview President Nixon kept the door open to labor even when he was being vilified as labors number one enemy by the American Fed eration of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations and others Thus the President and his political strategists set about peeling off as one dis gruntled Democratic party of ficial put it that segment of the trade union movement that could be lured from its tradi tional allegiance to the Demo cratic party Many of the unions that have endorsed the President thus far have received governmental favors concessions or prefer ences of some sort Although the Administration protests that it was a coinci dence the teamsters endorse ment of the President and the White House decision to drop plans for antistrike legislation in the transportation industry occurred within a few days of each other Wage increases due under the teamsters master freight con tract were approved by the Pay Board although there was a questionresolved by techni cal proceduresabout whether they conformed to the boards rules Frank E Fitzsimmons president of the teamsters re mained on the board when the other labor members quit last March Although there has been some speculation that the Ad ministration let the former teamster president James R Hoffa out of prison in return for a union endorsement for the President Administration sources make a persuasive case that this was not so The construction unions have also been the beneficiary of some special treatment by the Administration The construc tion industry has been given a separate wage control board and construction wage in creases while reduced are still running ahead of wage in creases going to workers in the rest of the economy Recently substantial Federal funds for construction projects were unfrozen and pumped into the economy creating ad ditional jobs for construction workers The construction unions have made no secret of the fact they are pleased with the Adminis trations modification of the Philadelphia Plan which origi nally was designed to increase the number of minority workers in the building trades The president of the Ameri can Federation of Government Employes John F Griner made a personal endorsement of the President after the Administra tion approved wage concessions for Federal bluecollar workers Mr Griner made his endorse ment despite objections from members of the union Roth Republican and Demo cratic campaign officials con cede that the decision by George Meany president of the labor federation to remain neutral was crucial to the Presidents ability to win labor support I would rather have had Meanys neutrality than the en dorsement of all construction trades and the teamsters com bined one Administration of ficial said Its not so much what he brought us as what he denied the opposition Clash With Meany Last winter when the Presi dent received a cool welcome at the AFLCIO convention in Miami and when the Adminis tration engaged in a verbal as sault on Mr Meany himself it seemed as though Mt Meany and his labor federation would be the most active and effec tive opponent of the Presidents reelection bid At that time the wellplaced Administration source disclosed many of the Presidents closest political strategists were urging himto adopt a strong antilabor posture in his campaign tactics in much the way that President Franklin D Roosevelt once ran against the National Associa tion of Manufacturers But Mr Nixon remained con vinced that he could attract substantial labor support and rejected the advice of his po litical advisers When Mr Meany fell ill af ter ter the AFLCIO convention President Nixon sent him a warm personally written note along with a box of cigars More important the Adminis tration gave up its efforts to block the payment of deferred and retroactive wages through the Pay Board Gus Tyler assistant presi dent and political officer of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union traces Mr Nix ons success to his application of his Southern and Roman Catholic strategies toward the relatively affluent bluecollar workers The Southern strategy is di rected at white ethnics liv ing in embattled urban areas who are angered by issues such as crime busing and quotas The Catholic strategy accord ing to Mr Tyler appeals to traditionalism among workers and rejects abortion marijua na rights for homosexuals and amnesty for Vietnam deserters all of which are somehow linked to Senator McGovern At Democratic national head quarters one melancholy cam paign official summed up the Presidents technique in seek ing labor support Nixon gnaws around the edges of a workers life Ho hasnt touched the central trade union part But he gnaws a little at the Catholic part a little at the Polish part a little at the patriotic part and a lit tle at the antihippie part After a while he has an awful lot of that worker
Candidate Sargent Shriver is,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/15/archives/a-supersalesman-in-a-very-tough-territory-shriver-member-of-the.html,In my first glimpse of him he was milking a cow somewhere in upstate New York By such means do politicians make the network news It was impossible to tell from the tube whether the suit was by Cardin and the shoes by Gucci but one of the few things we all know about Sargent Shriver who dresses him If youre going to milk cows in New York there is a lot to be said for dressing properly for the job Sarge and the cow stuck in my mind for I knew the man only by his stereotype which was Yaleman and sportsman Kennedy clansman by marriage energetic dogooder and everybodys favorite lightweight The name Sargent by itself suggests noncommissioned rank in the Kennedy officer corps His friends and associates give a very different version The first important fact about Sarge that he inspires fierce loyalty affection and respect The respect is the most important point Most of the people who have had anything to do with him at the Peace Corps in the poverty program or at the US Embassy in Paris tell it the same way They expected him to be a kind of a jerk a superficial Yale guy a Boy Scout the guy who married the bosss daughter Then they tell how he wowed them For example Charles Peters a Peace Corps colleague now an editor and publisher remembers Shriver returning from his first roundtheworld trip He just took us by storm with his report Ive never seen a guy so completely capture a group like he did His friends emphasize his seriousness his intellectual as well as his physical energy the breadth and depth of his reading and above all the strength of religious convictions which inspire his vocation for public service When I asked William Josephson Shrivers campaign coordinator to sum him up he said He has a desire to be profound which is a very rare quality in American politics If I hadnt already heard similar judgments I would have scoffed at this Sarge just doesnt look profound even when he is not milking cows The criticisms of him follow much the same lines too He is somewhat erratic as an administrator Whereas the Kennedy style is to cover every base Sarge likes to release creative energy and trust in the essential goodness of man He adopts the grapeshot approach and never puts one man on a job when six will do According to one former colleague He tends to be a bit royal a bit noblesse oblige in his social and staff relationships Everybody makes the point that he needs the restraint of others especially when he gets his salesmans foot in the door He is full of bright ideas but scores about 2 out of 10 According to a fellow old New Frontiersman Sarge has this extraordinary combination of high intelligence and often wisdom and extreme vulgarity At the Peace Corps he took lots of brave and principled decisions but there was a fraudulent side to him He had the PR mans concern with how it sounded rather than how it eyes Sarge asked her if she spoke Portuguese Another girl nearly swooned and said Oh I cant believe Im standing here Sarge couldnt stop talking even at that hour of the morning He gave the Floridians a glowing account of his travels It was all very winning but sounded too good to be true The change of atmosphere in the campaign had been extraordinary he told them He was full of what had happened in Little Rock Ark Gov Dale Bumpers had met him at the airport and said Ive good news for you John McClellan has just given you and the ticket a ringing endorsement When they reached the hotel somebody came rushing out and said Senator McClellans in there with television cameras And sure enough he was falling all over Sarge with friendliness and then riding out to the airport with him Good news from California too Labor leaders there had been assuring him that the McGovern  Shriver campaign was in better shape than the HumphreyMuskie campaign in 68 The opinion polls Trouble was they were national polls said Sarge and the Presidential election was not a national election but 50 simultaneous state elections Local polls were showing the Democratic ticket only six or seven points behind Nixon in key states such as Massachusrtts Iowa California he claimed In Michigan they had narrowed the gap 17 points He was interrupted in full flow of euphoria by the news that Governor Askew was on the phone There followed one of those very unprivate conversations for the benefit of the cameras speaking on the telephone for public effect is a difficult art Good morning Governor how are you this morning  Im very very happy you took the trouble to call me this morning  I know you must be very busy up there in Tallahassee  You are up there in Tallahasse  You just inter Fine Fine  Fine  Sure thing Well thank you for calling Governor Goodby Governor Over and out He hadnt come here to make a speech said Sarge returning to the breakfast table But he couldnt resist it and made another one The United Rubber Cork Linoleum and Plastic Workers of America had been waiting in the convention hall of the nextdoor hotel They looked as if they had had a rougher night than Sarge To fill in the time one of them sang the Fascination Waltz in English and in French Mercifully Shriver now arrived this time with his wife Eunice in tow She has a royal effect on bystanders and is used it People whispered There she iss Its herl The night before the rubber workers had endorsed the Democratic ticket A big blownup picture of McGovern was now on the wall Shriver said several was thought to be close to George Meany the implacable AF LCIO boss The rubber workers endorsement was seen as a hopeful omen Later admirable Pete presented a check to Sarge who it ecstatically in front of the cameras The reporters wrote down Only 15 000 Shrivers assignments in the first weeks of the campaign were to unruffle feathers among the regulars and labor leaders raise money for strapped campaign and try to enthuse Demovoters and stop their halfhearted defection the Nixon camp The message to union gathersuch as the rubber workers was that it was the same old religion The pocketbook issues still at the top of the agenda the Democratic needed the support of the working man and working man needed the Democratic party as much as ever Organized labor needed who are interested in rebuilding our sopeople like George McGovern and Pete Bommarito Shriver has been a friend of labor ever since New Deal his own family fortunes were away by the Depressionand as editor of Yale Daily News he wrote editorials in supof the Detroit sitdown strikers While briefly journalist he was active in the American NewsGuild and had supported the Association of Catholic Trade Unionists But what did the rubber who do dirty smelly jobs in places like Ohio make of this cultured wellbred wellexquisitely dressed husband of a millionairess He played on a distinction between them and you They ate in executive dining rooms or in restaurants on expense accounts you eat in the canteen and cant even claim expenses for a Hershey bar They had reserved parking spaces with their names on them you hunt and hunt [for a a place to park] and then walk an hour to work They took time off to visit the dentist and stayed home if they didnt feel well you get your pay docked if you are off work for an hour Sarges sincerity was plain but you could almost hear the workers asking themselves Hell when did that guy last work in a factory eat in a canteen or hunt for a parking space It had just been reported in the papers that Shriver earns 125000 a year in his law practice Next stop on the crazy crazy schedule was Dubuque Iowa During the night something had happened to the plane a chartered 727 It now the freshly painted legend Fighting Lucky 7 Victory in the Air The Lucky Seven are the seven ShriversSarge Eunice four sons and a daughter Saige also felt that his lucky number come up or so he claimed when he became McGoverns allegedly seventh choice of running mate Victory in the Air Well at least Sarge was in the air no doubt about that he would have flown more than 11000 miles by the end of that week The plane is specially equipped with a traveling campaign headquarters in the forward cabin and an office and communications center at the rear The press and the Secret Service make the filling in the sandwich Having a telephone on board keeps Sarge happy Telephoning is his one known vice He doesnt smoke takes only a glass or two of wine a day with meals and when asked after the Eagleton debacle if there were any skeletons in his closet said Only Eunice But when it comes to the telephone he is a mainliner At the Peace Corps and OEO his favorite toy was a device known to its victims as the buzz bomb By pressing a button Sarge could speak to any one of 25 people in each organization I could push the button and speak to Colombia South America and then push another button and speak to Columbia University in New York Donald McClure who was with Shriver at the Peace Corps and who was his press officer when Sarge was whooping up support for Democratic Congressmen in the 1970 midterms says that he will pick up the phone and call anyone who strikes his fancy somebody in the news or the author of a book which interested him When he saw the movie Patton his favorite and also Nixons he thought the generals opening speech was the best Middle American speech he had ever heard so he called Joe Mankiewicz the director and said I want the guy who wrote that speech He spotted a Business Week story about a Hawaiian tycoon Get me Honolulu ordered Sarge In the end they tracked the man down in Hong Kong and he was so flattered at being called that he contributed handsomely to the Democratic campaign A good many of the men traveling with Shriver and on the Shriver staff at McGovern headquarters at 1910 K Street Washington are people he collected in the Peace Corps and OEO days and some of them he met for the first time over the telephone When the call from McGovern came on Aug 8 he was staffless save for his secretary at his Washington law firm Bill Josephson arrived home in Long Island that night to find a pile of urgent telephone messages he packed a bag and hasnt been home since His appointment as campaign coordinator began Josephsons first essay in politicking on a national scale he had been chief counsel at the Peace Corps done some data work for a Lindsay campaign and managed a Congressional campaign in New York State Sarges campaign manager at headquarters Lee White has no previous Shriver connections but top aides to both White and Josephson Tersh Boasberg and Mickey Kanton were former OEO officers and the man who is conducting Shrivers grassroots drive Herbert Kramer was Director of Public Affairs at 0EO Among the speech writers Michael Novak Catholic philosopher and authority on ethnic politics was picked up by Shriver on the telephone in 1970 after Sarge had read aloud at the dinner table from Novaks book The Experienct of Nothingness Novak is the chief influence behind Shrivers increasing emphasis on the problems and fears of the white ethnic groups He is also said to be Sarges father confessor He remembers on his first visit to Timberlawn the Shrivers Maryland home Eunice instructed him to explain to Bobby Shriver then 16 why premarital sexual intercourse is wrong Novak says that he began writing Shrivers acceptance speech three hours after Eagleton withdrewI knew it had to be him Shriver has his own staff of between 60 and 70 of whom 15 travel with him His scheduling and advancing are done by the McGovern people and his speeches are cleared in Washington with the McGovern issues men upstairs One senior McGovern staffer said Its incredible whats going on in that outfit Sarge has his own very close personal staff and they are putting together a number of independent operations It looks as if Sarge is trying to put together his own base for a bid for the Presidency in 1976 Lee White denies vigorously that anything of the kind is going on The McGovern people are suspicious of independent fund  raising and of Shrivers grassroots activities White says that any money raised by Shriver goes into the campaign bag He says that the former Peace Corps and OEO people who are volunteering for Shriver are being woven into the McGovern campaign There was no independent voter registration going on White said We dont have to build a national apparatus and we are not trying to The atmosphere on the Fighting Lucky 7 was of a jolly bunch of amateurs learning on the job with not much to lose and everything to gain There were grumbles about the scheduling which it was felt was making Shriver into too much of a surrogate rushing him around and not giving him enough chance to make an impact on the issues Since I traveled with him his campaign has begun to take a more distinctive shape with the candidate hitting issues of his own choice and scheduling major speeches on subjects which especially concern him such as what he calls the injustice of justice All the way from Miami Shriver was working on the speech he was to make at a Catholic college in Dubuque evidently it had an importance for him greater than its political importance At Cedar Rapids we had to change to a smaller plane and on the halfhour journey to Dubuque I talked with him above the propeller roar of the Basler Airline charter which in honor of the occasion was being flown by Capt Warren L I wanted to explore three themes but we didnt get very far with any of them There was the question of why a public fnan of 56 had never come out and run for office before was this lack of opportunity or some lack of inner will Then there was the Kennedy connection a delicate subjecthad it forwarded his career or held him down And most interesting because the least explored there was the intellectual and religious side of his character which his friends had so emphasized Of the opportunities he might have had to run for office Shriver mentioned only 1960 when he considered trying for the Governorship of Illinois But there had been a family decision to concentrate on Jack Kennedys bid for the Presidency In his younger days although always preoccupied with public service he hadnt wanted to make his living out of politics He had liked the idea of journalism best We then got sidetracked into a reprise of his career He held himself a lucky man He had lived in Maryland New York Illinois and California He had got to know and like the great heartland of America Im not an Easterner I have an empathy with the plains Hed had an incredible succession of jobs not just the Peace Corps and the OEO but chairman of the Chicago School Board running the second largest school system in the country When we got onto the inspiration behind the activity the names of authors and books came pouring out as I had been warned they would His range of reading sounded pretty impressive he is particularly steeped in the literature of Catholic humanism One of the names he dropped was Yves Simon I would have been stumped by this one had I not been well briefed by Mike Novak who as an example of Shrivers prodigious reading cited an ob scure little book on race relations by a Catholic philosopherlawyer called Yves Rena Marie Simon So I was able to nod knowingly when Sarge mentioned this in connection with how he would go about mastering a problem First you have to reach an intellectual understanding of the problem he said For example when I was interested in interracial justice I read about 25 books on the subject Then Id go ahead take a position and do it He went on In the United States if you go around looking like a longhair its extremely difficult to obtain effective public support for what you want to do But my approach is first to understand it intellectually and then if I believe in it personally go sell it I know some people say Im just a salesman or a slick something or other Ive read that many times and I dont care if it helps me to get things done I didnt expect to draw him out very far on the Kennedys He looked at me straight with the handsome greygreen eyes and said No family could have been better to me in every possible way I asked him about his fatherinlaw who had been the first to see the possibilities in Sarge Joe Kennedy opened my eyes tointroduced me to you might saywhat people call the second half of me He taught me to bring my secondhand somewhat abstract bookish ideas down to earthand sell them Joe Kennedy was no intellectual but he knew how to soot and make use of other peoples abilities Pressed again on the family he said chin jutting now I dont feel that my name is Kennedy My name is Shriver I dont have to do things in a certain way because the Kennedys do But then he quickly added I dont want you to get the idea that this implies any disrespect for what they have achieved Mr Basler was now making a noisy but safe landing at Dubuque Shriver began little peroration which lasted until after the propellers were silent He leaned toward me with friendly enthusiasm talking even faster now Here I am running for Vice President Its incredible I have never run for office before and I never sought this office Im an unprecedented candidate Willkie had never run for office but he actively sought the Presidency So did Eisenhower who took part in party convention I was in Moscow during this years Democratic convention I didnt even see it on television I came onto the ticket without what would normally be considered political power that is if power is the number of votes a man can deliver in the way that a mans worth is said to be his wealth I may be able to get millions of votes for all I know but I didnt come onto this ticket like a bride with a dowry It had seemed a stimulating talk The Shriver charm is powerful and the enthusiasm infectious No doubt he is a good man earnest to do good But when I looked at my notebook later there wasnt much there Marrying a Kennedy says a student of that exotic anthropology means accepting secondclass citizenship in the clan Our few hours in Dubuque underlined the most important single fact about Shriver the force of his religion Dubuque has an 80 per cent Catholic population and is sometimes known as Little Rome because of the number of Catholic institutions there Shriver is an old friend of Loras College where the banners said Welcome back He soon had the priests chuckling with confessional jokes Sample The priest who said You dont need any other penance as long as Nixon is President The speech he made was profoundly Catholic in concept and imagery he analyzed the war in Vietnam in terms of original sin He dwelt upon two election issues of importance to Catholicsparochial schools and abortion He declared himself a stanch advocate of Federal funds for parochial schools and a sworn enemy of abortion on demand or for reasons of population control Abortion is an awkward question for Shriver He stands on the same formula as McGovern who having earlier been identified with reform now opposes abortion on demand and leaves the question to the states A reporter who got hold of Shrivers notes discovered that he had left out a reference to the right to life from its very beginnings But it was as recently as June this year in a commencement address at the Noroton School in Connecticut which is run by the Convent of the Sacred Heart that Shriver said Another answer to violence and death is the organization called Birthright Birthright fights against legalized abort on Birthright fights for life against death fights for the weakest of all human beings the speechless fetus living inside the mothers womb The Noroton commencement speech is a revealing document Its theme is that Christian action is more potent and more important than political action It is the speech of a politician more concerned with souls than citizens though he was not then a candidate The emphasis is not on socioeconomic change but charity charity in the saintly sense as exemplified by Mother Teresa of Calcutta The early Christians he noted fought and died to achieve a radical change in the social and political systems of their times But most of all they recommended change inside they said change yourself stop worrying about your clothes your money your house  and start concentrating on the poor living with them accepting their food their houses their hopelessness their hunger preaching the gospel to them working with them and for them At the end of that speech Shriver told his young audience that in 1962 he would have urged them to join the Peace Corps or the War on Poverty He still urged them so to do but these programs were no longer enough There was no Federal money for good works and the war in Vietnam went on under whomever was President And so today I urge you still to join VISTA and Peace Corps if the spirit moves you But I urge you even more to consider Mother Teresa and her work Birthright and its work the Sisters of the Sacred Heart and their work Because their work is Gods work and their way may well be the only way because its Gods way Shriver is a fan of Robert Bolts A Man for All Seasons One can see why he might identify with Thomas More politician lawyer wit and man of culture in his fight against the temptation to resort to moral gesture Enthusiasm is a vice for thinking fastidious Catholics of Shrivers kind The Berrigans gave way to enthusiasm and one may suspect that Shriver is sorely tempted Now that Shriver is on the Democratic ticket with Kennedyfamily approval lips are sealed on the old internecine quarrels But according to close friends Shriver feelsalthough he denied it in our conversationthat his talents might have received more recognition and found better employment had he not been caught in the Kennedy nexus One family friend described a monumental hostility between Sarge and the rest of the family His wife may not have actually said No its Bobs turn when Sarges name was touted as a possible running mate for Johnson in 1964 but that was certainly the opinionand indeed the decision  of the family Much the same happened in 1968 when Humphrey emissaries to Paris discovered that Shriver would be interested in a place on the ticket But soundings in Hyannisport indicated that the family would not be amused Said one of Humphreys advisers at that time We needed the goodwill of the Kennedys more than we needed Sarge His name was effectively vetoed Sarge had already blotted his copybook that year by preferring the Ambassadorship to Paris which he had already accepted from LBJ to a role in Bobby Kennedys latestarting campaign for the Democratic nomination Kennedy did not deign to even discuss his intentions with Shriver during the long period of agonized indecision which preceded his declaration In 1970 when Shriver Worked hard for the election of Democrats to Congress he was suspected of personal ambition which might queer Edward Kennedys pitch in 1972 or 1976 One of Shrivers aides described what happened That fall we would go up to the Cape most weekends and Sarge would be carved upWhy did you say that why the hell did you say this  Marrying a Kennedy said another student of that exotic anthropology means accepting secondclass citizenship in the clan Shriver got on best with Jack Kennedy who was his own age He had married the favorite sister Moreover Kennedy came to recognize Shrivers abilities first as talent scout for the Administration Robert McNamara was his chief find and then as the man who made a success of the Peace Corps It must have been hard for Shriver after Kennedys death to play second fiddle to the younger brothers He considered his own talents superior at least to Teddys said a friend He had to put up with a good deal of condescension People working in the 1960 campaign remember how the attitude was Oh well youve got to tolerate the brotherinlaw Bob didnt like him or respect him and Sarge knew it said a friend of both men He had the fighters contempt for a man who didnt have that quality The slogans which Shriver pins up in his office are not wholly convincing Does he really believe that Nice guys dont win ballgames or that theres no place in the club for good losers According to one friend it wasnt only the Kennedys who held Shriver back from seeking elected office He is a man who has a real need to function in the public service and the public eye but he doesnt have the kind of guts to run for office He has never been sure that he has what he has which is ability of his own so hes always looked for the sure thing He needs somebody to give him his opportunities But once Daddy has given him the job he does it well There are guys like that I actually think he would make a pretty good President but he wouldnt run for it if there were risks involved Shriver joined the McGovern ticket without illusions He knew perfectly well that the ticket was in bad shape After he had accepted the McGovern staff came out to Timberlawn and Sarge playing the devils advocate and the old New Frontier efficiency monger put them through their paces on McGoverns welfare position and was appalled to discover that they didnt know what the candidates position was His friends say that he accepted the nomination for two reasons One was Hes the sort of guy who believes that public service means leaping to attention when you are asked The other was that he wanted a platform for his ideas he really does think that he has something important to say to the country Back in April at his dinner table friends were tossing around who should be the Democratic nominee All sorts of names were mentioned and Sarge was nettled that nobody named him Later on he endorsed Ed Muskie At that dinner party he said George is a good guy but I dont believe he can win Now that he is the running mate not a word of disloyalty will pass his lips His aides plead the Fifth if you ask them what he really thinks of McGovern Shriver shares nearly all McGoverns positions Yet nobody accuses him of being a radical the equivalent of bad breath in American politics In many ways Shriver has more radical instincts than McGovern whose conservative prairie roots go deep After all Sarge sets out to change human nature  no less Yet paradoxically he is also better able to talk the language of Mayor Daley of Chicago and other party regulars The impression prized from his staff is that although he could exchange speeches with George McGovern he doesnt think much of the candidate as a politician Would Sarge like to be President Oh yes said a close friend He thinks he should be at the top of the ticket The McGovern people have qualified admiration for Sarge Hes not exactly Presidential material but hes better than the usual sort of creep who gets on the ticket was one verdict They think hed make an excellent Veep Like all Vice  Presidential aspirants Shriver has grandiose ideas about the office But in the McGovern camp they say Wed put him in the Executive Office Building like all the others and when he got restless send him globetrotting Sarge is a great globetrotter Sargent Shriver somebody once wrote is an easy man to meet but a difficult man to know That is true There is a puzzling gap between Shriver the bookworm and Sarge the supersalesman But Sarge bridges the gaps all the while giving the impression of a too welldressed saint  a sort of Teilhard de Chardin One mustnt underestimate the inspirational effect that he has on others or the loyalty he commands these are valid qualities of leadership He is a man of admirable zeal He does a good job of being faithful to himself Yet there is something not quite convincing about him His need to give Christian witness to eternal truth blunts the urgency which a practical reforming politician must have Politics is about choice and the choice unfortunately often lies between lesser and greater evil One doubts whether Sarge has the ruthlessness of his good intentions He would make an admirable and uplifting Vice President And possibly who knows if God or Daddyever handed him the top job he might surprise his ability When Shriver established the Peace Corps against odds President Kennedy reportedly said We sold him a lemon and he made lemonade Second place on the McGovern ticket looked like a political lemon if ever there was one when Shriver became the running mate But at least Sarge is squeezing the last drop of juice from it 
L.I.'s Liberated Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/15/archives/lis-liberated-women-lis-liberated-women-moving-on-several-fronts.html,Long Islands women liberationists are older and wiser Mrs Linda Lamel president of the Long Island chapter of the National Organization for Women says that there are fewer young people in the womens movement on the Island than in the city and that they tend to be less radical But older women who make up the bulk of about 1500 women in organized groups on Long Island may be more radical than those in the city she said One explanation came from Susan Ellman a leading force in the Womens Liberation Center of Nassau County She said Suburban women with kids and successful husbands are discovering that the American dream hasnt come true  even though it has come true They are perhaps more miserable and frustrated and angry than others who didnt buy the dream or didnt achieve the dream For them theres no more illusion than theres something out there to hope for The womens movement on Long Island includes several large activist organizations and dozens of small socalled consciousnessraising groups many of them unknown to one another The consciousnessraising groups usually have five to 15 members who take turns speaking of their personal feeling and experiences often discovering that others have similar problems and reactions These groups intentionally have no leaders Several Groups Involved Among the diverse activist groups are the Long Island chapter of the National Organization for Women NOW the Pulse of Women POW which was the forerunner of the National Womens Political Caucus and its Nassau and Suffolk branches Suffolk Womens Liberation the Feminist Press which publishes childrens literature and biographies of women and affiliates of the The Right to Choose abortion lobby Most of the Nassau consciousness  raising groups were formed under the umbrella of the Womens Center of Nassau County in Port Washington which now has 40 groups The center moved this month to Hempstead changing its name to the Womens Liberation Center of Nassau County The handful of original members of the group sent members to help form other groups which in turn helped to form more groups New womens centers were established in Long Beach and Woodmere Other unaffiliated consciousness  raising groups are scattered throughout the county There are a few in Great Neck and chapters of Encore a consciousnessraising type of group for divorced and separated women In Suffolk consciousnessraising groups stretch the length and breadth of the county from the 15 groups affiliated with the Huntington Womens Center to the 80member South Fork Womens Liberation Coalition whose originating members came from scattered consciousness  raising groups from Hampton Bays to Montauk They take public action together as well sparking new consciousnessraising groups The activist groups often help consciousness raising groups to form and also use the same discussion techniques in their own workshop sessions The consciousness  raising groups often take part in activities of the action groups or in activities of their own particularly in initiating courses and sending out speakers One such speaker who was sent recently to describe the movement at a Great Neck adult education class ended up turning almost the entire class into a new consciousnessraising group Mrs Lamel said that the number of members of all the organized groups on the Island gives little indication of the extent of the movement The movement is a process she said Every time a woman tries to straighten out her relationship with her husband or goes back to work or school which so many more are doing lately thats a part of the  movement The later marriage of women the number of women running for office thats a part of the movement too Mrs Lamel was a charter member of tong Island NOW the first womens liberation group on the Island She recalls talking with about a dozen other Long Islanders some of them members of New York NOW in the living room of a Rockville Centre home in April 1969 A friend who knew some of the others had asked her to come along and she found herself discussing vague feelings that something was wrong with the Way women were treated We asked each other Do we believe this is wrong and answered Yes We asked Should it be changed and said Yes again Then we asked How and decided to apply for a NOW charter to try to change things through legislation and also by educating on womens problems so women would support the legislative efforts An Idea Is Formed Mrs Lamel whose experiences are similar to those related by many others in the movement said she had never thought about womens liberation before attending that meeting When I talked with the others I knew something was wrong I had graduated from college with almost impossible qualifications and found I couldnt get a job I was offered 15 less a week to go into publishing than they offered one of my fellow students who was male Some places said they would have given me a job teaching but we already have one woman in this department I was rejected from graduate schools while men with worse grades got into them Suddenly I said The problem was that I was discriminated against because I was a woman Mrs Lamel said that carter counseling tests she took showed she had the aptitudes to become a doctor or a lawyer but her parents discouraged her because marriage might interrupt such a career So I became a teacher she said It took me 10 years but I went back to law school this fall anyway Resisting the pressure to follow many of her friends in marrying after college graduation she said she moved down the block from her parents house to her own apartment and stayed there for several months I got married in February 1965 to someone I had known all through school I felt tremendous pressure to validate myself as a woman by getting married  because I was 21 I realized later those months alone were some of the most joyous of my life The women in the newly formed Long Island NOW discussed job discrimination and role expectation she said explaining Most of us were working and coming home and cooking dinner and washing dishes and taking out laundry My assumption was that a career was okay as long as I fulfilled all of the responsibilities of a wife and mother So we were working twice as hard as our husbands Mrs Lamel who was later divorced said she felt the womens movement made it possible I had to decide whether I could think of myself as a fully independent person without sharing it with a man she said The first large project of Yong Island NOW was a survey of Long Island doctors on their views of abortion repeal Among its more recent projects were gathering petitions for the Equal Rights Amendment working for integrated shop and home economics courses in schools before similar statewide legislation passed and lobbying for the state jury duty bill for elimination of sex discrimination in education for employing female news carriers and for classifying maternity as a disability The group has had programs with speakers on psychoanalysis job discrimination the image of women in society education and women in the arts We have 225 members Mrs Lamel said But at our program on Sexism and Education more than 200 showed upmost of them not in NOW At our meeting on Psychoanalysis and Women 100 showed up most of them not in NOW Consciousness  raising on Long Island began separately and soon after the Long Island NOW formed A group most of them students gathered in the spring of 1969 in the home of the wife of a faculty member at Old Westbury who had been in a group in New York City The group decided at first not to participate in consciousness  raising but changed its view after an experience at an Old Westbury sitin a couple of months later The women had helped organize the sitin Mrs Ellman said But when it came to taking action to going to see the president of the school the men students went and to hell with the women The group reacting to male chauvinism by men of the left decided to have a course on womens liberation which became a consciousnessraising group Follow the Pattern The pattern followed that of many radical college women in the city and in the rest of the country who spearheaded the current womens movement Mrs Ellman a new suburban housewife who had been seriously ill and confined to her home for the year since her marriage wandered over to the Old Westbury campus put of curiosity a year later and participated in open consciousness  raising sessions being held there by the original group during a new sitin I really felt Thats all very nice for all those people with problems but what has it got to do with me  she recalled I went there to meet people I didnt have any concept of the womens movement Mrs Ellman said she went to the group partly out of loneliness and isolation a feeling she thinks is common and drives many suburban women to consciousnessraising groups One woman In a group described the streets of the suburbs in terms of getting to know only the outside of cars not of people she said People dont walk in the suburbs To me people walking around can seem just as dead although theres the appearance of life in people on a street But the woman got to think in terms of greeting the cars in place of people who never passed She would say Hello blue cedan every day but never know the driver Being married also means having no close friends she said I married and moved to where my husband could get to his job like everybody else The group gave me a feeling that I wasnt alone that I wasnt the only one who had the feeling of not being regarded as a person Different Groups Meet The initial consciousraising group at Old Westbury moved to the city the following year But others from the open consciousnessraising sessions got together with women who attended a Stony Brook womens conference in May 1970 sponsored by the Old Westbury women and an independently formed Stony Brook consciousnessraising group Mrs Ellman joined them in a new group which is still meeting Another independently formed group at Adclphia University sponsored a conference in November 1970 and Mrs Ellmans group met the new group and a third group of consciousnessraising women there a group of older Long Island women who had attended New York NOW meetings and friends of theirs When we saw them we were so excited that there were older women doing the same things she recalled And they said We cant tell you how fantastic it is to see you young women so alive  It was a glimmer of a real movement on Long Island  Mrs Ellmans group known as group No 1 the older womens group which is also still meeting and the Adelphi group sparked a series of new groups largely through gettogethers of acquaintances gathered by word of mouth The collection of groups ultimately opened the first womens center in Mrs Ellmans basement in September 1971 The Nassau groups now have 400 members most of them middleclass women from high school graduates to holders of doctorates most of them housewives students teachers nurses and secretaries A good percentage of those involved on Long Island are at home restricted entirely to taking care of children and going crazy and with no status attached Mrs Ellman said Many are married or have been married and if they are married and working they see it basically as a sideline The isolation spending your entire life with people under 4 feet high in a society that doesnt consider that to be an occupation or a worthy life gives you little egogratification And the oppressive aspect of work for men makes them need to be boosted up to make it out the door the next morning They arent in any condition to have stimulating conversation every night They think their wives have it easy Lack of Privacy Cited Mrs Ellman who has no children says she believes there are delightful aspects to having them but that women in groups have impressed her with their own lack of privacy lack of time to themselves and lack of power to concentrate on anything else with children around I think those becoming part of the womens movement have gained confidence and a desire to create their own lives and a consciousness of what those lives could be she said There can and should be changes in their families and society as a whole Women are now willing to rock the boat within their families to demand equal consideration within the family and within society to challenge the previously held assumptions about women And it gives them self respect to know theyre entitled to be treated better The Nassau womens center publishes a newsletter and like most of the other womens centers on the Island offers a referral file for women of health services psychological services abortion clinics lawyers and business concerns It has also helped to start consciousnessraising groups at a few Nassau high schools and to provide a link for men seeking to set up their own consciousnessraising groups Suffolk consciousnessraising groups appear to be increasing at an even more rapid rate than those in Nassau despite pressure against movement from the husbands of some of its members Winifred McClintock whose home serves as the base of the Huntington Womens Center said Some of the women have to tell their husbands theyre going to things like bridge parties when they come to our meetings One woman told her husband she was taking an adult education course in gourmet cooking In addition to its other consciousness  raising activities the Huntington center is setting up a workshop for mothers and their teenage daughters on mutual problems Suffolk Womens Liberation which grew out of Smithtown Womens Liberation and includes some activist members of the former consciousness  raising groups in South Shore Womens Rights coordinates six womens consciousnessraising groups and one mens consciousnessraising group Its 200 members also have monthly meetings to organize such activities as the planned Commack Child Care Center a successful lobbying effort to add discrimination against women to prohibitions in the Islip housing code a campaign to remove the Suffolk ban limiting abortions to hospitalaffiliated establishments and a successful effort to get a publisher to change a readingreadiness series used in many Suffolk schools which members said characterized girls as weak and sniveling Also in Suffolk Stony Brook has both its own chapter of NOW with members of the State University staff there and outside community residents and a womens center with students and outside community members A womens center member said its twoday conference last spring drew 400 women Its future plans include a selfdefense course womens theater and a course on women and their bodies But for the most part the movement among younger women on the campuses and in the communities is far less fierce than the uprising of the Old Westbury students at the beginning of Long Islands liberation efforts There is at least one womens liberation group on most of Long Islands campuses for study discussion or action At Hofstra University where there are five separate groups for students professional women staff women law students and graduate students Dr Marjorie Hewling Aghassi said the efforts were limited by the values of he surrounding communities where the students grew up Old Notions a Concern The girls are brought up with their roles clearly defined she said Women learn to compete for men with each other Its very difficult to break that pattern that they must put down other women criticize other women not work for other women Women on this campus are now really learning to cooperate Theres no longer the devastating kind of competition there was Dr Aghassi said that 150 to 200 attend the big rallies at Hofstra with only five showing up sometimes at weekly meetings The student group the Hofstra Organization for Women HOW is concerned with getting more courses for women help in planning careers and getting into graduate schools and a daycare center on campus for children of students and faculty members in addition to providing referral services Dr Aghassi said
"The argument of Women's Liberation, Midge Decter says, is with liberation",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/15/archives/the-new-chastity-and-other-arguments-against-womens-liberation-by.html,The theme of this book is the disparity between what it feels like to be a woman and what Womens Liberation says it feels like Midge Decter  writer editor wife mother and author of The Liberated Woman and Other Americans 1971begins her new book by saying that Womens Liberation sprang into existence over the issue of housework From its outset she writes the movement has claimed that women are demeaned at home and demeaned on the job They serve their husbands who service them at will they wait on their bosses who underpay and condescend On top of that a feminine mystique in league with a doctrine of masculine supremacy has conned women into thinking they like doing all the dirty work All the institutions of our society have conspired to make them accomplices in their own servitude And the process of knocking them into submission so the argument goes has left women too dizzy for selfdiscipline or independence or abstract thought They find it hard to defer gratification to bear criticism to study calculus In short the touts of femininity have gulled women into staking their lives on tawdry goods and shoddy illusions rather than on the distinctively human endeavor of defining themselves through personal fulfillment or public power Midge Decter demurs With friends who argue like that she says women dont need enemies Womens Liberation she says expresses not a demand for equal rights or a yearning for freedom but an inability to manage the rights and freedoms women already have Women are now free to marry or not to do housework or not to get a job or not and to make of their marriages housework or job what they will This relative freedom means that housework calls forth not too little of a womans nature as an autonomous willing being but too muchtoo much for Womens Liberation that is Housework Midge Decter argues has become not a task imposed but a profession chosen With choice comes the possibility of making the wrong one the anxious knowledge of that possibility beforehand and a personal responsibility for how it turns out Similarly middle  class women unlike their husbands take jobs by choice not necessity For men a career is the only medium of selfdefinition For women a career is a possibility embraced among others that beckon Liberationists then are those women who cannot bear the risk of failure or the responsibilities of success who cannot come to terms with their own ambition who see themselves as too delicate for the hurlyburly of competition or for exposure to judgmentthose who want never to grow up These are hard words but of a kind with Midge Decters stern replies to the arguments of Womens Liberation on the subject of sex marriage and motherhood The movements response to the sexual revolution has been counterrevolutionary she argues a retreat to a nunnery of the mind a longing for the old chastity and the bargaining power it gave women over men a flinching avoidance of the dangers and difficulties of sexual equality In answer to the movements claims that the bond of marriage is the cash nexus that a woman gives her hand only to place herself under her husbands thumb Midge Decter replies that women marry because they want to be married whereas men marry because they want a woman and that marriage is an institution maintained and protected by women for the sake of and at the behest of women and in accordance with their deepest wishes What the Womens Liberationist cannot abide is the terms of the contract she has arrangedterms which include the requirement that she respond to her husbands maleness with a reciprocal femininity that she enter into the conflicts and concessions of a dialogue with the sexual and social other Midge Decter also has a reply to the movements claim that motherhood is a swindle an ideological fortress erected by men to confine women to a life of drudgery a stockade built on the narrow ground of a biological property that science will soon remove to the lab Her reply is that birth control and the easier availability of abortion have transposed motherhood from a descriptive category to a normative one No longer helpless before nature or chance the modern woman herself decides whether when and how often she will have children Not only has the disappearance of the tribal family made the modern mother more responsible than ever for how children turn out she is now responsible for their very existence But this new opportunity for decision and choice like the others has been felt by Womens Liberation as only a new burden a dreadful freedom a sickness unto death from the moment of her first childs birth The movement then is not an expression of womens surge toward new possibilities and new freedoms but an expression of their terror in the face of the harshness and burdens of a new and as yet not fully claimed freedom That terror is the force behind the movements true underlying intention And that is to create a world or a culture in which either literally or to all intents and purposes there would be no men and no women The world they want to recreate is that of prepubescent androgeny a world shrunk to a household culture in which maleness and femaleness would be indistinguishable The red stockings that is are in fact blue and the triumphant crow that sisterhood is powerful is in fact the timorous cringe of the weak sisters among women Midge Decters argument is likely to please men and for that reason it is open to suspicion although the grounds for suspicion are no doubt something that a man cannot test by reference to his own experience In any case it is a sufficient ground for suspicion that so many women have discovered by reference to their own experience that something is very deeply wrong with the lives they are expected to live Even a man can have enough imaginative sympathy to see that many of the grievances expressed by Womens Liberation are based on real injustices And the argument that the movement is a symptom of an incapacity to manage new freedoms casts the shadow of an argument in favor of the old restrictions Those we can do withoutin spite of the anxiety that has seeped into the depressions left by their removal It is not easy to reach out for new freedoms if you have grown up getting your fingers slapped No doubt Midge Decter goes too far but in doing so she clarifies the issue she provides a truth reciprocal to the indubitable truth in the new feminism She applies to Womens Liberation the second term of a dialectic through which numerous crucial issues in addition to feminism must work themselves out Womens Liberation says women are victims Midge Decter says they are free to choose among alternatives Similarly all people are victims if you assume that at every moment each person is the product of an unbroken sequence of material and social causes But each person acts at every moment on the necessary assumption that he is free to choose among alternatives By assuming that freedom each person is responsible to himself and to others for the consequences of his choices Oedipus was fated to kill his father and to marry his mother but the Greeks held him responsible and he concurred That is in part what made him a hero Although women are victims and in more ways than men it would be I should think more energizing and more heroic for Womens Liberationists to think of themselves as free and responsible rather than as the products of fatal social pressures Otherwise they acknowledge even in their declarations of freedom that they are mere symptoms of social disease

Two point two is good. Is one better?,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/15/archives/a-fresh-look-at-the-only-child.html,I havent had anything to do with my older brother for years now but I can still recite all his sterling qualities He was helpful protective and always there to get me out of scrapes He was also imaginary As an only child I made him part of my fantasy life and grew up in the conviction that I had really missed something not having any brothers or sisters That was in the nineteenthirties and only children were common in the Depression years After World War II came the baby boom and along with the new prosperity and conservatism of the fifties a new emphasis on family life Womans place was in the home typically in the suburbs where she raised her two and a fraction children Now things have changed again and with the new interest in population problems as well as in womans role outside the home the onechild family seems to be coming back into fashion Population experts family planners and parents themselves are reevaluating the experience of the only child What they have to say suggests that the child with no sisters or brothers may not have it so bad after all A number of studies have shown firstborn and only children to be overrepresented in terms of their ratio in the population as a whole in the upper IQ group and among the students in colleges and universities with high entrance requirements as well as in professional schools Despite the statistics that show only children very often grow up to be outstanding there has been a longstanding prejudice against the onechild family The commonly held idea is that an only child will be spoiled that hes overindulged maladjusted and egocentric cant share and never learns the give and take of life No less an authority than G Stanley Hall the dean of American psychologists in the early years of this century said Being an only child is a disease in itself Parents have come to feel they have to have a second child to save their first This just isnt so says Dr E James Lieberman a child psychiatrist on the staff of Childrens Hospital in Washington D C Parents can be just as tough on and expect just as much from an only child as they can with larger families True they are likely to spend more time with an only child but this extra parental contact can mean an enrichment of the childs environment rather than an overindulgence of whims This can make the only child  or the oldest child who remains an only child for several years before he has to share his parent love and attentionfeet very special How to avoid his feeling too special and see to it that he learns to get along in a group Social behavior can be taught at a very early age in the play group and the nursery school Its true that in a large family its easier to teach democracy in the home but today thats still not enough In the days of the extended family kids grew up not only with brothers and sisters but with cousins their own age Today we substitute preschool education as the democratic learning experience But this still has its limitations says Dr Lieberman notably in that children tend to come in contact only with their age mates In a very large family there would be mixing of ages but in todays small families thats no longer true And its important Something the schools havent done enough of is to give children a neighborhood agemixing experience Sixthgraders ought to be helping the firstgraders But while the presence of other children can be a valuable learning experience couples shouldnt have kids in order to provide certain experiences for those they already have This is having a child as a too Rather than as what it should hean end in itself Dr Charles Arnoldt a professor of Public Administration at New York University and associate professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine at the NYU School of Medicine is another expert in community health and family planning who is convinced that only children have a distinct edge when it comes to getting ahead in life Reviewing data on the social effects of family size Dr Arnold found that only children enjoyed striking advantages both as children and adults He found these lifelong advantages reflected in studies showing a disproportionately high number of firstborn and only children in such groups as National Merit Scholars Westinghouse scienceprize winners astronauts doctors and those listed in such directories of distinguished individuals as Whos Who in America A study of the dependency patterns in the behavior of nurseryschoolershow well they integrated into the group how many fights they had how well they played with other children how they behaved at mealsshowed that the only children were less dependent got along better with other children and were less clinging The study suggested that children from larger families seek the maternal attention in the nursery which they fail to receive at home The results says Dr Arnold run counter to the intuitive common ideas about the only child but are consistent with the data on achievement by only children After all you are less likely to achieve in later life if you are locked in a dependency conflict in early childhood feeling displaced and having to compete for parental love and attention Another study of nearly 1600 children in a psychiatric outpatient clinic revealed that only children were underrepresented third and laterborn children overrepresented especially with school problems and antisocial behavior Still other studies have shown that physical health is also influenced by family size Researchers who followed 85 Cleveland families for almost 10 years observed 25000 illnesses from minor to serious and found that there is more sickness in large families The lowest rate of illness was in onechild families Dr Michael Lewis director of the Infant Laboratory of the Educational Testing Service in Princeton and a specialist in the intellectual and social development of infants and young children has studied the role birth order plays in personality You cant really ask whether its good or bad to be an only child he says It depends on what your goals are for the child The special qualities of the only child may not be due to the fact that hes an only child but to the nature of the parents themselves They may be more egocentric less familyoriented not willing to give up pleasures of their own for the sake of raising children and they may impart their own values to their only child who becomes the typical spoiled brat In reality its the parents who are the spoiled brats Id speculate that when this personality type develops its not the absence of other children in the family but the nature of the parents themselves thats the determining factor The first or only child certainly enjoys a unique situation He has the benefits of the mothers first experience as caregiver when she is fresh able to respond quickly and easily to his needs to comfort him when he cries talk and coo to him when he smiles and act in a way thats optimal for affecting the childs intellectual development Shes usually not able to respond as quickly to the needs of her second or third children because so many more demands are being made on her Dr Lewis believes that part of the reason for the difference between firstborn and only children on the one hand and laterborn children on the other may be biological The mothers birth canal is different and the newborn experiences more trauma in the birth experiencestheres more tension during the delivery and more chance of complications Because a first birth is more difficult and can be more complicated mothers in Britain tend to have their first babies in hospital and their following ones at home The first is more likely to be a problem thats just an actuarial fact Of course firstbom and only children are more oriented toward adults than toward their peers This is ]natural since the only child has just his parents to respond to not siblings and the course of his socialization follows from this fact But studies by the Swiss psychoogist Jean Piaget and others have shown that very young children have little empathy for others Theyre egocentric not capable of putting themselves in anothers place of sharing and cooperating And the multiplechild family doesnt really teach this to very young children because theyre just not capable of it yet It docs no good to try to teach sharing too young Dr Lewis says In fact it may do positive harm I see with my own 4yearold son that hes just becoming capable of learning to share with his 2yearold sister What it all boils down to is that the only child is subjected to an adult culture more than to a peer culture If your social goals are peeroriented if you want a child to be one of the boys to think and act as a member of the group youre more likely to get that type of child in a multiplechild family whereas the only child is more likely to be an achiever a doer who strikes out on his own More only children are born to couples who marry later in life or who postpone having children until they have realized other goals in education the professions career Dr Arnold is currently studying women who come to an abortion clinic Many young women he has found drift into motherhood as the only role they can imagine for themselves Lowerclass and uneducated girls in particular he finds have unwanted pregnancies as a way of escaping from the responsibilities of the surrogate motherhood that has been thrust on them at home They feel Its the only thing can do They have a conflict says Dr Arnold between seeking a way out through the only life role they understand motherhood  and finding themselves trapped again Often their mothers bring them to the clinic saying I dont want her to end up like me  Dr Arnold likes to quote Arthur Campbell deputy director of the Center for Population Research at the National Institute of Child Health and Development who says A girl pregnant at age 16 has 90 per cent of her life script written for her While raising a family certainly does not have to exclude a womans achieving in other areas of life particularly if she can afford the services of a good surrogate mother while she works increasing numbers of women are coming to feel that they can realize their other ambitions in life and still enjoy the experience of motherhood by having a onechild family I asked Margaret Mead the outspoken curator emeritus of ethnology at the American Museum of Natural History As an anthropologist and as a parent what do you think of the onechild family My daughter is an only child Dr Mead answered And she has an only child She says someone should write a book about the advantages of being an only child I always saw to it that she was involved in enough hassles with other children If there is a disadvantage to being an only child its being isolated You have to find ways to get the only child together with other children of different agescousins neighbors But the advantage is a great onemore companionship with parents and less likelihood that the personality will be distorted by competition with brothers and sisters Of course the onechild family works best where the child shares the parents interests With a maverick child it may be less successfulthe artist in a family of bankers or the baseball player in a family of intellectuals has harder time If you had it to do over again I asked her would you have an only child Well said Dr Mead I always wanted six children But life just worked out in such a way that I bad only one Today however Id have just one I think the onechild family is a very good solution to the population problem In fact I think people should either remain childless have one child or have many children In the twochild family one always suffers The competition is so intense There are some people who are good at raising children and they should have several if thats what they enjoy and do well There are others who shouldnt have any children at alland social pressures shouldnt make them feel they arent living fully realized lives unless they have them Most familyplanning experts agree with Dr Mead that its time for a revolution in thinking about family size in general and the onechild family in particular Despite the effects of the pill and new abortion laws the economic recession and the Womens Liberation Movement all of which have contributed to lowering the birthrate our population continues to grow and many experts have suggested that by the year 2000 the drain on resources and facilities particularly in our sprawling urban areas may have a marked effect on living standards on the density of our already packed metropolitan communities the overcrowding of classrooms the drain on our water supplies and other facilities the strain on mass transportation the shortage of jobs for new workers entering the labor market The recommendations of the Presidents Commission on Population Growth and the American Future together with the stated aims of the zero population growth movement point up the desirability of stabilizing the population before our numbers outrun our resources A key factor will have to be the easing of the social pressures that encourage early marriage and foster the ideal of a two or threechild family The problem according to Dr Lieberman is the idea people have that they should either have no children or two as a minimum This is deplorable Nobody should feel they have to have two I think its possible for people to have a rewarding life without having children if that is what they want but Im not so gungho on zero population growth that I think people should stay childless because they have the phony idea that you cant have one child and be successful parents We have to make delayed parenthood and the onechild family respectable As a matter of fact parents who are older better educated and established in life are more likely to be busy active creative people less likely to have a need to live their lives through their children which is probably better for the children in the long run Im not saying that everyone should necessarily stop at having one just that we should add the onechild family to the range of possible alternatives Dr Arnold agrees As the father of an only son now 7 born after 5 years of marriage I can attest to the social pressure brought to bear on young married couples first to have children and then to have a second child Friends and family are always asking you When are you going to have another He needs a little brother or sister to play with But even in a small family loneliness need not be a problem for a child The key is the availability of daycare centers to provide healthy giveandtake social situation for the young child The pressure to conform to the two or threechild norm of the past should be changed There is nothing wrong with waiting several years before having children Many women find that their own growth and development as individuals their opportunities to use their education and talents are aborted by the sudden demands of raising children Much of the anger in the womens movement is directed at men because they can escape these burdens continue to develop This often interferes with the relationship between husband and wife who need a chance to grow individually and in their mutual relationship before they are ready to assume the responsibilities of parenthood Raising one child well is a very exciting proposition and not a parttime one Dr Arnold says You see the nuances in his development and can participate in them and enjoy them You have time to explore his interests with him as they ariseto respond to his curiosity about how a flower grows what a book is about to be there when he notices a caterpillar the veins on a leaf or maybe asks you how the air gets in a tire You seize on the teachable moments As a teacher and a parent I feel Im kept aware of the freshness of experience This doesnt mean of course that there arent people who are able to do all this with two or three children or even more But for many people its harder and no couple should have to feel they have to have more than one child to have a rich family life There are distinct advantages in having only one With several children there is inevitably more competition for parental attentionespecially in the suburban family with a commuting father I asked Dr Arnold Does it really matter how many children the welltodo citizens of a rich country like ours have Isnt the population problem really one affecting impoverished people and undeveloped nations His answer was emphatic Lets face it unless population growth is checked our needs will outrun our ability to meet them by the end of the century Most of us arent about to move out to the plains of the Dakotas Were an increasingly urbanoriented society Reducing the number of children in cities is imperative if we are not to face insoluble problems within generation or two

Ogilvie Closing the Gap on His Challenger in Illinois Race,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/15/archives/gov-ogilvie-closing-the-gap-on-his-challenger-in-illinois-race.html,MOUNT VERNON Ill Oct 13Mayor Richard G Lugar of Indianopolis was here last night to make a campaign speech for Gov Richard B Ogilvie of Illinois There are very few Governors in this country who ever do anything Mr Lugar said in an unusually candid comment for a political professional They mostly smile a lot But this man has workedand he has picked up a lot of scar tissue on your behalf Most of the political sear tissue on Richard Ogilvie the stocky plodding Republican whd is seeking a second term as Governor of Illinois was acquirtd in the process of instituting the states first income tax That move proved so unpopular that a few months ago Mr Ogilvie was running 3D percentage points behind his Democratic opponent Daniel Walker in the polls But Mr Ogilvie has closed the gap the latest Chicago Tribune poll shows him only 4 points back Governors who impose income taxes always lose he commented but I intend to be the exception And he appears in perhaps the closest and most important race for Governor this year to have at least an even chance to do just that One major reason is the Presidential race President Nixon appears to hold an insurmountable lead in this state over Senlator George McGovern the Democratic nominee with politicians of both parties predicting a margin of 250000 to 750000 votes Because its voting machines and ballots are arranged to make casting a straightticket vote as easy as possible Illinois usually experiences less ticketsplitting than most states In every Presidential year since 1944 in fact Presidential governorship and senatorial candidates of the same party have won Norton Kay one of Mr Walkers key strategists argued that Mr McGovern was rapidly closing the gap but he conceded If Nixon gets close to 500000 it gets a little bit scratchy for us Mr Walker an intense handsome somewhat humorless former corporation lawyer came to prominence as the author of a report that accused the police of rioting during the 1968 Democratic National Convention He won the nomination for Governor with the help of a 1197mile walk through the state upsetting the candidate of Mayor Richard J Daley of Chicago The walk still helps as he ducked into bowling alleys in the suburbs of Berwyn and Skokie the other night he was recognized by an extraordinary number of people for one who has never held office Mr Walker needed no one to introduce him as he walked up and down the lanes Repeatedly the bowlers called out Hi Dan and asked whether his feet still hurt The Democratic nominee is running hard against what he describes as waste in Springfield He promises no new taxes and to keep Mr Ogilvies actions in the public mind he insists that the voters have not got their moneys worth from the new income tax He opposes the Vietnam war But he is conservative on many social issues opposing legalization of marijuana abortion amnesty for Vietnam draft evaders These days it is Mr Ogilvies Republican machine that he denounces not Mr Daleys Democratic machine The Mayor concerned about pulling the bottom of the ticket through has made his peace with Mr Walker and it has been reported and denied by Mr Walker that he gave 100000 to the Walker campaign Whether Mr Daley gave any money or not the Walker effort is in financial trouble It will spend only a million dollars against 2million a Republican estimate to 4million a Democratic estimate for Mr Ogilvie The Governors television spots started running July 24 Mr Walkers only this weekend But Mr Ogilvies tenure as Governor has been widely applauded he has won the endorsement of both St Louis newspapers and all fobr Chicago newspapers although some of them often back Democrats In addition The Chicago Defender a black publication is supporting him perhaps because he has named blacks to two posts In his Cabinet The Governors strategy is simple defend the Imposition of the tax by explaining what it is providing Whoever wins will have a chance to play an important national role in his party in 1976  a fact that both men recognize but both steadfastly refuse to discuss
Large Suburbs Overtaking Cities In Number of Jobs They Provide,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/15/archives/large-suburbs-overtaking-cities-in-number-of-jobs-they-provide.html,WASHINGTON Oct 14The mushrooming suburbs of Americas major metropolitan areas which already have more population than the cities that produced them are fast approaching an even more striking milestone in urbanization They have equaled and perhaps by now surpassed the central cities as providers of jobs According to a New York Times analysis of new data from the 1970 Census half of all employment in the 15 largest metropolitan areas is now outside city limits And of all the enormous number of workers who live in the suburbs only one in four still commutes from a suburban home to a city job The others both live and work in the suburbs whose headlong evolution into Outer Cities is one of the paramount features of the 200million statistical portrait of America provided by the 1970 Census A Quizmasters Delight The first faint outlines of that portrait began to emerge soon after the census was taken on April 1 1970 But as of today with publication of the United States Summary of general social and economic characteristics all the main features have come into focus The thick book is a quizmasters delight One can learn for example that on a per capita basis Mississippi has four times as many maids as New York but that New York has twice as many policemen Or that California has many more people in homes for the aged but New York has many more in mental hospitals But beyond the mass of detailed specific information in the reports 280000 statisticsand the thousands of pages of other findings that its publication climaxesthe following major themes stand out The continuation of deep changes among minority groups The migration of blacks HispanicAmericans and other minority groups to central cities has continued unabated It has been paralleled by striking gains in education But even after decade of passionate attention to civil rights the economic status of minorities has changed barely at all The coming of age of the baby boom generation that followed World War II The impact of this outsized generation on schools has begun to diminish Its impact on politics has just started And perhaps its most decisive impact lies just ahead In short order young couples will be starting their own households in prodigious numbers Striking changes in the status of women Increasingly they are much more interested in becoming workers and much less in becoming mothers They are getting moreand betterjobs and they are having strikingly fewer babies Most striking of all is the massive and richly varied developmentof the onetime bedroom communities and boondocks beyond the city limits The nineteensixties future historians may one day conclude was the Decade of the Suburbs The Suburbs It is a time of the suburbanization of almost everything Potato fields and tract developments have been joined by poverty for every three poor people in the cities there are two in the suburbs and wealth all 50 of the nations richest counties cover suburban areas by crime and culture by pro football and French cuisine Still for all the development and diversity the conventional view of the suburbs has remained mired in what John F Kain a Harvard economist calls the monocentric trap This is that at root suburbs remain sub because their residents commute to cities to earn their livelihood The first finding of The Timess new analysis of suburban work patternsdrawn from 1970 and 1960 census reports for each of the 15 largest metropolitan areasdemonstrates that this view is now decisively obsolete In 1960 the suburbs of these areas contained about seven million jobs and their cities contained about 12 million That is the central cities provided nearly twothirds of the jobs in their metropolitan areas But during the nineteensixties the suburbs of these areas gained more than three million jobsa rise of 44 per cent Meanwhile the central cities lost 836000 a 7 per cent decline By census day April 1 1970 the central cities had only 52 per cent of total metropolitan area jobs11224000 as against 10158000 in the suburbs And if as is likely the rates of change of the last decade have continued one day in the next month or two the suburbs will draw ahead New York an Exception In some individual areas notably New York that day may never come New York City still provides twothirds of the jobs in its broad metropolitan area Cities like Houston which can still readily annex developing suburbs provide threefourth of metropolitan employment But in nine of the 15 largest metropolitan areas the milestone has already been passed the suburbs have already equaledand even far exceededthe cities as the principal location of jobs The single most dramatic example is Washington DC Even here in the nations capital with its heavy city concentration of Government employment at least 55 per cent of all jobs are now suburban In 1960 there were 483000 city jobs and 274000 suburban jobs In 1970 after a momentous 118 per cent jump in the suburban category there were 492000 city jobs and 597000 in the suburbs Much of the explanation for such striking changes lies in the development of most new jobs in the suburbs But there is another explanation more ominous for the economic future of the central cities Of the 15 cities covered in The Timess study only two had significantly more jobs at the end of the nineteensixties than at the decades start And both of these were in Texas where state law facilitates cityannexation of growing fringe areas Total employment in the 15 areas went up 11 per cent in the decade But nine of the central cities lost jobs The largest numerical loss was in New York City whose total dropped 10 per cent to 3172000 By far the largest proportionate loss was in Detroit where city employment dropped 23 per cent And the other four cities barely held their own Second Major Finding The second major finding of The Timess analysis is of a massive increase in the number of workers who both live and work In the suburbs There was a rise in the number of conventional monocentric commuters from suburb to city They increased 13 per cent to 33 million But meanwhile the number of people who commuted from a home somewhere in the suburbs to a job somewhere in the suburbs shot up 40 per cent to 87 million Overall in the 15 metropolitan areas 72 per cent of workers who live in the suburbs also work in the suburbs For some areas the figure is significantly higher In the New York suburbs for example it is 78 per cent In other words only 22 per cent of suburban workers commute to the city The pull of suburban employment is evident also from a sharp rise in reverse commuters those who travel from homes in the city to jobs in the suburbs Overall the number rose from 845000 or 4 per cent of metropolitan employment in 1960 to 1460000 or 7 per cent Types of Employment The same pattern of suburban preeminence appears in each of the major types of employment covered by a Census Bureau analysis of the economic censuses of 1958 and 1967 For example the suburbs accounted for threefourths of all new manufacturing and retail jobs that developed in this period As a result by 1967 they had 45 per cent of all metropolitan area manufacturing jobs and 41 per cent of all those in retail trade By now as with other measurements the suburbs may have pulled even and perhaps gone ahead For all these measures are reflections of an outward movement in this century that ranks in importance with the Westward movement of the last This outward movement overshadows even major shifts of population between regions in the nineteensixties The South for example the most populous region grew by 78 million during the decade to a total of 63 million The West gained 68 million a 24 per cent increase reaching 35 million But the movement to the outer cities of America was greater still and it affected every region As of 1970 there were 76 million suburban Americans compared with 64 million in the cities and 63 million outside metropolitan areas The force of those totals is evident from a comparison with the 1950 census In the intervening 20 years cities added 10 million people Suburbs added 35 million Minorities In Baltimore St Louis and elsewhere people call the suburbs the white ring around the increasingly black city But that view overlooks significant black as well as white movement to the suburbs The black population of all suburban areas increased by a million in the nineteensixties bringing the total to about 36 million With fair housing ordinances even formerly exclusive suburban areas began to open to black home buyers But for three reasons the white ring label remained a largely accurate description One is that white movement to the suburbs was so massive that it far outweighed the black shift In 1960 42 per cent of the suburban population was black In 1970 the figure had risen only to 47 per cent The second reason cannot be found in census data for they do not specify which are booming affluent suburbs and which are older closer fringe communities afflicted with urban decay And it is to the latter areas that many of the suburban blacks have been limited The third and most dramatic reason for the white ring view is that the truly massive movement of blacks in the nineteensixties as in the nineteenfifties was from Southern farms to Northern and now increasingly also Southerncities In 1940 the South contained 77 per cent of the black population By 1970 the proportion had dropped to 53 per cent In the same period the population of the Northeast and North Central states went from 11 to about 20 per cent black The black proportion of the population as a whole is 111 per cent22580289 But in cities the proportion is much higher The figure is 21 per cent for all central cities In the 12 cities with more than 2 million people it is 28 per cent In nine cities more than 40 per cent of the population is black and four major cities have a black majority The highest proportion is in Washington whose 538000 blacks constitute 71 per cent of the citys population In total numbers by far the largest concentration is in New York City where 17 million blacks make up 21 per cent of the population The urbanization of the black population has proceeded so strikingly that in 1970 almost three of every five blacks58 per centlived in central cities compared with 28 per cent of the white population The movement of blacks to Northern cities strongly appears to be paralleled by an increase in the amount of education for their children Even with recent gains the South as a whole still lags behind the rest of the nation on several educational scales For example nationally the median number of school years completed in 1970 by adults was 121meaning that more than half the population had finished high school In the South the median was 113 yearsthe beginning of senior year in high school And even that regionwide figure masks lower ones in some states In Kentucky the median was 99 years and in South Carolina and Arkansas 105 By contrast the median in the West was 124 years and in Utah the highestranking state it was 125 Rural blacks most of them in the South had a still lower median education level72 years But for blacks in urban areas the figure was notably higher102 years Only 13 per cent of rural blacks over the age of 25 had finished high school according to the 1970 findings For urban blacks the figure was 35 per cent For HispanicAmericans it was 36 per cent For all whites it was 55 per cent These figures for the minority groups represented major improvements over those in 1960 But the relative gains were offset by still stronger improvements in white educational levels Nearly the same was true of family income In 1960 half of black families made more than 3000 and half less By March 1972 the figure had risen to 6440 In the same period however white income also advanced rapidly From about 6000 it jumped to more than 10000 Thus in terms of dollars the blackwhite gap widened although in percentage terms black families gained slightly In any event as of last March a third of the black population lived below the official Federal poverty income level compared with only a tenth of the white population Whites continue to make up 70 per cent of the total poverty population Recent Census Bureau studies show that HispanicAmericans as a whole earn significantly more than blacks This general comparison however masks wide variations among persons of different Spanishspeaking backgrounds The 93 million reported Hispanic  Americans are roughly 5 per cent of the total population But twothirds are concentrated in five states and more than half live in California 31 million and Texas 21 million alone Youth Like a pearl in an oyster there is a crystal ball of sorts embedded in the endless rows of tiny numbers of the 1970 Census reports It rests in a category demographers call the age structure What they refer to is the differing size of different age groups in the population The crystal ball possibilities arise from the knowledge that people at different ages have broadly predictable needs There are some striking ups and downs indeed in the current American age structure There are now about 121 million people aged 47 to 51 But there are only 111 million aged 37 to 41the clear result of low birth rates in the Depression Most Striking Bulge The most striking bulge in the age structure now exists among those between the ages of 6 and 25 This is the baby boom generation and its size can be illustrated by noting that there now are 21 million people aged 38and 43 million aged 12 The predictableand unpredictableimpact of this enormous youth bulge on society was one of the major developments of the nineteensixties as it was of the nineteenfifties The statistical footprints stand out sharply from a page of figures in the new United States Summary entitled School Enrollment by Age For instance in 1970 there were nearly as many 18and 19yearolds still in school as there were total people of those ages in 1960 It is not just that there are many more people of school age It is also that much higher proportions of people are going to school and staying longer Thus almost 90 per cent of 16 and 17yearolds were in school in 1970 In 1960 it was 81 per cent In 1920 it was 43 per cent Oneoupling Phenomenon There is a future as well as a past side to the agestructure coin With the leading edge of the baby boom now in its midtwenties the impact it has had on education is now starting to be felt in different ways One of the first is in housing A generation ago for a young unmarried person to move out of the family home provoked raised eyebrows among the neighbors But now rapidly it has become a commonplace Uncoupling is what demographers call this phenomenon and they cite figures showing that just between 1964 and 1970 the number of young people setting up housekeeping has jumped by more than 130 per cent There has been a parallel though not quite so dramatic a jumpof 50 per centin the number of older adults over age 65 also uncoupling They move to apartments for example rather than feel themselves to be a burden on their children The total effect of such movement by young and old has been a huge 50 per cent increase in oneperson households And the almost certain prospect is that such households will increase even more sharply in the near future Conrad F Taeuber director of the 1970 Census notes that between 1945 and 1965 about 48 million Americans reached age 20 Between 1965 and 1985 about 78 million will Nor will household changes be limited to single persons Mr Taeuber one of the nations leading demographers foresees massive rises in total household formations Apartments in Suburbs The annual total has been running at something under a million a year It is already starting to go up and he says may reach as much as 15 million per year before it begins declining again The signs are already evident from what once would have sounded like a contradiction in terms suburban apartments In the nineteensixties they increased so fast96 per centthat there is now one suburban apartment for every two in the city The crystal ball possibilities are plain whether for those who manufacture spatulas or those who make housing policy And small wonder that George H Brown the director of the Census Bureau believes that the years leading to 1985 will be the Era of the Young Married Women Women now outnumber men as never before in this century There are 100 women for every 95 men 54 million more across the country And the difference is by no means accounted for only by women of older ages More boys are born than girls but with increases in the death rate among younger men women are now more numerous at every level over age 20 The most striking change in the status of women in the nineteen  sixties concerned work Women of all ages and all family income levels surged into the labor force in massive numbers and accelerating rates Among all women over age 14 13 millionor 26 per centwere in the labor force in 1940 In 1970 there were 308 million working women 40 per cent Among adult women only the figure was 43 per cent And in some age groups it was even higher A considerably greater proportion of black women than white are in the labor force Among women over 35 the black rate is 60 per cent But at the same time three times as many black women support themselves and their families without a husband present In general they work more and earn less than their white counterparts Their quest for better salaries and work with higher status is clear from the 1970 census findings on private household workers In all there are 600000 fewer maids than there were in 1960 The 1970 total was 11 million Most of the drop was accounted for by black women The number working as domestics plunged from 900000 to about 500000 For black women indeed for all working women one of the notable findings of the United States Summary is that their job status improved appreciably during the nineteensixties The proportion of working women In factory jobs decreased The proportion in professional clerical and service jobs increased Thus in 1960 27 million women worked in professional and technical jobs13 per cent of the female work force In 1970 there were 43 million women in such jobs 15 per cent of their total workers Among black women alone the shift was even clearer The number in professional jobs jumped from 197000 to 344000 Men Gaining Even Faster Despite these gains however men are moving up the occupational status ladder even faster For example the male increase in professional and technical jobs was half again that of women And there was evidence of strong continued discrimination against women in earnings A study by two Census Bureau analysts found that women who had worked throughout their adult lives averaged only 62 per cent of male earnings in parallel jobs Even in professional and technical jobs women earned only 66 per cent of what men did A fundamental question is raised by sharp increases in the number of working women what about the children One answer offered by American womenwith particular force in the last several yearsis to have fewer of them Fewer young women are marryingor at least marrying young After staying stable for 20 years the median age at marriage for women has started to rise notably It is now about 21 For men it is a little over 23 And even those who are marrying are considerably less eager to have children quickly to have many children and perhaps even to have children at all By every measure births and fertility have been in decline since 1957 And since 1968 the trend line has moved to what is now a historic low More Divorced Women The increased work rates among women are one possible explanation So are improved contraception rapidly rising public approval of abortion and an increase in divorced and separated women Whatever the reason the impact is dramatically evident With the coming of age of the baby boom generation there are 3 per cent more potential young mothers this year than last But the birth rate for the first six months of 1972 is 10 per cent lower than in the first half of 1971 The decline is so sharp that in the same period the actual number of births went down sharply an the 1971 period there were 1755000 children born In 1972 there were 1604000 These low figures translate into an estimated fertility rate of 21 children per woman And that to demographers is a symbolic number because it is the rateif it continued for about 70 yearsat which the country would achieve zero population growth More Births Than Deaths Fertility rates however are unpredictable and no reputable authority believes the nation is likely to achieve the widely discussed goal of zero population growth Indeed even with the absolute decline in births the country continues to grow In the first six months of this year there were 600000 more births than deaths In the 30 months since the census was taken the population has increased more than 5 million from 203211926 to more than 208232000 Even should low birth rates continue the population by the year 2000 would be close to 270 million But that would be moderate by contrast with some predictions as recent as twp years ago that the populatiob then would exceed 320 million In any event the larger problem illuminated by the massive reports of the 1970 Census is not the size of the population but its concentration For all its growth the American population still lives on a tiny fraction of the land Threefourths of the population lives in cities and suburbs and even that high proportion is increasing steadily Where will the new households be formed Some surely will be in the cities But most cities are already fulland are themselves losing great chunks of population The nineteenseventies in short are even more likely than the nineteensixties to be above all the Decade of the Suburbs

Trudeau Mutes Campaign Style,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/17/archives/trudeau-mutes-campaign-style-but-his-personality-is-still-colorful.html,KAMLOOPS British Columbia Oct 15Pierre Elliott Trudeau is no longer the flamboyant flip campaigner who stirred so much excitement during the 1968 election Nowadays he arrives at a rally for his Liberal party in sober gray business suit with vest His shirt was tan today and his necktie subdued and t he everpresent red flower adorned his lapel His shoes once modishly pointed are now conventional and black The 53yearold Prime Ministers long hair has been moderately trimmed for the campaign and where once he brushed it forward to cover his baldness he now wears it flowingly back in the style of earlier Canadian statesmen Though Mr Trudeaus appearance may be more conservative in his campaign for reelection he is still his unpredictable self with a boyish smile that is half mischief and half embarrassment The people who come to see and hear him may not be so frantic in their admiration as they used to be but they are enthusiastic and devoted The Prime Ministers plane was late and some 200 Kamloopers had watched the sun sink behind the foothills of the Rockies and a pale quartermoon rise in the chilling evening I Like Trudeau It was dark when the door of the small plane opened The high school musicians struck up their march and there were oohs and ahs from the honor guard of young women A man in cowboy regalia shouted I like Trudeau It did not seem chilly any more A woman who had brought her husband 40 miles through the ranch country to meet the Prime Minister said We have become accustomed to him guess Growing accustomed to Mr Trudeau means excusing the moodiness that strikes his detractors as arrogance and the strong language to which he is prone The virtues and shortcomings that Mr Trudeau displays appear to have made his personality the foremost issue in the campaign You still like him or you hate him one often hears A Kamloops waitress said I wouldnt go out to the airport or anywhere to see him Im not for him and hes not for me As the campaign approaches the finish linethe election will be Oct 30it is much easier to start a barroomor for that matter a parlorconversation by defending or attacking Mr Trudeau than by commenting on the Governments record on economic growth and inflation or even on abortion and homosexuality The Prime Minister seems to relish his vocal position in the politics of the day An Overflow Crowd With a straight face he denied at a questionandanswer session in the high school auditorium here that he ever used foul language in public In the House of Commons one day moved my lips and Opposition members accused me of using a bad expression he said I cant help it if they are poor lip readers All I had in mind was fuddle duddle On Saturday night when cowhands come into Kamloops for purposes other than political discussion Mr Trudeau drew an overflow crowd Comfortably relaxed in an upholstered chair he turned questions easy or tough into entertainment no less than edification Regrettably he said unemployment is high71 per cent the Government statistics agency announced last weekbut he emphasized 93 per cent of Canadians have goodpaying jobs All signs except the unemployment figures point to the countrys strength he added The hourlong session of giveandtake convinced one Kamlooper that Mr Trudeau talks straight telling us exactly whats on his mind That it was suggested he might not do in a set speech probably ghostwritten Sensing the mood of questioners the Prime Minister cracks jokes indulges in biting sarcasm and sometimes even says a good word for the Opposition led by Robert L Stanfield the Progressive Conservative who is Mr Trudeaus principal rival Mr Stanfield would make a good Prime Minister of Canada he told an audience But on this trip in the West where the Conservatives are strong Mr Trudeau also derides Mr Stanfield as an oracle of fear and despair Len Is a Hard Worker A party leaders job is to help local candidates for Parliament In Kamloops the Prime Minister urged the reelection of Len Marchand the first and only person of Indian descent to be elected to Parliament Happiness is having members of Parliament like him Mr Trudeau said Len is a hard worker At one point defending his law requiring that all Government services be made available in both official languages French and English he said We French Canadians have been in Canada longer than anyone He caught himself and went on Weil Lens people have been here lots longer than even we have In Edmonton the other night the Prime Minister drew laughter in urging election of Mel Hurtig a young aggressive Canadian nationalist whom he described as sometimes a thorn in my flesh He added Some of his wildest statements I dont agree with Another audience was startled to hear the Prime Minister lecture it on the poor state of Canadian health Canadians he said are sports

Cooke Explains Rockefeller's Invitation to Dinner,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/18/archives/cooke-explains-rockefellers-invitation-to-dinner.html,Terence Cardinal Cooke issued a statement yesterday explaining why Governor Rockefeller had been invited to the Alfred E Smith dinner in the light of Mr Rockefellers veto of a bill that would have repealed the states liberalized abortion law The dinner to be held tomorrow night at the WaldorfAstoria Hotel is a major Roman Catholic affair in the city each year The Governor traditionally is seated on the dais with other notables Yesterdays statement was issued by the office of communications of the Archdiocese of New York and was prompted by the urgings of righttolife groups that have stated their opposition to anyone of antiabortion convictions appearing publicly with the Governor The righttolife groups which are predominantly Roman Catholic favor restoration of the state law permitting abortions only when a mothers life is imperiled The liberalized law which the Governor kept intact with his veto permits a woman to have an abortion on demand until the 24th week of pregnancy The Cardinals statement noting that the dinner was a social civic affair which raises money for a number of hospitals of different religious of1 filiations said that public officials always have been invited to it impartially across political lines Never has an invitation been construed as approval of a public officials action Cardinal Cooke said Governor Rockefeller knows that I disapprove of his veto and his veto message in the strongest possible way He reiterated his commitment to repeal the liberalized abortion law more than ever the efforts of all of us must be redoubled to eliminate this evil from our state Among those who will be attending are Vice President Agnew and either Senator George McGovern the Democratic Presidential nominee or his running mate Sargent Shriver A preface to the Cardinals statement said that Mr Rockefellers veto of the bill to restore the old state law had prompted many people to hold him responsible for the abortion deaths in New York State since that time Equally offensive to many opponents of abortionondemand the preface said was the accompanying veto message in which Mr Rockefeller said that the repeal campaign was conducted in the halls of the Legislature with extremes of personal vilification and political coercion
The ‘Albany Three’,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/18/archives/the-albany-three.html,The State Legislature handles such vitally important issues as home rule powers for the cities which cover topics ranging from permission to build housing to authorization for deployment of New Yorks policemen in four shifts instead of three The Legislature decrees land use regulations it provides for zoning it adopts marital abortion and divorce laws it apportions state aid to elementary secondary and higher education fixes the guidelines for administering federally funded programs for welfare and health care And yet despite its importance the Legislature New York as elsewhere has been a largely neglected public institution Throughout the country state legislatures are the agencies of representative government most in need of greater public attention and constructive improvement In this election year when New Yorkers will again select members of the Legislature it seems to us that three members of this lawmaking body deserve special commendation because they have been firmly committed to fundamental legislative reform Perhaps it because the Republicans have dominated the legislative process at Albany for so long that the impetus for reform now comes principally from the ranks of the Democratic party and within that party from among its youngest and most unencumbered members This not meant to slight the work of some of the longerterm members who have waged this same lonely struggle the pastDeputy Minority Leader Albert H Blumenthal Assemblyman Franz Leichter and others But the reform torch has passed to younger men They are Manhattan Assemblymen Antonio Olivieri and Peter A A Berle and Brooklyn Assemblyman Stephen Solarz These Albany Three have spearheaded the more recent efforts to bring the fresh air of change to the states legislative process Mr Solarz has been a forceful advocate of both legislative and electoral reforms He has the strange notion for example that members should be allowed sufficient time actually to read and study bills before being asked to approve or reject them and that complicated budgetary bills especially be presented in time for close review Mr Berle and Mr Olivieri join Mr Solarz in such proposals on the side of increased legislative sanity In addition Mr Berle has been particularly effective as student of the budgetary process and as an advocate of measures to protect consumers and the environment It was Mr Berle who initiated a court challenge to Governor Rockefellers shorthand budget and ultimately forced the state to present its schedule of proposed spending in a more open and understandable way Mr Olivieri is a freshman legislator A freshman usually does not provide leadership A member of the minority party often tends to be ignored But as a freshman Democrat Mr Olivieri has held a series of ad hoc public hearings on issues of crucial concern He has plunged vigorously into such delicate problems as the drafting of nofault automobile insurance legislation He is keenly interested in the improved care of juveniles in difficulty and he has proposed valuable reforms this generally neglected area of state activity A number of key issues will confront the next session of the New York State Legislature One of the first will be one of the most vital the adoption of rules to govern the legislative process itself On the basis of their dedication to the public welfare their fine records and promise for broader future service these three incumbentsAssemblymen Olivieri and Berle of Manhattan and Solarz of Brooklynhave earned strong electoral support
"Chinese Doctors on American Tour, Report Housewives’ Door‐to‐Door Campaign Has Cut Birth Rate",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/19/archives/chinese-doctors-on-american-tour-report-housewives-doortodoor.html,The birth rate in Shanghai Chinas largest city has declined sharply in recent years as a result of an intensive campaign in which housewives trained as health workers go from door to door with birth control information and five contraceptives Chinese doctors are thought to be making progress in the use of acupuncture to treat common form of deafness for which no effective treatment exists in Western medicine The Chinese are accelerating research in the use of herbs long a staple of the countrys traditional medicine in the treatment of heart disease rheumatism tumors and other diseases The herbs concentrated in capsules and tablets are often used in combination with the more modern types of drugs These developments in Chinese health and medicine were reported last week in interviews with American doctors who returned recently from working visits to China Their tripscoupled with the current threeweek tour of American medical institutions by 11 Chinese doctorsreflect the growing interchange of scientific ideas between the United States and China Spends 5 Weeks in China Dr Victor W Sidel chief of the department of social medicine at Montefiore Hospital In the Bronx brought back data on Shanghais birth control program and on mortality rates He spent five weeks in China accompanied by his wife Ruth who has just published a book Women and Child Care in China According to statistics supplied to Dr Sidel by the Chinese the birth rate in Shanghais inner city is now seven births annually per 1000 population For metropolitan Shanghai with a population of 105 million the rate is 11 per 1000 This is considerably lower than rates in the United States and most Western nations For the first six months of 1972 the United States rate was 155 births annually per 1000 population The Chinese statistics Dr Sidel said are based on birth records for the first three months of 1972 Although he was given no comparable figures for past years Dr Sidel said that he was told that the current rate represented significant progress in the birth control campaign of the worlds most populous nation Only the rural areas he was told still lag in birth control Organization Is Key The key to the success of the program in Shanghai Dr Sidel said is the way it is organized on a neighborhood level Like many Chinese cities Shanghai has three levels of governmentmunicipal district and neighborhood The last the smallest official unit of government usually covering 50000 people is further subdivided into residents committees often called lanes for the narrow neighborhood streets which embrace 1000 to 2000 people When the municipality decided that birth control would be a priority program Dr Sidel said each lane do the city mobilized forces Housewives recruited as health workers were given short training courses Besides supplying birth control information at the neighborhood clinics the housewifehealth workers paid monthly visits to all the married women in their lane to see that they were doing what they said they would do Contraceptive pills similar to those in the United States are the most commonly used method Dr Sidel was told All contraceptives and abortions are free in China The Chinese doctors visiting this country said in New York yesterday that they were experimenting with a onceamonth injection for women to prevent conception Similar work is being done in the United States Urged to Marry Late As part of the program young Chinese are encouraged to marry latewhen the men are 26 to 29 years old and the women 24 to 26 And they are counseled to stop having children after two or three are born Dr Sidel said that Chinese officials reported that infant and maternal mortality rates were decreasing It appears that life expectancy in China has risen into the seventies the same as in Western countries Dr Sidel said In the first six months of 1972 according to statistics given to Dr Sidel the leading causes of death in Shanghai were cancer 25 per cent cerebral vascular disease or stroke 19 per cent and heart diseases 12 per cent The leading causes of death in the United States are heart disease 38 per cent cancer 17 per cent and stroke 12 per cent Chinese officials in their discussions with Dr Side pointedly emphasized that before 1949 when the Communists came to power the leading causes of death in Shanghai were infectious diseases and the complications of malnutrition The comparison may be somewhat misleading because Shanghai at that time was crowded with civil war refugees and had not recovered from World War II Another recent visitor to China Dr Samuel Rosen returned with a report that the Chinese seem to be on the track of a useful treatment for a type of deafness Dr Rosen is professor emeritus of ear surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan This was his second visit to China in the last year To test the Chinese treatment Dr Rosen checked 111 deaf children at the Number Three Peking School for the Deaf They all suffered hearing loss from nerve deafness a type of affliction that is often congenital or develops in early childhood Dr Rosens tests using an audiometer that records hearing level electrically set the baseline of the childrens hearing ability The Chinese had been using spoken words or handclapping at various distances to assess hearing ability a far less accurate measure In return the Chinese surgeons taught Dr Rosen their acupuncture treatment It involves placing needles at specific points around the ear every day for about 10 days followed by a 10day rest and the resumption of the treatment Dr Rosen said that he was not 100 per cent certain about the efficacy of the treatment but that its was worth a try Now that he is back in New York he is making arrangements through the New York League of the Hard of Hearing for a similar experiment with 111 Americans suffering from nerve deafness Dr John K Koo a biomedical scientist and his wife Dr Helen Y Koo a pharmacologist returned from a twomonth tour of China and reported on the many traditional herb drugs that are being used in the treatment of heart disease cancer and other diseases They emphasized that they had no statistics on the results of such treatments They only knew that they were commonly used Dr John Koo is a former senior staff member of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda Md His wife is chief of the Food and Drug Administrations Psychoneuropharmacology Laboratories Other reports by American scientists indicate that the Chinese are teaching peasants to recognize grow and handle medicinal herbs Scientists are being encouraged to attempt to extract the curative ingredients of the plants When the visiting Chinese doctors toured the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center yesterday Dr Robert A Good who will soon take over as director of the center suggested a joint AmericanChinese study of ancient Chinese herbal medicines to see if they could be used in cancer treatment Dr John Koo reported that in Peking the Chinese have collected 5000 herbs in a laboratory as the basis for a systematic study of herbal medicine What he reported seemed to conform with what Mao Tsetung once advised Chinese medicine and pharmacology are a great treasure house Efforts should be made to exploit them and elevate them to a high level
Letters on the Presidential Race,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/19/archives/letter-to-the-editor-6-no-title.html,To the Editor George McGovern promised in the primaries to run a campaign on the issues And he did setting forth clear positions on total Vietnam withdrawal a 1000 per person welfare program amnesty for those who refused to fight in Vietnam and greater individual freedoms legalization of marijuana and abortion Regretfully however as soon as he got the Presidential nomination McGovern began changing these positions equivocating and hedging on previously clear positions Finally he gave up altogether campaigning on the issues which had admittedly grown very blurred and amorphous and has now turned to a straightout personal assault on Mr Nixon Using the most extreme and emotional rhetoric McGovern is concentrating all his anger on the person of the President rather than on his record McGovern has descended from the issues to a lowroad campaign of false charge and smear It is an unpleasant spectacle and one that ultimately can only hurt McGovern
The Issues at Albany,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/19/archives/the-issues-at-albany.html,Beyond the urgent necessity of democratizing the Legislature by reforming its obscurantist rules as discussed on this page yesterday there are many other significant issues on which New York legislative candidates ought to be required to state their position before Election Day One of these issues is abortion law reform Despite the spectacular success of the states model abortion law there is a strong movement for repeal The impact of repeal would be to condemn many lowincome women to giving birth to unwanted children or as the only alternative risking their health and lives at some backalley illegal abortion mill Several members of the State Legislature have withstood particularly severe local pressures on this touchy highly emotional issue Among them is Democratic Assemblyman Irwin Landes from the Sixteenth Assembly District in Nassau County who has proved also in other respects a useful member of the Legislature and Assemblywoman Mary Anne Krupsak a Democratic victim of Republican redistricting running now for election in the 44th Senatorial District in Schenectady Assemblywoman Constance E Cook Republican from Seneca Yates and Tompkins counties a major sponsor of the abortion law is now under severe challenge because of her enlightened leadership We believe all three of these legislators deserve strong support Nofault automobile insurance is another hot legislative issue which succumbed to lobbying pressures of the trial lawyers at the last session in Albany Candidates ought to be asked publicly to commit themselves to the publics interest on this issue next year A turn in the states economy creates still another issue What to do with surplus tax revenues Lawmakers will confront three choices 1 reduce taxes 2 increase state aid to localities 3 enlarge state spending for selected programs It seems to us that a state budgetary surplus after the recent period of bitter austerity ought to signal redemption of the original Albany commitment to return as much as 21 per cent of state income tax revenues to the cities and localities instead of the present 18 per cent Still other issues of wide concern include divorce law reform equitable welfare rules and regulations proper siting of new power plants construction of lowcost housing in both cities and suburbs An alert electorate will require candidates to express their views on such vital local issues for only then can intelligent decisions be made at the polling booth This isor ought to bestandtaking time in New York as elsewhere
Investors Wooed by the City Turn Bullish About Future,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/21/archives/investors-wooed-by-the-city-turn-bullish-about-future-investors.html,Normally when Alvin Kuehn an Indianapolis banker comes to town he doesnt have breakfast lunch and dinner with Mayor Lindsay Nor does he go to the Tallmans Island sewage disposal plant in Queens a hospital for heroin addicts in Brooklyn or Police Headquarters in Manhattan This week he did New York City invited Mr Kuehn and 24 other men who invest large amounts of money here to convince them its bonds are much better than they thought Investors Are Impressed It was a wellorchestrated highlevel publicrelations effort to offset the poor image of the city spread by television cab drivers and bondrating agencies Its chief aim was to lower the citys cost of borrowing money And it seemed highly successful in turning around the thinking of the 25 money managers After nearly three days of talks by city commissioners business leaders and others the investment men appeared convinced that the citys bonds were more creditworthy than they believed that the city itself had many more capable managers than they imagined and that the city not only knew what its problems were but that it also was malting some headway in solving them Moncure G Crowder an Atlanta banker who oversees a 110million portfolio of municipal bonds and advises more than 200 banks in Georgia Florida and Alabama had a frequently voiced reaction Before the tour he said he would not recommend New York City bonds to the country banks he counsels Now he probably would Other bankers and investment advisers said they would either increase their purchases of the citys bonds or recommend buying longerterm bonds than they have recently That meant that they were willing to lend the city money for a longer time An Unhappy Image Everybodys terribly impressed with the talent weve seen Maurice Mann executive vice president of the Western Pennsylvania National Bank said late yesterday morning at a meeting with Mayor Lindsay Controller Abraham D Beame Deputy Mayor Edward K Hamilton Finance Administrator Richard Lewisohn and more than a halfdozen other officials at Gracie Mansion The thing that bothers us Mr Mann said of the city is why dont you tell your story better They hate you out there To tell its story the city did not stint either in providing creature comforts for the investment men or in giving them information or in making top  level officials available Many big cities and government authorities conduct investor junkets to put their case directly before the men who buy bonds In comparison with others the citys effort was not particularly lavish according to one bond analyst who has gone on number of such trips across the country Police Pave Way The cost of the tour which was not disclosed was paid by the Wall Street banks that underwrite the citys bonds The investors were put up in the Park Lane Hotel on Central Park South with rooms overlooking the park A well  shined police car escorted their bus all over town sometimes running through red lights or sounding its siren to get through traffic The visitors went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to dine amid Egyntian art with the Douglas Dillons the George Champions the Leonand Goldensons and other business leaders of the city Mr Dillon is a former Sec retary of the Treasury Mr Champion is a retired board chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank and Mr Goldenson is president of the American Broadcasting Companies In their talks to the investment managers city officials did not dodge problems and they made the solutions they were working on sem workable Jaquelin Robertson the natty Southerner who is director of the Office of Midtown Planning and Development declared for example that pornography was a short  term problem that would pass when economic development cleaned up Times Square Heroin addiction said Peter Wynn the walrusmustached deputy commissioner of the Addiction Services Agency has shown no increase in overdose deaths for the first time i neight years Crime in New York City Police Commissioner Patrick V Murphy said is not the worst in the country although that is widely believed to be the case The city stands ninth in percap ita homicide incidence among the 10 biggest cities and fifth in robberies he told the investors Crime is Key Issue The investment men left little doubt than crime narcotics addiction and prostitutes were at least as important to them as cash in the till on the citys balance sheets Richard Abbott a young investment officer of Studley Shupert  Co Inc in Philadelphia who described himself as an adviser to 100 smaller banks throughout the East said When I go in to a banker in Lewistown Pennsylvania or Durham North Carolina he wants to know about the crime not the citys credit rating Such bankers he said are dead set against the city Mr Abbott stressed that it was not the bond rating but tile girls on Eighth Avenue that made them not buy New York City bonds Eighth Avenue was not on the tour nor was any slum area The bankers many of whom usually confine their visits to an area bounded by 60th Street on the north and Wall Street on the south flew over upper Manhattan and the southeast Bronx in two helicopters But they did view the vast stretches of row houses in Queens the Hunts Point food distribution center and downtown Brooklyn  clearly aspects of New York city life that they had paid little attention to in the past Wives Travel Too Seventeen wives accompanied their husbands to New York They went on a separate tour attending a fashion show at Cote Basque that was regarded as a lesson on the economics of Seventh Avenue They went to a daycare center in Brooklyn but not to an abortion clinic Yesterday they went to the new World of Birds at the Bronx Zoo and they joined their husbands at lunch with the Lindsays at Gracie Mansion We start out with the concept that the city is a good thinga workable form of social organization Donald H Elliott the chairman of the City Planning Commission remarked when he talked to the bankers After their threeday cram course the investors applauded the tour acknowledging that they were more ready to agree with Mr Elliott than they had been before they came here

Who's medically fit for the White House?,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/22/archives/whos-medically-fit-for-the-white-house-a-doctor-says-its-too.html,WASHINGTON The Constitution requires that the President of the United States be at least 35 years old a resident of the country for 14 years and a naturalborn citizen It says nothing about the state of his coronary arteries his physical endurance and the slow silent tides that wash his mind A lot of people wish it did The recent abortive candidacy of Senator Thomas Eagleton has again focused attention on the issue of Presidential physical and mental fitness This time the debate has centered on the fitness of man nominated and not elected but it takes no great historian to remember the crises precipitated by the illnesses in office of Wilson Roosevelt and Eisenhower and John Kennedys constant burden of pain Spurred by the tragedy in Dallas Congress in 1966 passed the 25th Amendment which for the first time provided a mechanism whereby an incapacitated President could be so declared and deposed while in office But this in a sense is ex post facto legislation The important thing say some observers is not to elect men or women who will be prone to disability once in office One articulate proponent of some kind of screening before nomination is James Reston of The Times who wrote about the problem in his column last summer Reston pointed out that physical and mental checkups are required before a man can be appointed to a high position in the CIA or Atomic Energy Commission but that no medical examination at all is required of the man who has ultimate responsibility for nuclear warfare the President Restons suggestion was clearcut Men with the power of peace and war should be checked objectively before they are nominated and electedand checked regularly thereafter Furthermore such checkups should be done not by the officials own doctors but by medical boards representing the national interest Even before the Eagieton affair two Washington specialists in health testing internist William Ayers and engineer James Aller had suggested that all candidates from the Presidential level through Congress and the state legislatures be required to complete a health questionnaire and undergo a battery of health tests without psychologic testing Ayers and Aller suggested that once such data was collected it could either be released voluntarily and reviewed by Congressional committees as is now done with the financial records of some nominees to high office or made public as the result of specific legislation These ideas have an Instant appeal As Reston wrote No sensible corporation or even professional football team could afford to tolerate the present system in which absolutely no medical data at all are required of candidates for high office The old joke about the man in the Congressional race who had years ago served some time in a state mental institution and got elected on the basis that he was the only candidate who had a piece of paper proving his sanity rings a bit hollow when one considers the risks of instability in office Indeed it is true that many large corporations give their executives yearly physical examinations and that the results are sometimes made available to higherups in the company helping them to identify men with heart or drinking problems and to decide promotions Politicians and statesmen no less than corporate executives are frail vessels like the rest of us and the history of incapacity in office is lugubrious reading indeed Hugh LEtangs fascinating book The Pathology of Leadership is an account of the physical and mental illnesses of national leaders during the 20th century It makes a valuable grace note to the standard histories of our time for even as the usual texts focus on the complicated maneuvers of great statesmen and mighty nations LEtang reminds us that the statesmen involved were suffering from cancer hardening of the arteries depression and host of other debilitating diseases Dr Howard Bruenn a young Navy physician who served as consulting cardiologist to Franklin Roosevelt between March 1944 and April 1945 has given a careful account of the Presidents final illness hardening of the arteries which affected his heart and led to a stroke From Dr Bruenns notes and clinical data including electrocardiograms it is clear that Roosevelt was a sick man during his final year Perhaps not a dying man as some have claimed perhaps not a man whose mind was failing as many have said but certainly a man who better belonged on the sandy beaches of some retirement community than as chief of state of the worlds most powerful nation Those who blame whatever concessions were made at Yalta on Roosevelts illness rather than on the Realpolitik of the moment must keep in mind that neither Churchill nor Stalin were models of fitness in 1945 Churchill who was 70 and suffering from an intestinal upset had for a year been so fatigued or arteriosclerotic that he had difficulty concentrating on a single subject for any length of time Stalins medical history of course went with him to his grave or to the graves of the physicians executed after the doctors plot of 1953 but even in 1944 intimates noted that he lacked his usual vitality There is little reason to doubt that Stalin suffered from suspicion bordering on paranoia most of his life In statesmen of course particularly those at the head of totalitarian states a little paranoia is a protective trait While Yalta might have better been held at an old mens home or the Mayo Clinic is there any reason to believe that younger or healthier men would have made a better peace LEtang writes The examination of state papers documents or cabinet minutes should ideally be accompanied by a simultaneous inspection of the medical records of the participants This is fair enough for historians whose task is to use every tool availablefrom family letters and computer analysis of word frequencies to intimate detail about great mens aches and pains  to build a picture of the past It is not quite the same however to think that a prenomination examination or even a daily bulletin on the Presidents health as he deals with matters of state will advance the cause of decent rational government If we insist on a preemployment physical should we not want to know what pills the President is taking as he wrestles with the dilemmas of nuclear disarmament According to LEtang Anthony Eden told a friend he was living on Benzedrine before the Suez crisis Benzedrine with its amphetamine and associated feelings of energy and omnipotence is bad stuff for a truck driver  it distorts his judgment on the road let Alone a Prime Minister Perhaps we should insist that the participants in summit conferences like Olympic athletes be subjected to daily urine testing for drug usage The Federal Government does provide annual examinations for many of its top appointed officials Commissioners of this or that trot off for a yearly checkup as obediently as any corporate executive Members of Lyndon Johnsons White House staff were required to have an exhaustive annual exam  the results were available only to the patient Heaven knows what arcane medical rites are required by the CIA but it is known that the agency has a list of approved Washington psychiatrists that its employes can go to without endangering either the national security or it is said their own chances of promotion Moreover there are said to be several psychiatrists in addition to a large Health Unit full time at CIA headquarters in Langley Va The State Department has a reputation among Washington physicians of having one of the most enlightened medical policies of any Federal agency Candidates for the Foreign Serviceand their dependentsare required to have a complete physical examination before becoming career diplomats The State Department will not knowingly accept anyone with a significant chronic medical or psychiatric problem A Department spokesman explained it this way When we take a man on we know hes going to have to spend perhaps a third of the next 30 years overseas Our Personnel Division has enough to do to match officers language skills or special interests like economics or labor to the posts available without having to get special medical clearance When we suddenly needed 80 young Foreign Service officers with language skills for the hamlet program in Vietnam the computer picked out 80 ideal candidatesbut 40 of them had some compelling reason medical or otherwise why they couldnt go We have to keep this to a minimum Once in the Foreign Service the career officer has physical examination with almost every change of assign ment It is here that the State Department is noticeably more liberal than in the past If a significant treatable illness is discovered the officer is kept on although he or she may be barred from service in areas where immediate medical care is scarce or in the case of certain heart and lung diseases where altitudes are high Psychiatric problems if they are treatable or responding to treatment and not interfering with duties are no bar to continued service or advancement a number of highranking State Department officials have been flown back to the United States for treatment and eventually returned to their posts The medical files of the officers are available only to physicians but in the past the allpowerful Promotions Boards the groups that decide advancement in a system with the basic rule of Go up or get out have been permitted an interpretative report of a subjects record from the Medical Division In recent years even these interpretative reports have not been asked for Nonetheless State Department employes are leery about revealing heart disease alcoholism or other problems that might compromise them The Medical Department is honest and fine said one of my patients and when they tell you everything between you and them is confidential its true But if the Security Division ever gets word of it its in your folder and its there for the Promotions Board The paragons of virtue in the matter of regular checkups are the armed services From the Joint Chiefs on down admirals generals colonels and the rest march off resignedly to have EKGs done weights checked blood pressures recorded and rectums probed There is little to object to in this annual examination by the military Physical fitness is needed in line officers as part of their job and anyway there is no occupation in the Western world in which men voluntarily sign away so much of their individuality and privacy Medical officers in the military hold great power but in turn are subject to reprisals when they wield that power against superiors In the Navy the chief medical officer aboard ship is the only person who can overrule the captain and declare him incapacitated though the physician may be subject to court martial if his decision is found to be capricious In most branches of the service when the question of the physical or mental fitness of a highranking officer comes up he is required by regulations to be examined by medical personnel from another base so there can be no reprisal against the members of the medical board at his own base In the State Department too medical decisions frequently met with resistance and the higher the official involved the nastier the situation Some years ago a prominent American ambassador suffered a severe heart attack while on duty After convalescence in the U S he was reexamined by a board of State Department physicians and outside consultants The boards clear opinion was that he not be returned to duty The ambassador then lobbied furiously both within the State Department and on Capitol Hill but to no avail It was left to the Medical Division of State to bell the cat and reiterate that under no conditions would he be able to return to overseas duty Several years later the former ambassador and his wife who had been one of the main springs in his desire to return overseas  visited the physicians involved to thank them for their decision If you hadnt told him to quit the wife said I wouldnt have husband today Because of the strictness of military and State Department standards some officials Senator McGovern favors the idea of physical and psychiatric exams for Presidential candidates his staff reports He thinks they should be given by a respected institution such as the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington D C and that the data should be made public But he does not think the tests should be mandatory President Nixon asked during the Eagleton controversy whether he thought all candidates should release their medical records said that the decision should be up to the individual but that he had made his own public You will recall in 1968 the President said at a press conference the question was raised about my medical history and Mr Ziegler at that time put out the medical history including examinations some of the examinations what the yearly examinations that we all have were going back to the time that I came to Washington in 1946 The President added Considering what I have been through mean some fairly stern crises I would say and rather extensive travel I dont think anybody would question the state of my health But a question was raised as the President mentioned in 1968 just after his election At issue were Mr Nixons visits during the nineteenfifties to Dr Arnold Hutschnecker of New York an internist with a special competence in psychosomatic complaints who later became psychotherapist Full details of the treatment given him by Dr Hutschnecker were never revealed The medical history released by Mr Ziegler contained only selected facts about Mr Nixons past examinations During the White House years Mr Nixons doctor Air Force Brig Gen Walter Tkach has held press conferences after the Presidents annual checkups Tkach has described the President as in excellent health and moreover has given some details Last year for example he disclosed the Presidents weight 173 and blood pressure 115 over 72 which Dr Tkach agreed was amazing for a man of 58 But is this full disclosure And do members of the news media have enough medical background to ask the right questions at these sessions Then too only physical data are reported the era of psychiatric checkups for our Presidents has not yet arrived at least as far as we know Lastly the exams are conducted by the Presidents own physician whose interpretation of the data is open to charges of partiality The McGovern camp has said their candidate is willing to make his medical history public provided there is some reciprocity from the Republican ticket He has not therefore opened his records either though last April McGoverns family doctor J Lawn Thompson completed a questionnaire on the candidates medical history for the Newspaper Enterprise Association Besides height and weight 5feet11 170 pounds the report includes such details as blood pressure 110 over 60 and usual serum cholesterol level 200 milligrams The picture is of a man who has had few health problems who has had only one serious illness hepatitis in 1961 just one operation for a hernia last year who has never smoked drinks mildly and rarely and has never consulted a psychiatrist or psychologist bootleg care from private physicians in the Washington area and their hometowns secure in the knowledge that such medical data is confidential and cannot be passed to other authorities without the patients approval Some will explain the situation frankly others will explain that they just want another opinion and some will conceal their real names or occupations from the physician There is probably less of this bootlegging of care now than there was 20 to 30 years ago when both military and State Department medical requirements were less flexible But it continues The point in question however is whether a system that is routinely albeit at times reluctantly accepted by corporation executives aspiring diplomats and middlelinebackers is applicable to candidates for political office My personal feeling is that it is not that it would introduce an element of Big Brotherism into political life far more dangerous than the risk of electing a potential invalid There is vast public uneasiness about the idea of required medical disclosure from candidates particularly of psychiatric or psychological data This uneasiness is shared by most health professionals The lines between normal and abnormal behavior have always been hard to define and today the task is even more difficult Fifty years ago Americans might have felt that someone who said he was God was a bit tetched but they might have kept him in the attic or as a hired hand so long as he didnt make too much fuss They would have found it very hard to imagine however a society in which a proclaimed homosexual runs for office in which women announce the number of abortions they have had and mental patients organize to demand power in running their hospitals In everyday life what is abnormal one moment may be considered by many to be normal the next In political life the distinction has always been unclear Do normal people have the drive the will and the ruthlessness to get to the verge of the Presidency Once elected can normal people trade off one group of friends against another lie at times in the interest of national policy and live with nuclear holocaust as one of their main bargaining powers Medical detectives may sniff through the lives of great men collecting their private eccentricities as evidence of instability or madness But who among us does not have his or her quirks Only public personages must relentlessly stamp them out or give vent to them only in private Is it really so unusual that President Nixon threw a temper tantrum after his California defeat in 1962 or that Muskie cried in New Hampshire The advocates of preelection testing might argue that these are merely minor displays of emotion that what they are concerned about are deeper more chronic problems such as Senator Eagletons depressions In such cases too the retrospective psychoanalysis of famous politicians leads only to a tangle of contradictions Douglas may have been normal but the melancholy Lincoln with his strange dreams of predestination won the debates and the election Burnside may have been normal but Union forces began to glimpse victory only when the harddrinking chronic failure Grant took command Will someone please come forward and prove that Franklin Roosevelts paralysis made him a better President or that Eleanors miserable childhood made her the champion of the underdog The nasty thing about other peoples psychological problems is the way all of us liberal and conservative alike revel in them Enlightened Democrats during the 1968 campaign were quick to spread stories about President Nixons supposed visits to a psychiatrist and more recently Gloria Steinem proclaimed that Richard Nixon is the most sexually insecure political leader since Napoleon Liberals treat Martha Mitchells problems as some kind of comic relief Instant psychoanalysis of prominent people is already rampant at cocktail parties across the country It would become epidemic if politicians were compelled to undergo psychiatric andor psychologic testing Of course one of the sticking points of any prenomination medical examination would be how the results would be released to the public Would the examining tribunal merely stamp the candidate fit or unfit and leave it at that or would the actual raw data be released so that the public could make up its own mind If it were the first there might be endless speculation about the criteria used and guessing about the actual results If it were the second it would demand of the public an enormous sophistication in evaluating raw medical data The concept of an impartial medical board is not so simple as it seems While the candidates own personal physician may lack impartiality he willor shouldhave insights into his condition that a group of comparative strangers might not Further even impartial physicians have their own medical and social biases which would inevitably affect their judgment of a politicians ability to do the job The problems that can arise were dramatized by the recent case of Representative William Fitts Ryan of New York Two years before his primary campaign against Representative Bella Abzug last June Mr Ryan had undergone neck surgery During the campaign four physicians who knew him wrote a letter to The Times denouncing rumors that Mr Ryan was a very sick man The four vouched for his undiminished vigor and concluded that reports of his illness were not only despicable but untrue None of the four had examined the candidate Noting that all four were personal friends of his Representative Abzug replied in a letter that they were presenting hearsay as fact and that their letter was a shameful breach of ethics Last month Mr Ryan died of a recurrence of oral cancer It is unclear whether he himself ever knew his own true diagnosis Even the criteria for physicalas opposed to mentalhealth are debated by many experts After Senator Stuart Symington had a sympathectomy to relieve severe hypertension more than 20 years ago it is doubtful that any insurance company in America would have issued him a fiveyear policy yet he continues active and vigorous Lyndon Johnson and Dwight Eisenhower suffered massive heart attacks within a few months of each other in 1955 no physician would have predicted that they would outlive the youthful John Kennedy In 1931 plagued by rumors about his health Gov Franklin Roosevelt of New York took the unprecedented step of releasing the results of a full physical examination Although the report served to reassure the public it contained in the mention of an elevated blood pressure and slightly abnormal electrocardiogram a hint of the illness that was to strike him 13 years later Should be have been barred from office then or should there have been open debate about bloodpressure readings and mortality statistics There is now no precedent for prenomination examinations of political candidates in the Western democracies In Washington the embassies of Canada Great Britain and Sweden could remember no similar requirements or debate in their nations and indeed seemed a bit surprised that the issue could arise While it has become customary for Presidential and VicePresidential candidates to release details of their financial holdings such disclosures are purely voluntary Some Congressional committees Senate Armed Services for example require that candidates for Cabinetlevel posts disclose their holdings to prevent any potential conflict of interest These disclosures too are kept within the committee One of the few instances of a Presidents requiring a doctors report before making a Cabinet appointment was according to LEtang Roosevelts insistence in 1940 that Henry L Stimson then 73 be examined by his private physician before becoming Secretary of War Roosevelt had particular sensitivity to the issue of physical illness many of his personal advisers suffered from chronic ill health and three of his initial Cabinet choices died during his first term Despite the furor raised by the Eagleton case and the recent death of Congressman Ryan professional politicians have little enthusiasm for required medical examinations Joseph Califano until recently general counsel to the Democratic National Committee says the committee has no regulations pertaining to the health of candidates and is not presently contemplating any My own personal feeling Califano says is that a candidate ought to release the medical report of his own physicians but I cant see making it obligatory or getting in some kind of impartial board I guess my reluctance stems from the same kind of feeling that allowed Mayor Curley [James Michael Curley who served as Governor of Massachusetts and Mayor of Boston] to run for reelection while he was in Danbury prisonyou let the people decide these things not medical boards Another reason for reluctance is that no one knows where such medical examinations would stop Drs Aller and Ayers would test candidates down to the state legislature level Dr George Mishtowt director of the State Departments Medical Division between 1966 and 1971 is aware of the pitfalls of such testing but still favors it Its selfevident he says that when someone enters Government service he gives up certain rights We already have a conflictofinterest statute and a loyalty oath As a citizen and a physician as one who testified on Capitol Hill I was appalled to see legislators who were senile or incompetent Id require testing not only for Presidential and VicePresidential candidates but also certainly for Congress Theyd never approve it he added mordantly The majority of physicians Ive talked with however tend to favor the viewpoint of Dr George Silver now professor of public health at Yale who says I really dont think we know enough yet to be able to require medical tests of candidates I think you have to rely on the probity of the man seeking office to be as honest about his health as he is honest about other matters Political casualty That I think is the crux of the issue Our present system is risky It depends on either the honesty of the candidate or the vigilance of the press to bring forth serious health problems Yet required physical and mental examinations would be another step in the direction of a world where none of us are trusted on our own merits where liedetector tests would be a commonplace precondition for employment where our mental and physical performances would follow us around like the personnel folders of Army privates The risks of any further official inquiry into our personal lives far outweigh the risks of illness while in office public or private And it is often forgotten that we already have perhaps the most sophisticated preelection testing device yet known the one used by physicians evaluating handicapped persons in any kind of work from laborer to switchboard operatorcan he do the job The rigors of campaigning the constant exposure to interviewers the demands of the public offices that the candidates have held previously all these give a better idea of what a manor womancan do than a battery of tests They are far from perfect but in a democracy they are the best we can work with
Television,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/22/archives/hearing-fewer-bleeps.html,SEVERAL weeks ago an actor on Love Is a Many Splendored Thing an afternoon soapopera on the Columbia Broadcasting System was heard using the word crap A top CBS executive who happened to be watching the program was horrified and the corporate wheels began turning to warn stations on the West Coast where the program is run on a delayed basis and where the word could be bleeped As it turned out the Word didnt trigger any complaints from viewers After the fact some CBS executives reasoned that it was justified in the dramatic context of the moment and viewers have become mature enough to distinguish between what is and what isnt justified The minor incident could be interpreted as simply another example of TVs new permissiveness a permissiveness that may rely less on what TV is willing to attempt than on what viewers are willing to accept Much perhaps too much has been made of how formerly taboo subjectshomosexuality divorce venereal diseases abortion have become almost commonplace on television entertainment often in the surprising context of situation comedies There is however another new element in TV programing this season It is not as obviously apparent as the permissiveness deluge but it can be detected with increasing regularity And in the long run it may turn out to be the more significant of the two This particular element takes the form with varying degrees of success of attempting to deal with human values Perhaps after the numerous investigations into and studies of violence on TV over the past several years this new approach is merely cosmetic But curiously enough it is not limited to TV The play attracting the most enthusiastic audiences on Broadway at the moment is That Championship Season an oldfashioned treatise on values out of the school of Ibsen On television the new phenomenon most apparent on CBSs The Waltons Set in the Depression years the weekly series revolves around a large family in the mountains of Virginia With plots pegged to such story lines as the eldest son going on his first hunting trip with his father The Waltons manages to be quietly affecting with a consistency rare for any television series If anything it is improving with age Elsewhere on television the phenomenon is less obvious more likely to be discovered in bits and pieces of series than in the dominant role of any one series Illustrations can be found in of all places two new Westerns Kung Fu can be seen every fourth Saturday evening on the American Broadcasting Company slipped into the time slot used by Alias Smith and Jones Produced by Jerry Thorpe the program features David Carradine as Caine a halfAmerican halfChinese Buddhist monk who in the 1870s is roaming around the American West Kung Fu for the uninitiated is an ancient Chinese technique of personal combat Caine needless to say is a master of the technique and the notsoancient American Western technique of the gun is no match for him Caines penchant for nonviolence is admittedly thrown into question by the fact that he has killed a man albeit a brutal murderer in China The man belonged to Chinese royalty and now there is a price on Caines head making him a target for bounty hunters in America A series after all does need some sort of plot In any case a pilot film of Kung Fu shown last season proved to be unexpectedly successful prompting a good deal of mail from viewers Producer Thorpe exuding the type of solemn sincerity afforded by success on television has attempted to explain that response Kung Fu seems to have touched something in the temper of the times a rejection of violence a thrust toward brotherhood a feeling for the universal principle of nature perhaps Well he did add that perhaps But given the established format of the TV western the new series is attempting a new direction away from the eye for an eye brand of confrontation A similar direction is being taken on the National Broadcasting Companys Hec Ramsay which has been awkwardly squeezed into a rotating series of programs plastered with the label NBC Sunday Mystery The grabbag also includes Peter Falk in Columbo Rock Hudson in McMillan and Wife and Dennis Weaver in McCloud Hec Ramsay with Jack Webb as executive producer is set in Oklahoma at the turn of the century in nineteenoughtone as the narrator pinpoints it Hec is a former gunfighter once connected with the famous court of Judge Parker At this point though he is a lawman less interested in shootouts than in the newfangled techniques of scientific criminology Its not that Hec wont use his gun As he sets out for his new job of deputy sheriff at New Prospect he is confronted by a killer seeking revenge and Hec just has to let him have it And when he gets to New Prospect the sheriff a former schoolteacher who tends to be a mite prissy makes it clear that he isnt impressed with Hecs gunfighting reputation So Hec has to go about proving that his ideas about law and order dont really end at the barrel of a gun When man and wife are discovered dead apparently as the result of a double suicide Hec goes about patiently proving via scientific bulletballistics tests that they were murdered And on it goes until just about everyone in town including the sheriff and Nora Muldoon the pretty widow is thoroughly in awe of old Hec It helps of course that Hec is played by Richard Boone Looking incredibly shaggy and sounding incredibly weary Boone is a splendid choice for the role For a touch of instructive contrast it will be remembered that he won television fame as Paladin in the longrunning series Have Gun Will Travel It also helps that the series or at least the special twohour premiere seems to be striving for an unusual degree of visual authenticity The frontier town the relationships between the various inhabitants the rides across desolate plainsall strike a note of conviction suggesting that some careful research may actually have gone into the production The plot on the first episode finally dribbled off into inconsequential psychology but the trimmings a series of vignettes on frontier life compensated for that typical TV failing Much as in The Waltons the plot became secondary to the interactions between the principal characters Hec was allowed to sit down with the widows young son and begin explaining that there were as many differences between the various tribes of American Indians as between the various countries of Europe Hecs sparring with the sheriff Rick Lenz was used to illustrate evolving concepts of law and order together with ideas of justice The result was not overwhelming It was however considerably more intelligent than usual One conclusion to be drawn is that television might try to be a bit more underwhelming more often Perhaps the audiences attention will not wander if it isnt bombarded with shootouts screeching car chases and tremendous explosions Perhaps the audience isnt that emptyheaded That discovery could have some profound effects on television entertainment even after all the old taboos have been demolished
LINDSAY TO RETAIN A LIBERAL STANCE ON MAJOR ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/22/archives/lindsay-to-retain-a-liberal-stance-on-major-issues-will-support.html,Despite polls indicating that many voters are shifting toward conservatism Mayor Lindsay has decided to fight for liberal positions on school busing capital punishment and abortion when bills on these highly controversial subjects are argued at the next session of the State Legislature This is one of the major decisions reached by the Mayor after meetings with key aides that climaxed six months of preparation of the Albany package of bills that the city will sponsor or oppose in the Legislature The Mayor generally regarded as a strong contender for the Democratic nomination for Governor in 1974 as well as for the mayoral race next year said in reply to questions submitted by The New York Times On these three specific issues [busing capital punishment and abortion] my own views and the position of this administration will remain unchanged and we will oppose any effort to turn back the clock of social progress Other Measures Proposed Other highlights of the citys legislative bundle prepared by the Mayor with Deputy Mayor Edward K Hamilton Legislative Representative Richard A Brown and Budget Director David A Grossman include measures that would do the following  Reform the courts to make them more efficient and less subject to political influence  Raise the citys portion of the states revenuesharing program from 18 per cent to the 21 per cent it received in 1971  Cut welfare cheating and increase employment of those on welfare particularly addicts  Modernize the Civil Service system to make it more flexible and responsive to changing needs In addition the city for the second time will press for passage of an amendment legalizing gambling thus enabling the proposal to go before the voters during the mayoral election next year The Mayor particularly desires to use this amendment so the city can press for legalization of what is now known as the numbers racket and which is dominated by organized crime The Legislature of 1973 the Mayor said could be either the most successful for our city in modern times or it could be one that tries to repeal much of the progress of the last four decades Bills Being Prepared Final drafts of the bills to be pushed by the city are being prepared by legal staffs of city agencies and by Corporation Counsel Norman Redlich for a meeting this week of the Mayor and key assistants The city hopes to have a number of bills ready in time for prefiling on Nov 15 for the session next year Mr Brown has already been meeting with legislators in the city and upstate picking sponsors for bills Mr Brown said he had found that a number of New York City legislators who had supported the present abortion law were now fearful of holding the line because they were under heavy attack The present law permits any woman who is pregnant for 24 weeks or less to obtain an abortion Last year the Legislature passed a bill to repeal the liberal law following a strong campaign waged by antiabortion forces but the repealer was vetoed by Governor Rockefeller I hope the Mayor said that this legislative session despite the emotions that are bound to surround such issues as abortion busing and capital punishment will buckle down to the tough but critical job of passing legislation to help make our government work more efficiently In court reform the Mayor seeks to have more judges appointed instead of elected He will also move for the establishment of work standards for judges that will increase their output I think the Mayor said that because of the new public consciousness of the stagnation in many of the courts 1973 will be the year in which we finally see a change in the process of selection for judges Supreme Court Criticized Deputy Mayor Hamilton who is working on detailed plans to make courts more productive said the honeymoon is over for judges who have adhered to a short work day and a slow pace The Mayor cited the enormous progress in the citys civil and criminal courts in catching up with their calendars while the State Supreme Court has lagged behind In seeking an increase in revenue sharing to 21 per cent the Mayor and his aides noted that Governor Rockefeller had said that he expected a surplus next year Mr Hamilton said that the city would make a massive effort to win this point Help is expected from others in the Big Six mayoral group which represents Buffalo Rochester Syracuse Albany Yonkers and this city In his effort to reduce the numbers of ineligibles on the city welfare rollsabout which the Mayor has been sharply criticized by state officials Mr Lindsay stressed the need to protect the poor as well as taxpayers in establishing a fully safeguarded system of welfare Working Coalition Urged In urging Civil Service reform the Mayor said he hoped to build a working coalition with public private and union support He had previously said he wanted training and experience to be considered as well as grades in filling Civil Service jobs He also wants permission for lateral entry to some jobs instead of entry only from the bottom The Mayor has been attacked in the City Council for allegedly undermining the Civil Service system by permitting many provisional appointments Some of the provisionals have allegedly remained in their jobs for several years In seeking legalized gambling the Mayor wants it to cover the numbers operation not only for the revenue to be derived but also to reduce corruption Ideas Are Solicited The process of preparing the legislative package for the next session began last June with a memorandum from Mr Brown the legislative representative to the Mayor summarizing the results of the last session By August Mr Brown was sending notes to the citys agencies to submit ideas for the 1973 session These suggestions were then screened by the Mayors Legislative Coordinating Committee The law staffs of the agencies then began drafting bills for those proposals thought to be desirable and feasible by the Mayors committee Mr Hamilton and Mr Brown estimated that about 200 measures would be in the package When the bills reach Albany Mr Brown and assistants follow up by giving summaries to all legislators the citys position on bills This pressure continues until the Governor acts on the bills Mr Brown who has held his job for three years and before that held important staff jobs with Democratic leaders in the Legislature said the Governor when considering measures frequently asks about the citys position We have the most professional lobbying operation in the country Mr Brown said
A guide to a sane divorce,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/22/archives/a-guide-to-a-sane-divorce-uncoupling-the-art-of-coming-apart-by.html,Norman Sheresky and Marya Mannes begin their book Uncoupling billed as a guide to sane divorce with several chapters on marriage suggesting at once that many of the ills of divorce grow directly out of the defects of the union it dissolves If you are married the authors tell us it is already too late Getting into the institution of marriage is a cinchwe need neither show familiarity with the laws governing the relationship nor with our partners expectations of it But its only when we get out a far more costly and demanding process that we find out what our marriages were about It is only in divorce that many women understand to their stupefaction that in most states in this country they own only what property is in their namesnot half of their husbands They are not equal partners but dependents It is only then that many men learn the same lesson The wives they formerly cherished as subservient and supportive helpmeets suddenly become parasites to whom one pays alimony The real legal and practical issue in divorce Uncoupling tells us is the division of money and property It is the dubious economic relations of our marriages that not only muddy but bloody the waters of divorce Husbands and wives simply do not normally acquaint each other in good times or bad with the financial realities report the authors Thus the charade in which wife exaggerates her husbands financial capabilities and husband pleads incipient poverty and tries to bury the boodle flourishes What kinds of marriages  presumably the most intimate of relations are these in which the economic facts are hidden from one or the other of the participants Uncoupling is most interesting when it explores the social and legal principles operative in marriage and divorce It is a dizzyingly confused book howeverapparently the authors are responsible for separate chapters  and lacks the force and consistency of a unified vision Although there is an entire chapter on Sex Sex Discrimination and the Law which tells us that contrary to widespread belief the system is weighted heavily against women the legal chapters dont deal adequately with the specific disadvantages women face The section on Hiring Lawyers for instance glosses over the difficulties faced by the woman who is not out in the world and doesnt know any lawyers and dispenses in one sentence with the conflict of interest inherent in the fact that the husband usually pays the wifes lawyer Nor does it mention that it may be almost impossible for a woman without money of her own whose husband doesnt want a divorce to find any representation at all Uncoupling s subtitle The Art of Coming Apart to the contrary the book is more a plea than a prescription Embattled spouses are asked to abandon their desire for revenge or punishment and to avoid toughguy lawyers the legal establishment is exhorted to embrace nofault divorce legislation But the books legal chapters consist primarily of long case histories and transcriptions of courtroom dialogue or diatribe rather than practical guidelines for the person undergoing or contemplating divorce These glimpses into the institution at its tawdriest are so revolting that they should act as a powerful deterrent to becoming involved in it oneself If the authors intention is to motivate readers to avoid the kind of divorce they describe they succeed admirably Uncoupling may be more useful to healthy marriages than to those which are irreversibly doomed The most fascinating part of the book is model marriage contract enlitled A Memorandum of Understanding and Intent between a mythical couple named Donald and Ina Although many couples have begun to experiment with negotiated agreements none yet published is as sensible and sophisticated as that proposed by Miss Mannes and Mr Sheresky A document of 11 articles it covers full and fair disclosure to each other of those facts concerning their lives which they deem essential and significant full and fair disclosure of their attitudes and expectations concerning their future and the future of any children born to them and determination of rights and claims that will accrue to each of them in the estate and property of the other Thus Donald represents and warrants that he is 29 years old graduated from the University of with acceptable but unexceptional grades His parents react favorably to the marriage but are unable to make any financial contributions to it He was previously married and divorced a copy of the decree is annexed as Exhibit A and is presently employed as an assistant sales manager at a salary of 22500 annually Etcetera On her part Ina is 21 years old and attended but dropped out of University after her junior year During 1969 she had an abortion under circumstances which have been fully disclosed to Donald She is presently employed as an assistant interior decorator at salary of 6300 Etcetera In Article III Future Expectations Donald and Ina disclose their attitudes concerning religion and adultery and discuss where they will live whether or not Ina will continue to work if they have children their intention to have children etcetera In Article V they state their assets and in Article VI determine how they will dispose of them and future property They agree to maintain in a place in their home accessible to both all financial records concerning any personal or real property held by them individually or jointly Other sections of the agreement cover the question of support should they decide to separate or divorce how they will dispose of their estates and how any disputes will be arbitrated As the authors point out such a contract is meaningless under our current marriage laws But should it be If contract marriage we must why not through free and explicit contract Finally Uncoupling is as much a plea for sane marriage as for sane divorce 
The Guest Word,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/22/archives/happy-days-are-here-again.html,Grateful to Norman Mailer A rum sensation these days But in St George and the Godfather reviewed last week by Garry Wills Mailer writes with a huge fresh hatred of the warwhen many who feel the same are too tired to find new words for it The book includes a few spurts of compulsory womanhating and I cant go along with Mailer on the wad midAmerica he really seems to despise them for their obtuseness But weve seen the same blindness among far more worldly persons who are also glad to hear that the war is over Anger at the public is fair enough but we have to keep studying how that public has been manipulated Mailer does some of this but we need even more However hes one of the few reporters who hasnt called the Republican convention boring as indeed it wasnt In fact it was an education for anyone who isnt voting for Nixon And there were many lessons for students of recent historyespecially about the pliability of history The handwriting on the wall may be forgeryRalph Hodgson I heard more references to John Kennedy at that convention than I had among the Democrats Apparently JFK was Republican His spirit was cordially evoked and it was obvious that Nixons molders hoped that some voters nostalgia for Kennedy might turn into affection for Nixon One movie showed the President walking on a beach in a shot which parodied those of JFK 10 years ago But Nixon was dressed for the office and had his shoes on black Oxfords that shone in the sand Of course we now know that the difference between Kennedy and Nixon was slender Yet it was startling to hear Goldwater quoting Ask not what your country can do for you Ask what you can do for your country I remembered that a middleclass black community organizer had said to me a few years ago Did you realize that was a totalitarian statement The sentence has since been called Stalinoid by some young radicals So it was intriguing to hear it tripping off the lips of Goldwater who was featured to reassure the Republicans who think that Nixon is too liberal Later at two different caucuses I heard the Ask not line attributed directly to Nixon Naturally much of the Kennedyclutching was intended to make bruised Democrats feel welcome Throughout that shower of joythat celebration of a healthy Americaone marveled at the ability of many to deny the facts that litter the sidewalks or hang from the walls of anybodys home Most of those present truly seemed to believe what Nixon and the Republicans told them your dollar buys more we have peace on our plates crime is dwindling poverty wont exist much longer It was very clear that the GOP had persuaded many to ignore or mistrust their own experience You can look in your wallet or check out the price of spinach or discover that the muggings have mounted on your blockand then youre asked to erase the evidence of daily life as though it belonged to science fiction Coming on the heels of LBJs Administration these tactics are bold ones Nixon has deeply flummoxed his followers by mingling liberal and reactionary policies until voters no longer know what he really represents Thus his most loyal constituents in Miami Beach continued to struggle with the switches he had pulled on themall couched in deeply moral terms I wore a dress from 1966 in order to spend a lot of time with the faithful those I met were amiable moderates not rich distinctly decent And often innocent women who support abortion were sometimes called abortionists as though they performed the operation itself Most seemed quite dazed as well as seduced by what they heard Peter Schrag who wrote The Decline of the Wasp remarked that Nixon had liberated them from their principles And one certainly felt that in the air In the past many had been hardline antiCommunists like Nixon himself their ideas of right and wrong were as sharply defined as the Presidents when in 1970 he praised Westerns because the good guys come out ahead  and the bad ones lose Since his visits to China and Russiawhich were applauded rather cautiously when convention speakers mentioned themmany longtime Republicans no longer seem to know what they believe or what to believe Hence I think the malleability the uncertainty about what is actually going on around them Having swallowed some of their lifelong convictions it was almost impossible to digest anything else CS gas combined with Mace makes some people vomit And as the delegates came hawking and retching into the hall many had been frightened by the demonstrators whom they hated for the pain in their own throats Yet during the final session what was happening in the streets was hardly acknowledged For the Congressional elections of 1970 Nixon and Agnew had campaigned on domestic chaos though the campuses were then quiet Agnew had talked as though a nationwide bloodbath were underway But at the 1972 convention it was implied

Two inevitables,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/22/archives/death-is-a-noun-a-view-of-the-end-of-life-by-john-langone-228-pp.html,Although someone dies every 165 seconds in the United States death is one of the great American taboos rarely discussed little understood and hence fearsome For young people especially life seems so boundless that thought of its finitude is repugnant a state of misplaced bliss that can be traumatically jolted when one of those deaths every 165 seconds happens to a close relative or friend Or when that death may be ones own The subject of death considered with realism as an ineluctable fact of life need not be morbid as John Langone a medical journalist demonstrates in his book Indeed he strikes an almost cheery note writing We must learn that since life is relatively short it is better to live it in a springtime way appreciating each new bud each newborn babe each new experience For when the end comes as it must for all of us what will matter is the quality of the life we have lived Langones Pollyanna is balanced however by a more serious presentation of the nature of death as a biological phenomenon and by myths and legends associated with it It seems clear that in many societies death is much more accepted as natural than in ours despite a heavy overlay of fantasy One explanation is that in our society the ill and the dying are shuffled off to nursing homes and hospitals so that the act of death is seldom observed by relatives and friends From this in part arises an ignorance that begets both inflated fears and obscene euphemisms undertakers are particularly adept at these that are employed to cloak the fact of death Even some understanding of death does not of course lessen the grief that grips survivors Langones chapter on this topic should prove exceptionally helpful to young people for whom the emotion of grief can be devastating He describes the physical and psychic reactions to death and says quite commonsensically that they are normally selflimiting But he is on less certain ground I think when he puts down psychiatric help Such counseling on a dynamic shortterm basis can be crucially important especially in instances where unconscious guilt is an ingredient in grief As a pioneer book Death Is a Noun gets good marks for its candor and its spirit of enlightenment Its shortcomings  a questionably necessary chapter on abortion and another on murderare a small price to pay for its virtues not the least of which is its conception that death like sex is one of those facts of life that should be learned about at an early age

House Contest,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/24/archives/west-side-experts-hedge-on-picking-winner.html,In this district you never know Assemblyman Albert H Blumenthal said yesterday Id be afraid to call It Mr Blumenthal a Reform Democrat long familiar with the foibles and internecine sometimes therapeutic shenanigans that mark politics in the 20th Congressional District was commenting on the race for the seat held by the late Representative William F Ryan who died last month of cancer at the age of 50 The two main contenders for the West Side Congressional seat representing a district that extends from Greenwich Village through Washington Heights and into the Riverdale section of the Bronx are Mr Ryans widow Priscilla the Liberal party candidate and Representative Bella S Abzug who lost to Mr Ryan in the Democratic primary in June by better than a 2to1 margin Mrs Abzug later got the Democratic nomination at a meeting of Democratic committee members There are three other candidates vying for the seat Harvey J Michelman Conservative Annette Flatto Levy Republican and Joanna Misnik Socialist Workers party By all normal standards Bella should win Mr Blumenthal said reflecting on the overwhelmingly Democratic enrollment in the district Also by normal standards the Democratic Congressional candidate had Liberal party endorsement in the district as Mr Ryan did But a normal year for politics on the West Side is abnormal anyway and this year is no exception The RyanAbzug names have been yoked together for months nowfirst in the hardfought primary that culminated in Mr Ryans victory over Mrs Abzug on June 20 Lindsay Gives Blessing Then when Mr Ryan died Mrs Ryan announced she was seeking the Democratic nomination a bid she lost The selection of Mrs Abzug brought her the support of Democrats from George McGovern on down including many reformers like Mr Blumenthal who had supported Mrs Ryans attempt for the nomination Yesterday Mayor Lindsays office issued a glowing letter of support for Mrs Abzug which said that during her two years in office she had been one of the citys most forceful advocates of peace and new priorities The letter issued while Mr Lindsay compaigned for Senator McGovern in California also praised Mrs Abzug for her emphasis on urbanoriented legislation A spokesman for Mr Lindsay said the Mayor supported all Democratic candidates for office but had issued a special letter of support for Mrs Abzug at her request and because he was indebted to her for the support she gave his race for Mayor in 1969 When Mrs Ryan lost the Democratic nomination she fulfilled a promise to seek the Liberal party nomination so that the voters will really have a choice between her and Mrs Abzug Mrs Abzug scored Mrs Ryans persistence contending it could cause divisiveness and damage the McGovern campaign in the district In any place else but the volatile 20th CD Mrs Ryans chances would have been dismissed out of hand But politicians note that the last time a candidate was elected to Congress solely with Liberal party support he represented that district That was in 1949 when Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr first went to Washington Furthermore there is still resentment among some voters in the area to Mrs Abzugs decision to run against Mr Ryan in the June primary after her district was eliminated by reapportionment On major issues such as the Vietnam war and the plight of the cities there is no dis agreement between 43yearold Mrs Ryan and the 52yearold Mrs Abzug Mrs Ryan has said repeatedly that she and Mrs Abzug differ in their methods of handling things in their style  references to the abrasiveness of her opponents manner at times Initially Mrs Ryan did not elaborate on precisely what she meant by these comments but lately she has been more on the attack contending that Mrs Abzug is not effective in Congress and that she has alienated powerful legislators by her manner At community meetings and nighttime gatherings of Democratic clubs Mrs Ryan has been quoting from a book Who Runs Congress sponsored by the Ralph Nader Congress Project The quote is Whenever Abzug offers a measure it gets 2030 fewer votes than the same bill would under someonel elses name Quotation Called Gossip Mrs Abzug dismisses that quotation as gossip and cites praise from various quarters for her achievements as a freshman legislator I think I should be elected to Congress because Im an incumbent Congresswoman who has a proven record she told an enthusiasitic gathering of the Village Independent Democrats the other night The Village groups gathering provided a microcosm of the campaign to datea campaign that is intensifying each day The two candidates arrived at the crammed loft on West 4th Street about 10 PM and stonily greeted each other Mrs Ryan spoke first telling the group that the whole question in this campaign is effectiveness in the Congress There has to be a rapport with the people in the district she said She spoke at length of her involvement with her late husbands 12 years in Congress and said she had come to know the working of the Congress i a very intimate way Mrs Abzug who has been restrained of late but who that night let loose with a bit of the rousing style her adherents cherish said that there was a need to have in the Congress of the United States people willing to fight She cited her work on the Public Works Committee and read from letters of support from such powerful figures as Speaker Carl Albert with whom she has jousted in the past Your use of the complex rules of the House would bring credit to any senior member Mr Albert said In your two years as a member of the House you have achieved national recognition for your forthright and articulate presentation of basic issues that profoundly confront America There were other letters Mrs Abzug read excerpts from and Mrs Ryan dismissed them saying Those letters Mrs Abzug read tonight are written every election year There were questions about abortion welfare equal rights for homosexuals labor support the peace movement Mrs Abzug defended her style saying its how I pursue things with vigor As the evening wore on the two women headed closer and closer to an allout clash but narrowly averted it It ended with the club erdorsing Mrs Abzug 92 to 16 a move that did not surprise Mrs Ryan or her aides One Ryan aide quickly pointed out that the Village Club had endorsed Mrs Abzug over Mr Ryan but that Mr Ryan had carried every election district in the Village in the primary Late yesterday spokesmen for the two candidates were waxing enthusiasic about their chances while politicians familiar with the area clung steadfastly to statements like Mr Blumenthals In tihs district you never know

Nixon today of having needlessly prolonged the war in Vietnam to satisfy rightwing war hawks The Democratic Presidential nominee made the charge on a nationwide television program in New York this morning He concluded the day here with the fourth in a series of 10 telethons in which he has been answering questions from callers In this mornings interview on the Columbia Broadcasting Systems Morning News show Senator McGovern declared that the terms under which the Nixon Administration might be able to settle the war now appear to be exactly the same terms that the war could have been ended on four years ago It appears to me he went on that if the Presdent should end the war before we count the votes here on Nov 7 he has run it for another four years purely to avoid criticism from the rightwing war hawks Senator McGovern also charged that the bombing of North Vietnam the mining of the harbor at Haiphong and the invasion of Cambodia had been fraudulent and had been done to appease the hawks None of this has worked he said Were right where we were four years ago Asked whether he thought an end to the war before the election would destroy his chances to win he replied I would think that it would destroy Mr Nixon I cant imagine anybody voting for him in view of what hes done in the last four years Day Reflects Strategy Mr McGoverns day reflected his strategy for the final two weeks of the campaign Sandwiched between the television appearance this morning and the telethon tonight were a number of local television tapings He made only one appearance before a rally crowd  in Dayton  his first since Saturday In trimming the number of appearances before rallies or conventions and of such campaign devices as factory visits in favor of a heavy concentration on television in the closing days of the campaign Senator McGovern is attempting to reach and persuade the millions of voters he will need to turn the apparent tide against him In more conventional campaigning he could hope to be seen only by relatively small numbers live or on local television The homestretch tactic calls for several uses of television Halfhour nationwide paid political

New commercial spots attacking the Nixon Administrations record are being run in the states with the key electoral votes And Mr McGovern is spending much of each day taping local television shows In his CBS appearance today he suggested another possible format After complaining about Mr Nixons refusal to debate him on television Senator McGovern said Maybe we could run some of Mr Nixons old films and I could at least answer him that way In fact were thinking about doing that Wed try to take fair statements of his positions and then I would answer them Effort in Key States A major part of the McGovern television effort is the series of telethons in key states These are forerunners of a nationwide electioneve telethon with his VicePresidential running mate Sargent Shriver The telethons give the Senator a chance to restate his positions on a number of issues that are not new but apparently still trouble voters who have not read or heard his repeated answers to similar questions over the last few months In contrast with the questions posed by the carefully selected panels with which Mr Nixon appeared during the 1968 campaign those reaching Mr McGovern through his staff people supervising the telephone bank have frequently been the ones they considered the most difficult Given the opportunity the aides will feed him questions on such subjects as his stand on amnesty abortion the legalization of marijuana or the reasons for the dropping of Senator Thomas F Eagleton from the ticket Metzenbaum Is Arranger Howard Metzenbaum the defeated 1970 Democratic candidate for the Senate in Ohio is handling arrangements for the telethons He said that he suggested them during the last week in September I had the feeling this was a way for him to handle the whole credibility

win the nomination and now reportedly holds a substantial lead over his Republican opponent Paul W Cronin and an independent Roger P Durkin Depressed Area The Fifth District which lies north of Boston near the New Hampshire border is a chronically depressed area Its two biggest cities Lowell and Lawrence are old decaying mill towns with unemployment rates that are mong the highest in the nation It also includes the normally affluent Boston suburbs of Lexington and Concord which have been afflicted by defense cuts The cuts have created high unemployment among the scientists and engineers who work in the electronics and research and development companies along Route 128 In the center of Lowell a line of red brick 19th century mills huddles over the narrow rushing Merrimack River Some of the mills are empty the remains of textile and shoe companies that moved South for cheap labor in the twenties and thirties or that were killed more recently by cheap imports from Europe and Asia Right around the corner from those mills are the campaign headquarters of both Mr Kerry and Mr Cronin And both men stress unemployment as their No 1 campaign issue A Question of Jobs The biggest question around here is how is a guy going to live how is he going to pay for his groceries and send his kids to school Mr Kerry said in an interview With unemployment running at 9 per cent in Lawrence and 12 per cent in Lowell the voters want to know what will be done to create jobs and to bring in industry he asserted Mr Cronin also believes that the biggest issue here is unemployment and that is my best issue The Republican candidate is a former legislative assistant to F Bradford Morse who resigned as the districts Representative earlier this year to take a United Nations post Mr Cronin is stressing the fact that he has already succeeded in persuading some new industry to come here But many observers question the importance of the unemployment issue in deciding voter choices in the Fifth District The district has been depressed so long that unemployment is almost an incantation word meaning different things to different people War Issue Obscure The Vietnam war is even obscure as an issue according to the candidates Mr Kerry who gained a national reputation two years ago as an eloquent witness for the Vietnam Veterans Against the War on Capitol Hill said The war is not an issue people perceive because President Nixon has done such a marvelous job of fooling people that the war has ended Mr Durkin the independent candidate who is a 32yearold businessman has been running advertisements lately impugning Mr Kerrys patriotism and suggesting that the Democratic candidate would abandon prisoners of war in Vietnam would excuse traitors and is a champion of legalized abortion The President has been able to wind it down and people are no longer emotional about Vietnam Mr Cronin said Thus the issues have played a relatively small role in the Fifth Districts race The explanation for Mr Kerrys apparent lead seems to lie in the large campaign contributions he has attracted in his able intelligent and highly efficient organization and in his personal magnetism  and Lanky Mr Kerry 28 years old tall lanky and lanternjawed is boyishly attractive He graduated from St Pauls School and from Yale comes from a welltodo family has a pretty and vivacious wife and is backed by the Kennedys Since his antiwar testimony he has been a hero to the liberal establishment Since the beginning of the primary campaign he has been able to attract contributions totaling nearly 200000 many of them from outofstate donors In contrast Mr Cronin has received only about 70000 almost all of it coming from within the district Many of the people working on the Kerry campaign are the kind of well educated concerned liberals who normally work for the Democratic Presidential candidate But this year many of them have turned their backs on Senator George McGovern Mr Cronin 34 grew up in Andover and went to Boston University and the Kennedy Graduate School at Harvard In his campaign he is stressing his experience in government pointing out that he was a selectman of Andover at the age of 23 and served in the Legislature A Boston Globe poll published during the first week of October indicated that Mr Kerry had a lead of nearly 2to1 over Mr Cronin with Mr Durkin far behind Mr Cronin disputes The Boston Globe saying that his private poll shows that he is only 2 percentage points behind Mr Kerry and is closing the gap At present there is no Vietnam veteran in Congress So if Mr Kerry wins he will be one of the first and perhaps the first to serve in Congress For Mr Kerry it would be a somewhat belated milestone Why has it taken so long he snapped
Sex Without Tears,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/29/archives/sex-without-tears.html,To the Editor I read with some concern Theodore Sturgeons review of Sex Without Tears by Boyd Cooper Mr Sturgeon quotes Dr Cooper reflecting on his first abortion in these words I learned that the value of life itself as a mere body count is not the ultimate judgment for a doctor I came to believe that it is the quality of life not its mere existence that matters I fear that this kind of oversimplification does not do a service to a debate on the morality of abortion that is infinitely more complex than simply quality versus existence of life There are societal issues at stake that are far broader than the immediate concerns of the particular individual involved I too believe with Dr Cooper and Mr Sturgeon that a lifeoriented mind capable of growth and change is the only kind of mind that can create a viable society I have some reservation however as to whether this kind of mind would sweep aside the moral wisdom of the past as glibly as does Mr Sturgeon in his reference to the dead hand the precut and kilndried moral values hypocrisies  What the world needs now is neither sweet love nor a book on sex refreshingly free from moral judgments  but rather a more serious reflection on what is best for all of the people all of the time ROBERT NEWTON BARGER Champaign III

three women members in its history and none since 1965 That was before the new feminism hit politics and the three candidates  all lawyers turned fulltime political activists with an average age of

time he sees me said one the other day Somebody will welcome us as ornaments to this chamber said another with a smile that made dimples even though my big idea is that this chamber should work as hard as the Assembly Or harder The three candidates are the following Carol Bellamy 30 years old codirector of the Council of New York Law Associates a communityservice agency of volunteer lawyers She

way Karen Burstein describes the special visibility of the few women particularly young ones in politics Of 205 state legislators only three are women Assemblyman Krupsak and Assemblymen Constance E Cook Republican of Ithaca and Rosemary R Gunning RepublicanConservative of Queens A Bryn Mawr graduate who picked apples on an Israeli kibbutz Miss Burstein favors pants and turtlenecks and no jewelry

secondgeneration feminist whose mother was also in politics here she said I was a feminist without knowing it till five or six years ago but I knew my mother was a better mother after she had an autonomous life outside the family She sees a social problem and goes after it My father talks in millennial terms about improving the world but the way he supported the family allowed my mother to run for office Miss Burstein ran for Congress in 1970 partly out of despair over trying to help victims of the welfare bureaucracy but mostly because no other Democrat was willing to be slaughtered in the Fifth District that year I was a terrible candidate but it was a learning experience she said with a grin Then I was that kid but now Im a viable candidate Miss Bellamy served with the Peace Corps in GuatemalaI raised thousands of chickens in the cause of nutrition and is a former corporate lawyer and assistant commissioner in the City Health Department She has written legal briefs for the

Pennsylvania she recalls when the new politics of the Kennedy time sent me into the South the Peace Corps and later the antiwar movement and publicinterest law She has worked with community school boards tenant groups and centers for health daycare and the elderly but she says her corporatelaw background makes her focus on how people are taxed for services and how the money is allocated She said she had run both her primary and fall campaigns for about 17000 Miss Krupsak whose father is a Montgomery County Supervisor has a name for the role all three women outline for a fulltime legislator community expediter and ombudsman A red Volkswagen bus is her officeonwheels because her community sprawls from the farmlands and moribund industrial towns along the Mohawk to the mixture

Canajoharie N Y Her husband and her own numerous relatives she said pitch in as my hidden weapon in campaigns The two downstaters already well acquainted have met Miss Krupsak and all have said they were mutually impressed I hope we can show a prototype of how legislators can work together Miss Krupsak said
TV Mailbag,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/29/archives/is-dr-welby-against-abortion.html,ARECENT episode of Marcus Welby MD dealt with the problem of abortion in California a state which allows women to have legal abortions under certain circumstances When Dr Welbys patient came to him 11 weeks pregnant and at 19 a minor he advised her to see a psychiatristeven though the time was running out for her to have the safest and easiest type of abortion The script called for the girl to be severely and permanently damaged as a result of her completed abortion Her mother who made the abortion arrangements herself because Dr Welby was dragging his feet was made out to be an aggressive bitch and later repentant of her action It is true that Dr Welbys license to practice medicine on TV is as fictitious as the script in question but many young women and their mothers watch the program not only to be entertained but to gain insight into basic problems which could touch us all On this episode Dr Welbys medical advice was criminally faulty The emotional bias he displayed against the idea of seeking out an early abortion for the patient was sinister Did the show represent the opinion of ABC the medical community or an uninformed script writer Marcus Welby MD considered family entertainment has an obligation to its audience not to misinform but to broaden understanding of contemporary medical practice In the interest of truth in broadcasting how about a little homework Dr Welby
1972 CAMPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/29/archives/other-presidential-aspirants-offer-wide-choice.html,WASHINGTON Oct 28 AP Richard M Nixon and George McGovern may agree that they offer the clearest choice of this century but there are nine other Presidential candidates who insist that the choice is wider Linda Jenness the nominee of the Socialist Workers party says that the Democrats and Republicans are no more than Capitalist party No 1 and Capitalist party No 2 John G Schmitz who is running for the American party which nominated George C Wallace in 1968 says that the Democrats are Socialist party A and the Republicans are Socialist party B Besides Mrs Jenness and Mr Schmitz seven other Presidential candidates are appealing to American voters with preferences outside the conventional twoparty system They include Dr Benjamin Spock the pediatrician and antiwar activist who is the Presidential nominee of the Peoples party Prohibition Party Back The Prohibition party is back again with Earle H Munn on the presidential ballot in Colorado Delaware and Kansas The Universal party has its nominee Gabriel Green on the ballot in only one state Iowa John V Mahalchik of the America First party is only on the New Jersey ballot John Hospers of the Libertarian party is on ballots in Colorado and Washington Gus Hall the Communist party choice and Louis Fisher of the Socialist Labor party are running in several states Minority parties may not prosper as well this year as one did in 1968 when Mr Wallace polled nearly 10 million votes for the American party and almost sent the choice of President to the House of Representatives Messages Most Important But that is no deterrent to their ardor since most of them concede that their message is probably more important than their chances of getting to the White House Mr Schmitz a member of the John Birch Society says that he picked up the American party banner because he thinks that the country needs a man who puts America first Mr Schmitz who lost a bid for reelection as a Republican Representative from California this year could appear on Presidential ballots in 34 states although several are tentative because of legal entanglements Dr Spock of the Peoples party now reports his certification in 10 states and Mrs Jenness may appear as the nominee of the Socialist Workers party in 20 states Both parties are pursuing court actions aimed at expanding those numbers StandIn Candidate The Socialist Workers party has the distinction of fielding two Presidential nominees both women Evelyn Reed is a standin for Mrs Jenness in New York Indiana and Wisconsin because of constitutional questions over age Mrs Jenness is 31 years old and the Constitution puts the minimum age at 35 The party contends that the 20th Amendment empowers Congress to waive the requirement and most states apparently agree Louis Fisher the Socialist Labor party candidate is on the ballot in at least eight states and Gus Hall the entry for the Communist party lists 13 John Hospers the Libertarian candidate is certified in two states and hopes for five by Election Day Here is a look at six prominent minority party candidates and their positions JOHN G SCHMITZ Despite the serious conservative themes of Mr Wallaces unendorsed successor this mustachioed twoterm Representative tells more jokes than any candidate on the Presidential circuit Armed with dozens of oneliners Mr Schmitz calls himself the Adlai Stevenson of the right A favorite is I did not oppose President Nixons trip to Peking Only his trip back He contends that Mr Nixon has sold out to socialism at a time when America is a target of international conspiracy And he says Any government thats big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take away everything youve got A onetime political science instructor at Santa Ana College Mr Schmitz 41 entered politics with an upset victory over a moderate Republican in a race for the California State Senate He went to the United States House of Representatives in a special election and won reelection in 1970 by a large margin A Roman Catholic Mr Schmitz cites the religious balance of his ticket with the selection of a fundamentalist publisher Thomas J Anderson of Pigeon Forge Tenn as his running mate DR BENJAMIN SPOCK Im indebted to the Johnson Administration says the pediatrician for giving me an entirely new and important career Indeed Dr Spock now devotes full attention to his role as elder statesman of antiwar activism Dr Spook cuts an incongruous figure among the ranks of the New Left He wears fine blue suits with vest and tie a pockethandkerchief and a gold watch chain His hair is white and grows ever thinner but he is tanned and spry at 69 reflecting an enthusiasm for physical fitness that dates back to his Olympic rowing days in the nineteentwenties Dr Spock has been a visitor to more than 200 college campuses in the last four years and has attended many Washington demonstrations In 1971 he took the reins of what began in 1968 as the Peace and Freedom party Many of the partys former advocates are now in Senator McGoverns camp but Dr Spock says You waste your vote by voting for Democrats or Republicans The rich and powerful control both parties Dr Spock differs most with Mr McGovern on domestic policy calling for an unspecified maximum income free medical care for all people and consumer and worker control of industry on the local level He also advocates a minimum Federal allowance of 6500 for a family of four Dr Spooks running mate is Julius Hobson a black activist noted for his leadership role in the 1963 civil rights march on Washington and his advocacy of statehood for the nations capital LINDA JENNESS Mrs Jenness was a Washington secretary and then a school teacher in Spain She became a supporter of the Cuban revolution and joined the Young Socialist Alliance in 1966 She was born in El Reno Okla but has lived in Georgia most of her life and in 1969 ran as the Socialist Workers party candidate for mayor of Atlanta A year later she ran for Governor of Georgia She has traveled in several LatinAmerican countries including a visit in 1969 to Cuba at Premier Castros invitation Mrs Jenness calls for a democratic society where the people who live and work in it make the decisions And that she adds means taking control of society out of the hands of a minority of millionaires and reorganizing production with nationalization She refuses to designate either President Nixon or Senator McGovern as the lesser of two evils because the lesserevil policy is a deadend road She knows that she will lose but expects to see a Socialist America in my lifetime A strong advocate of the womens liberation movement Mrs Jenness wants all abortion laws invelidated Other proposals a shorter work week with no reduction in pay and black control of the black community Her running mate is Andrew Pulley 22 a black railroad worker from Greenwood Miss and a former organizer of GIs United Against the War LOUIS FISHER Mr Fisher 59 is a drycleaning plant worker in Chicago who calls for a new type of government an industrial government Socialism he says is inevitable but unlike Mrs Jenness he will not venture a guess as to when his partys day will come Mr Fisher contends that he has special appeal to young people They liked Mr McGovern he says but since hes been talking to Wall Street the young people are turning away The partys VicePresidential choice is Cenevieve Gunderson a dispatcher for the Minneapolis Fire Department GUS HALL According to the partys newspaper Mr Hall is something of an allAmerican success storyborn in a chilly log cabin in Minnesota  selfeducated  a lumberjack then a steelworker then a Navy hero  a baseliall fan and one of the boys J Edgar Hoover called him a powerful deceitful dangerous foe of Americanism The partys longtime general secretary Mr Hall at 62 says he will be happy if I can beat out the other leftist parties His platform he says does not advocate communism and indeed there are only three planks  an end to the Vietnam war and a dismantling of the defense establishment a massive assault on poverty including a 6500 income for a family of four and the elimination of racism Mr Hall expects a respectable vote for himself and his running mate Jarvis Tyner in the13 states that have him on the ballot even if it is cast as the vote of protest more than for birth Four years ago only Minnesota listed him JOHN HOSPERS The 54yearold chairman of the University of Southern Californias philosophy department is running for an office he does not want to hold for leadership of a government he hopes will shrink away Libertarians believe in the least government possible Each individual has the right to exercise sole dominion over his own life so long as he does not forcibly interfere with the equal rights of others the party platform says With that Hospers advocates amesty for draft evaders the legalization of marijuana the right to bear arms and strong pollution controls He opposes public schools government economic controls censorship and welfare programs Our party is no more right than left he says Conservatives run very high on economic freedom and very low on political freedom Liberals are very high on political freedoin but very low on economic freedom We run very high on both Some would call it a mixture of laissez faire economics avante garde morality and Jeffersonian suspicion of government Mr Hospers says his candidacy will not accomplish much except to gain the party which has small groups scattered throughout the countrya bit of publicity He and his running mate Tonle Nathan a radioTV producer in Eugene Ore are on the ballot only in Colorado and Washington However they hope to add Oregon New Hampshire and Louisiana before Election Day
"An Unwed Mother With a Son 4, Opts to Stay Single and Raise Him Alone",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/29/archives/an-unwed-mother-with-a-son-4-opts-to-stay-single-and-raise-him.html,Mary Hanes has deepset eyes and a kind of melancholy expression that isnt erased even when she smiles She has a little boy James But she doesnt have a husband never has had and says she doesnt want one Mary Hanes is not exactly a novelty She recalled that she recently was interviewed on television by a young woman who later revealed that she too was that notoriety called an unwed mother And this of course is the age of womens lib isnt it Mary Hanes is not her real name She doesnt feel that she can reveal that She has written a book Love child published recently by Lippincott that despite being called a selfportrait has been drawn partly in shadow Apparently there is still enough shame and trouble for the liberated woman to prefer some anonymity And it may be that Mary Hanes is a special case She is a member of an illustrious family with money fame and prestige But it seems to have deserted her The desertion may have started with her father a lawyer who had four wives an occasional mistress and difficulty holding on to his share of the estate He is dead now but he was Marys favorite parent Miss Hanes  and Miss appears fine with hergrew up in comfort in the Boston area going to private schools finishing schools and Bennington College She was a lonely and troublesome girl a bit of a delinquent she said with a compelling need to hang around some of her teachers as parentsubstitutes Shed break windows during the day visit them during the night She adored her father but he wasnt around much She wont speak of her mother The growing up sounds nightmarish as Miss Hanes tells it Two breakdowns one while working as a teenager in a derelict ward of a hospital her mother away her father courting a mistress There were onandoff efforts with a psychiatrist Whether any of that is relevant to her unwed motherhood Miss Hanes will not say After Bennington Miss Hanes who is 32 years old found work as a newspaper reporter While on the staff of a Boston newspaper she had a yearlong affair with her department editor She says she disliked the man but was afraid to reject him And although she used a birth control devicesevere headaches kept her from the pillthe affair ended in her pregnancy and the eventual birth of James Her reaction when learning of the pregnancy I was happy she said I felt this must be a soul that wanted to be born I had this incredibly religious feeling about it I wanted it to be born if it had gone through all these obstacles I never considered an abortion [although friends family and her employer she said all offered to help her get it] I felt sick I felt if I touched this little life something terrible would happen to me There is strong religious feeling in Miss Hanes though she describes herself as an atheist  or maybe an agnostic  now An Episcopalian originally she said she once flirted with the idea of converting to Catholicism But I felt when I let God down He dropped me I felt the affair was a bad thing I felt that it was sinful Not so much that he [Ronald] was married but that the baby was born out of hate and weakness Ronalds reaction to her pregnancy once her attitude to abortion was made known was a oneway ticket to London Miss Hanes went expecting financial help from Englands national health Wan but it wasnt forthcoming She returned to have the baby in Boston Her employers reaction to the pregnancy was dismissal without severance pay She had been employed for six years so she hired a lawyer who won both severance pay for her and payment of hospital costs But despite her battle she could not reverse the gross misconduct charge under which she was fired Much of the rest is detailed in her book It is a grim recitation of poverty and horrid living conditions the search for babysitters a brutal runin with Ronald depression and finally a job as a reporter for a newspaper in Wilmington Del where she works now Her employers assured Miss Hanes that her marital condition is of no concern to them They found her a place to live a small house in a mostly black area where the rents are low She covers urban affairs for the paper She said she does not feel ostracism from the community though she does say that she was discouraged from seeking a home in one of the more desirable suburbs by a community leader who seemed to feel I believed in free love Miss Hanes said she has no regrets about her decision though she would not have a second child James now a boisterous blond boy of 4 has been the warm tide in my life Miss Hanes said I really was never happy till I had him Hes given me reasons for living I sometimes worry that hes going to grow up and get married and leave me Im starting to store up things Im going to do when he does I guess that makes me a permissive mother I let him do things others wouldnt do Marriage Miss Hanes says no She also says among other things I sometimes felt that having a child would make me more sympathetic to men Men would love me for my little child But I knew I never was going to get married Its too great a leap of faith It would be the end of me I dont want to be assimilated Right now I am in love with someone [a widower in Delaware] and Ive been asked But I dont want to get married  I have this negative thing I hate myself Im afraid to get married I guess I think theyll walk out on me   I like being a woman I like to cook and look pretty for someone like being overpowered by someone But if I got married Id want to keep My own name Even my [married] sister is getting back her name Ronald who is still married and has three other children has only seen James twice Miss Hanes said the only money she has gotten from him has been 4000 support that she won in a paternity suit They notoriety of the suit also cost Ronald his job Marriage of course would give James a father And James is old enough now to ask about that I hear him talking to the kids he plays with telling them things like My daddys coming soon and things like that He makes it up for his friends Or he gets strange ideas like My Daddys dead One day Ill tell him his daddy lives in Boston but we dont live together because we dont like each other But hes too young for that now

Outcry Holds Up California Bid To Deal With Illegitimate Births,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/30/archives/outcry-holds-up-california-bid-to-deal-with-illegitimate-births.html,SAN DIEGO Oct 29Mounting statewide controversy has persuaded a welfare advisory panel set up by Gov Ronald Reagan to revise a drastic plan that it had proposed for dealing with Californias growing number of illegitimate children In a report issued last March the Governors seven  member Social Welfare Board called for legislation that would allow a third illegitimate child lborn to any woman to be taken away and placed for ladoption on the legal assumption that the mother had shown herself to be morally deprayed Under the formula a woman could retain custody of no more than two children born out of wedlock unless she went to court and was able to disprove the assumption of depravity In the case of an unwed mother 16 or younger the first child could be taken from her Governor Reagan has as yet taken no position in the controversy The illegitimate birth rate in California according to the advisory board is three times the national average with an estimated 234000 illegitimate children on welfare rolls at a cost to the state of more than 160million a year The boards formula would not be limited however to mothers on welfare Storm of Protests The recommendations evoked a storm of protests Mass meetings were held in several cities Letters to the editor columns of newspapers were deluged with communications pro and con Many of the letters were spiked with such epithets as monstrous barbarism and neanderthalism The womens liberation movement made an issue of the recommendations And a number of state legislators cautioned that the plan stood no chance whatever of becoming law not only because of its social implications but also because of the questionable constitutionality of such punitive action The boards chairman Robert E Mitchell a Norwalk lawyer said last week that the panel had not expected such an emotional outburst from so many quarters and that the original recommendations were being revised The new clarified plan he said will be disclosed at public hearing in Los Angeles on Nov 16 Mr Mitchell declined to say whether the assumption of moral depravity in compelling a mother to prove that she is a fit parent would be dropped or softened Be added however that there are likely to be new alternatives and definitions which should answer many of the objections The new proposal he went on will be much broader and will concern itself with the entire question of good parentage including not only the welfare of illegitimate children but also such related questions as family planning abortion and absentee fathers Mr Mitchel indicated that the new formula would be designed to meet the objections of state legislators as well as a number of social welfare authorities who have contended that the original recommendations involved a denial of due process and of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment Mr Mitchell complained that many Californians had chosen to regard the boards proposals of last spring as a financial device aimed wholly at reducing the states burdensome cost of welfare and not as a means of dealing with a growing problem of social behavior and morality It is amazing to find how many people do not regard illegitimacy as much of a problem and who do not think there is anything morally shocking about its growth l said Under existing California law the state can take custody of an illegitimate child only when it is able to prove parental unfitness But under the welfare boards proposals the burden of proof would be upon the mother The board also proposed that state law be changed to make it mandatory that the paternity of an illegitimate child be established within six months after birth unless the child was placed for adoption If the mother refused to cooperate in identifying the father the fact would constitute ground for taking the baby away from her and placing it for adoption Minority groups have been particularly vocal in opposing the plan contending that it would work extreme hardship on them because there always has been greater difficulty in finding adoptive homes for black and Chicano children The boards proposals would take large numbers of minority children from their mothers to be brought up in foster homes at tremendous expense to the taxpayer and probably at great harm to the child said Walter A Heath director of the Los Angeles County Department of Adoptions In California the average county payment for a foster child is 176 a month whereas the countys cost for a third welfare child kept by the motheir was said to be about 45 a with

Poll Shows Nixon Tops ’68 Among 2 Groups Here,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/31/archives/poll-shows-nixon-tops-68-among-2-groups-here.html,President Nixon has been found in a survey to be receiving twice as much support of New York New Jersey and Connecticut Catholics and Jews as he did in the 1968 election returns Mr Nixons relatively strong showing among these pivotal groups is the major reason for his substantial lead in the three states over Senator George McGovern in the latest New York TimesYankelovich survey the fourth In a series of Presidential campaign surveys in the last two months The Presidents lead in the three states is thinner than his 5630 per cent tally in a Yankelovich 16state survey but still substantial Mr Nixon led by a 5138 per cent tally in New York 5130 in New Jersey and 5430 in Connecticut all somewhat lower than his tallies in three previous surveys Little Change Noted The survey indicated that there had been little change in the Nixon showing among Catholics and Jews over the twomonth period and thatany gains for Senator McGovern particularly among Jewish voters came largely from previously undecided residents of the three states The survey also showed that the Presidents foreign policy was popular among Jewish voters even those preferring Senator McGovern while both the Nixon foreign and domestic policies appealed to most Catholic voters The Presidents relatively strong showing among Catholics and Jews in the Yankelovich survey was confirmed by Democratic officeholders who were interviewed Fourth Survey of Voters This report is based on the fourth of a series of voter surveys conducted for The New York Times by Daniel Yankelovich Inc of New York The latest survey involved a telephone sampling of 675 registered voters in New York New Jersey and Connecticut which was part of a 16state survey of 3010 registered voters Sampling error could account for variations of 5 percentage points in the tristate survey The survey showed that Mr Nixon was supported by 32 per cent of the Jewish voters interviewed in the tristate area double the estimated 15 per cent vote that Mr Nixon won in Jewish areas four years ago Significantly the percentage of Nixon support among Jews has not changed since the first survey in early August indicating that this support was fairly solid for Mr Nixon Apparent Shift to Senator Senator McGoverns support among Jewish voters has jumped from 47 per cent in the first survey to 60 per cent in the latest indicating that an apparent shift of Jews back to the Democratic camp is not a loss for Mr Nixon but a case of undecided voters finally casting their lot with the Democrats Mr Nixons support among Catholics has remained relatively stable at nearly 60 per cent compared with the 36 per cent vote he scored among Catholics in 1968 The Yankelovich findings were supported by several Democratic politicians who represent predominantly Jewish or Catholic areas Assemblyman Arthur J Kremer of Long Beach L I said that the finding that one out of three Jewish voters preferred Mr Nixon was probably a fair estimate He attributed the relatively strong Nixon showing to the myth about Nixons support of Israel Comment by Solarz Another Democratic Assemblyman Stephen Solarz of Brooklyn said there was no single dominant reason to explain these defections He said that the issues most often cited to him were Israel opposition to quotas such as those for women and minority groups at the Democratic National Convention and even a feeling that McGovern is a national version of Lindsay Assemblyman George Cincotta who represents a heavily Catholic district in Brooklyn said that the findings that nearly two out of three Catholics were backing the President is more than accurate Mr Cincotta who has been praised by McGovern campaign workers for his cooperation said that he had found in talks before Catholic audiences that they wont give you a chance to talk about the top of the ticket He added that he had been told by constituents that you must be crazy to be supporting Mr McGovern Mr Cincotta and two other Democrats one from Long Island the other an upstater who asked not to be identified cited Senator McGoverns amnesty proposals his refusal to take a stand on abortion and his delayed endorsement of parochialschool aid as major reasons for Catholic defections from the Democratic ticket The Yankelovich survey showed that Mr Nixons strong issues among Jews were a belief that he would deal more fairly with Israel more effectively with Russia and China and keep the nations defense strong Among Catholics Mr Nixon rated high on these issues and a wide range of domestic issues including crime honesty and integrity and keeping prices down

Senate Contest,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/02/archives/school-busing-issue-divides-michigans-democrats-and-has-impact-on.html,DETROIT Nov 1 At the Ark Lane in suburban Warren where the automobile workers are bowling and taking a shot or a beer at 10 in the morning Don Rehahm said he would vote for Robert P Griffin a Republican rather than Frank J Kelley his Democratic opponent The big problem here is busing Mr Rehahm said Kelley was for busing then he changed the shoe After he gets in office maybe hell change the shoe again Mr Rehahm worked for the General Motors Technical Center nearby A couple of lanes down Bob Chambers who works at a Chevrolet plant said I like what Kelley says but Im going to vote for Griffin Ive got a little girl four years old Only a year ago the big unionDemocratic machine that helped deliver the Motor State to John F Kennedy Lyndon B Johnson and Hubert H Humphrey seemed ready to roll again in the Presidential race and sweep out the Senates second ranking Republican too replacing him with Mr Kelley the states popular Attorney General a bantam rooster type of candidate short fasttalking and a hard campaigner Today in Michigan President Nixon has a comfortable lead over Senator George McGovern in the polls ranging from 16 to 25 points Senator Griffin is in a closer race but he appears to have won over enough usually Democratic voters such as Mr Rehahm and Mr Chambers to carry him to victory too If it wasnt for busing wed have Griffin beaten easily said Douglas Fraser a vice president of the United Automobile Workers who is head of the unions political action group in Michigan This spring a Federal judge ordered a busing plan to exchange 300000 white and black children from Detroit and its suburbs The plan is stalled in Federal Appeals Court but it broke the effective coalition between black Detroiters and white suburban workers that is needed for a Democratic victory Senator Griffin a hard campaigner who is 48 is not relying just on busing He calls himself Michigans muscle saying that the President listens to Michigan when Mr Griffin speaks Elderly women on his TV ads feign excitement upon learning that the Senators desk he is the Republican whip is in the front row of the Senate chamber But hes nobodys yes man the Griffin campaign emphasizes noting that he opposed President Nixons choice of Clement Haynsworth for the Supreme Court and opposed the SST and the Lockheed loan Mr Kelley who supports Senator McGovern but says as little about him as possible in his speeches attacked Senator Griffin for using his muscle to support big business and linked Senator Griffin to what he calls President Nixons failure to bring peace years ago end the inflation and the unemployment But busing cant be ignored and the Attorney General insists he has done more to keep the white and black children from changing places than the Republican Senator Griffins antibusing bills failed completely Mr Kelley insists The only reason our children are not being bused today is the court order I obtained he emphasizes Democrats insist that they are catching up not only in the Senate race but also in the Presidential contest Senator McGovern will be making his seventh campaign trip into Michigan this week He will be in the state tomorrow and Friday Earlier the lowerlevel union leaders fearful that antiMcGovern sentiments would rub off on them in local union politics were not working hard for the Democrat Were picking up now said Dan Sain an auto worker political leader in Flint a factory town north of Detroit but I dont know if we can pick up enough in time But to carry Michigan a Republican does not have to win the majority of the states factory workers he need only cut into the normally large Democratic margin And workers interviewed complained that Senator McGovern is soft on welfare or wants to give everything away Carl Wagner a 27yearold McGovern worker from Wisconsin imported to Michigan to head the campaign here admits morale was a little low but says now canvassing shows Mr McGovern gaining Its going to depend on two things the undecided vote and our ability to get people out and the single dominant issue wont be busing or the war or the economy he said but credibility more than anything else People want a Government they can believe in The big vote should come In addition to the Presidential and senatorial election voters are asked to approve abortion on request leading in polls but under heavy Roman Catholic attack now ending of property taxes a major support for schools that would mean sharp rise in the state income tax leading but again under late heavy attack a proposal to allow a graduated rather than flatrate state income tax likely to lose a proposal to move Michigan to Daylight Saving Time in the summer like most of the nation always a tossup and a proposal to borrow 266million for bonuses for Vietnam veterans Voters in the Detroit area Should be drawn out by a oneonone blackagainstwhite race for a seat on the citys ninemember council and by proposals to raise taxes for schools and a new jail But the big vote may not be enough for a Democratic victory I think Ill go to McGovern headquarters on election night said a highranking UAW officer involved in Michigans politics Theyre a great bunch of kids but theyre in for a shock Theyll need someone

his voice hoarse and cracking campaigned doggedly through three states today in an effort to close the apparent gap between himself and President Nixon in the final days of the Presidential race After canceling an appearance in Hibbing Minn yesterday to rest his voice the Democratic nominee was back campaigning this morning in his drive to capture the 72 total electoral votes of Illinois Ohio and Michigan a sizable portion of the 270 needed to win Tuesday From 9 to 10 AM he appeared in Chicago on another in a series of telethons in which he has been answering voters questions in an attempt to satisfy their concern about his positions on various issues Today he faced some of his sharpest questioning to date including that by a woman who wanted him to comment on what she said was a newspaper report that Senator Hubert H Humphrey the Minnesota Democrat had disputed Mr McGoverns contention that the Vietnam war could have been ended four years ago As you know over the years there has been some difference between myself and my friend Hubert Humphrey on the war Mr McGovern replied Senator Humphrey and I have moved much closer together on the war today We now have essentially the same view He thinks we should set a withdraw[al] deadline and simply get out with the understanding that thats the only way were ever going to bring about the release of our prisoners But it is true that we continue to argue about what might have been done four years ago or six years ago or even eight years ago A Question Reiterated At a rally that attracted several thousand students to the field house of the University of Cincinnati here Senator McGovern reiterated his lquery as to why President Nixon had not ended the war four years ago It does seem strange that he has waited until the

New York City yesterday that he would like to have started his questionandanswer programs earlier in the campaign If I had had the money to do so he said we might have cleared up some of the propaganda my Republican opponents have put out Mr McGovern finds himself in the last days of the campaign still on the defensive explaining time after time to questioners on the telethons his positions on such things as amnesty abortion and the legalization of marijuana Nevertheless in spite of the polls and the pessimism of even his own entourage he acts and sounds as if he really believes he will win the election Enormous Crowds For instance during local television tapings at the university here he repeated that were going to win One indication is the enormous crowds weve been getting he said Ive heard lot about student apathy but when we visit campuses like this we see that the students care they care deeply In his first radio speech of the campaign a talk on farm problems taped for broadcast today from Chicago Senator McGovern declared that farm ers know Mr Nixons record and they will not reward him with votes The Department of Agriculture in the Nixon Administration he contended has watched over rural decline without lifting a finger Four years ago as a candidate he said Mr Nixon declared that 74 per cent of parity was intolerable He said farmers are entitled to better and he asked for their votes on that basis But two years later parity was down to 67 During his four years it has averaged 72 well below the level he saw as intolerable in 1968 3 States

Concern Over the Legal Rights of a Silent Minority—Children,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/03/archives/concern-over-the-legal-rights-of-a-silent-minority-children.html,The question of whether children have rightsand if they do the extent of themis becoming of increasing concern to the lawyers doctors public officials administrators and educators who tangle constantly with a morass of legal inconsistencies loopholes and uncharted areas The problem is further complicated by variances in state laws What may be legal in New York where the age of majority is not reached until the day before the 21st birthday may well be illegal just a few miles away in Connecticut or New Jersey Weve heard about minorities and women but too little has been said about another group that does not have spokesmen or lobbies commented Mrs Harriet Pilpel a lawyer and coauthor with Dr Adele D Hofmann of a brief on the legal rights of youth But Charles Schinitsky attorneyincharge of the Juvenile Rights Division of the Legal Aid Society in New York pointed out that the rights of children in the broadest sense are not as easily legislated as those of adults There is clear recognition that child growing up needs discipline and isnt mature enough to make decisions he said You cant legislate that unless you want to legislate the family out of existence In addition to the possible erosion of parental rights another concern is how viable means for obtaining childrens rights can be established and maintained Let us not deceive ourselves as we set up new programs we do not consider the consequences said Richard J Gould who has been interested in the economics and politics of public programs for some time and is now a graduate student at the University of California We have not spent enough time trying to figure out why other programs havent worked he added pessimistically We have bombed out in achieving social and legal rights for the adult What makes us think we can do any better for the child Many of the legal rights held by minors in New York are still somewhat paradoxical Anyone under 18 must have parental consent for medical treatment unless the doctor judges that an emergency exists but there is no mention of age in the New York state abortion law A minor of any age can content to treatment of venereal disease but contraceptives and prophylactic devices are not legally purchasable under 16 A girl cannot consent to sexual intercourse until she is 17 but she can be married without parental consent at 18 a boy must have his parents permission until he reaches 21 a sex differential now being challenged by the Civil Liberties Union A young couple married and making their own way in life on a par with adults cannot divorce before the age of 21 unless the action is brought in their name by their parents or guardian Beyond divorce cases minors in New York generally are not allowed to bring a court action unless an adult acts for them still at 16 they can drive a car and at 18 they can make a will buy liquor move out of the family home and qualify for welfare With few exceptions minors under 18 are not allowed to work without an employment certificate generally obtainable only with parental consent Some Eniancipated Minors The age at which minority ends is in itself one of the practical difficulties in attempting to devise any program of rights Aside from variations between and within states there are in New York for example emancipated minors term traditionally applied to youths who are married members of the armed services or selfsupporting and away from home with parental consent There are as well numerous laws and statutes that allow 16 17and 18yearolds certain rights Few adults would deny a childs rights to parental love affection guidance and discipline and to support maintenance and education to the best of the parents ability But there is controversy over a childs right to obtain medical care and counseling without parental consent if necessary and with some of the more intangible rights held by not always accorded adults These include the right to be regarded as person to receive fair treatment from all in authority to be heard and listened to to earn and keep his or her own earnings Two important and farreaching decisions affecting the constitutional rights of minors have come down from the United States Supreme Court in recent years In 1967 in the Gault case the High Court ruled that juvenile court proceedings must provide some of the basic guarantees of due process notification of right to counsel warning of the privilege against selfincrimination etc The Tinker case in 1969 upheld the right of students who had been suspended for wearing black armbands to school in memory of the men killed in Vietnam A Student Rights Handbook The decision suggested that students do not shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate said Alan Levine a lawyer and director of the students rights project of the New York Civil Liberties Union Mr Levine who put together a student rights handbook that has been widely distributed since the original ban on it was lifted by the court said that some principals still interfere with student rights He noted that students still complain about some schools not allowing therm to go out for lunch to hold hands in hallways or to smoke in any part of the school What we call petty issues arent petty to the students he said But they also arent easily litigable The students having a greater say in running the schools will be the only thing to change that To Leah Marks former staff attorney for Citizens Committee for Children of New York and now deputy executive officer of the Family Court there are at least two major deficiencies in childrens rights One is the denial of the privilege to bring suit at any age and the other is the denial of the right of an adopted child to get his or her family medical history The adoption situation itself concerns Mrs Rena Uviller director of the Juvenile Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union She believes that although lip service is paid to the best interests of the child the situation is still primarily seen in terms of warring adults She is also disturbed by court pro cedures used for nondelinquent minors known as Persons in Need of Supervision PINS The child who has committed no law violation the stubborn child the incorrigible child should be removed from the judicial process she said They are brought in mainly by overwhelmed parents who think they will get some help and their treatment is indistinguishable from that accorded to delinquents A Number of Recommendations The brief prepared by Mrs Pilpel and Dr Hofmann notes that under the present juvenile court system a youth may be deprived of his freedom for far longer periods than would an adult for a similar act A number of recommendations to strengthen the rights of minors have been offered in recent years but none have been wholly accepted as yet A national advocacy system that would act as a monitor in the delivery of services to parents and childrenhas been proposed by the Joint Commission on Mental Health of Children Mrs Pilpel has suggested an ombudsman or childrens advocate Henry H Foster Jr a professor at the New York University School of Law and Dr Doris Jonas Freed lawyer and author recently drew up a suggested 10point Bill of Rights for Children One of the major points offered is the right to emancipation from theparentchild relationship when the relationship has broken down and the child has left home due to abuse neglect or other sufficient cause The relative helplessness and tack of autonomy of children require selfrestraint and legal checks on parental and other authority In addition to love children are entitled to respect

But the American party loves,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/05/archives/john-schmitz-is-no-george-wallace-.html,John Schmitz is no George Wallace He looks like an actor playing a nightclub maitre d in a nineteen forties Busby Berkeley musical and talks as if he is leading a seminar on neoNeanderthal politics But Congressman John G Schmitz  professorial air David Niven mustache and allis whirling into as many as five cities and three states a day trying to turn the American party into something more than a limousine that George Wallace keeps in mothballs except for quadrennial outings to the polls As it happened Governor Wallace seriously wounded in an attempt on his life last May was physically unable to consider making a thirdparty run which had promised to be even more successful than the powerful showing he made in 1968 So lameduck Congressman Schmitz who had been plumping to become Wallaces running mate after Republican primary voters in his Southern California district ended his brief House career in favor of a Nixonbacked candidate sought the Presidential nomination at the American pattys firstever national convention He won it virtually unopposed Stephan Lesher who spent the last three and a half years reporting from Atlanta is now a Newsweek correspondent in Los Angeles Before making his acceptance speech to the more than 2000 delegates in Louisville Ky Schmitz did something Wallace never had considered he became a member of the American party I had tears streaming down my face recalls Eileen Shearer a party official from San Diego You dont know how wonderful it felt to have a nominee of my party who actually was a member of my party Unlike Deiilocrat Wallace Republican Schmitz had precious little to lose by severing ties with his party Early in his fiveandahalf year career in the California State Senate he became persona non grata to Gov Ronald Reagan for being the only Republican in either house to oppose Reagans tax programs Reagan had promised the jittery Democrats supporting the tax that he would deliver the vote of every GOP member of the State Assembly And in most of his two and a half years in Congressespecially after the Presidents trips to Peking and MoscowSchmitz was more virulently antiNixon than George McGovern Lawrence OBrien and Herblock combined After his primary election defeat in June John Schmitz had no place else to go By no stretch of hyperbole is Schmitz a political heavyweight He won his Presidential nomination primarily because the American party so totally wrapped up in the fortunes of George Wallace for so long had no place else to go either But Schmitz a longstanding member of the John Birch Society joyfully welcomed the opportunity to reshape the party to his imageto make it a potentially viable political force of the far right The party had been like a giant clam says Larry Abraham a darkly handsome young businessman from Olympia Wash who is Schmitzs Western states campaign director It opened wide for Wallace at campaign time and then shut tight Thered be a few stragglers whod fight like hell to keep the party structure going But John fully intends to build it into a truly national political party so that by 1974 and certainly by 1976 well be fully qualified in every state and it wont be a regional or a oneman show The party Abraham says will not be built on the Wallace base Those were Wallace people he says not American party people Eventually we hope to convince them that their feat home is with us But for now theyll vote for Nixon and in some areas even McGovern The Wallace base was a significantly large potpourri of white moderateincome Americans  pompadoured car salesmen button downed Jaycees bouffanted secretaries rough knuckled farmers and greasestained steelworkers In the South they are moving overwhelmingly to Nixon while in industrialized areas of the North a surprising number are tending to favor McGovern The Schmitz base such as it is is far smaller It is unlikely that Schmitz will receive even a fifth of the 10 million votes George Wallace commanded in 1968 But Schmitzs followers compose a dedicated generally affluent group of white Americans who deeply believe that the Republic is threatened by a conspiracy masterminded by fatcat international financiers in league with China and Russia and protected from public view by a Comsymp American press Gone are the rousing evangelistic footstomping rallies that filled huge auditorimns to hear George Wallace denounce the superrich the superpoor the criminals in the street and the judges on the bench Gone too are the throaty roars of approval from those who desperately needed a George Wallace to reassure them that theythe plain average citizens of Americahad more common sense than pointyheaded intellectuals briefcasetotin bureaucrats or the editor of The New York Times In their place is a lean hard core of physicians chiropractors orthodontists lawyers real estate developers displayadvertising executives electronics engineers insurance salesmenricher more sedate more sophisticated and somehow more menacing than the earthy kneeslapping throngs that came to adore Wallace This party says Tucson Ariz American party oficial Del Myers a 50yearold insurance salesman is a distillation of the John Birch Society the Christian Crusade and the Minutemen Were revolutionaries Were getting together to try to work through the system But Ill say this Well have constitutional government in this country and if we dont get it through the ballot box well get it in the streets Those are harsh words even for the 42yearold Schmitz who delights in snapping oneliners delivered out of the corner of his mouth a habit he probably acquired during his eight years as a fighter pilot and classroom instructor on the Communist system in the postKorea Marine Corps If Reagan and Javits both think Nixon is doing a fine job he says one of thems getting fooled  or were getting fooled about one of them Your choice in this election is between a man who broke almost every campaign promise and a man who you hope would break every campaign promise The choice now is between two wings of totalitarian socialism Ive been asked who I would vote for if I were not in the race Thats a heck of a choice Nixon the candidate endorsed by Moscow and Peking or George McGovern endorsed by Hanoi and the Manson family Nixon is the living embodiment of the old political adage that if you get the reputation of being an early riser you can sleep till 11 [He] used to rant against Keynesian economics Now hes bumbling and fumbling and fumbling in the same policies as the people he threw out Now Keynes said he was a Marxist and Nixon says hes a Keynesian You figure it out If there were two Gods Richard Nixon would pray to both of them Schmitz who holds a masters degree in education and who taught history philosophy and political science at Santa Ana College before entering politics eight years ago also is serious in his speeches though sometimes in phrases so convoluted that he confuses his listeners The immorality of the Vietnam war he explains is that were putting blueand whitecollar workers out of work by transferring their technology to a competitor which uses that technology to build a war machine which kills the sons of the blueand whitecollar workers in an undeclared nowin war The polite applause usually is accompanied by puzzled frowns Being an old college professor he concedes its difficult for me to say anything in less than 50minute segments He tends to lose momentum in his speeches by delivering lengthy and meticulous quotes from sources ranging from Plotinus to Hans Christian Andersen He is just as meticulous in his daily routine which despite a full campaign schedule requires steadfast adherence to the Cooper Aerobics Exercise Program which he credits for keeping his weight to a trim 150 pounds on his 5foot10inch frame and two hours of nighttime reading including authors such as John T Flynn Allen Drury and Taylor Caldwell I once heard that Mao Tsetung reads two hours a day he says If our enemies can do it weve got to keep up with them A Catholic Schmitz and his youthfully pretty wife Mary have seven children ranging from 212 to 17 and both fervently oppose abortion If government can determine when life begins he declares usually to moderate audience response it is only a short step to government determining when life can end But he grows furious with his church for what he considers its social liberality Theres nothing wrong with the Catholic Church that a good inquisition wouldnt cure Catholics and Protestants both are now pushing the idea that it doesnt matter if you have a soul as long as you unionize your workers and integrate your schools No wonder people arent becoming priests and ministers anymore They can join the Peace Corps if all they want to be is social workers And he dismisses Womens Liberation with a throwaway line My wife Mary onaces Womens Lib She refuses to be lowered to the level of equality But on occasion Schmitz touches a genuinely exposed national nerve Carefully instructing his audience on Pavlovian response he says perceptively Words can produce the same kind of conditioned reflex in peopleand politicians have found out that if they say one thing often enough and do another voters will respond to what they say and not what they do Again Nixon of whom Wallace spoke only rarely and then in carefully modulated terms is Schmitzs primary target To Schmitz it is Nixon the turncoat who must be doubly damnednot to mention Schmitzs belief that the American partys future permanence depends on Republican defectors not on the heretodaygonetomorrow Democrats who flocked to Wallace Few people realize Schmitz says that onefourth of our entire national debt has been run up by Richard Nixon in just four short years under the guise of moderate conservatism We cant blame the Democrats Nixon had the votes to sustain his vetoes And he conned the American people into believing he had an antibusing program But his bill starts out by saying the Government favors busing as long as other means for desegregation have been tried The American party is against forced busing to achieve a racial balance is against forced busing to achieve racial integration is against forced social relationships period Schmitzs campaign is far from capturing public imagination On a recent visit to Tucson he was greeted at the airport by 17 mildly enthusiastic American party functionaries and their children There were a few signs When Youre Out of Schmitz Youre Out of Gear and a few skimmers with bands proclaiming SchmitzAnderson  Anderson being Schmitzs running mate a Nashville Tenn columnist and onetime farmjournal editor Thomas Jefferson Anderson At the Redwood Gay Nineties Restaurant 155 people paid 10 each for a Saturday luncheon of roast beef baked potato and peas But these were the party faithful  the doorknockers telephonecallers and envelopestuffers The absence of noisy crowds to cheer Schmitz doesnt perturb his supporters The people in the party now are informed and able to analyze explained Mrs Dorris Tretschok a willowy blonde whose husband Carl is an American party candidate for Arizona corporation commissioner Theyre not after the free charge they got from Governor Wallace I dont know maybe were just not wired for 220 The Schmitz campaign is keeping the charge down on fundraising dinners as well At the Pasadena Hilton Hotel recently more than 400 people paid only 10 apiece for a sumptuous buffet of stuffed breast of capon rice pilaf Polynesian peas white tuna fish and a selection of delicate pastries It sure beats hell out of Wallaces fried chicken and barbecue ribs observed a tuxedoed partygoer from Los Angeles But Schmitz was upstaged at the dinner by his national campaign chairman the popular rightwing pamphleteer Dan Smoot of Dallas Tex who brought the crowd to its feet with a short ringing speech I havent approved of a President of the United States since Coolidgeand I had some reservations about him For the first time in my life we have a candidate for the Presidency whom I can support without reservation without qualification without limit He is saying Get the world off our back and lets defend ourselves He is saying Get out of the UN and get the UN out of the US He is saying If you get into a war get into it legally and then win it Isnt it refreshing isnt it thrilling to have a Presidential candidate who promises people nothing but to leave them alone It was a tough act for Schmitz to follow especially because the oratory of a number of other party officials droned on for more than an hour including a 12minute opening prayer and by then the audience was heavy with food and drink The coup de grace came when Schmitz stepped to the microphone and it went dead Conspir acy called a man in the rear jokingly You know Schmitz said while relaxing in his room later and sipping Coors beer from a can you have to check yourself from getting paranoid about this conspiracy thing Oh I dont mean the mike But we were on a filmed segment of a news show in Phoenix the other day and just as it began the channel went dead The station manager traced it and found that one of the station employes had cut it off the air intentionally The guy got fired of course But when things like that happen you just cant help wondering Schmitz wonders about conspiracy a great deal His political Bible is a book by Gary Allen his California campaign cochairman entitled None Dare Call It Conspiracy In his foreword to this gossipy undocumented and conjectural book Schmitz warns readers that mass media journalists will brand it as gossipy undocumented and conjectural Among other charges author Allen alleges that David Rockefeller traveled to the Soviet Union in 1964 to fire an employenone other than Nikita Khrushchev Obviously writes Allen the position of Premier in the Soviet Union is a figurehead with the true power residing elsewhere Perhaps in New York More than five million copies of Allens paperback are in print The American party sells it for 1 a copy which helps raise a portion of the 25000 a week being spent on the Schmitz campaign Schmitz tried recently to make headlines with what he termed documented evidence that Arthur Bremer was part of a conspiracy to kill Governor Wallace The linchpin of his presentation was that Bremer had been identified as having attended three or four meetings of Students for a Democratic Society in the Milwaukee area Schmitz also believes that other recent American assassins were conspirators Oswald Ray Sirhan Bremer  theyre supposed to be mixedup loners But you look into their background and you find they arent loners at all And whether theyre from the Fair Play for Cuba Committee or SDS theyve got one thing in commontheyre all out of left field Schmitz also contends that because he angered Richard Nixon who legally resides in Schmitzs district the President ordered both money and manpower released to Schmitzs opponent Whether or not Schmitz angered Nixon he certainly turned off Nixon admirers in the Orange County Congressional district with lines like this one Im not opposed to his visiting China Im only opposed to his coming back Schmitz will be on the ballot in 32 states but he expects to win none although he does hope to make a difference in California and Michigan presumably to McGoverns benefit In the apocalyptic mentality of the American party a McGovern victory would speed the day when most Americans would turn in fear and disgust to true conservatism After the election he will try to make a living teaching college again and lecturing but he will devote most of his time to trying to swell American party ranks for the 1974 Congressional elections and in 1976 for himself for Wallace or for a new standardbearer For the unpretentious Schmitz it is solace enough merely to spread his gospel of conspiracy to as large an audience as possible At least Im consistent he shrugs And I sleep well at night

The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/05/archives/how-nixon-got-it-all-together-the-campaign.html,WASHINGTON  If George McGovern wins the Presidency on Tuesday there isnt a pollster reporter or pundit worth asking why For their evidence and analyses and instincts raise not even the murmur of a doubt that the 1972 campaign will be recorded as a Nixon triumph or a McGovern disaster or some combination of the two Indeed it seems safe to predict that if McGovern wins it will be largely because about 9million Americans in one great glorious fit of pique at the polls and pUndits will decide in the hours that remain to vote against the political experts and for the doctrine of the Unfathomable Voter Not bloody likely that but bloody embarrassing for sure if it were  ever  to occur So we are left 48 hours before judgment day with the fathomable voter  who appears unhappy with the choice bOred with the process but resigned to four more years of youknowwho  and with the candi dates themselves Richard Nixon serene and confident after four years of shrewd Campaigning making only a lastminute show of concern this weekend for the struggling Republicans seeking a place in Congress in his wake George McGovern hoarse and weary after failing with every conceivable stratagem to enlarge the fervent but feeble minority that carried him to the nomination and George C Wallace the crippled apostle of angry and often racist grievance whose withdrawal from the contest delivered unto Mr Nixon an allmist irreducible margin of victory Presidents Perspective There are many ways to reflect upon the campaign now ending but surely the most important perspective was the Presidents Nixon 434 Humphrey 427 Wallace 135  those were the 1968 percentages from which a prudent President had to calculate his opportunities They implied three courses of action First hold the supporters of four years ago who would be loath in any case to admit to a serious mistake Hereditary Republicans the majority were safe Ideological rightists were easy to anchor  keep Agnew go slow on welfare humor Reagan and Goldwater And make sure the rest were not seriously hurt by the war or the economy Done It takes hours of polling to find a few 1968 Nixon voters who are switching horses this year Next lure away enough Humphrey voters to make the margin more cornfortable to protect against a sudden burst of Democratic strength among the untested new young voters and to forestall the accident of a Democratic sweep of the big states with the most electoral votes even with a minority of all ballots cast This implied a nonpartisan and statesmanlike bearing at the White House Peking Moscow Arms control Price control Reelect the President and never mind that he is named Nixon or called a Republican Done Then add to the mix a generous pouring of salt into Democratic wounds What with so many Humphrey Democrats fearing McGovern and so many McGovern fans despising Humphrey this approach always seemed a reasonable hope When Muskie collapsed trying to merge the two camps it became positively promising Fully half the Humphrey voters of four years ago have been in various tstages of disaffection throughout the campaign debating the Democratic candidates competence and credibility and proposals Up to a third of them are leaning toward voting for the President with a lack of enthusiasm that is startling but In the reckoning irrelevant Finally complete the conversion from Democratic of enough Wallace voters to secure a solid electoral base in the South in case he stood again and capture the lions share of his 1968 vote in case he withdrew Haynsworth Carswell Antibusing Calley Antiwelfare Antiamnesty Sound white and virile and patriotic Done The South is solid again  123 Nixon electoral votes plus 26 more in John Connallys Texas toward the required minimum of 270 If Wallace were in the race the TimesYankelovich poll shows the voter preferences a week ago would have been Nixon 44 McGovern 29 Wallace 15 and 12 per cent undecided With Wallace out three of every four of his fans are votino for Nixon Given all these circumstances it is doubtful whether any Democrat could have overtaken the President this year But Mr McGovern appears to he finishing at the minimum end of his scale instead of the optimum as it appeared in his perspective His job was to hold the Humphrey Nntr With a broadbased appeal to Democratic loyalties and fears of Republican economics to let Wallace draw strength from the Republicans if he ran and to regain a sizable portion of the Wallace vote if the Alabaman withdrew to concentrate his support in the populous states with the largest electoral votes to lure over some former Nixon voters who were strongly opposed to the war in Vietnam and to augment this total with a whopping share of the new votes of young people McGoverns Problem What was left of the unity of Democrats after the primaries however was shattered in the bruising battle over the California convention delegates The month of June which Should have been devoted to the arts of healing the spent in bitter conflict Hence the nomination came in an atmosphere of triumph over other Democrats instead of over Nixon including even the expulsion of Mayor Daley so that many Democrats looking in on the Miami spectacle lost their sense of kinship with the party Some have been won reluctantly back but by no means all Then came the Eagleton fiasco shattering the idealism of Mr McGoverns younger fans who thought him yielding to expediency at the first sign of trouble and confirming for other voters the NixonHumphrey complaints about the South Dakotans managerial competence The result was a further serious loss of support just when McGovern should have been growing in strength and this loss was not overcome until the final weeks of the campaign North Vietnams inability to mount another serious offensive this fall and its willingness to engageresident Nixon in the most serious negotiations to date further deflated the war as an issue The economic upturn at long last focused the attention of most voters on their hopes for prosperity instead of their memories of difficulty The Watergate breakin and rill the evidence of highlevel influence peddling in the Nixon administration evoked almost no measurable rebellion in the electorate So Senator McGovern was left with his pleas for decency and defense cuts and tax reform and a new social agenda of goVernmental exertion But among many traditional Democrats and the bulk of the Wallace constituency these positions faded into the impression that he was a 1000giveaway dogooder a friend of rebels and malcontents or just plain blacks an opponent of the traditional virtues and of some less than virtuous but hallowed ways of doing business Heading into this final weekend Mr McGovern was still straining to recover the 1968 Humphrey voters with appeals to the Democrats mistrust of Mr Nixon with complaints about corruption and bigbusiness favoritism and warnings about future unemployment and inflation But the war had become an ethical rather than practical issue for college youth and Mr McGoverns bulge of support among them did not even suffice to offset the Nixon sentiments of working youth The Potential Stigma The man from South Dakota was running hard largely it appeared to avoid the predicted stigma that he would go down as the Barry Goldwater of the left  as a man who had contrived to win the nomination in an ideological pose that then proved fatal in the mainstream of American voters Logic required Mr McGovern to attack attack and attack to tear away Nixon votes and he tried to exploit corruption and inflation and threats to civil liberties and the uncertainty of peace in his heavy use of television demanding all the while that the President come out and fight like a candidate But necessity pushed him constantly on the defense and many of his telethon discussions with voters in key states found him explaining away the old crises of the 1000 distribution Eagleton amnesty abortion And the President of the United States was running just hard enough to offset the Democratic complaint that he was hiding the Republicans complaint that he was fending only foi himself and the voters complaint that it was difficult to remember theres an election on Tuesday Mr Nixon had left the campaigning td a huge staff of surrogates to emphasize his preoccupation with affairs of state to stake his claim on fouryear record and to demean his opponent by leaving him to wrestle with the lesser ranks Only at the end did the President deliver some lowkey radio speeches and one lofty television address Unless he is forced to concede a startling upset Tuesday night the President will have waltzed through the whole campaign without once mentioning his challengers name MAX FRANKEL

News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/07/archives/the-campaign-issues-many-questions-of-interest-to-voters-never-got.html,WASHINGTON Nov 6 A young salesman stood on a corner in Cheyenne Wyo a few days ago and expounded at length on the need for tax reform especially in the dosing of loopholes that benefit the rich It was almost precisely the argument advanced by Senator George McGovern all this year in the Presidential race and to the salesman it was the most burning national issue of the day Yet he expected to vote for President Nixon he said because he did not quite trust Senator McGovern and he thought that real tax reform would have to await the arrival of a more convincing candidate on the national scene His outlook was indicative of what happened to many important issues this year They never got enmeshed in any meaningful sense in the campaigns While some such as the economy and Vietnam were mitigated by developments of recent months the extent of interest in the issues throughout the year suggests that after the election many of them will still be there unresolved by the strange 1972 campaign According to both sides at the outset it was to have been an important year for the is sues The two parties were to present a clear choice  on the war the economy military spending social and urban programs agriculture health philosophy of government busing and others Borne Out for a While For a while the forecast was borne out For example hearings that the Democrats held around the country in preparation for drafting the party platform showed an outpouring of interest A diversity of individuals and groups lined up to show that they felt deeply about national policies and practices Many of these concerns found their way into the Democratic platform and the Republicans although conforming to the wishes of the White House sought to promote policies to fit the public demand on issues But the issues never survived the conventions Thereafter the Presidential campaign swung on personalities as the issues faded into the background Some issues had an indirect impact For example Senator McGovern had been so closely identified with the New Left on such matters as amnesty and abortionwith the Republicans constantly keeping that image of him before the publicthat his credibility was damaged on more substantive matters as tax reform Vietnam jobs and military spending Some of the issues became silent ones working mostly to Mr Nixons advantage according to the public opinion surveys His opposition to busing and forced integration of subtirban housing although rarely discussed by either side worked to President Nixons favor in many communities Issues Confused A number of the issues became thoroughly confused as the campaign progressed The Democrats began the year convinced that health would work to their advantage Senator Edward M Kennedy and Leonard Woodcock president of the United Automobile Workers wanted Senator McGovern to come out strongly for their national health insurance plan as the Democratic platform had done But Senator McGovern shied away from anything but token support of the plan because it would have added billions of dollars to his list of spending programs which were already under fire from the Republicans as an excessive drain on the Federal Treasury For their part the Republicans pointed to health legislation that the White House had proposed halfheartedly and let it go at that Therefore when the new Congress opens next year the health issue will be right back where it was at the beginning of this year as will the debate over what to do about chronic unemployment tax loopholes property taxes racial divisions and other things that have been worrying people Impact on Congress Races Yet the issues did cut in a sense on one level this year in the races for the House and Senate All across the country Democratic candidates who had been associated with the social programs of the 1960s were thrown on the defensive as their Republican opponents sought to identify them not with their own stands on the issues but with Senator McGoverns positions With few exceptions there was on the part of Democrats who had been known as Liberals backpedaling on racial integration busing a guaranteed income social programs with Federal controls and other matters that national Democrats had endorsed in recent years The campaigns were generally devoid of idealistic appeals and pleas for unity and healing They focused instead on such matters as reducing property taxes for the middle class and cutting Federal spending As a result whichever party prevails in the Congressional elections the promises that the winners must keep can be expected to follow the tone and direction that have been set by President Nixon

The President Richard Milhous Nixon,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/08/archives/the-president-richard-milhous-nixon.html,WASHINGTON Nov 7 During a campaign stop in Greensboro N C last week Richard Milhous Nixon bothered by heckling from small group of antiwar demonstrators paused in his speech and asked the television cameramen to train their equipment on theThen with an imperial wave and a triumphant smile he directed the cameras to the vast sea of white middleclass faces who made up the rest of the crowd so the country could see the kind of people who are supporting us Suitably aroused both by the presence of the protesters and the injunction of their President the audience erupted with a loud almost visceral roar of approval Man in the News group so that the country could see the kind of people who are supporting our opponents  It was an instructive moment in the 1972 campaign not only because it revealed that four years in the Presidency had not diminished Mr Nixons zest for combat or his capacity to inflict political punishment What was even more revealing was the response of the crowd for in their roar lay all the evidence anyone will ever need of the remarkable symbiosis that Mr Nixon has been able to establish between himself and the millions of voters in middle America who propelled him to victory today In the literature that attempts to describe this elusive mana man who has probably invited more amateur psychoanalysis than any other politiciancertain words tend to recur persistent durable clever ambitious and lucky Mr Nixon has been and remains all of these But what brought him to power four years ago shaped his first term in office and has now given him a second was and is shrewd understanding of the aspirations and complaints of the middle American A Certain Irony There is of course some irony in the fact that the man who turns out to have best understood and exploited the stirrings and strivings and discontents of the majority has himself done everything possible to rise above the mass His closest friends are silent and loyal millionaires He has never been comfortable on the political stump mingling with the people his lowvisibility campaign this year perfectly suited his aversions and instincts And despite his frequent references to his humble beginnings in the little California town of Yorba Linda 59 years ago the simple frame house there stands unattended and unvisited by its former occupant who now lives in a large Spanish There is further irony in the fact that it was not Mr Nixon but George McGovern who was supposed to have capitalized on the new populism of the mass In any case it was Mr Nixon who emerged in the end as the champion of not only Republican voters but also a goodly number of Democrats But the President himself was not surprised Some weeks ago a public opinion poll suggested that the serious complaints about Mr McGoverns early schemes to increase inheritance taxes and distribute cash grants to the populace came from ordinary workingmen and their wives who wished to preserve for their children the opportunities offered by the American dream that they themselves had never been Mr Nixon sensed the out come of the poll before it was taken and campaigned accordingly portraying himself as a guardian of those who had won the race and those who had yet to run The President understood these aspirations in part because he had lived them Much has been writtenand whether it is accurate nobody knowsabout how Mr Nixon as a child would lie awake in Whittier where he moved nine years after his birth on Jan 9 1913 in Yorba Linda and dream of getting out and getting ahead But what is verifiable is that he soon showed a capacity for work and a driving ambition and an uncanny sense of timing which together propelled him onward to honors in college through nights of drudgery at Duke Universitys Law School to Congress in 1946 to the Senate in 1950 and on to the national Republican ticket as VicePresidential nominee two later In between his political forays Mr Nixon served in the Office of Price Administration as an attorney and in the Navy during World War IL Earlier while trying out for an amateur play in 1939 at Whittier College he met Thelma Catherine Patricia Ryan a teacher who like her future husband had grown up on a small farm They were married on June 21 1940 Their two daughters Julie and Tricia are married respectively to David Eisenhower and Edward M Cox The Presidents most celebrated qualities  ambition and a sense of timinghelped him survive difficult defeats When Mr Nixon won his partys nomination in 1968 it occurred to those who watched him accept that honor that by all the usual rules of logic he should not have been there at all Few men have been written off as finished in American poliics more often than he In 1948 friends predicted disaster when he set out to pursue Alger Hiss a State Department official later convicted of perjury in a sensational Congressional investigation involving charges of domestic subversion Overcame the Odds In 1952 when he was involved in controversy over secret fund raised by friendly businessmen his chances of political survival were conservatively estimated at 100 to 1 And 10 years ago today following his defeat by Edmund G Brown in the California race for Governor Mr Nixon himself seemed to have accepted the inevitability for permanent political exile when he told his famous last news conference Gentlemen you wont have Nixon to kick around any more Yet he not only survived and captured the nomination in 1968 but won the election as well helped as much by events as by his own perseverence and tactical shrewdness Gov Romneys hapless campaign Governor Rockefellers uncertainty Lyndon B Johnsons decision to withdraw Robert F Kennedys assassination Hubert H Humphreys inability to shake the legacy of Vietnam As President he continued to benefit from the unexpected Notably George C Wallaces near brush with death and subsequent withdrawal from the 1972 Tailored the Office But Mr Nixons reelection today was hardly the result of happenstance alone Carefully and systematically he tailored the style and substance of the Presidency not only to his convictions and habits but also to his desire to run and win again In terms of style Mr Nixon stressed order which he thought he could impose rather than charisma which he knew he could not project His ambition he once said was to restore respect to the Presidency With countless option papers provided him by a staff that prided itself on its efficiency he made many of his most important decisions in private consulting few outsiders Publicly meanwhile he presented a sober and largely colorless facade resenting and resisting the continuing efforts of some members of his staff to turn him into something he was not Walk on a Beach A case in point was his celebrated walk on the beach in San Clemente early in his Presidency At the urging of his staff Mr Nixon agreed to take a stroll on the shore and be photographed by cameramen The appointed day arrived and began with a typical burst of White House management A press aide herded photographers to the beach drew a line in the sand to show them where to stand and the President started walking down the beach from his house Then the unthinkable happened He stepped in the water Two months ago the same White House staffers suggested another walk on the beach to give his campaign an informal touch Mr Nixons reply suggested a capacity for selfdeprecatory humor in private that he rarely displays in public I probably walk on the beach more than any other President in history he told a startled and abashed aide like walking on the beach But the last time you guys tried to make something of it for publicity I walked into the ocean Not again His Strong Suit Mr Nixon tried on occasion to compensate for his lack of charisma with flights of rhetoric describing each achievement with superlatives The phrase historic first proved to be his favorite But even this turned out not to be his kind of theater and besides his penchant for careful planning and surprise produced achievements that did not require verbal embellishment The most prominent of these occurred in the field of foreign policy which Mr Nixon has long considered his strong suit In the campaign of 1968 he spoke of the need for negotiation and concillation but neither the capital nor the country was prepared for the spectacle of Richard M Nixon inveterate antiCommunist banqueting in Peking and agreeing to a mutual limitation of armaments with the Soviet Union Perhaps as he once speculated in an interview only a man with his antiCommunist record and cold war views could have moved so swiftly towards detente without provoking domestic discontent In any case he did it and it undoubedly made a difference in the Presidential campaign Ending the war in Vietnam on a basis satisfactory both to him and the country has proved more difficult The question at the beginning of his Administration was whether he would succumb to his political antennae which told him the nation was tired of involvement of his residual coldwar instincts to punish Communist aggression Chose Middle Course He chose a middle course withdrawing ground forces while escalating the war in the air and sending his national security adviser Henry A Kissinger on a seemingly endless series of diplomatic rendezvous with the North Vietnamese On Election Day a negotiated settlement seemed near but Mr Nixons pledge to end the war on an honorable basis remained unfulfilled Despite his profitable balance sheet overseas however future historians may well conclude that it was Mr Nixons domestic policy that accounted for his margin of victory Policy of course may be the wrong word what captured those who voted for him was not so much a systematic or programmatic strategy for dealing with the nations problemsalthough he did indeed submit many conventional programsbut rather his responses rhetorical and real to its grievances Building and expanding on the strategy he had used to outflank the Wallace threat in 1968 responding not just to Southerners but to a vast army of restless and confused suburbanites he invested big new sums in the war against crime denounced radical protesters dispatched Vice President Agnew to condemn the press honored his pledge to appoint con stitutionalists to the Supreme Court wooed parts of labor with his Vietnam policy and Roman Catholic voters with promises of help for the struggling parochial schools and a tough stance against liberalized abortion He quietly desegregated Southern schools as required by the Courts but when the courts went faster than the country wished them to go he offered to Congress and to his admirers in the nation legislation designed to slow busing and preserve neighborhood schools Underneath these tactical responses to periodic problems lay a basic perception A majority wanted orderly change to use Mr Nixons own words but not radical change Whether this strategy could have succeeded against a centrist Democrat like Edmund S Muskie will never he answered But the Presidents luck held The Democrats nominated George McGovern who seemed to symbolize all those dangersprincipally elitism and revolutionary change  against which Mr Nixon had been warning for four years Given the chance to draw a clear choice Mr Nixon campaigned accordingly Mr McGovern had hoped to make Mr Nixons personality and character a major issue the President remained in the White House wore his Presidential mask or hat as he preferred to call it and watched as Mr McGoverns personality became the issue Stuck to Themes In his rare public appearances and utterances he stuck to the themes he had been developing for four years and which Mr McGoverns presence made all the more salable the work ethic law and order national security busing traditional values Mr Nixons friends insist that the positive aspects of his domestic strategyrevenuesharing welfare reform tax reform programs on crime and education and health  have been ignored or underrated His critics and even a few of the friends believe that he has too often substituted symbolism for a clear presentation of those programs and that as a result the vast majority of Nixon supporters are vocal only to his negatives If so his task in a second term will be to construct the intellectual base that alone could commit the voters to his party

Republicans in Connecticut To Control Both Houses,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/08/archives/republicans-in-connecticut-to-control-both-houses.html,HARTFORD Nov 7Connecticut Republicans tonight won control of both houses of the General Assembly for the first time since 1956 Aided by a legislative reapportionment weighted in their favor and by the coattails provided by President Nixons 252000vote state plurality the Republicans piled up a 23to13 edge over Democrats in the State Senate and a 93to58 margin in the State House of Representatives The election will change the nature of state politics which has been characterized by bitter partisan standoff between the Democratcontrolled General Assembly and the Republican Governor Thomas J Meskill The Democrats had charged that the reapportionment plan drawn up in 1971 by two Republican members of a threejudge panelamounted to unconstitutional gerrymandering Republicans countered that local Democrats would rather have skipped the election to avoid running on a ticket headed by Senator George McGovern The General Assembly race became certain only after a Superior Court decision in September upheld the reapportionment plan The principal effect of the reapportionment was to reduce the number of seats in the State House of Representatives from 177 to 151 and to dilute the power of the cities where Democrats predominate In the old House the states five largest cities Hartford Bridgeport New Haven Stamford and Waterbury had 41 seats of which 32 were held by Democrats Under the new legislative district the five cities have 31 seats Although the State Senate still has 36 seats Democrats said they were at a disadvantage because some city districts were expanded to include heavily Republican suburban fringes In the present State Senate the Democrats held a 19 to 17 margin in the State House their edge was 99 to 78 Because of the reapportionment dispute and the vastly more dramatic Presidential and Congressional races the General Assembly contest was more devoid of major campaign issues than usual According to leaders in both parties the incumbents unfamiliarity with large numbers of voters in their new districts discouraged debate on the more controversial issues In many races candidates of both parties simply echoed each other in campaigning for environmental protection redtiction of sales taxes no state income taxes and continued restrictions against abortion
One Governorship Is Gained by Democrats,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/09/archives/one-governorship-is-gained-by-democrats.html,The appeal to populism that failed to work for Senator George McGovern in the Presidential election emerged as an important factor in the out come of several governorship races across the country as the Democrats gained one governorship in Tuesdays election Of 18 offices up for contest the Democrats won 11 and the Republicans 7 This means that for the next year barring a vacancy the margin favoring the Democrats will be 311 to 19 Before the election it was 30 to 20 But more important than party was that even though the more conservative and traditional candidates won in some states there was a trend toward electing Governors who stressed tax reform consumer and environmental protection clean and open government peoples politics and government stimulation of employment In Vermont Thomas P Salmon former minority leader in the Vermont House upset the Republican contender Luther F Hackett who had defended Republican Gov Deane C Daviss tightbudget traditional view of state government Mr Salmon the second Democrat in 116 years to win the governorship campaigned for a more equitable property ta and against Mr Hacketts opnosition to the expansion of public power while a member of the Legislature There was a party turnover in Missouri too at the hands of a young insurgent promising to make government more responsible Christopher S Bond 33 years old the State Audi tor campaigned on college and high school campuses across the state against the cronyism and spoils system he said had gripped the state under long years of Democratic rule The young Republican defeated a St Louis lawyer Edward L Dowd who had run as a lawandorder candidate to succeed the retiring Governor Warren E Hearnes Montanas election presented a clash of ideologies Lieut Gov Thomas L Judge 38 Democrat advocated an expansion of state services and said We cannot revert to the caretaker Governors of the nineteenfifties State Senator Ed Smith his opponent called for a cutback Mr Judge won by a comfortable margin and will succeed Gov Forrest H Anderson In Illinois where the Democrats gained a prized governorship Daniel Walker 49 a Chicago lawyer won partly because he attacked the nongraduated regressive income tax that Gov Richard B Ogilvie candidate for reelection had pushed through the Legislature Washington provided another example of the trend against traditional conservative politics in the West Gov Daniel J Evans 46 a Republican won another term over former Gov Albert D Rosellini 62 who had proposed eliminating state jobs and cutting property taxes Governor Evans had called for increased public expenditures for mass transit pollution control projects new community colleges and parks and public service jobs A close race in Texas was decided at midday yesterday giving the Governors office to a Democrat Dolph Briscoe a 49yearold former state representative Mr Briscoe is a wealthy rancher from west Texas but he ran as a reform candidate denouncing the cerruption linked with high government officials in Texas in recent years He defeated a conservative Republican State Senator Henry C Grover of Houston who had hoped to be swept into office in the Republican Presidential tide Elsewhere in the South and border states however the trend was to the more conservative candidates Gov Arch A Moore Jr of West Virginia a Republican up for reelection was able to turn back a challenge from Secretary of State John D Rockefeller 4th who had campaigned as an environmentalist North Carolina elected its first Republican Governor in this century James E Holshouser Jr 38 a former state legislator over Hargrove Bowles Jr a Greensboro businessman who had poured much of his own wealth into the campaign to succeed retiring Gov Robert W Scott The race did not present much ideological difference It was described as a campaign between a Boy Scout and a Jaycee In Delaware an old guard Democrat Sherman W Tribbitt a businessman and legislative minority leader ousted Gov Russell W Peterson who had pushed through tax increases and offended some corporations with strong enforcement on pollution Mr Tribbitt won by a narrow margin But the Delaware and West Virginia results went against the trend Moderate Democratic Goys Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and Richard Kneip of South Dakota won reelection Mr Kneips victory came after he proposed a new tax on corporations Moderate Democrats also prevailed in races in Rhode Island where Phillip W Noel mayor of Warwick was the upset winner over Herbert F DeSimone former Attorney General and in North Dakota where United States Representative Arthur A Link won over Lieut Gov Richard F Larsen Conservatives were continued in office in Indiana where Otis Bowen a Republican physician was elected over former Gov Matthew Welsh to succeed retiring Gov Edgar D Whitcomb in Iowa where Gov Robert D Ray a Republican was named to another term in Kansas where Gov Robert Docking a Democrat was reelected for the fourth time and in Utah where Gov Calvin L Rampton a Democrat won a new term In New Hampshire the contest was between two conservatives a Republican Meldrim Thomson Jr and a Democrat Roger Crowley Jr Mr Thomson won after a race that showed the candidates to be alike on the issues Candidates who advanced populist issues survived in a number of the races however possibly because they steered clear of such emotional issues as busing amnesty abortion and drugs which apparently cut against the Democratic ticket in the Presidential election according to observers in the states involved
McGovern Defeat: A Look at Some Factors,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/09/archives/mcgovern-defeat-a-look-at-some-factors.html,SIOUX FALLS SD Nov 8 The black limousine that bore the defeated Democratic candidate from his hotel to the airport here today was a backup Presidential vehicle flown here in case its occupant should be a Presidentelect But the short ride in a Presidents car was as close as Senator George McGovern was destined to get to the White House Many reasons were being advanced here and elsewhere today for his defeat yesterday and its proportions The handiest was that the South Dakotan had never recovered from the Eagleton affair Another was that the Senator had merely misread the countrys temper Frank Mankiewicz the senior strategist traced doom to June 9 when Senator Edmund S Muskie decided against endorsing Senator McGovern But the injury sustained by the McGovern candidacy was all of those things and more Shirley MacLaine the actress author and McGovern supporter swept an arm at one of the Senators audiences last week and said Im going to write a book about all of this It isnt going to be about politics because that isnt what this is Senator McGoverns candidacy seemed in retrospect to have been more a moral crusade than a political campaign He began it here 22 months ago with an announcement of candidacy that was laced with moral outrage at the Vietnam war He ended it here yesterday with a concession statement urging President Nixon to lead us to a time of peace abroad and justice at home Theological Defense Chief In between Mr McGovern kept telling his audiences I am here because as President Roosevelt said the Presidency is preeminently a place of moral leadership A clergyman in Grand Rapids Mich asked Mr McGovern a few days ago if he would consider naming a theologian as Secretary of the Interior I would consider naming a theologian as Secretary of Defense the senator replied He may not have meant it specifically but he appeared to have meant it generically He accused Mr Nixon of presiding over the most corrupt Administration in history The Presidents October maneuvers to obtain a negotiated settlement of the Vietnam war were a ploy and deceit Senator McGovern said While other Democrats might have concentrated on joblessness and inflation as prima facie evidence of the Presidents failures Mr McGovern made them out to be symbols of a broader malaisea corruption of the spiritand offered himself as the initiator of a coalition of conscience Already Home Robert Shrum Mr McGoverns senior speech writer urged the inclusion of the theme Come home America in the Senators acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention Now Mr Shrum said he questions the political wisdom of such an approach People think theyre already home Mr Shrum said Its tough to believe that General Custer was wrong or that if the war in Vietnam is bad the country is to blame They want out of Vietnam but they want to bomb Hanoi at the same time Before the voters answered it for him yesterday Mr McGovern said that the question was whether he was ahead of the country in articulating themes of idealism abroad and equality at home But now Mr Shrum and others wonder whether the Senator was not hampered by the style and circumstances of his nomination and candidacy He seemed to have become the candidate of the counterculture the apologist for amnesty marijuana or abortion and in this view the victim of a political cleavage that was not economic or social but cultural Listening to Mr Nixon get the impression that he thinks Ive been President these last four yearsCpmment by George McGovern in Tacoma Wash on Sept 25 Senator McGovern first went on the defensive in the California primary in June He was the challenger but he never regained the challengers offensive stance Senator Hubert H Humphrey of Minnesota debating Mr McGovern in California made an issue of the eventual nominees plans to cut the Pentagon budget and redistribute income to a radical interpretation Mr McGovern was still trying to explain his intentions in traditionalist terms the day before the election The Church of Politica The Democratic convention in July further corroded Mr McGoverns image He was the son of a fundamentalist minister His speeches kept insisting on rededication to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness ideals as old as the Constitution But he never got the opportunity to try to link old values with new movements until 3 AM the last night of the convention when most of the nation was at sleep By then the convention may have burned an image in the consciousness of television viewers as a collection of women  seeking to liberalize abortion laws youths in tee shirts and beards and advocates of a lettuce boycott People think of conventions like they think of first communions one McGovern aide said thinking back on Miami Beach Its the church of politics Into the sacristy in this interpretation went McGovern supporters whose own rhetoric made it appear that Mr McGoverndespite his professed neutrality on abortion reform his defense of amnesty as traditional American postwar grantand his denials that he would legalize marijuana use had as one aide put it let all the kooks into the church We should have had a coat and tie rule another rueful campaign worker said The next time that most Americans saw Mr McGovern was in the television films from Custer S D where he stood beside his running mate as Senator Thomas F Eagleton disclosed a history of treatment for nervous exhaustion The initial vow of 1000 per cent support soon dwindled to the dismissal of Mr Eagle ton and his replacement by Sargent Shriver the seventh man to be offered the VicePresidential nomination by Mr McGovern To the impression of the Senators radicalism was added anotherin some views vacillation or less charitably incredibility Traditional Constituency Well yes Mr McGovern said last week indicating that] he probably should have handied the Eagleton decision differently I probably should] have been a little more cau tious before pledging allout support of Mr Eagleton Other McGovern assistants under the Senators writ of silence on the matter for months now are saying that Mr Eagleton should have been dismissed immediately for having kept his medical history a secret from Mr McGovern Why did Mr McGovern lose I can think of three names Frank Mankiewicz replied here this morning Hubert H Humphrey Thomas F Eagleton and Arthur Bremer When Gov George C WalI lace of Alabama was shot by Bremer in Maryland the McGovern campaign strategists believed that they would be able] to combine their movement with Mr Wallaces to overwhelm President Nixon They reasoned that Mr McGovern and Mr Wallace were both touching the nerve of alienation that ran through much of the American electorate But it did not work You have nothing to fear but fear yourselfRepresentative Richard Hanna Democrat of California misquoting Franklin D Roosevelt as he introduced Senator McGovern at a breakfast in the Disneyland Hotel In the primaries that he swept with stunning upsets Mr McGovern captured a share of the bluecollar vote by going into the grimy mills and factories to shake hands and answer the questions of workers who professed resentment at injustices in the American system But in his frenetic campaigning across tens of thousands miles of landscape and in his search for the millions of dollars needed to campaign via television Mr McGovern seemed to have neglected the traditionally Democratic bluecollar constituency once he had won the nomination His sole appearance before an ethnic group was a meeting with three dozen or so officials of the Democratic partys Nationalities Division The returns in yesterdays election appeared to bear out Mr Mankiewiczs contention that the vote had been Mr Wallaces in his thirdparty candidacy of 1968 nearly all went to Mr Nixon Failure to tap those roots was only one of the organizational deficiencies that some of Mr McGoverns camp described in interviews Some argued that Mr McGovern had erred in trying to comert his grassroots campaign to a regular Democratic candidacy He won over former President Lyndon B Johnson Mayor Richard J Daley of Chicago and many of the leaders of organized labor But as one of the intellectuals of the] McGovern campaign stated to be the antipolitical candidate in the spring and try to become i the party candidate in the fall is not a doable exercise On the day last month that Mr McGovern delivered an inspirational homily at Wheaton College outside Chicago and then had lunch and talked politics with Mayor Daleys precinct captains a staff member shook his head and sald that it had been like going from the sacred to the profane I Some youthful idealists resented the overtures to the pragmatic old pots some professional Democrats regretted the intrusions sometimes overbearing of the neophytes Above this dichotomous coalition no one ever really took charge Nearly all of the mediumechelon staff members interviewed over the last few days contended that the campaign lacked central direction They said that Gary Hart who had the title of campaign manager and Lawrence F OBrien the campaign chairman and Mr Mankiewicz the political coordinator were constantly engaged in intramural scrimmages Jeff Smith a traveling assistant and Gordon L Weil the Senators executive assistant got in one anothers way trying to do the same tasks Richard Dougherty the traveling press secretary and Kirby Jones who ran the press office in Washington seemed never to be advised of what the other was doing Ungifted Amateur It was said one old hand the year of the ungifted amateur And one member of Mr McGoverns entourage said in assessing the defeat that it had been naive to imagine that the same organizational effort that had won in the primariesvol unteers knocking on doors to market the candidate  could have as much impact in a national campaign The country is just too large and too disinterested in politics the aide said to be organized in dhurch basements Sign on a bedsheet held aloft in a crowd at the Greater Cincinnati Airport during a McGovern appearance Let us rise up and build Nehemiah 218 For all of its difficulties Mr McGoverns candidacy of evangelism appeared to have struck a responsive chord among many Americans Saint George will slay the dragon declared a placard in Minnesota Would Jesus Christ fight in Vietnam asked another in North Dakota Some wondered today nonetheless if it had been worth the effort having lost so overwhelmingly The Presidency belongs to someone else Senator McGovern said last night in conceding defeat But the glory of these devoted working friends and their dedication to the noble ideals of this country sustains us now and it will sustain our country We will shed no tears because all of this effort I am positive will bear fruit for years to come Loyal Opposition Mr McGovern credited his candidacy with having raised the issues of peace in Southeast Asia and reform at home And in asserting that the loyal opposition had a continuing obligation to pursue them he seemed to declare his intention to contend with his opponents within the Democratic party for its leadership Frederick G Dutton one of the Senators advisers said that Mr McGovern might turn out to have had more effect on President Nixon than on the country Mr Weil proclaimed his belief this morning that some day the 91yearold exSenator McGovern will be sitting on his porch when the President comes winging in to have him witness the signing of the Income Redistribution Bill And Mr Shrum said that it was almost like the Reformation We could be Luther and Zwingli standing up to say things arent all they are cracked up to be Mr McGovern declining requests for interviews returned to Washington today and prepared to depart tomorrow for the Virgin Islands where he intends to rest and reflect on his campaign Not long after Senator McGovern left the Holiday Inn here today two words were placed on the hotels lighted marquee Its Over
President Won 49 States And 521 Electoral Votes,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/09/archives/new-jersey-pages-president-won-49-states-and-521-electoral-votes.html,By decisively reelecting President Nixon and a Democratic Congress the American voter delivered a mixed mandate Tuesday along with fresh evidence that he remains planted in the middle of the political spectrum As the counting of Tuesdays election returns neared completion Mr Nixons personal triumph was virtually total He swept 49 states losing only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia for a total of 521 electoral votes out of 538 The President won 6083 per cent of the popular vote just a shade under Lyndon B Johnsons 6109 in 1964 By any measure Senator George McGovern suffered the worst defeat of any Democratic Presidential candidate in history Up to half the voters in many states hOwever switched to Democrats in their votes for Congress and governorships They increased the Democratic strength in the Senate by two to a margin of 5743 and diminished it by a minimal 13 seats in the House to a margin of 243192 More than onethird of the nations Democrats rejected the nominee of their party thus cutting back Mr McGovern in every major metropolis The South Dakotan took New York City by the neater majority of 516 per cent Mr Nixon became the first Republican to win a majority of Roman Catholic votes He carried nearly half the young firsttime voters and cut into the traditional Democratic strength in union households and Jewish Spanishsurname and even black communities In the seven largest states where Mr McGovern had staked all the Nixon majorities were 56 per cent in California and Michigan 60 per cent in New York Pennsylvania Ohio and Illinois and 67 per cent in Texas His majorities in the South were still higher up to Mississippis 79 per cent In the states that he lost Mr McGovern ran above 45 per cent only in Rhode Island his native South Dakota and neighboring Minnesota Yet in every section there were remarkable swings back to the Democrats on other ballot positions Mr Nixons rewere remarkable swings back to the Democrats on other bal lot positions Mr Nixons reluctant support of Republican colleagues was helpful in only a handful of situations notably in North Carolina where the party captured the governor ship and a Senate seat in the wake of Mr Nixons 70 per cent majority But the Democrats won the governorship and a Senate seat in Delaware despite the Presidents 60 per cent Mr Nixon carried Arkansas by 69 per cent while Democrats remained Governor and Senator by 76 and 62 per cent The Democrats captured Senate seats in Colorado Delaware Iowa Kentucky Maine and South Dakota while losing seats in New Mexico North Carolina Oklahoma and Virginia Their majority in the House of Representatives declined from 77 to 51 but the political coloration of Congress as a whole shifted ever so lightly to the left if at all Liberals Ran Well And in 18 gubernatorial contests Democrats captured control in Delaware Illinois and Vermont while losing it in Missouri and North Carolina As a whole liberals ran well While it could be argued therefore that Mr Nixons reelection with the massive support of former supporters of Gov George C Wallace of Alabama was at least a slight shift to the right the net record of voter sentiment Tuesday remained anchored near the center of American political opinion The President could claim a resounding vote of confidence in his diplomacy abroad in his personal capacity for leadership and in the social values he expressed on such subjects as public spending abortion amnesty busing for racial balance and the work ethic He failed however to persuade the country that Democrats were spending too freely to manage Coneress or that they did not sufficiently follow his lead in other respects Extent of Nixon Support Indeed it was difficult to tell from the results what proportion of Mr Nixons huge margin was a positive expression of support and which part represented a judgment widely expressed in the opinion pollsthat Mr McGovern was either too extreme in his views or too unreliable in his capacities to deserve the White House Not even the low turnout of eligible voters shed much light on this question Of the 1396 million citizens of voting age only about 55 per cent came to the polls the lowest proportion since 1948 Presumably the stayathomes included voters who felt no enthusiasm for either candidate as well as those who had been led by the remarkably accurate public opinion polls to believe that their ballots would make no difference The firsttime voters between the ages of 18 and 24 this year appeared to have participated in lessor proportions than their elders as has usually been the case Overconfidence Avoided In any event the President and his reelection committee clearly did not repeat their partys 1948 mistake of overconfidence Their vigorous and wellfinanced getoutthevote campaign outdid even Mr McGoverns grassroots organization in most places Despite the overwhelming result however political leaders outside the Congress as well as on Capitol Hill read a variety of interpretations into the election returns Governor Wallace and former Gov John B Connally Jr of Texas were quick to argue that their more conservative counsel to the Democratic party could have avoided the McGovern rout Mayor Lindsay and the supporters of Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts were just as quick to contend that their brand of liberalism if espoused by a more forceful leader would have prevailed George Meany and other labor leaders who remained neutral against Senator McGovern felt vindicated and entitled to greater respect in Democratic councils and most members of Congress were confirmed in the view that they had better not rely on either party organization or Presidential candidates for political success Looking precisely for the kind of popular endorsement he won in his final campaign for public office Mr Nixon had refused to identify himself very closely with other Republican officeseekers even on his few campaign forays out of the White House Like most incumbent candidates he ran as President on a record of four years service stressing his foreign trips his opposition to tax increases the imposition of wage and price controls and the restoration of calm in the nations inner cities and schools To woo the Wallace voters of 1968 he opposed busing for school integration and sought out likeminded Supreme Court Justices To capitalize on opposition to longhaired youth and other radicals he tried to associate his opponent with the relaxation of standards in sex with drugs and with amnesty for draft evaders When Mr McGovern came to the nomination with the conspicuous support of this counterculture Mr Nixon moved in for the kill portraying his opponent as alternately radical and indecisive neither prudent nor competent enough to protect the nation in a dangerous world or against misguided youth and other troublemakers at home By the end of the Democratic convention the President held a 3to2 lead in all the opinion Polls After the confusion over Mr McGoverns choice of a running mate the Nixon advantage edged up to 2 to 1 The President simply held on after that and never felt threatened His theme boiled down to the rally cry of four more years and that is what he won for himself in the White House and the Democrats in Congress and for the political analysts who struggled throughout his first term with the problem of what all these split ballots really mean

To woo the Wallace voters of 1968 he opposed busing for school integration and sought out likeminded Supreme Court Justices To capitalize on opposition to longhaired youth and other radicals he tried to associate his opponent with the relaxation of standards in sex with drugs and with amnesty for draft evaders When Mr McGovern came to the nomination with the conspicuous support of this counterculture Mr Nixon moved in for the kill portraying his opponent as alternately radical and indecisive neither prudent nor competent enough to protect the nation in a dangerous world or against misguided youth and other troublemakers at home By the end of the Democratic convention the President held a 3to2 lead in all the opinion Polls After the confusion over Mr McGoverns choice of a running mate the Nixon advantage edged up to 2 to 1 The President simply held on after that and never felt threatened His theme boiled down to the rally cry of four more years and that is what he won for himself in the White House and the Democrats in Congress and for the political analysts who struggled throughout his first term with the problem of what all these split ballots really mean
... the Defeat...,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/09/archives/-the-defeat-.html,In defeat Senator George McGovern remains an admirable and respected figure He waged a gallant and often lonely campaign never losing confidence in his own prospects or more important in the rightness of his vision of America Scorned by his opponent who refused to debate him or even to respond to most of the issues he had raised Mr McGovern nevertheless continued hammer away on his major themes of which he spoke so movingly as he acknowledged defeat late Tuesday night In practical political terms his candidacy was a disaster since he won only in Massachusetts and the District of Columbia The sources of this debacle are easily traced By his own reckoning Mr McGovern at the time of his first ballot nomination in July was the first choice of perhaps only 30 per cent of his fellow Democrats The partys most liberal elements had united behind him while their opponents fragmented and mismanaged their strength Senator McGovern a skillful organizer in his own state of South Dakota and an astute political strategist in winning his partys Presidential nomination seriously underestimated the difficulty of reuniting the party after the Miami Beach convention The AFLCIO hierarchy and many party regulars proved far more recalcitrant than Mr McGovern had anticipated or than his overall public record as a liberalnot a radicaljustified With his candidacy crippled from the outset by party dissension he was knocked off stride at a critical time by the truly tragic Eagleton episode Equally harmful was his identification with the unpopular side of such issues as abortion amnesty and the legalization marijuanaissues hardly central to the nature of Presidential leadership in the next four years Because his political base was too narrow his party enemies too obdurate his social outlook allegedly too radical Mr McGovern lost But the moral force of his challenge will we believe have lasting impact He spoke to the conscience of America on the cruel and senseless war in Vietnam If the majority of the nation seemed not to respond to this challenge he did at least courageously bear witness within the twoparty system to the sense of outrage which millions of Americans do feel about the war His plea for a foreign policy based on a genuine internationalism rather than on national egotism and the obsolete balanceofpower doctrine his denunciation of corruption his deep sense of compassion his call for a Government more open and more respectful of individual liberties and his effort to evoke a healing reconciling spirit between the races and the generationsthese basic elements of the McGovern message square with traditional American ideals and are sure to find their affirmation in a future election year We salute Mr McGovern in defeat and expect him to carry on with dignity and with honor in the Senate
The Abortion Front,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/11/archives/the-abortion-front.html,An Intensely emotional issue in several of the New York legislative races last Tuesday was the fate of this states abortion reform law Both righttolife antiabortion groups and feminist proabortion groups played active roles in these key contests In general the proabortion forces won There were two tossup races Nassau County in which incumbents who had favored abortion reform were being challenged by candidates pledged to vote for its repeal the incumbents won both In the Bronx similar challenges were also turned back There were two losses in the Senatethe defeat of Democratic incumbents Murray Schwartz of Queens and James Powers of Rochesterbut brutal reapportionment by the Republicancontrolled Legislature seems to have dictated both of these results Elsewhere Assemblywoman Mary Anne Krupsak a supporter of abortion law reform who was also a victim of Republican reapportionment ran for the State Senate and won Even so the elections overall results leave survival or the present excellent abortion law in grave doubt Both the Senate and the Assembly voted to repeal it at the last session and only Governor Rockefellers veto saved reform In the laws first two years tens of thousands of womenpoor as well as richhave availed themselves of the opportunity to terminate unwanted pregnancies under medically safe circumstances The maternal death rate has been fantastically low health officials report The laws basic value is that it makes medically safe abortions available to the poor as they have always been available to the wealthy State law now requires no one to have an abortion those who urge its repeal would require women once again to visit backalley abortion mills or in the alternative to have unwanted children Because forces seeking repeal of this model law are certain to be active at Albany once the new Legislature convenes those pledged to its defense must begin marshaling their strength as well

By LETTY COTTIN POGREBIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/12/archives/review-1-no-title.html,Once upon a time there was such a thing as a typical teenage girl She lived in a warm loving family Mom made her chocolate pudding and cableknit sweaters Daddydear gave her permission to stay out until midnight for special occasions She wore powderpink lipstick learned to use an eyelash curler and got a permanent for her 16th birthday At first she went out with the crowd to rumpusroom parties and Saturday matinees Eventually she doubledated and gossiped about girls with bad reputations and boys who wanted to go all the way She knew how to soul kiss and she knew how to say no when she wanted to Her allowance was spent at roller rinks and record shops but she also sold raffles for Community Chest Secretly she smoked cigarettes After the senior prom she ordered a Pink Lady at a neighborhood bar and got away with it Through it all she went to Girls Club piano lessons and church And when she got married she wore white Her mother cried at the wedding her father joked about going bankrupt to pay for the reception and her husband knew for certain that she was a virgin Naturally she lived happily ever afteruntil her daughter became a teenager Whether or not such girls still exist one does not encounter them in the five novels under discussion here Instead one finds multiple variations on the imperfect adolescence divorced parents mothers who work nights and fathers made listless and impotent by unemployment pot poverty and unwanted pregnancies sex that turns sour and love tattered by betrayal Above all else there is a cosmic loneliness about the lives of these young women and a kind of resiliency which one could call courage Both BONNIE JO GO HOME by Jeannette Eyerly Lippincott

tempered by humor a neerdowell father is allowed an unlikely streak of compassion anti the pregnant sister gives her baby up for adoption only after the subtleties of her predicament are seen and felt Rather than arousing judgemental passions Dont Look and It Wont Hurt leaves the reader empathic and terribly moved In Mrs Eyerlys novel Bonnie Jo travels to New York City for a legal abortion Through flashbacks one learns that she got mixed up with a fast boy when she was rebounding from a nice guy who rejected her She had sex because she was drunk and recklessa rather oldfashioned motivation at best If the sex was nasty Bonnie Jos experiences on the way to her abortion are even more sordid From the contemptuous prig on the bus from Cedar City to the seedy West Side characters insensitive doctors and nerveshattering bureaucratic delays at the clinic there is an undertone of shame and fear which has no place in a modern young adult novel Given the progress of abortion law repeal in several states the clinical details in the book could have served a valuable educational function had they not been polluted by pathos While abortion will never be comparable to having a nose job or a tooth pulled neither should it be reminiscent of The events in the following three novels in which females are characterized as loners would indicate that the idea of a selfcontained independent girl at loose in the world is an inherently combustible one In ONLY A GIRL LIKE YOU by Sidney Offit Coward McCann  Geoghegan 535 what could have been a trite story of unrequited love becomes provocative and thoroughly engaging because this time it is a boy who suffers the capricious attentions of a troubled and untamable girl Sam is 17a square young man from a happy conventional home Christinewho claims to be 19 but later admits to 23is a flowerchild Hippie Beatnik Bohemian with a compulsively free spirit and a secret past Just dont crowd me she warns Be you and Ill be me and remember were always even when we say goodbye Dig Sam doesnt dig He wants love with his sexa sentiment that is recognizable to those of us who once were romantic girls at the mercy of makeout artists One observes with fascination as this rootless girl casts Sam in the classic female role passive vulnerable and hungry for commitment While she grooves on freedom and spontaneity he sits home by the telephone feeling powerless Somehow that didnt seem right he thinks Because the person who waits for the call is usually the girl It is the man who makes the call who picks up the phone and dials and says How you doing baby Come on out well fly a kite  Role reversal can hurt But it can also humanize In BETTER THAN ALL RIGHT by Susan Beth Pfeffer Doubleday 395 the loner is 16yearold Irisa perennial transient who shuttles between her father an unsuccessful playwright her mother a muchmarried woman with connections and boarding school where the flotsam of broken marriages wash ashore and compare notes When she comes to spend the summer with her aunt uncle and their overprotected 14yearold daughter Iris is met with tense ambivalence They find her a threat to their tenuous respectability but at the same time her candor is irresistibly appealing She is willing to serve their needs for diversion and companionship even if it means superficially conforming to their rules Furtively she smokes grass and makes love Shes not out to shock her aunt or corrupt her young cousin but neither will she take responsibility when her privacy is violated and her behavior is found shocking and corrupt Perhaps someone like Iris raised in an emotional wasteland with instructions only to survive and endure cannot be expected to make any further sacrifices A QUIET PLACE by Peter Burchard Coward McCann  Geoghegan 495 is the evocative story of a city girls summer in Maine and her conflicted response to two diverse life styles Cindy may as well be living alone Her father is a shadowy figure who plays tennis her mother is never mentioned Cindy divides her time between the simple farm peopleepitomized by Ike a decent earnest young manand the cynical and sophisticated summer peopleparticularly the fastdriving potsmoking Mark Her satisfying volunteer labor on the farm and her close friendship with a local housewife seem an almost corny counterpoint to bikini parties and sex on the beach Nevertheless Cindys dilemma becomes a serviceable shorthand for the dual pulls in the orbit of many young people backtotheearth vs glamourandtechnology Or one can personalize the question as Cindy does when considering her feelings for both Ike and Mark Are there men who are both exciting and good For lonely neglected girlsand for the women they becomethe question is frequently left

Catholic Bishops Ask End of Bombing in Vietnam,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/17/archives/catholic-bishops-ask-end-of-bombing-in-vietnam.html,WASHINGTON Nov 16  Quoting their exhortations of a year ago for an end to the Vietnam war with no further delay the Roman Catholic Bishops of the United States expressed hope today for a suc cessful outcome of the present negotiations and appealed for an end to bombing and ter rorism A resolution expressing these goals was adopted by a vote of 186 to 4 after pro longed debate at a conference here today The Most Rev Thomas J Gumbleton Auxilary Bishop of Detroit who led a move that got the bombing is sue into the resolution told re porters We could have made a much more forthright and clear statement But he said that the resolution was in a way better than the 1971 reso lution which was the Bishops first call to end the war be cause it does refer explicitly to the bombing The Bishops president John Cardinal Krol Archbishop of Philadelphia noted at a news conference that this years statement emphasized the fu ture not the past Were not hurling condem nations he said but rather directing attention and efforts in a positive way We are say ing heres what needs to be done The bombing reference ap peared in the following part of the opening statement We pray earnestly to Christ the Prince of Peace for a successful outcome of the present negotiations that is for a just and lasting peace with stability and freedom for all the nations and peoples of Southeast Asia We couple this prayer with a plea to both sides for an end to bombing and terrorism which are causing such loss of civilian life and which are causing de struction of the very land itself Indeed a particularly anguish ing and in many cases im moral aspect of this war has been the suffering and death inflicted on noncombatants Long Bitterness Feared The statement went on to warn that the war could leave a residue of bitterness which could poison our national life for years to come It said that we must seek to resolve our differences in a spirit of mutual understanding and re spect As their president John Cardinal Krol Archbishop of Philadelphia did in his open ing address Monday the Bishops  without using the word amnesty  quoted from last years statement urging generous pardon of convictions incurred under the Selective Service Act with the understanding that sincere con scientious objectors should re main open in principle to some form of service to the com munity Todays resolution also called for unstinting aid to Southeast Asia when peace comes on the model of the dramatic and successful pro grams of aid and reconstruc tion carried out by the United States following World War II It also declared Convinced that war is not an apt means of settling disputes and rec ognizing the right of selfde fense we regard as an urgent priority the quest for viable means of preventing war and for effective alternative meth ods of resolving conflicts with such agencies as the United Nations That stalement reflected a Victory for the more moderate Bishops The original statement in the documents second draft under discussion today de clared war is no longer ad missible as a means of settling disputes The Most Rev John Cardinal Deardon Archbishop of Detroit had assured the body that the original wording did not exclude self defense But the Most Rev Edmund F McCaffrey Bishop of Belmont Abbey N C offer ing the substitute said that the original might be misinterpreted In contrast last years state ment quoted a 1939 radio broadcast of Pope John XXIII saying In this age of ours which prides itself on atomic power it is irrational to be lieve that war is still an apt means of vindicating violated rights Although todays debate took up all of the morning session that was open to observers debate on the first draft earlier during the fiveday conference provoked sharper remarks Angry because the first draft did not mention bombing Bishop Gumbleton declared Tuesday Are we going to issue a statement about war and yet ignore  as moral leaders speaking in the name of Jesus the bombing that is going on He asked the conference if it did not have courage to speak about an utterly im moral situation The Most Rev Thomas A Connolly Archbishop of Seattle said that the freedom of the South Vietnamese people should be granted otherwise we are throwing a million of our Catholics to the Communist dogs And the Most Rev Robert E Lucey former Arch bishop of San Antonio asked What good is an agreement with a bunch of Communists that dont intend to keep that agreement Todays debate concerned finer points of wording The Most Rev John Cardinal Car berry Archbishop of St Louis pressed successfully to include both sides in the condemna tion of bombing and terrorism Other bishops succeeded in qualifying the immoral aspect of this war with the phrase in many cases and in deleting the second two words from a sentence calling for gen erosity not vindictiveness Bishop Gumbleton reluctantly agreed not to call the bombing unprecedented for fear that his amendment about destruc tion of the land would fail The conference which began Monday ended today a day earlier than had been planned The more than 200 bishops have been meeting at the Twin Bridges Marriott Hotel in Arlington As the session was ending a proabortion demonstrator William R Baird Jr of Valley Stream LI was arrested on a disorderly conduct charge Mr Baird told reporters he had hoped to address the Bishops and show them a 10 minute film of an actual abor tion to give the Bishops a better understanding of the issue and not call us murder ers

City's Health Department Tightens Its Regulation of ‘Mini‐Abortion’ Procedure,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/19/archives/citys-health-department-tightens-its-regulation-of-miniabortion.html,A medical procedure for ear ly intervention in possible preg nancy less expensive than standard abortion and consid ered by some physicians and women to be less traumatic physically and emotionally has been declared by the citys Health Department to be sub ject to the same rules that gov ern other abortional   The policy would mean that the procedure which a grow ing number of individual gyne cologists and licensed abortion clinics here have provided in recent months for about 30 could no longer be performed in doctors offices foreshadow ing a substantial increase in cost The procedure is known variously as menstrual extrac tion or regulation and as miniabortion or preemptive obortion depending partly on the circumstances and partly on who is doing the talking The technique is a form of endometrial aspiration that ex tracts by vacuum suction the menstrual shedding from the endometrium or uterine lining in which a fertilized ovum may or may not have implanted itself It is usually performed with in 5 to 10 days after a missed menstrual date earlier than the time for which present preg nancy tests are reliable Stand ard abortion by vacuum suc tion also a form of endometrial aspiration is performed up to the 12th week of pregnancy and usually not before the sixth week Experimental Procedure Because the newer method is performed early enough to per mit use of a flexible plastic aspiration tube only 4 mm or about 16 hundredths of an inch in diameter it can be done without dilation of the cervix or anesthesia of any kind The aspiration tube is onethird to onehalf the size of the tubes used in standard abortions The Health Department has described the socalled men strual regulation techniques as an experimental procedure that is still undergoing re search It said that they were either unnecessary surgical procedureswhen used in ex traction or regulation for a woman not actually pregnant or else constitute abortional acts Department officials said that from now on they would make no referrals or appointments for patients of municipal clinics who requested the procedure The department attributed its views to a resolution adopted by its Obstetrics Advisory Com mittee made up of doctors ap pointed by the department The opinions made known in letters to private clinics that had requested information as well as to municipal clinics are expected to be the bases for official guidelines to be issued soon Requirements Listed Behind the Health Depart ments policy is a fear of open ing the door to other forms of abortion in doctors offices Medical sources predicted yesterday that as a result the price for early aspiration would increase to near the range for abortions This is about 125 to 150 in clinics and outpatient facilities and about 250 with hospitalization To conform to abortion stand ards each earlyaspiration case would require laboratory tests of blood urine and tissue path ology a chest Xray three hours of pestoperative obser vation and the filing of a preg nancytermination certificate Groups that have a particu lar interest in the menstrual extraction or earlyaspiration technique include many in the womens rights movement civ illiberties organizations and a number of research gynecolo gists I wish we could take the womens lib aspect out of it the whole thing needs much more testing for longterm ef fects said Dr Donna OHare assistant commissioner for ma ternity and child health Even gynecologists have not had much chance to be familiar with the effects of repeated abortions Dr Harold Schulman direc tor of the gynecology depart ment at Albert Einstein College of Medicine said he opposed the new policy for reasons of economy for patients as well as research He said that safe ty is not a problem with the technique and that he hoped the philosophy of the issue would not become a political football Dr Edward M Stimm clini cal instructor in gynecology at Einstein said that medically speaking he would limit the term menstrual extraction to an earlyaspiration procedure on a woman who had missed her period and who also proved negative to a pregnancy test Safety Is Seen Throughout thecountry how ever women are experimenting with using menstrual extrac tion routinely on the duedate of each period generally do ing the procedure for each other Many of these are acti vists in the medical selfhelp clinics that are proliferating within the feminist movement The clinics condemn the do ityourself kits advertised in underground publications Even in states where abor tions are illegal most women who practice menstrual extrac tion insist that the term is snot a euphemism But many con cede that it is their means of contraceptionwhich they con sider less dangerous than pills or intrauterine devicesas well as of avoiding menstrual in convenience Merle S Goldberg director of the National Womens Health Coalition said representatives of 10 womens organizations concerned with health services had been given an appointment for Wednesday by Dr Jean Pakter of the Health Depart ment She said they would urge that abortion regulations not be Applied to earlyaspiration procedures done by doctors un til the results of several cur rent studies were evaluated Studies Under Way The coalitions own endome trial aspiration study covering 5000 cases in eight states is being monitored and evaluated by the Population Council The North Carolina  International Menstrual Regulation Study Miss Goldberg said has re searched about half of a pro jected 10000 cases Planned ParenthoodWorld Population is conducting another study Dr Stimm who has per formed more than 200 menstru al extractions by his own defi nition called it a worthwhile technique for the gray area after a missed period instead of delaying at least 10 to 14 days more for the confirmation of a positive pregnancy test Any attempt by the Health Department to prevent its use in the presence of a negative test would be unenforceable he predicted because it is practically indistinguishable from other twoorthreeminute office procedures in use by gynecologists for the last 50 yearsincluding the removal of tissue for biopsy from a wo man who has missed her period but has no possibility of pregnancy
"Governor, Viewing '73 Fiscal Outlook, Expects Few Funds for New Projects",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/20/archives/governor-viewing-73-fiscal-outlook-expects-few-funds-for-new.html,Governor Rockefeller esti mates the state will have 85 billion to 86billion in rev enues during the new fiscal year but says that mandated increases in state spending are such that there will be very very little for anything impor tant moneywise thats new In an interview last week aboard his plane as he returned to the city from upstate town meetings Mr Rockefeller dis cussed the states fiscal out look and some of the issues among them abortion and no fault automobile insurance that will come up in the 1973 legislative session which be gins Jan 3 The Governor said he was generally working within the framework of the estimated revenue total in conceiving his state budget for the 197374 fiscal year which starts April 1 The states current budget which expires March 31 is a holdtheline spending plan of 79billionabout the same as in the previous state fiscal year Mr Rockefeller noted that the expected revenue increase in the next fiscal year would largely be spent on a variety of mandated increases These include the normal growth fac tor in the states educationaid formula previously negotiated salary increases for state em ployes and a rise in pension costs and the like leaving little leftover for new projects At the town meetings five of which were held around the state last week with six more due in coming weeks the Gov ernor stressed that the spend ing outlook for next year was tight In the interview he de clined to say whether he would ask the Legislature for new taxes He maintained that that had been a policy since he was widely criticized years ago when he said no taxes and then had to seek added sources of revenue But earlier in the week he told an upstate newsman that theres no need for new taxes if we hold the line on spend ing EducationAid Brought lip One of the issues he has raised at each town meeting has been a recommendation by a special state commission on education that the state take over the raising and distribut ing of funds for public schools partly by means of a uniform statewide property tax that would replace the share of local property taxes devoted to the schools The proposals by the Fleisch mann Commission are aimed at producing greater equity be tween poor and affluent school districts and at providing a more equal method of taxation With the possibility that the United States Supreme Court will decide that the use of local property taxes is an inequit ableand therefore unconsti tutionalmeans of financing education Mr Rockefeller said he wanted the Legislature to begin discussing the issue seri ously in the 1973 sesion The Governor conceded that whatever legislation might be introduced next year would be more for study and discussion than for action but said that a beginning toward solving the issue should be made The Governor also indicated interest in the Fleischmann panels proposal to increase average class sizes without de creasing educational quality for a saving to the state of 500million I have to think if theres 500million to be saved its not a bad thing to study the Gov ernor said Mr Rockefeller did not seem enthusiastic about a plan put forth last week by the Board of Regents that would change the distribution of state aid to schools by providing more funds for districts that have neared the limits of their tax ing ability while limiting spend ing by wealthier ones Sees NoFault Hope His attitude may be explained in part by the secondyear im plications of the plan which would involve more than 250 million in new state aid For 1974 is an election yearboth gubernatorial and legislative and politicians are unlikely to favor costly programs that might require new taxes from voters only months before they head for the polls Mr Rockefeller said he was buoyed by Assembly Speaker Perry B Duryeas recent state ment that some form of no fault automobile insurance would be a major goal in the Assembly next year The Governor who saw his 1972 nofault plan swept aside by the effective lobbying of trial lawyers has pledged an allout effort for nofault in surance in 1973 His chances also are enhanced in the Senate because two powerful oppo nents of the concept will be absent next year They are Sen ate Majority Leader Earl W Brydges Republican of Niagara Falls who has retired and Sen ator John H Hughes Republi can of Syracuse who died re cently The Governor called the pub lic pressure for nofault insur ance intense He cited as evi dence the New York State Trial Lawyers Associations recent statement that it now favors the concept He said however that its plan was not a viable form of nofault insurancewhich is aimed at allowing an autoac cident victim to collect damage claims without costly and lengthy court battles The Governor said he was uncertain whether the issue of the repeal of the states lib aralized abortion law would come to the floors of both houses again next year This year he vetoed a repeal of the liberalized law which permits a woman to elect to have an abortion until the 24th week of pregnancy A possible deterrent to the abortion issues being let out of committee he said was a case pending in the United States Supreme Court that will determine if a woman has the right to decide whether to have an abortion He said Mr Duryea had informed him that the abortion issue had not fig ured in the recent election of Republican Assemblymen who are in the majority The Governor also gave short shrift to a plan by the mayors of the states six largest cities to seek state revenuesharing of 21 per cent of state receipts instead of the 18 per cent localities now get He said that when the Federal revenue sharing bill providing aid to states and localities passed it was expected that the funds would be split 5050 between the state and local govern ments TransitFinancing Discussed Instead twothirds of the funds are to be distributed to localities and onethird to the state Last year voters rejected the Governors proposed 25 billion transportation bond is sue He suggested at two of the town meetings that some alternative be found for the longrange financing of high way and masstransportation projects He was asked if an other bond issue was likely Some form he replied adding I really havent any plan Im interested in seeing how much interest there is in rate of expenditures for high way and other programs which are now at what he considers a slow 220million from cur rent revenues There are no major pro grams that Im pushing with out finding out what the peo ples real thinking on the subject are the Governor said

Program Helps Over‐40 Pregnancies,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/26/archives/program-helps-over40-pregnancies-women-in-40s-get-aid-on-pregnancy.html,NEW HYDE PARK LI Some pregnant women over 40 years old who are troubled by the increased risk of pro ducing a defective baby at their age are being helped by a new hospital program that tests for defects and requires that the woman undergo an abortion if the fetus is mon goloid The women sometimes re ferred by their doctors are going to the prenatal diag nostic center being estab lished at the Division of Human Genetics at Long Island JewishHillside Medical Center There they are learn ing that there is a 1 per cent risk of Downs syndrome sometimes called mongolism in children born to women in their 40s After genetic counseling they may choose to have amniocentesis a medical pro cedure to remove amniotic fluid from the amniotic sac where the fetus grows If when cells from the fluid are grown they indicate the pres ence of Downs syndrome the parents are expected to de cide to have the fetus aborted and try again to conceive a normal baby At the center amniocen tesis is only performed if the parents commit themselves in advance to have an abortion if Downs syndrome is detected They must have the test at about 13 weeks of pregnancy in case the cells fail to grow so new cells can be removed and grown in time to have an abortion at 16 weeks if indicated This test is done to make a specific decision said Dr Eugene Pergament coordi nator of the division If the parents are not ready to make the decision to have an abortion on the basis of the test there is no sense in making the test There is a small risk of in fection in the procedure and also a small risk of aborting the fetus as a result No ma ternal deaths have resulted Dr Pergament is strong ly opposed to having the test just to see Elsewhere there have been cases of women who have gone through the procedure and discovered their babies would have Downs syndrome but changed their minds after the test about aborting them The current cost of the procedure at the hospital is 250 a pa tient It is performed on an outpatient basis The new availability of the test reassuring to many can also produce a harrowing de cision for some One couple who came to the center re cently happily expecting their first baby late in life left considerably sobered and still undecided Mrs Audrey Heim ler the divisions genetic counselor discussed the pro cedure with them The woman was over 40 and had never been pregnant before she recalled The man was in his mid50s and had two children from a pre vious marriage This was what wed call a premium baby for the wifeshe wanted it very much Mrs Heimler told the cou ple the risks of Downs syn drotne would be about one in 100 and of other chromo somal disorders would be about one in 50 She showed them diagrams of the fetus pairs of chromosomes indi cating the pair in which an extra chromosome produces Downs syndrome in babies born to older women She described the removal of amniotic fluid She as sured the husband his age was not significant in the case She also recommended a blood test Since all the couples grandparents were Central European Jews to de termine whether the couple are carriers of TaySachs syndrome indigene  to Jews of that area If the couple are carriers the amniotic fluid can be tested for that as well Tests of the fluid are made only for specific defects indicated by genetic tendencies of the parents The test will also reveal the sex of the child but Dr Pergament said it would be inappropriate to disclose it to the parents At the end of the counsel ing session the husband par ticularly seemed deeply shaken Mrs Heimler said But he had firmly decided he favored amniocentesis The wife was not yet sure The feeling is Its my baby and I want to protect it from everything Decision Often Difficult Many of the couples find the decision difficult to face she added They sometimes say it took them a long time to bring themselves to pick up the phone to make an ap pointment Sometimes they will use denial like saying Really I dont think I needed to come or My wife here had a lot of questions and I just came along If they decide not to have amniocen tesis and have a child with Downs syndrome they have to think of the burden of the child in their old age Mrs Heimler attempts to find out their emotional con cerns as well as reassuring them of the statistically small likelihood of genetic defects and the availability of ami nocentesis For those who have had genetically defec tive children she may have to convince them that the de fect was not a result of diet or being hit by a wave or being punished for previous sins They ask her sometimes Why did this happen and sometimes Why did this happen to me We must address our selves to the real concerns she said We have to take the superstitious beliefs se riously to reduce this kind of thinking or else we cant make headway with real in formation In one such case a woman who had been born with a deformed hand believed it to be punishment for sins in a previous life since it oc curred before she could have sinned in this life She said she had lived her life to guard against deformities in a fu ture reincarnation She con sulted Mrs Heimler as she was about to be married aft er having put off marriage for some time before I asked her why she thought her belief about the cause was so and whether she could believe another ex planation Mrs Heimler said Then I told her it was an isolated event unlikely to happen again She left with tremendous relief Mrs Heimler said an im portant part of her job was to help parents deal with anx iety fear and guilt about having produced a defective child in the past I tell them everybody car ries eight or 10 genes which if they mate with someone with the same genes have a 1in4 chance of producing a defect Mrs Heimler said I tell them they could have had no clue beforehand and the fact that theyve come to us means theyre doing the right thing

Television,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/26/archives/meanwhile-as-hitler-is-raping-czechoslovakia-.html,ON this weeks episode the third in 13 weekly installments of The Roads to Freedom Daniel re duces Marcelle to one fat stink ing pregnant woman the aging Lola sniffs cocaine as her love affair with the young Boris begins to founder Ivich gets drunk at a nightclub and slashes the palm of her hand with a penknife and Mathieu plunges the same knife through his own hand It is in other words a fairly typical episode in the latest serial dramatiza tion to be imported from the British Broadcasting Corporation This one however based on a trilogy of novels by JeanPaul Sartre is being carried only by stations WNET13 in New York and KCET28 in Los Angeles The Roads to Freedom is one BBC production that was rejected for the national showcase provided by Master piece Theater Whatever the reasons there is no shortage of possibly objec tionable language and sex elements the rejection is understandable As drama the series is exasperating stuffed with pompous interior mono logues and unconvincing historical re creations But with the help of several good performances The Roads to Freedom generates a considerable degree of perverse fascination perhaps as much for what it reveals about Sartre as for what it captures of his highly schema tized characters The dramatization actually deals with two and a half of the Sartre novels A fourth in the series was never com pleted In exploring illustrating vari ous concepts of freedom Sartre focused primarily on three characters Mathieu an intellectual professor Daniel a homosexual and Brunet a Communist In this dramatization Brunet who took over in the last half of the third novel is reduced to a relatively minor character In the beginning in June 1938 Mathieu Michael Bryant discovers that Marcelle Rosemary Leach with whom he has been having an affair fur seven years is pregnant Still not ready for marriage to compromise his freedom he sets about trying to get money for an abortion Meantime Daniel Daniel Massey consumed with selfloathing for his sexual habits convinced that you can only damage yourself by the damage you do to others Eventually he winds up marry ing for his own bizarre punishment Marcelle whom he regards as a great hulk of nauseating femininity The rest unfortunately is reduced despise the generally intelligent efforts of producer David Conroy and director James Cellan Jones to a show of philo sophical puppets dangling on the flayed strings of Sartres existentialism A character is never simply a character he is a walking thesis And most of his thoughts evidently too profound for mere dialogue are delivered in soundtrack voiceovers When Mathieu discovers that Mar celle is pregnant he looks quite com posed but in the voiceover he almost hysterical murmuring intensely Shes pregnantpregnant And when Daniel is preparing to drown his cats his voiceover is explaining laboriously that they shall die because they love me Oddly enough while Mathieu and Daniel fret and suffer and constantly question themselves the less prominent and less complicated characters become almost refreshing Mathieus prosperous brother is the epitome of the righteous French bourgeois Yet when Mathieu approaches him for the abortion money the brother infuses the confrontation with dramatic vitality He ridicules Mathieus notions of freedom arguing that they always seem to imply freedom from not free dom for As for principles the brother points out that you invent them but you dont stick to them that Mathieu is capable of despising family ties hut not beyond exploiting them At the same time Sartre is able to make clear that this brother proud of his full moral health and maturity bought his law practice through his wifes dowry and that he is a prime candidate for fascism And then there is Lola a nightclub singer and in love with the young Boris a student and disciple of Mathieus Lola can look at Mathieu and conclude correctly that I cant imagine him enjoying anything Lola knows what she herself enjoys and she is singleminded in the pursuit of it As played by Georgia Brown the British singer she also provides most of the best scenes in the series In this weeks extended nightclub sequence Lola gets to perform in front of an audience and in an atmosphere that brilliantly captures the mood of a France looking nervously at Hitlers Germany Miss Brown is gorgeously on target As in the novels later episodes counterpoint the characters with actual events leading up to Frances entry into war The historical centerpiece is Munich in September of 1938 As Hit ler is raping Czechoslovakia in front of Frances Daladier and Englands Chamberlain Sartre in his tiresomely obvious way arranges to have one of his characters raped by a man she despises Daniel still convinced that only through others can I loathe myself finds the ultimate other in Christ on the Cross He sees me Daniel cries Coward hypocrite pederast hated despisedyet sustained I am before God and before man I am  Ecce Homo The incurably passive Mathieu ends up in the army and discovers that the secret of my life is death  my death will be the rejection of my impossible life It is a long road a very long road and the result is obviously not in the category of popular television As a collection of theses the Sartre novels do not lend themselves to dramatization But given the impossible task The Roads to Freedom is as noted per versely fascinating in its oval rigorously offbeat way

breather read a lot of scripts and then choose something in which you dont play a character suf fering from Identity Crisis or any of the other dread beasts of modern ma laise something that allows you to savor a little of the joy of life Get yourself a tough totally nonartsy director wholl pare away the tics youve acquired since youve become culturally accept able And you know what Youll be as

The sexual revolution and the young—,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/26/archives/the-sexual-revolution-and-the-young-four-studies-the-sexual.html,The gradual liberalizing of sexual codes ethics and standards of appropriate behaviorwhat some have called the new morality or the sexual revolutionhas to many observers transformed young people into wholly promiscuous adolescents Too often overlooked however are those young persons for whom the new morality causes a spe cial sort of insecurity and hurt For some time my work in sociology has been to describe the experiences of young people many of whom I have visited with regularly for more than five years Recently several young people have spoken to me of those features of the new moral ity that have hurt them or confused them or some way disrupted their sense of intimacy and personal evolution Insisting that they speak only for themselves and to circumstances they call their own they have granted me permission to publish their words On a fiercely cold March day I was visited by a 17yearold college freshman Her face appeared to be frozen her fingers practically rigid We had spoken before though not that many times but these had essentially been interviews about her college experiences These meetings were usually at her residence house she had never before visited my office I wanted to see you she began laughing weak ly because I cant study Anxious Yes in a way But not like you must think See I live with this girl who well she has this boyfriend whos always in our room And like I like him and all that but its kind of hard to work while theyre making love all the time Its all right when the librarys open but like some nights I get back after studying and I can hear everything theyre doing or Judy will put a note on the door for me or something Two nights ago I studied for three hours in the bathroom if you can believe that On this freezing cold floor I had to use the shower curtain as a blanket I mean maybe Im crazy but I dont think its fair They dont seem to mind Its like they really wouldnt care if I went to sleep but I just cant see doing that I mean can you No I dont think so I recalled what were for my generation the problems of roommates and their dates Ive thought of asking for a single but a lot things prevent that Like money Thats one thing But there are others She seemed perplexed or rather it was a request for permission to say something that I saw on her face If I live alone dont you see there will be lots of people wholl think its only for sexual reasons I was incredulous Single rooms belonged to the brains when I went to collegeor to neurotics maybe but scholarly ones who kept strange hours and just learned more Of course Dont you know Who would want live alone but a sex maniac or someone frightened of it Then suddenly she was crying embarrassed that she was and pulling a handkerchief out of the pocket of her pea jacket I want so much to be like them but I cant get myself to There are so many different values everywhere Between my parents and the kids and my sister and Judy  I used to be like them I mean Im not against sex You can sense that cant you I nodded yes But what am I supposed to do Who do I tell Where do I go I want to be like Judy but how can I Why cant you do things like her if you want Because Im UGLY DAMMIT she cried out Because I have no choice What am I supposed to do go to bed with the first guy that comes along Dont you see how complicated this is Nobody knows anymore what anybody is doing I dont know what normal means One minute I think Im OK and then I think I should see a doctor I just dont know she sobbed I feel so lonely all the time and I cant even figure out if that is supposed to be good or bad One person says aloneness is right somebody else says I should find someone to sleep with I dont know I dont know I did my best to comfort her Finally she was willing take off her coat and scarf She sensed my embar rassment  Do you know what I did this morning she asked without looking up I went to the health services and had myself fitted for a diaphragm I had to Its like inside in my body I had to feel that in some way I was a part of it all A part of them the generation Nothing will happen Im sure of that But you want to be prepared Not really she corrected me gently I dont really want to have sex yet I mean like that I just want to know that I could that Im like them in side you know Maybe I do You see I dont know How does one know How do you know if people tell the truth Like do you think people would believe me if I told them about this She nodded toward her lap Dont you see Do you advertise it Do you keep your mouth shut Three nights ago I actually sat in the library figuring out ways that I could arrange to get raped I did I had this elaborate plan all worked out too I was going to hitch into certain places in Boston until it happened Then I decided why bother Ill just tell people I was raped Then I decided Id cut myself on the leg or something in case they made me prove it So instead of that I got a diaphragm I dont even have a boyfriend Its all so pitiful and humiliating She turned away from me I feel so foolish telling you this now You really must think Im weird I wont take any more of your time go Hoping she would stay I did my best to describe my reactions to her It was only natural for her to be confused I said clumsily for no one knows what others are demanding and why But she should have faith in her own decisions and a sense of a right way It was a speech most of us would make It contained references to the dif ficulty of being young the need for autonomy the pressure of peer groups her rights and the value of speaking with adults from time to time She was already at the door holding her coat in front of herself when she mumbled thank you and smiled kindly It helps a little to see you she said but not enough I have to live out there with them and its more difficult I can assure you than any course this school See I have to do it all alone Without you without my parents With them the good ones and the animals Boys and girls I have to have a diaphragm because its 1972 because maybe of what you all think were doing Her tears which had stopped while I spoke welled up again in her eyes and she shook her head in disbelief Thats what I meant before Do I have sex because they want me to because I want to because my parents are worried about it You know rebellion the independence thing Do I have it because you say I dont have to or because Im not attractive And if I do will I have to keep doing it Will I want to keep doing It She leaned toward me holding on to the doorknob Am I going to be come a whore Is that what Im supposed to get out of my college education I saw myself in the soul of a 20yearold man about six months ago We have been friends this young construction workercarpenters apprentice and I for several years He left high school six months before graduating taking jobs first in a cleaning store then for less than three weeks as a dishwasher in a tavern I used to kid him during lunch hours on his job at various construction sites about the negotiations he had made with his girl Their agreements I remarked about what they could do separately and together sounded not unlixe the will of a wealthy baron He laughed out loud as he recalled his earlier words to me He used to say things like See weve got it worked out I get to see other chicks and she sees other guys Ill tell her like what I think is motivating me you know and whether its really pure or whether Im just into some flesh trip Course thats all right if its only that cause weve agreed that you can actually love people in different ways With the mind you know and with the body and we want to experi ence everything so that well really know if were together where were coming from you know Staying together forever man is a heiluva step For the girl too I aint about to go getting a divorce with kid there dawling Ive seen enough of that So when she meets another guy I sort of psychoanalyze her to see what shes really feeling about this guy You know why she thinks she needs to see the guy Then I can sort of tell her whether it seems rational you know or whether shes into some spiritual thing spaced out you know what I mean just stud tripping She does the same for me Like we do it for one another I was so astounded to hear this from him the codicils of the will that I actually blurted out Do you two ever have time to make love He laughed and shook his head as if to say you know it sounded rather contorted to me too Three months ago however there was no gaiety between us They had broken up I just cant believe it man She just split Left all her self Her stuff you mean Yeah her stuff Whatd I say Her self I wish he mused I got all her clothes and things in my place Another guy I guess so yeah I just see her everywhere though man Everywhere I go I see her like sitting there like shes following me around I even went home to talk to my ma about it Whatd she say Go out and get a job He smiled Good ol ma But it was strange man finding myself going home over a thing like that Just like a lit tle boy huh going home to his mommy telling her his girl ran out Jesus You wouldnt think a thing like this could get you down so\Ever happened to you Yes Hurt Better believe it I an swered So you know I know You know what I found out She made it with a bunch of guys Handed me all that crap about having to get to know where her heads at and shes running around in and out of the sack Aint those kind of girls got any sense of guilt Youd think something could stop em Baby it really hurts me It really hurts I want to confess some thing to you I havent told anyone You repeat it Ill deny it Ive been going to the church on our block and sitting there way in the back you know just crying my eyes out Ive been praying shed come back Ive got all her stuff in my place still smells like her I got some of her clothes I smell all the time Smells just like her I just sit in that church and cry man like a goddamn baby The cry ing carpenter Even thought of killing myself You imagine that You know who I blame Yourself No sir He sounded em phatic Not in the least I blame this screwedup society Rich kids poor kids white kids black kids and all their folks and grandfolks They got this new morality thing going here This sex revolution thing Everybodys supposed to be humping and jumping Aint anybody anymore knows if hes in love or just turned on You get some girl see her like then move in with her and everythings OK Then theres all that talking and the hassle Theres no way to straighten yourself out What they need is a sex cop stand ing on the corner telling you where to go But it works for a lot of people Yeah sure it does he agreed Works awful pretty for a lot of people Makes em free Hell it made me free for eight months Beautiful man I think I loved her I loved her What can I say Now I got this He showed me the back of his hand I saw a large gash and stitches Put it right through a stair rail last week Thats in case you thought I was lying about being in the church Burns me that everybodys got to go ex perimenting Everybody with her was an experiment One night experiments What you could call house calls And me like a fool Im sitting around watching Guys are making it everywhere I turn and Im letting her run around sos we can talk about it every night stead of getting stoned For a few moments we said noth ing Then he spoke again You see that dude over there He pointed to another worker That guy specializes in rich girls He says hes helping the cause Dude goes up to the square every night to find college chicks Hes got a business going Says hes got all these chicks feeling guilty about being rich or smart You believe that With all the s going around he may be telling the truth he grinned Going around like a social worker And youre sitting in the church crying Can you beat it You know what he told me He said with pride man that he knocked this one girl up and when she came back after hav ing an abortion somewhere in New York maybe or Puerto Rico That sound right Any way when she came back like a couple of months later he comes on to her again and doesnt even recognize its the same chick And she lets him I mean its her thing too man Whos to say whats good or bad Last year they did drugs This year its abor tions Were just following your dreams My dreams You know The press TV They got all these ideas of what we do so we do em Anyway let me finish The dude there makes it with this girl right and when theyre all done she tells him And he says Sonofabitch How you making out And dont you think she got pregnant all over again A rich college girl Jesus was all I could say Place is crazy man he continued I can see it all around Old peoples marriages are coming apart young peo ple playing every which way at marriage I did fraid to go all the way Everybody think ing sexs going to do it for em People fraid to say theyre uptight about this or that I tell you man they need a cop down here to direct the traffic And so what becomes of you I asked Me Im into drugs pretty big now I suppose Speed Speed a little acid on the weekends You know At home it works out but then you get with your friends  And after drugs Maybe the closet This was his word for homosexual ity Dont rightly know You gotta try everything now Isnt that what they say Gotta experience new spaces man But you speak as though you had no control Where ever the tide pushes thats where you move Thats a good way of say ing it You live down here thats the way you think I was shaking my head again in disbelief In fact the gesture was becoming reflexive in conversations like these What got to me now was his way of sounding as though nothing lived within him If instincts drove my generation then so ciety or any leftover pieces of it seemed to drive his You move with the times man he was saying People have expectations for you so you live up to em Its the same with you Societys got a hold on your leg too It says marry some chick and stay that way Me it says mess around and be a big man No ones gonna care when you settle down so go make it with every chick in sight I want em all Only thing I wish is that you guys would make up your mind about Us guys Yeah You guys You talked here the other month about a sex revolution No kid my age is smart enough to invent something like that Anything that bigs gotta come from the old and the rich So when you all make up your mind we all might get it together down here Till that time man I got lots of tears left to come out and lots of pills Phone me if you want me is how I left him not sure exactly what I wanted to say What for man he called back from near the lunch wa gon on Copley Street You got a bunch of extra girls or something lying around No You afraid I might hurt myself Maybe I dont know I was uncomfortable yelling the words to him If I decide to blow my brains out Ill buzz you When she was 13 she had an abortion Thanks to a so cial worker and a teacher no one learned of it and a short absence from school for rea sons of illness was all anyone ever knew about The opera tion had crushed her mother angered her father and pro voked her eldest brother to beat up a young man he claimed to be the father The young mans jaw and nose were broken his right eye cut so severely that normal vision never returned The victim of the assault however was not the father of the child When she was 15 her par ents arranged to send her to a school in the suburbs where as her mother hoped she might meet good kids and be away from these dirty streets they got around here She was one of very few black women in the school and in the first few days several white students came to her and to those with whom she was bused inquiring about drugs Several boys asked her out but she refused them Later in the year however she accepted some of their requests for dates We spoke once in the school bus riding back to Boston Her posture never changed her expression re mained fixed resigned When they see a black girl come in to their school they only think of one thing Black girls they think are loose Maybe they arent for black guys but theyre supposed to be for white guys Its always been that way But now they go calling it a sexual revolution which means I guess that nobodys supposed to care what people are thinking of you But a lot of em out there got that sex revolution mixed up with racism Theyre just thinking anything they do is all right cause people are sup posed to be expressing every thing and youre not supposed to be hung up with morality But a lot of it is racism If they found out about my you know what happened to me theyd be all over me Even now some of em are expect ing me to be some kind of a teacher or something These kids you see think were the ones who got this sex thing going They think all that stuff starts where we live But they got it all in their homes Every one of em practically has divorced parents Ill bet They go blaming it on us just so they dont have anybody snooping around them But their kids know Problem is they just cant go telling any body Who they gonna tell it to So you know who they tell it to You Right on She smiled broadly for the first time that afternoon I know as much about some of them as you know about me More even She looked at me then down at her hands I went to this party the other night out there A whole bunch of us went actually It was really a laugh All these guys were there walking around as if nothing bothered them Listen ing to them youd think sex was the only thing on their minds Its like they got to tell you about it so youll know theres nothing wrong with them Some of em are real nice too Real nice I could like em if theyd just stop act ing as though they were all grown up like their fathers or their stepfathers if you know what I mean Its like nobody wants to be a kid any more Nothing for anybody to do so everybody gets into drugs and sex and like I said before they go around mak ing you think that were bet ter at drugs and sex Boy if what they thought ever were true it sure would be one sick world I asked her then that spe cial question about whether there is a lot of sex in the school I fumbled with the words and tried my best to let her know that I really didnt want to know but I really did but then again She laughed Sometimes Tom I dont really think even you know what you want to ask Now do you want to know if everybodys making it with everybody That it She turned her body toward me looked quickly around at some of the other students and held her hands palms up in front of me Cause they aint Lotta kids are plenty fright ened Lotta them dont know what to do Nobody knows whats going on except may be that the teachers and the parents are all nervous But I can understand that Id be nervous too if I had a kid my age going to school Im not so sure I could trust me Kids our age dont know all that much I can tell from what you say that you feel that Its probably true Even with what Ive been through Im still kind of a child Old in some ways but a child in lots of other ways Everybody talks about some big change in sex and all that but they dont know Just cause you have sex doesnt mean you really care for somebody And a lot of the teachers theyre only against sex cause they got it through their heads that nobodys really supposed to show anybody else they really like em And then a lot of kids they think sex means youre caring for somebody So if you have a lot of sex you follow me then that means you care for a lot of people And that sure aint true I know lots of the sis ters right on this bus been hurt plenty by lots of guys Lots of em Theyve done some hurting in their time too So I dont know I think everybodys got sex mixed up with a whole lot of other But Ill tell you the big mistake you all make There was a sadness in her voice now as well as anger You think its easy to be young and just go running around no cares no responsibilities like Thats your mistake You all think we can do anything and get away with it but thats because youre only in terested in the excitement You know something They got girls in this school so lonely they cant talk about it But when they get them selves pregnant then some ones gotta listen Aint no body interested in a boy or girl having a fight or trying to figure out their lives what theyre gonna become you know But if he knocks her up or beats her up then all the adults come running They just dont want people mis behaving So afraid were going to be doing something all the time You should only know how many ways I gotta look before I take a step My mother and my father and political kids who say I shouldnt see white boys kids back at home who say I shouldnt be seen with subur ban kids older kids younger kids Holy Jesus by the time they figure out who I can see itll be down to one guy some You uneasy talking to me now Course I am Youre white and there are all kinds of rea sons we shouldnt be talking Sexual revolution is what youre interested in Political revolution is what Im inter ested in Theres always going to be a wall between you and me just like theres always gonna be someone seeing us thinking Im your woman Most important revolution will be over when they see me just as a woman not as your wo man Several students in the seat in front of us heard her I watched them nodding their heads One turned to look respectfully at her So Im not going to tell you everything Im thinking but one more thing Everybody nows talking so much about sex and drugs and stuff like that even though they know those arent the problems everybodys having But they talk about em anyway And that means that when youre a kid you cant have any thoughts that are really your own Every time you say something youre just saying what everybodys already said Your mother your teacher the newspaper television even you She pointed her finger at my nose There aint noth ing Ive thought of that other people didnt think of before Or felt So I cant do anything new or say anything new something really mine except maybe with some man or some pill You ever think of that Thats the only time I create you know The only time I know that what Im doing is mine and honest All the other time is like playing this big game moving here or moving there just cause every body expects you to be doing it They hand you all this sex revolution jive all the time but if you ask meand you did you knowI think its just another way theyre try ing to watch over us Jail us maybe While they go talking we gotta go snooping around Cant keep no secrets cant make no deals cant even keep your loneliness to your self no more She looked at me as if to test my strength Bad as it was that little operation of mines about the only thing that let me know freedom You think you can understand that A man on his 18th birth day made a pledge that be fore the year was out he would no longer be a virgin Only his roommate knew of this pledge indeed most of his other friends would have been shocked to learn of how limited were his sexual ex periences at that point In truth he had boasted to them of his exploits never lying but instead making sure to use language that would make them believe he had ex perienced everything If any of them had ever bothered to play back what I said theyd have seen Ive done nothing he told me one afternoon in a Cambridge coffee shop where I used to read poetry with a young man who died a year ago from an overdose of drugs If they ever listened to me I mean really listened to me theyd see I wasnt really saying anything We drank our tea in silence the only two people in the shop on this hazy spring afternoon It all seems so strange he continued that there should be so much emphasis placed on sex in this country You have to assert yourself one way or the other Everybody wonders if you dont So let em wonder Cant You can say that but I cant do it Youre older People wonder What can I say They wonder They look at you when you come home after a date as though check ing you out I do it myself I try to imagine what the guy might have done or where they went Do you believe he went on that men can really be impotent You mean physically Yeah I mean not psycho somatic or whatever you say Yes I suppose some men are physically incapable of  I began before he cut me off I am you know Physically Whats the difference cant make it I cant perform and thats what Americas all about isnt it he replied bit terly You know Cadillacs coming off the production lines buildings being torn down and bigger and bigger ones going up More people more cities bigger wars Big ger bombs Promiscuity Thats what men are supposed to do isnt it make every girl they see I didnt know that was the game Sure looks that way to me he said And what are women sup posed to say to all that Do the big men in your dorm ever talk about that My fury which I hoped would put him at easefor I was trying after all to be his allywas not totally disingenuous I am truthfully tired of the ex traordinary pressures put on people to perform in certain ways at certain times and to be good and beautiful at what they do on every occasion I recalled a concert pianist say ing to my wife and me one night Did anyone ever think that maybe some of us may not feel like playing Mozart on Saturday night from 845 to 906 Did anyone ever think that maybe wed like to play baseball at that time or that maybe if they want to hear us at our best they should come to our house at five in the morning when we cant sleep I play Mozart then and plenty good too sometimes Yes my friend was say ing the men in my dorm think of that But mens per formance still comes first to them Let me tell you some thing I began Im tired of all the pressures your sup posedly liberated generation puts on itself May I Go ahead he said I dont buy this conscious ness two three four five jazz I dont buy the idea that the young have it all What the hell is going on in these dorms that everyone is push ing people to behave So what if youre not screwing You will Or you wont for a while Country doesnt need any more babies for a while any way Your time will come He smiled Had there been others in the shop they could have seen that he enjoyed my performance He was pleased But they would have seen too that he was not at all relieved My time has come he said finally Whats that mean Now it was he who sounded like the professional calm meas ured thoughtful everything under painful control Ive met a girl that I guess I love So great Not so easy he said Shes great Im great with her but sex isnt so great You try Tom he laughed weakly looking as if he wanted to soothe me by patting my hand I cant do it She can Shes had two miscar riages my friend She can He smiled kindly Miscar riages dont just happen Shes trying hard but Im well failing Im just a flop With his fingers closed he jerked his thumb downwards and made a popping sound with his mouth Do you talk about it You got anything in mind that we should talk about other than that What do you think we do all night if we cant make it We talk about it Seems all I do is talk The only way I have to make my self useful is to listen to her talk about her personal prob lems Her past and all These guys you know and the mis carriages Ive changed a lot in these last two months You learn from women like you cant ever learn from men In fact weve both learned a lot from mothers Like what Well its sort of a happy coincidence that both of our mothers could feel free enough to be able to tell us about some of their problems You know things from their private lives Both of them for example are impotent [I believed that he meant to say frigid] I guess although theyve each had several chil dren We have three and Mollys family has two She has a younger sister And both of our fathers Im pretty sure now have had kind of a lot of affairs Your mothers have told you all that Hmm My mother told me Her mother told her The fathers tell you too No no My real fathers dead her father and mother were divorced when she was very small Maybe 10 I think younger even maybe I just learned a lot of this recently Right before I went off to col lege last year you know first child first time away from home thing my mother and I had this long talk about dating and sex I thought she was pretty damn courageous talk ing as openly as she did Shed agree with you I think Her generations probably a helluva lot more open than mine like you were saying before He seemed perfectly at ease almost clinical in his way It was I who felt anxious hearing this new information and watching all these ideas and notions move about in space totally disconnected Yeah she told me just about everything shes ever done Or didnt do And I told her too Although I didnt have very much to tell her Mothers can be all right They can be rotten too but they can be all right They take a lot of crap Like fathers having af fairs I offered Like fathers having affairs exactly and getting young girls pregnant That happened too Not in our family but in Mollys Well so what do we do I questioned him at last Thats your role Youre supposed to say You want to talk to some one Shrink maybe I knew youd say that I am talking to someone You Right now I know but I thought you might want to see someone else Professionally No not really But theres a problem no Its the biggest problem he said with a sudden firm ness in his speech But Im not about to fall down before your psychiatric gods and let them eat my mind up alive The second you make that first appointment with the shrink youre labeling your self sick frigid impotent whatever No sir You have to pull yourself out of it otherwise all thats happening is that our society is swallow ing you up You ought to be able to appreciate that Yeah somewhat Its got to be personto person Not patient to doctor You label me sick you label my whole background my whole history sick Which would mean that your mother and father too would be labeled in the process Thats exactly right pal he responded angrily Thats exactly right What are they going to do make my mother come into therapy with me And my sisters And Molly and her past boyfriends I suppose What are we going to do have a sance so we can all ask my father some questions How about an in tergenerational seminar on im potence maybe Thats what it means you know You im plicate everyone whether you want to or not What youre saying is that all of us are sick We sat in silence I could see his eyes moistening with tears Its pitiful he was saying Its all so pitiful I feel dead inside Lifeless burdened desperate Not real ly lifeless I dont know Theres nothing to do really You dont have this problem I guess do you No I wanted to add thank God Youre lucky Ive had my silent lifeless moments though He seemed a bit relieved In fact he even smiled slightly Maybe he started if you could loan me some of your hormones I might be able to start a little sexual revolu tion this weekend We looked at one another neither of us smiling A whole revolution you need I joked I need one shot One crumby lousy shot in the dark Just loud enough for every body to hear

subject however it does not deal with demean ing and oppressive social attitudes about women from a safely philosophical or sociological distance It is not a book about womens liberation it is the record of a quest for personal liberationwritten by a woman It is as the author states unobjective fiercely idiosyncratic Yet its personal focus honesty even ambiva lence make it both compelling and il luminating Examination of Experiences I dont think I ever chose manhating to be a part of my life says the author It is a defense against fear against pain It is the refusal to suppress the evidence of ones experience And much of Combat is a description and examination of the experiences that led Miss Bengis to accept her resentment of men from being molested by anonymous hands on crowded subways to attacks by male drivers as she hitchhiked across the coun try to her battles with a professor who could understand that she might like him and not sleep with him but could never accept it But manhating is not an ob sessive theme in this book Miss Bengis submerges herself completely in the mael strom of conflicting Ideals and attitudes that have complicated and impeded her quest for a decent way of living of making human contact sexually and psy chologically In effect she is having a dialogue with herself in which the referent for her dis cussions of traditional and liberated views of love sex and womanhood is her own experience Therefore while she may de nounce all mens complicity in the sub jugation of women and even admit to castration fantasies she can also admit that I do like many men and have thought I loved two or three She recognizes the weakness of womens traditional passive role and the need for more independence but she can admit to the horrible ab surdity of not being in controlever except when I wasnt in love except when someone really didnt matter And while she recognizes the desirability of removing legal constraints on abortions and women exercising control of their own bodies she reminds us of the anguish [one] still must feel when she conies home and looks in the mirror and thinks Its gone  Sustaining a Balance What Miss Bengis tells us makes us see through vivid documentation of her own struggle is that the psychic damage issuing from oppression of women is real and felt But she also demonstrates that in the process of attempting to become separate individuals many [women] have had to anesthetize [themselves] to needs that are nonetheless real and deep Her essay is poised between a justified indig nation at womens oppression and a refusal to accept compensatory ideological canons that themselves thwart basic human re sponses It is a difficult balance to sustain but throughout the three sections of the book ManHating Lesbianism and Love she maintains the tension Only occasion ally does she lapse into Cyclopean views for example her tooeasy defense of women turning away from men to Lesbian ism because of a need for tenderness which men lack She does not consider that conversely the general lack of ag gressiveness in women which men need is also an obstacle to satisfactory hetero sexual relationships These lapses how ever are rare Combat is a torturous record of a womans search for genuine love and for self and as such it is far more poignant than say Memoirs of an ExProm Queen a fictional work with the same theme that was published with a great deal of ballyhoo earlier this year In its stark honesty it accomplishes on a per sonal and human level what many fem inist writers have sought to do with plati tudes and rhetoricevoking an effective and empathetic acknowledgment of the psychic devastation that too often results from the callous repression of women It also makes one realize that many of the ideological blueprints and facile generalizations of movements are themselves often antihuman But its essen tial value is more basic By taking us into the emotional labyrinth of one woman Miss Bengis has provided a microcosmic view of the untended human needs and the emotional turmoil lying behind both the rhetoric of the feminist movement and the smug posturing of the masculine ego It is a book well worth reading

Dublin Reviewing Link to Church,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/29/archives/dublin-reviewing-link-to-church.html,DUBLIN Nov 23The Irish Government has embarked on a delicate and possibly far reaching reassessment of its re lationship with the Roman Catholic Church The immediate aim is to ease the fears of Protestants in Ul ster that the Irish Government is priestridden and domin ated by the Catholic Church But officials view changes on such issues as divorce contra ception and censorship as nec essary in the long run if Ire land is to be reunited Prime Minister John Lynch and other officials are involved in a referendum campaign to amend the churchs special po sition in the Constitution The referendum on Dec 7 is con sidered deeply significant be cause a sizable vote to delete the churchs favored status could open the way to key so cial changes Government offi cials say that defeat of the measure or a small vote in fa vor would confirm the fears of Northern Protestants and set back unification Historic Opportunity There is now an historic op portunity to raise ourselves out of the quagmire of hatred to work together to create a new kind of Ireland said George Colley the Minister of Finance and director of the smoothly organized referendum cam paign It must be clear that we are talking of an Ireland which Protestants and Catholics will share and in which neither party will dominate Ireland is now sharply split along religious lines Twothirds of Northern Irelands 15 mil lion people are Protestant in the Irish Republic to the south 95 per cent of the population of three million are Catholic The Protestants in the North have long feared unification because it would mean Catholic ascend ancy over them So far the Catholic Church has been somewhat equivocal about the campaign to revise what is widely referred to sim ply as Article 44 the part of the Constitution that recognizes the special position of the Holy Apostolic and Roman Church in Ireland William Cardinal Conway head of the church in both parts of Ireland has said that he would not shed a tear over the deletion of Article 44 but there is disappointment in the Government that the Irish Catholic hierarchy as a body has not formally supported the amendment In fact many priests in Dub lin and Cork have given publicity to meetings organized against the proposal arid a movement called Defend 44 has been set up to keep the ar ticle on the ground that abor tion reform the sale of contra ceptives and sexual permissive ness would follow its repeal Leaders of the movement have said that the Irish will commit spiritual Karakiri if they amend the article High Government officials maintain that the deletion of Article 44 would merely be a gesture but a highly symbolic one It would show our open mindedness and our desire for genuine change said a senior official Defeat of the amend ment he said would play right into the hands of such people as William Craig the militant Ulster Protestant leader Mr Lynchs Government is now working with an allparty committee on constitutional re visions considering especially repeal of the ban on divorce Other changes under discussion would enable the partners of religiously mixed marriages to adopt children and would ease censorship Some of the books now judged indecent or ob scene are by such authors as Bernard Malamud Iris Murdoch Colette and John Updike Saying Nothing Beautifully Critics of the Government maintain that on the crucial issues of contraception and education Mr Lynch and his Cabinet have so far done little to ease the anxieties of the northern Protestants Saying nothing but beautifully began a recent article in This Week magazine a popular Dublin weekly It added The reiterated appeal to the northern citizens of Come in we wont hurt you is only reminiscent of the classic tale from the nursery of the spider and the fly Earlier this year the Govern ment opposed a measure in the legislature  called the Dail in Gaelicthat would have permitted the sale of contracep tives as well as the circulation of advice on family planning At present Mr Lynch says only that the issue is before the Irish Supreme Court because of the actions of a Dublin womens group that bought contraceptives in Belfast and distributed them illegally at home The debate is especially em barrassing because underthe counter sales of contraceptives are common in Dublin Recently a Catholic marriage advisory council in Cork the first established in Ireland was closed by the Bishop of Cork and Ross the Most Rev Cor nelius Lucey who took excep tion to the remark of one of the counselors that 93 per cent of those attending postmarriage courses were seeking advice on family planning The comments of Dr Luceya church con servative who has been cool to the deletion of Article 44  were widely publicized in Northern Ireland School Issue Is Crucial Perhaps even more crucial is the issue of primary school education still overwhelmingly under the control of the church Dr Noel Browne a former Minister of Health and an Irish Labor party member of the Dub lin Parliament said forcefully that the church has controlled our education and although theyll make concessions on some issues they insist on sectarian schooling We have a church as au thoritarian as any South Amer ican Republic with a hierarchy as rigid as any in Europe he added It has blocked desper ately needed social legislation and it has been an important contributor to the fact that we are a country with had health services dreadful housing poor education Dr Browne a Catholicborn physician who represents a workingclass Dublin constitu ency in Parliament said Why the hell should any Northern Protestant in his right mind want to join the Republic On our record in terms of our inferior social welfare or free dom of conscience no Protes tant or Catholic should want to conic here and accept out standard of living our way of life All of us here are victims and end products of the same sectarian education Our ideol ogies our social attitudes are predetermined by our educa tion Priests dont have to go into Parliament because were taught by them as children Dr Browne conceded how ever that the church was in the midst of changes because of political necessity the rest lessness and questioning of Irish youth and television dis cussions and documentaries from Britain that have had an impact on the Irish Theres obviously a ferment taking place now he said The church knows theyve got to change and the Government knows it too

Nation's Births Show Drop. Below Zero‐Growth Level Federal Statistics for Nine Months Give Rate of 2.08 Children a Family —No‐Increase Figure Is 2.1,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/05/archives/nations-births-show-drop-below-zerogrowth-level-federal-statistics.html,WASHINGTON Dec 4Fertility in the United States has dropped for the first time below the replacement level 21 children a family that is necessary to achieve zero population growth The population is still growing but it appears that the rate of growth this year will be only a little more than half that averaged during the sixties According to new Federal statistics for 19 consecutive months the birth rate each month has been lower than in the same month a year before And despite an increase in women of childbearing age so has been the actual number of births The estimated fertility rate consequently has dropped from 239 children a family for the first nine months of 1971 to 208 this year If it persists this seemingly small difference in rate would mean nearly 17 million fewer Americans by the year 2000 than at the 239 rate The larger significance of the new rate lies in the fact that it means the country has for the first time cracked what analysts called the 21 barrier The 21child figure is that required for the population eventually no more than to replace itself assuming no immigration This is the goal of the national zero population growth movement The figure is 21 rather than just 2 to account for girls who die before reaching childbearing age Even during the Depression years of 1935 to 1939 previously the lowest recorded birth rate period the average fertility figure was slightly over 22 children a family Were the nation to sustain a 21child fertility rate for 70 years the population would stop growing having reached about 320 million It is now about 2093 million The presence of a disproportionately large number of young people in the population means that zero population growth could not be achieved in a short period of time Still the new figures indicate that the population will increase by 07 per cent this year The average annual increase during the sixties was 13 per cent Were the fertility rate to go below the 21 rate as it now has and stay there the day of zero population growth would come correspondingly sooner Demographers caution against any expectation that zero popu lation growth is likely They treat shortterm period statistics warily noting sharp historic swings in fertility For example as recently as 1957 the peak year of the postwar baby boom the fertility rate climbed to an alltime high of almost 38 children per family The possibility of a new upward swing is latent within the nations current age structure Because of the baby boom there now are about 500000 more women aged 18 than there were 10 years ago and 900000 more than 20 years ago With so many more potential mothers even a small upward shift in the fertility rate could cause a significant increase in the population growth rate For the moment however the new Federal birth statistics which are issued monthly all point to low birth and fertility rates Through September there were 2437000 births 236000 less than in the corresponding ninemonth period last year This is a drop of 9 per cent The general fertility ratethe number of births per thousand women of childbearing agedeclined 11 per cent for the ninemonth period this year to 753 births The crude birth ratethe number of births per thousand population also dropped 11 per cent from the 1971 period to 166 births Population experts identify a series of reasons for such declines One is the growing proportion of young women who stay single Another is that even married women are having children later A third is the expressed desire of women black white rich and poorto have smaller families Other factors are the growing number of working wives the state of the economy the increasing use and effectiveness of contraception and the broadening liberalization of abortion laws The new figures are contained in the Monthly Vital Statistics Report Vol 21 No 9 published by the National Center for Health Statistics Rockville MD 20852

LONDON,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/08/archives/mr-heath-at-10-downing.html,LONDON Dec 7The nations large and small are now concentrating on the problems nearest their hearts their boundaries and their particular regions of the world This trend is clear not only in the new and struggling coun tries but in the United States the Soviet Union and China and it is par ticularly marked here in Britain Prime Minister Heath talks about these things very quietly and steadily in the Cabinet Room at No 10 Down ing Street He seems more in command here now than ever before despite all his problems but the emphasis of his conversation has changed in the last year from global to national and Euro pean interests He does not dwell as he used to do on the special relationship between the United States and the United King dom Pearl Harbor Day passed here almost without notice though it was probably the turning point for Britain in the last World War But that was 31 years ago and the British have new things to worry about For they are caught now between the old Irish tragedy to the west and their new shotgun marriage with Eu rope to the east between the power of Parliament and the potential power of the emerging European community between the need for more production and world trade and the demands and threats of organized British labor for higher wages Prime Minister Heath is very courte ous and pragmatic about all this He is going to Washington before Inaugura tion Day to talk to President Nixon about how to work out the monetary tangles of the world and how to recon cile all the economic interests and con flicts between the Common Market and the United States on the one hand and the security interest of the NATO allies and the Soviet Union on the other But the things in the front of his mind now quite naturally seem to be primarily the condition of his own people the problems of rising prices and labor demands the ancient con flict with the Irish and the sharp division among the British people who are going into Europe but dont quite know what they are going to find there Before the British have quite got used to losing an empire they liked they are being asked to join a con tinent they have never particularly liked and meanwhile the Heath Government has published an offi cial social commentary on the condi tion of Britain which even the Webbs might feel was a little dis turbing One per cent of the British pop ulation today it says still own 30 per cent of the nations wealth de spite all the progressive taxation since the days of Lloyd George Economically the British people are better off than they have ever been before  better The Financial Times suggests gloomily than they may ever be in the futurebut the results of this increasing affluence are not entirely encouraging For example the Governments official report says while the eco nomic condition of the British peo ple has improved the social trends to use a modest English word are disquieting Violent crimes have almost trebled in the last ten years Between 1961 and 1971 average weekly income rose 94 per cent while retail prices went up by only 57 per cent but the big increases have been on motor vehicles alcoholic drink en tertainment and recreation and hous ing fuel and light There is good news on the increase in holidays social security health ben efits education and the decline in infectious disease but veneral disease and abortion are also on the rise In 1971 the report says one out of every four babies born to mothers between fifteen and nineteen was ille gitimate and three out of every five of the births within marriage in this fifteentonineteen age group had been premaritally conceived Overall the Heath Governments report is one of economic progress and social decline No doubt these few ex amples distort a study which is as big as a telephone book but it illustrates as American social statistics do in Washington  why modern govern ments are beginning to think more about the problems nearer home The British are only the most dra matic symbol of the problem for they have a long tradition of selfanalysis and selfcriticism but at least they are publishing the facts unlike many other governments and trying to deal with them under very difficult cir cumstances For Mr Heath the United States is always a primary concern particu larly if there is danger of major war but since that danger seems remote now he is doing what Nixon Pompi dou Brandt Brezhnev Chou Enlai and most of the other world leaders Are doing He is looking homeward and forward to the new organization of the world and it play not be a bad idea

Maude Didn't Leave 'em All Laughing,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/10/archives/maude-didnt-leave-em-all-laughing-maude-didnt-leave-em-all-laughing.html,ON television a few weeks ago the 47 yearold title character of a situation comedy chose to have an abortion In the dustfree nonallergenic flameproof tidy world of television Maudes abor tion was major surgery Two CBS affiliates  WCIATV in Champaign Il linois and WMBDTV in Peoria  refused to put the twopart show on the air the first time any CBS sta tion had refused to run an episode of a continuing se ries WJBK in Detroit orig inally refused to show the first episode and then changed its mind after the Detroit Free Press and The New York Times made in quiries about that decision While switchboards at WCBSTV in New York were flooded with 373 angry tele phone calls and 10 favor able ones the National Or ganization for Women filed a classaction suit demand ing that the Champaign sta tion show the canceled ep isodes and Norman Lear creator of both Maude and All in the Family received a dozen glossy photographs We dont think abortion is a proper subject for treat ment in a frivolous way in a comedy program said James Fielding manager of the Champaign station Do you really think abor tion is a fit subject for laughter asked the more printable of several hundred letters sent to Norman Lear and CBS Like Norman Lear I think abortion is an eminently proper subject for laughter despite the fact that I can barely imagine circumstances in which I would be will ing to have an abortion I must also guiltily admit I would probably welcome the prospect of being pregnant at the age of 47 My fan tasies usually contain six or eight children and yet I think I could manage to laugh were Mr Lear to zero in on the absurdity of ladies whose life is a constant craving for babies The extraordinary suc cess of all three of Lears shows  All in the Fam ily Maude and San ford and Son  comes in part I think from the fact that all three more or less deal with the impolite sub jects that haunt us including illness aging the abrasive ness of private relationships and death Before All in the Family television comedy was a vast playground for witches Martians and crazy ladies who constantly dressed in disguises or mistook their husbands boss for the milk man Relationships were re lentlessly stapled together out of cardboard and then wrapped in cellophane with professionallooking bows The few nonplastic situation comedies were gentle and relatively melodramatic and contained no meanness All in the Family was in one sense a way of pick ing ones nose in public It provided a certain catharsis in the knowledge that the things we did or thought or felt in private were not foreign country Ethels men opause Mikes impotence Glorias miscarriage the death of a cousin in the Bunk ers upstairs bedroom and Archies subsequent rage at being pressured into paying the funeral expenses were not only fit but elegant sub jects for laughter One of the funniest of last years All in the Family shows centered around Archies diarrheaa fact that left my 9 and 10 yearold sons who had been asking for years Dont people in movies ever have to go to the bathroom ex tremely grateful and relieved Those two subversive Maude shows in which Maude decided to have an abortion and Walter decided not to have a vasectomy also contained dialogue about birth control The gismo Why werent you using the gismo I was It didnt work Suicide Im just figuring how many yards of tubing itll take from the exhaust pipe to the rear window on 69 Corvair Toilet training I live in a house where an uncle is about to inherit his nephews pottyseat Perversion Do you know what it means to be poor and pregnant Twice a week I had to go to the laundromat I hated that place It was full of perverts They used to love to sit in front of the machines and watch nylon panties go around and around Sexual embarrassment The next thing I knew I was in the hospital where a nurse handed me a brown paper bag and told me to deposit my undergarments Then she just stood there while I slowly died of em barrassment You see Carol I had run out of underwear and was wearing your fa thers boxer shorts And the lasting effects iof idistorted ipsychosexual de velopment I still line the seats in public restrooms My mother spent half her life telling me what I could get if I didnt We had the same mother Walter You know what I do I flush with my foot The day before Norman Lear taped the first of the two abortion episodes CBS refused to pay for it The network suggested that the show be postponed During the showdown that occurred by telephone between Holly wood and New York Lear made it clear that if the va sectomyabortion segments of Maude were not filmed and aired then the network would have to get itself some other show to fill Maudes 8 PM Tuesday spot on the CBS schedule It is not that Norman Lear is altruistic He has no par ticular desire to lose his swimming pool his threecar garage the mountainous leatherandchrome chairs in his Emmystudded office or his butler He simply did not feel he was taking a risk with his series even though not only the network but most of his own staff told him that he could not allow the leading character in a continuing series to have an abortion unless he wished to throw the 11thranked series on television down the drain Lear says It isnt that wouldnt have taken a chance if I thought it was a chance but I think people even in their angerenjoy being involved enjoy having their emotions stirred The figures so far bear Lear out The first Maude abortion episodeaired on Nov 16got a 4648 per cent share of the New YorkLos Angeles television audience and jumped from 11th place to 6th place in the Nielsen national ratings The second episode on Nov 23 got ap proximately a 44 per cent share of New York and Los Angeles even though its op position was West Side Story Up until that point Maudes audience share in the two cities had been about 38 per cent Lear insists that if Maudes abortion was not altruistic neither was it cal culated as a way of raising the ratings on the series My fight is to get a funny script on a subject that is adult and meaningful I enjoy stirring feelings even nega tive feelings because I think that is what theater is about Its marvelous to know you have engaged the feelings of millions of people  In one breath he moves from his obviously whole hearted pleasure in forcing open bathroom windows for several million Americans to an ingenuous I was just putting on a funny show He adds the ends of his toothbrush mustache wrig gling A little Although Im not dumb enough not to real ize it was on a sensitive subject In order to let the audience come upon his sensitive subject unaware Lear did ask TV Guide and major newspaper weekly television supplements to withhold the idea of abor tion and mention only Maudes pregnancy in their capsule synopsis of the first show What Lear does not add is that for the last year andahalf he appears to have been publicly working out his own unacknowleged ambivalence about the posi tion and role of women through many of the themes he has chosen for All in the Family and Maude Maudes abortion began accidentally Ideas run in waves Last year after eight writers came to All in the Family with plots concerning burial I thought If theres so much death in the air lets have a death right on the show And the whole story came together in five minutes This year half a dozen writers came in with latelife pregnancy ideas but always for a character other than Maude Writers were probably prodded to look into the areas of vasec tomy and abortion by a 5000 prize offered by Popu lation Institute for the best 30minute script on popula tion control produced on primetime television between September 1972 and June 1973 In the first draft of the script it was Maudes best friend who had the pregnancy and the abortion and the friends unseen hus band who thought about a vasectomy But that script although relatively safe was also dead I realized the only way to engage the audi ences interest was to let Maude get pregnant says Lear That decision may still hurt the show although Lears mail is now running 6 to 1 in favor of the two episodes It is not a question that can really be answered until Nielsen fishes in mid American waters throughout the winter months But Nor man Lear doesnt totally care Richard Levinson who co wrote and produced That Certain Summer a sensitive and moving exploration of the relationship between a homosexual father and his adolescent son said that our show about homosexuality on All in the Family was a groundbreaker for everybody that it was what allowed other people to explore that subject And I saw Patton on television the other night When George Scott said Were going to go through that field like crap through a goose I knew that line couldnt have been wouldnt have been on television be fore All in the Family Lear is of course correct The honorable vulgarity of All in the Family has opened the door to Maudes abortion If were lucky its a door that will never shut properly again
Double troubles of Northern Ireland— A visit with the Protestant militants,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/10/archives/double-troubles-of-northern-ireland-a-visit-with-the-protestant.html,BELFAST The Shankill Road runs downhill for a mile or so toward the harbor through the Protes tant workingclass district to which it gives its name It is a drab thoroughfare of two and three story buildings occupied by small shopsbutchers bakers drapers news agents ironmongers There are bars on the corners and gaunt gray churches that somehow suggest unanswered perhaps un asked prayers every three or four blocks At the lower end stand factories many of them long abandoned The streets that cross and parallel the Shankill Road are lined with rows of identical peakroofed twostory brick houses They were built by the tens of thousands in Belfast in the last third of the 19th century for the workers in the shipyards foundries and linen mills These tiny dwellings are called terrace houses a term that mocks them with a Regency glow of elegance They are gradu ally being replaced around the city by publichous ing projects but in the Shankill their ranks re main unbroken At the corner of Wilton Street near the center of the district stands the public house called the Bricklayers Arms Its woodwork is peeling and its sign is gangrened with rust The frosted and curli cued windows are flyspecked and covered with steel mesh Empty 50gallon drums are spaced along the curb in front of it to prevent the park ing of a car that might turn out to have 200 pounds of explosives and a time fuse in the trunk As my taxi stopped there to let me out three men who had been standing near the doorway of the pub quickly stepped across the sidewalk With their hands sunk in the pockets of their raincoats blocking my path they looked at me inquiringly The cab having scarcely stopped sped away The driver was a Catholic who could not be persuaded to wait for me in enemy territory Four years of increasing violence in Northern Ireland which has claimed at least 650 lives more than twothirds of them this year and caused tens of millions of dollars of property damage have trans formed the province into thousands of armed camps Schools stores churches outlying villages square blocks of the commercial sections of the cities whole neighborhoods are barricaded and guarded by British troops the police and the resi dents themselves Of all these none is more vigi lantly patrolled than the Shankill and the Brick layers Arms which is the headquarters of Com pany C of the Ulster Defense Association The association with a claimed membership of 60000 is the largest of several semisecret para military organizations that have been formed by the Protestants of Northern Ireland in the past year or two ostensibly as a means of protecting themselves against the gunmen and bombers of the Irish Republican Army IRA All of them have been growing rapidly since March when Britain suspended the Northern Ireland Parliament for a year and took over direct rule of the province Many Protestants interpreted this development as a final perhaps fatal act of appeasement of the terrorists and the Catholic minority and as an un mistakable sign that the day was fast approaching when they would be forced to kneel and kiss the ringed clawlike fingers of the Catholic hierarchs who run the Dublin Government Such fears although they may seem either merely silly or dangerously paranoid to the visitor are real indeed to the Protestants of Northern Ire land Although they comprise about twothirds of the provinces population of 15 million they with the 150000 Protestants in the Irish Republics pop ulation of 3 million would form less than one third of the population of a united Ireland This sense of being at the same time a majority and a minority is particularly strong in the Shan kill In Belfast as a whole the Catholics who total only about 30 per cent of the population of 415 000 are on the defensive but most of the citys Protestants live in East Belfast on the other side of the Lagan River The Shankills 30000 inhabi tants are flanked by tough Catholic districtsthe Falls on one side and the Ardoyne and Andersons town on the otherthat are base areas and recruit ing centers for the IRA Ever since the first Catholic civilrights demon stration in Londonderry in October 1968 there Territorial imperattves At left a show of force in the Shankin district of Belfast last October by Protestant defense forces a good many wearing face masks Theyre the civil servants who dont want their wives or bosses to know what theyre doing says a Catholic journalist Above John Spence a security officer for the Ulster Defense Association which claims 60000 members at a pub in the Shankill where he talked with the author has been a tendency in the world press to dismiss Northern Irelands socalled militant Protestants as bullies and bigots personified by the likes of the Rev Ian Paisley whose instructions from God are to cherish what he calls a perfect hate of Roman Catholicism I had come to Belfast to look into the rapid growth of this form of social pathology and had arranged with the leadership of the UDA to talk to someone who could be regarded as a typical member of Company C John Spence the security officer It was Spences name that I spoke to the three men on the sidewalk One of them entered the pub reappeared in a moment and beckoned me inside Thats Johnny Spence he said pointing out a stocky man at the bar Hes been expecting you I walked over and introduced myself Spence gazed at me silently His eyes were gray and deepset mouth tight chin square with a bit of a cleft I did my best to return his stare unflinchingly in Protestant manner I could claim as a birthright being an article of faith among Ulster Protestants as I already knew that Catholics are shiftyeyed besides being immoral intemperate undependable and unclean It was about 6 PM and the bar was crowded with men who had stopped in for the ritual pint or two on their way home from work Despite all the trouble factories continue to operate normally for the most part and strikes are almost unheard of In fact the Protestants boast that production is going up all the time as if to prove that the time they spend on their ancient quarrel isnt stolen from their bosses It is a good example of the Protestant ethic in action The 40 or 50 customers seamyfaced stubbly snaggletoothed most of them between 30 and 60 years old at a guess sat on swaybacked wooden chairs upended crates and benches set against the wall holding their pints of Guinness ale lager or whatever in big chapped brokennailed hands Many of them wore the frayed and greasy tweed caps that are still the most distinctive emblem of the working class in Britain Spence ordered a vodka and bitter lemon and in true ScotchIrish fashion a few syllables at a time the information being no more difficult to extract than an impacted wisdom tooth told me a little about himself The words came harsh as well as hard in the jagged accents of his city rough ened by coal dust and iron filings It is far closer to the dialect of the Gorbals of Glasgow or the Merseyside slums of Liverpool across the Irish Sea than to the hypnotic caress of images easily summoned to the tongue the bardic cadences the harps and flutes of the dreamridden south He was born he said 49 years ago in East Bel fast where his father worked at the Harland  Wolff shipyard which with close to 10000 em ployes is still Northern Irelands largest business He had left school at 14 which is still the age at which formal education ends for the children of the working class Protestant or Catholic Belfast men have always followed the sea and the next year which happened to be 1939 he enlisted for 12 years in the Royal Navy During World War II he said he had served as a gunners mate on ships rang ing from submarines to aircraft carriers and from the Mediterranean to the far Pacific Mixed in with other Britons in a ships crew Ulster Protestants and Catholics usually get along well together even forming hometown alliances against brawlers from other cities Given the fact that Catholic and Protestant youngsters in Belfast go to separate schools live in segregated districts and sel dom even compete against one another in sports it isnt easy to break down old suspi cions but I half  believed Spence when he said earnest ly Some of the best friends I ever had were Catholics Ive fought with them sailed with them slept in their homes If it werent for the IRA and the Communists and their priests they would most of them be fine peo ple On the other hand I never found out who these friends were Spence told me that he had been married in 1945he and his wife had three children and that when his enlistment ran out in 1951 he had trans ferred to the merchant ma rine In 1969 when he de cided to come ashore he was a third officer on a tanker making in his words good money 140 [about 350] a month He looked down at the bar I had one inten tion in mind he said To fight for Ulster to defend our heritagewhat all those who have gone before us have fought for We wont be pushed out and if need be well die so we can stay under the Union Jack He enlisted as a private in the Shankill Defense Associa tion one of the local organi zations that were eventually amalgamated into the UDA and since then he has been in his words fiddling from job to job as a barman in a pub fitter in a factory and the like to keep going economically Spence looked at his watch and invited me to take a walk around the neighborhood with him By then darkness had fallen the shops were closed and the Shankill Road was deserted Home  bound auto mobiles hurried past followed by an armored jeep with a British soldier in a red beret leaning against a guard rail at the back and holding his rifle across his chest and then a sixwheeled armored car Papers blew in the gut ter The heavy astringent odor of softcoal fires hung in the damp air This is the one Protestant section of Belfast that the Catholics have never pene trated Spence said If the Shankill goes then Ulster goes The intensity in Spences voice summons up visions of humanwave attacks by froth ing Catholics suddenly more numerous than the Chinese led by implacable Jesuits and Dominicans carrying the gold andwhite banner of the pap acy Such rhetorical excess is the essence of what has come to be called in Ulster the siege mentality The Cath olics have their own version in which a diffident subaltern in the Greenjackets is trans formed into Cromwells most savage Roundhead at the Drogheda massacre We started down Wilton Street and I noticed that most of the street lights were out Aye said Spence our lads do it We dont want snipers shooting out of the darkness at us At the end of Wilton Street a youth slid out of a door way He and Spence spoke in whispers for a moment It was one of his lookouts We turned right on Ashmore Street which runs parallel to the Shankill Road The terrace houses on the far side of the street had been emptied and their windows and doorways bricked up The intersecting streets had been blocked with 10foot barriers of corrugated iron to block a snipers view On the other side were Cupar and Bombay Streets where Protestant mobs ran wild in August 1969 driving Catho lics from the fringes of the Shankill back into the Falls and burning hundreds of homes In the absolute stillness our footsteps echoed alarm ingly Shadows thickened by the gathering mist off the harbor seemed to leap out at us We heard the thick blurred stream of shots of an automatic weapon Thomp son gun said Spence That would be the IRA over the Falls It was followed by a volley of single shots Thats the troops firing back he said At Canmore Street which was open down into the Falls the British Army had built an observation tower heavily sandbagged and hung with steel netting to stop grenades into the corner house Spence stepped into the full glare of the searchlight waved his hand and walked on Else where in Belfast that night a bar would be blown up two men would be found mur dered there would be beat ings and arrests but the Shankill was quiet  Until a few months ago the UDA wrapped itself in secrecy Its leaders remained anonymous many of its mem bers wore dark glasses or masks when they paraded The effect might have been sinister except for the fact that the Catholics who come close to having a monopoly on Ulsters sense of humor laughed rather than shud dered Its the wee fellows who wear the masks if youve no ticed a Catholic journalist told me Theyre the civil servants who dont want their wives or bosses to know what theyre doing Not being taken seriously is a terrible blow to anyones selfesteem especially when you are as solemn as an Ul ster Protestant working him self up for a fine fight in a righteous cause This was the main reason I think why the head of the UDA a glazier named James Anderson and his two assistants Tommy Herron and Sammy Doyle agreed to talk to me They were all Belfast work ing men 10 to 15 years young er than Spence but no more articulate Herron the spokes man of the organization was particularly difficult to under stand The organization was formed the previous year they told me when the lead ers of several local defense or vigilante groups got together to coordinate their tactics A council was elected which in turn had chosen the officers There were 13 com panies in Belfast the center of the UDAs strength and others throughout Northern Ireland they said Most of them had a cadre of exserv icemen and both Anderson and Herron said they had served in the British Army All members took an oath which was secret carried on covert training including handto hand combat guerrilla tactics and marksmanship and at tended at least one meeting week They all fell silent again when I asked if these skills were ever used in shall we say offensive operations against the IRA Herron finally replied Well if it was a case of a known IRA gun man we would take action against him but Im not say ing that weve done that But weve got the weapons and the people if it becomes necessary Beyond that Anderson and his aides had trouble in spell ing out the objectives of the organization They wanted it seemed to me the restoration of the Northern Ireland Par liament with its powers unim paired At the same time they wanted to break up the Union ist party which had con trolled Ulster politics on be half of the Protestant squire archy and business interests since partition in 1922 There is a hint of still unfocused workingclass consciousness in the UDA that the estab lished political powers find disturbing They no longer have a mandate from the people Herron said about the Union ist politicians with their con tinuous changing of policies and giving concession after concession appeasement after appeasement to the terror ists Were a pressure group not a political party Doyle who used to be active in the Labor party and comes as close as anyone in the organization to being politically sophisticated said For this reason he went on they had become loosely associated with but not a part of a frankly rightwing Prot estant political movement called the Ulster Vanguard which is headed by William Craig who was dismissed as Minister of Home Affairs in the Northern Ireland Govern ment in December 1968 be cause of his opposition to granting even the most mod est demands for reform by the civilrights movement We want to preserve a British Ulster said Doyle Thats what its all about But if we cant have that then well fight to keep our free dom from the Republic even if it means declaring our in dependence Our uniforms and marching and training and all that theyre not meant to scare the Catholicsa point I had mentionedbut to im press the British Government that we mean what we say I had supposed that the fighting in Northern Ireland was the only example of strife in the world for which the blame could not one way or another be put on the United States but I was wrong UDA leaders and other militant Protestants think that Washington betrays its proCatholic sympathies by not clamping down more firm ly on IRA fundraising and weaponsbuying in the United States They are also disap pointed by the fact that their own cause finds so little sup port among American Protes tants particularly those of ScotchIrish descent The rea son it struck me is that al most all of this group are old stock Americans with few if any family ties to their home land while Irish Catholics rep resent a later wave of im migration A few days later on a Sun day I went back to see John Spence I found him at home his feet propped up on the coffee table in his tiny living room reading The News of the World one of Britains most popular anthologies of the previous weeks sexual ac tivity real or imagined among the famous and obscure Aside from The News of the World Belfast celebrates the Calvinist Sunday Pubs movie houses and dance halls are closed Many Protestants prove they are twice as vir tuous as Catholics who fulfill their religious obligations by attending mass by going to both morning and evening services Nor do the Protes tants attend sports events on the Lords Daythe soccer league plays on Saturdays while the Catholics feel free to turn out for Gaelic football and hurley matches Besides not living together or going to the same schools the Catho lics and Protestants of North ern Ireland dont even play the same sports Spence and his family it turned out hadnt gone to church in fact they dont go very often It isnt the church I was brought up in anymore he said gloomily speaking of the Church of Ireland which is the Irish branch of the estab lished Anglican Church As I see it its leaning towards Rome Its been going on a long time My wife agrees with me and we sent our three youngsters to the Presbyterian Church instead Two of the three Spence children Bill who is 22 years old and a sheetmetal worker and Agnes who is 14 and thinks she will become a hairdresser after he leaves school next year are still liv ing at home The oldest a daughter is married Mrs Spence a slender sharpfaced woman and Agnes who looks like her emerged from the kitchen with tea and biscuits Agnes began to polish the brass and copper pots that were placed decoratively on a table in front of the window The room which is 12 feet inches by 12 feet was im maculate The furniture which was modest departmentstore grade covered in nubby sal moncolored fabric looked al most new It was set off by a busy floral carpet that re verberated against the trellis androses pattern of the wall paper The smoky old fire place had been replaced by glowing electric grill On a table to one side were dis played son Bills trophies for soccer and darts In a corner by the window stood the tele vision set The kitchen where the fam ily also washes is the only other room on the first floor The toilet is outdoors in the corner of the small back yard It is not a countrystyle privy however since it has a flush mechanism and is hooked up to a sewerage line Upstairs there are three bedrooms and above them a small garret The house might seem claus trophobically small to an American family accustomed to an eight or tenroom sub urban house or a roomy city apartment but it must be about the same size in square footage as a New York tene ment flat and struck me as a good deal pleasanter with far more light and air In any event it is all John Spence has ever known He was born in a nearly identical house and has called this one home since his marriage I congratulated Mrs Spence on the furnishings and sug gested half in jest that she probably felt a compulsion to eliminate every last grain of dust to help prove the case that Protestants were tidier than Catholics Its true said Spence as his wife nodded Theyre dirty right enough Take the Ballymurphy housing estate When it was built it was beautiful beautifully laid out with gardens front and back bathrooms anyone wouldve been proud of Within a year it was a slum The Catholics used the bathrooms to store coal in The postmen would come back here to the Shan kill sick to their stomachs be cause of the human dirt in the halls They even used the wooden fences around the lawns for firewood Protestants never tire of talking about Ballymurphy which in fact seems to have collected most of the socio pathic Catholic families in Bel fast but they seldom mention the many housing projects oc cupied by Catholics or the few still shared by Catholics and Protestants where there is lit tle to criticize But for all that a couple of members of the social sciences faculty at Queens University here whose names I omit to save them from the possible incon venience of having their homes blown up said that there appeared to be certain noticeable differences between the two groups Neatness probably doesnt count as much with Catho lics one of them said Its a freer more spontaneous way of life On the other hand ordinary criminality is prob ably more prevalent propor tionately among Catholics They tend to excuse them selves by saying they didnt make the laws There may even be something to that ideathat Catholics are shifty eyed People who have grown up in what they think of as hostile environment may well be shy of making eyecontact with strangers But what about their sense of rhythm I asked Well I do think Catholics do more dancing than the Prot estants he replied Thinking along the same lines I asked the Spences what they would do if Agnes said she planned to marry a Catholic I wouldnt try to stop her Spence said leaving me unconvinced but I wouldnt like it Were there many mixed marriages in the Shankill A few Mrs Spence said making it plain that it was a disagreeable subject but they almost always move away to England or America or Aus tralia They wouldnt be com fortable here and I dont think theyd be any better off in Catholic district Had the Spences ever been in a Catholic church No said Mrs Spence They dont come to ours and we dont go to theirs Some times you might be invited to a wedding reception after wards If someone died that you knew quite well you would go to the wake or to the grave They wouldnt ex pect you to go to the church Didnt the Catholics get any credit I asked for all the changes that had been made in the past 15 years many of which had been directed at areas like authoritarianism secrecy the power of the Curia the Latin mass that Protestants had found most objectionable Thats true enough said Spence but it doesnt apply in Ireland The Catholics here are still living in the Middle Ages Ill give you an example The Catholic Church doesnt demand a pledge anymore that the children in a mixed marriage will be brought up as Catholics Its never been announced in Ireland Or what about the priests who tell par ents they cant take com munion if they send their chil dren to the public schools At bottom religious and political ideas are inextricably tangled in Northern Ireland Protestants call themselves Loyalists meaning that they wish to keep the British tie and the two terms are for all practical purposes inter changeable as are Catholics and Republicans although it is likely that a significant per centage of Catholics would prefer not to join the Irish Republic until its living stan dards and most important welfarestate benefits come a lot closer to matching those of Great Britain The very name of the place is loaded with implications To the Protestants it is al most invariably Ulster and to the Catholics the six coun ties This serves as a remind er that it comprises only two thirds of the original nine counties of Ulster which is one of the four provinces into which the whole island has been divided since the Middle Ages The Catholics claim theyre discriminated against in hous ing said Spence going back to a subject that was still bothering him but look at the houses that the Protes tants are living in here in the Shankill and over in East Bel fast Theres been more hous ing built for Catholics in Bel fast since the war than for Protestants To my surprise I must say I later found out that Spence may well have been correct Although there had been gross discrimination against Catho lics in providing new housing in Londonderry Armagh and other places this abuse was not practiced in Belfast and although such records are not kept on the basis of religion there was general agreement among knowledgeable people that the Catholics here had received their share of new accommodations and perhaps a bit more Protestants love to parade not only on July 12 which is celebrated as the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 when William of Orange drove James II from the field but on countless other occa sions Such marches usually demonstrate the territorial im perative among other things and the purpose seems to be to encroach on Catholic ter ritory enough to stimulate a good brawl The first sectarian riots recorded in Belfast in 1835 began with a march and there have been countless others since As it happened there was a grand cavalcade of militant Protestants while I was in Belfast and on the day it took place I went back to Wilton Street to watch Company C form up They were there in their hundreds filling the streets wearing bush jackets trousers and Afrika Korps caps of camouflage cloth staring straight ahead under the tight command of their of ficers A good many of them were still wearing cloth masks across the lower half of their faces which made them look as though they were suffering from some disfiguring disease or were like the Japanese trying to avoid catching the flu Spence wearing the three pips of his rank on his epau lets and with a smart black kerchief tied around his neck stood near the pub entrance No Im not marching he said as his comrades stepped off to the squeal of the fifes and the beat of the drums of an Orange Lodge band Ive got to attend to security here A couple of women in the throngs that lined the Shan kill Road caught me in con versation Preserving my neu trality I said it was a beauti ful day which it was It never rains on a Protestant parade one replied I looked for the smile but there wasnt one With the British Govern ment in full control the par ade route out to the provincial Parliament building at Stor mont five miles from the city center had been drawn through Protestant or neutral ly commercial areas At only one place would the marchers touch the fringes of the Falls and there I saw as I tagged along hundreds of troops and police lined up almost shoul der to shoulder It seemed to me that the marchers looked rather sheepish as they passed under the gaze of the genuine ly toughlooking Royal Marine Commandos and members of the Parachute Regiment By the time the marchers got out to StormontI took a taxi out and was there when they began to arrivethey must have numbered 20000 UDA Orange Volunteers Loyalist Defense Volunteers former BSpecials Taken in the mass in their uniforms waving their flags beating their drums pushing people out of the way as they swung by I decided they were rather sinister and for people who never tired of waving the Union Jack crashingly un British  Seated in the places of honor atop a long flight of steps at the columned white Parliament building was the rath er thin cream of militant Protestant ism There was Lord Brookeborough who served as Prime Minister from 1943 to 1963 a period in which Catholics knew their place Craig the Vanguard chieftain whose drinking problem is about the only aspect of his character that Catholics find appealinghe lost his drivers license for drunken driving a week or so after the march Jim Anderson in uniform wearing the insignia of a major general and the Rev W Martin Smyth a grim Presby terian cleric who is the grand master of the Orange Lodge of Belfast Craig a beefy man with thinning blond hair and rather closeset eyes took the harshest line of all the speak ers Today we are knocking at the door asking for our rights he de clared in a bullying tone One day if theres no other way of getting our rights well storm this door and estab lish a Government that governs with the consent of the people A notable absentee was Paisley His career as a baiter of Catholics begun in 1964 when he was an obscure evangelist operating out of the equiv alent of a storefront church has paid off handsomely another proof perhaps of the Calvinist dictum that virtue and world ly success go hand in hand He was now the proprietor of a handsome new church in a pleasant section of Belfast far removed from the fight ing the guru of the rapidly growing sect of Free Presby terians and a member of both the Stormont and Westmin ster Parliaments I had seen him in his pulpit looking opulently episcopal in a fine black broadcloth coat that reached his knees and immaculate clerical linen He is a tall man but somewhat stooped and his fleshy ruddy facein appearance and speaking style he suggests a combination of the least in hibited moments of George C Scott and a younger Lee J Cobbglows with certainty and selfsatisfaction The Sun day I caught his act he seemed a bit subdued limiting himself to a routine excoriation of the Catholic Church as the whore of Rome and neglecting to call the Pope Old Redshoes a turn of phrase that brings his congregation to its feet shouting Amen But only after considerable argumentation with his secre taries did I arrange for a brief telephone interview It all tended to bear out what I had heardthat Paisley since he had begun treading the corri dors of parliamentary power in London was taking himself pretty seriously as a states man and now wanted North ern Irelands Parliament abol ished to tighten the British link When I finally got through to him I mentioned that his absence had been noted and his name roundly booed at the rally I could see him shrug ging his shoulders It was not really a united Loyalist rally he said but a call for a re turn of the Stormont Parlia ment which I oppose Just as I oppose the Vanguards talk of a unilateral declaration of independence By midOctober there was a growing fear among Prot estants that the tide was flowing to the IRA and that civil war might be only weeks away For one thing hundreds of the suspects who had been interned since Au gust 1971 were gradually being released and many of them were unquestionably taking up arms again More over contrary to Protestant wishes William Whitelaw the chief executive of direct rule had scheduled elections for the 26 local government coun cils prior to the planned pleb iscite on the future of North ern Ireland He had also or dered the balloting to be con ducted by proportional repre sentation to insure the fullest possible Catholic representa tion Beyond that the Protes tants were gradually becom ing aware of the fact that the rest of the United Kingdom was growing bored impa tient and even outraged at the cost in lives of the protracted conflictabout 170 British troops and 30 police have been killed so farand the apparent refusal of both sides to accept any reasonable solu tion For this British public opinion seemed to put most of the blame on the Protestant bloodymindedness As tempers shortened there were clashes between UDA patrols and British troops in which a couple of Protestants were killed and the UDA be gan to boast about its cross border raids into the Irish Re public to blow up IRA head quarters and arms depots Tommy Herron bitterly an nounced that his organization was withdrawing its support from the British forces and William Craig in London shouted that he was ready to kill for Ulster Then on Oct 30 the British Government made public its longawaited green paper containing the outline of its plan for a resolution of the conflict I had been given a sketch of some of its provi sions in London prior to its release and it struck me as an extremely sensible docu ment First it tranquilized Protes tant fears by stating un equivocally that Northern Ireland must and will remain part of the United Kingdom for as long as that is the wish of the majority of the people Although the Catholics birth rate is somewhat higher than that of the Protestants so is their rate of emigration and if present trends continue they cannot possibly outnum ber Protestants according to statistical opinion until at least the year 2050 On the other hand the doc ument pleased the Catho lics by saying that the Stor mont Parliament which would almost inevitably continue to have a heavy Protestant ma jority would have its powers notably over police and in ternal security sharply re duced and that it and other political bodies would have to guarantee absolute fairness for all And it recognized at least in principle the fact that Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic shared the same small island and had prob lems in common that were not shared by the rest of the United Kingdom Whatever arrangements are made for the future administration of Northern Ireland must take account of the provinces rela tionship with the Republic it stated and to the extent that this is done there is an obligation on the Republic to reciprocate The hardliners on both sides continued to grumble but the green paper had un questionably achieved its ma jor objective which was to please more people on both sides than it displeased and to help to isolate the extrem ists from the main body of public opinion In midNovember Prime Minister Edward Heath visit ing Northern Ireland warned Craig and the Vanguard that any attempt at a unilateral declaration of independence in the manner of Rhodesia which they were muttering about would lead Britain to cut off 500million in annual subsidies to the province For the ScotchIrish it was a more fearsome threat than the atom bomb Late in the month Sean MacStiofain chief of staff of the Provisional or bomb throwing wing of the IRA was arrested in Dublin and sentenced to six months in jail for membership in the organization which is as il legal in the Republic as it is in the north MacStiofain had made the mistake of talking about his activities in a tele vision interview A few days later the Government of Prime Minister Jack Lynch in troduced a bill in the Irish Parliament that would make it far easier to jail members of the organization even if they did not appear on television Official sources denied there was any connection but many observers could not help but relate this new attitude of the Irish Government which had previously allowed the IRA Provos freedom of movement to mount raids into the north both with the is suance of the green paper and conferences that Lynch had had a few weeks earlier with Heath In any event despite IRA rocket attacks in Northern Ireland there seem ed to be a growing feel ing that the worst of the troubles in Northern Ireland might be nearly over I went to Belfast with my suitcase full of assumptions about the conflict the most important of these being as I have already suggested that the Protestants were the vil lains and the Catholics all of them playing parts written by Sean OCasey the heroes By the time I left I cant say that had become particularly fond of any of the militant Protestants I had met but I was somewhat more sym pathetic to their point of view As I saw it the degree of prejudice to which the Catho lics were subjected had been somewhat exaggerated and it seemed to me that they had brought a good deal of it on themselves by pretty much refusing right up to the time of the first civilrights march es to do anything to help themselves The gerrymandering I had heard so much about as a de vice for keeping Catholics from getting their rights turned out to apply only to local elections and not in all districts by any means The districts for the Stormont and Westminster seats had always been laid out by impartial commissions and were gen erally admitted to be fair However many Catholic politi cians because they refused on principle to recognize the legitimacy of the Government of Northern Ireland would not run for office If they did so and were elected they often would not take their seats and present their case It appeared also that while a few Catholic clergymen and prelates glowed with the ecu menical spirit the church in Ireland in general remained one of the most reactionary in the world It dictated a wide range of social legisla tion in the Republiccensor ship birth control abortion and so onappointed the principals of all state schools and showed no signs of want ing to relax its grip What struck me most forci bly was how quickly once the Catholics stopped sulking and started demonstrating most of their grievances were at tended to It wasnt of course that there was a change of heart among the hardline Protestants but rather pres sure from Westminster As a practical matter it made no difference The property qualification for local elections was elimi nated the whole local govern ment system was overhauled the reserve constabulary the hated BSpecials were dis solved a provincewide hous ing authority staffed by neu tral Englishmen was set up to end discrimination in the as signing of public housing an ombudsman was appointed to hear complaints from Catho lics and they were offered Cabinetlevel appointments at Stormont Discrimination in employ ment was a more difficult problem to deal with as Americans should be well aware Protestants by and large had sewed up the jobs in Belfasts traditional indus triesthe shipyards aircraft factories and foundriesand given the fact that employ ment there was steadily con tracting there seemed little that could be done immediate ly However many new enter prises subsidiaries of interna tional corporations had been established in Northern Ire land during the 10 years be fore the outbreak of violence and in them it was generally agreed Catholics were receiv ing their fair share of jobs at all levels of skills The one major error that Britain had made it seemed to me and it was an enormous one was to permit the Stor mont Government to begin in ternment The fact that violent death has increased sharply since then demonstrates pretty clearly that the policy has not worked on even that primary level Beyond that to subject the internees to the psycho logical breakdown techniques that were used even if they fell short of physical torture in the Greek Brazilian and South Vietnamese tradition darkened Britains reputation for justice and decency As the demands for reform were being made and begin ning to be met however members of the lunatic fringe  which is quite a long thick fringe in North ern Irelandgot going and coerced their coreligionists into supporting them Protes tant mobs and assassination gangs cheered on by Paisley and his ilk and often aided by the police began breaking the heads of demon strators The demonstrations were continued after they had served their purpose of at tracting the attention of the world and then the IRA split and the bomb and gun psychopaths of the Provi sional wing went to work not to eliminate discrimination but to seek the hopeless and in the view of most moder ates undesirable goal of immediate unification The pity of it was that nowhere could the great majority of the people of the province who prefer peace to warfare and life to death find men to guide them out of the sectarian and political quick sand They might have been found in London New York Melbourne Toronto or any of the countless cities and towns to which by and large for 300 years and more the most energetic and intelligent in habitants of Ireland north and south Catholic and Protestant have been settling and governing Those who have remained behind even when of unquestioned ability have tended to see themselves as the preservers of ancient customs and grievances the chroniclers of events that might be better forgotten Saddest of all is that this has become a workingmans fight It is their lives that are lost their homes and pubs that are reduced to rubble Go a mile out the Malone Road into the smart suburbs of Belfast and youd never know there was a war on My Catholic taxi driver said it best when he explained why he tried to stay aloof from the fighting The way I look at it he said is that if its not good enough for the middle class its not good enough for me

The World,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/10/archives/a-message-to-the-north-ireland.html,DUBLIN  Thirtyfive years ago Eamon De Valera then Prime Minister and now President of Ireland trans formed what was essentially a secular Constitution into one that specifically assigned a special position to the Roman Catholic Church On Friday Irish voters decided to repeal that pro vision in a referendum designed pri marily for a Protestant audience that lives elsewhere It was a low turnout about 50 per cent of the 17 million eligible to vote But those who went to the polls voted by a margin of almost 85 per cent to make a gesture toward the Northern Ireland Protestant majority in hopes that repeal would ease their fears about reunification some day with this independent republic which is 95 per cent Catholic Leaning against a sink in a voca tional school where clerks were count ing the ballots George Colley Minister of Finance and the Governments director of the referendum explained Its a symbol We dont expect any immediate reactions from the Protes tants But its the first opportunity the people here have had to say whether they have the will for reconciliation Unity is at the end of a long long road but there is no point in starting out unless we have that will The people of this republic have be come increasingly weary of the vio lence in Ulster the British province in the North and in fact had a little themselves a week ago when two car bombs killed two persons and injured more than 120 in downtown Dublin Most realize that unity must come about by peaceful means if it comes at all and that the elusive goal can only be achieved with the consent of the Protestants who make up about two thirds of Ulsters population Accordingly they voted yes here or as one Dubliner put it I voted for the change because it might help bring some peace eventually Theyre not going to be bombed into joining us We have to talk them into it While the Government emphasized the desire to show northern Protes tants that change was possible in the South many Irish had other reasons for their support There is a growing number of liberals here who want re forms in the tight strictures of Irish society whether unification comes about or not The special position provision recognizes the Catholic Church as the guardian of the faith professed by the great majority of the citizens There was talk this weekend about how the vote had cleared the way for more significant steps toward bring ing about social change The first may be to lift the ban on adoptions by mixed marriage partners This could well be followed perhaps in two or three years by the repeal of the pro hibition of the import and sale of con traceptives There is no doubt that something will have to be done about contra ception said one Government official The ban is creating a nation of law breakers You can buy contraceptives under the counter and doctors do pre scribe the pill There is widespread evasion and there seems to be little point to the present system That change will be coming The repeal of the churchs favored status in the Constitution however is expected to have no immediate practi cal effect The mere fact that the Gov ernment would not act until the church seemed ready to accept the change demonstrated that its special position remains very much intact William Cardinal Conway Primate of both parts of Ireland said three years ago that he would not shed a single tear over the repeal of the Con stitutional provision because it confers no legal privilege whatever on the Catholic Church He obviously be lieved too that the spirit of Cathol icism had become so entrenched that politicians were not about to take the occasion to open up Irish society to such proscribed practices as abortion and divorce

parties sup porting repeal plus the additional con stitutional change of lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 the oppo sition seemed muted during the cam paign Although the Catholic hierarchy declined to take a unified stand on the issue many priests told their follow ers that the vote was not a test of faith But Dr Cornelius Lucey the Bishop of Cork and Ross who is some times called the

An innocent defense of power,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/10/archives/power-and-innocence-a-search-for-the-sources-of-violence-by-rollo.html,In this his ninth book his first since the highly popular Love and Will Rollo May has written an apology for power and a critique of innocence By power he means primarily psychological power the ability to assert oneself to exercise influence even to enlarge ones au thority at the expense of others By innocence he understands a failure to acknowledge the reality of power Just as the reasonable assertion of power leads to selffulfillment so the indulgence of innocence leads to vic timization or paradoxically to vio lence In the case of Melvilles Billy Budda central symbol for May innocence encompasses both of these fates Billys childlike unwillingness to recognize the presence of evil in the world results in an outburst of murderous violence and eventually in his own death May illustrates his thesis with cases drawn from his psychiatric prac tice There is for example Merce des a young black woman sexually exploited by her parents whose rage at her own impotence is directed in ward in classic Freudian fashion to destroy the children she bears Before coming for psychiatric treatment she had suffered eight miscarriages or abortions When May succeeded in eliciting an aggressive reaction against her parents whom she im agined opposing her pregnancy be cause it would withdraw her from circulation she managed finally to carry a child to term Most per sons seeking psychiatric help May contends resemble Mercedes they exhibit not too much but rather too little hostility Then there is Oliver an equally passive young man whose resent ment at his powerlessness is inter nalized in the form of epileptic seiz ures At the same time Oliver lives in a sadistic fantasy world of secret omnipotence He believes that his family will be struck down by God unless he observes an elaborate rit ual each morning on rising With Mays assistance Oliver eventually discovers the modest but authentic realm of his authority in the world He obtains a teaching position launches a literary magazine and as a consequence of these successes gradually abandons his private myth ology According to May Olivers error is a common one It consists of bypassing selfaffirmation and moving directly from powerlessness to aggression Mays therapeutic accomplishments would seem to justify his emphasis on the role of power in psychic de velopment Behind him stands the authority of Alfred Adler Harry Stack Sullivan and a generation of ego psychologists including Erik Erikson All of these theorists have disputed Freuds contention that hu man psychology can be reduced to a struggle between love and hate In stead they have stressed the need for mastery the effort to cope with the environment and to make something of oneself May is not satisfied to remain a psychotherapist He aspires to be a social critic as well and much of this book accordingly is devoted to the role of power and violence in re cent American history When applied to domestic politics his psycholog ical categories often yield persua sive results He argues for instance that the violence committed by blacks in the last decade was the inevitable and to a degree legiti mate response to their impotence in American society Hardly an original observation one might counter but nonetheless a valid one He also launches a telling critique of counter cultural innocents such as Charles Reich whose inability to deal with the realities of power leads them to conclude that there are no enemies There are indeed enemies insists May and they are not about to roll over and play dead simply because of the emergence of Consciousness III  When he turns to foreign affairs Mays dialectic of power and inno cence becomes somewhat confused An exact construing of his psycho logical model seems to render a for eign policy distressingly similar to Richard Nixons failure to exercise national power invites aggression and in the long run increased vio lence According to this reasoning surrender to the Communists in Viet nam would only whet their appetite heighten our own sense of frustra tion and lead eventually to World War III Much as May fancies him self a political realist he neverthe less avoids such a formulation In stead he argues that American ag gression in Southeast Asia reflects our false sense of innocence Be cause Americans cant accept the fact of their own power because they think of power only in negative terms they are all the more prone to its ruthless and immoral exercise The Vietnamese are merely the lat est victims of this fatal innocence the American Indians were the first The psychodynamics of Mays ar gument remain obscure and to me unconvincing Is it not equally plaus ible that American aggression reflects not the neglect but precisely the cul tivation of power in the American character It hardly seems likely that a nation of Billy Budds could have wreaked such havoc in the world If our foreign policy is to be ex plained in characterological terms at all we might more reasonably place the blame on Horatio Alger Power and Innocence is writ ten in the tradition of popular psy chology It makes no pretense to the oretical or empirical rigor and it draws on an eclectic variety of sources including the movies pop ular literature mythology individual case histories and a handful of tech nical studies in sociology and psy chology Facile distinctions abound Power we are told comes in five varieties exploitative manipulative competitive nutrient and integra tive and it can also be classified in terms of five phases the power to be selfaffirmation selfassertion aggression and violence There are mercifully only two kinds of inno cence authentic and inauthentic Nei ther this proliferation of categories nor the elaborate subdivision of chapters can disguise the essentially casual character of Mays arguments His natural manner is discursive not systematic The book is also marred by its bloated philosophical language We are not much enlightened when we read that the five phases of power are ontological onesthat is they are part of the human being as hu man Most teachers and students will also be surprised to learn that a good lecture is one that commu nicates being from one person to another Such ponderousness might be tolerated in a Tillich or a Sartre but in these relatively humble sur roundings it seems merely gratui tous Rollo May is obviously a man of good will and at the same time a man anxious to avoid sentimental ity and wishful thinking There are many things to admire in his book not least among them his defense of reasoned discourse Ultimately how ever he leaves one disappointed He has not mustered the intellectual dis cipline necessary for his ambitious subject
Abortion Foes on L. I. Berate Governor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/12/archives/abortion-foes-on-li-berate-governor.html,Governor Rockefeller agreed yesterday to meet soon with opponents of the states abortion law who have repeatedly attacked him in the last month at his Town Hall meetings across the state On one of his meetings in Hauppauge L I the Gov ernor said yesterday he would meet with the repre sentative group of antiabor tion forces to discuss four proposals that had been ad vanced by the Right to Life Committee which has spear headed efforts to repeal the present law John Short of Farmingdale cochairman of the newly formed Positive Alternative Committee of the Right to Life group proposed legisla tion that would provide full Medicaid coverage to all handicapped children regard less of family income and a stateaided afostercare pro gram He also called for pub lic hearings on the question of when human life begins Aides of Mr Rockefeller said that he was willing to discuss the proposals in the hope that the abortion issue would not dominate the com ing session of the Legisla ture as it has recent sessions However there was no in dication that the Governor or the Right to Life Committee was ready to compromise on the basic issue of repeal of the present law which per mits abortions in the first 24 weeks of pregnancy The Governor vetoed a repeal bill at the legislative session earlier this year Asked what he expected the meetings to produce Mr Rockefeller said I dont know they know my posi tion and I know theirs The Governors agreement to meet with the group high lighted the Town Hall meet ing in which he was repeat edly and loudly berated by foes of the abortion law and the proposed Oyster BayRye Bridge across Long Island Sound as well as by homo sexuals demanding changes in the states sex laws and Stony Brook University stu dents attacking the Gover nors handling of the Attica Prison riots last year When the Governor arrived at the Binghamton Airport for his 11th and last Town Hall meeting he found it considerably more orderly than the Long Island session I was getting their point of view  firsthand and forcefully put across Mr Rockefeller said of the meet ing on Long Island The Governor did not es cape completely unscathed at Binghamton State University students there heckled him over Attica and his familys wealth He disclosed in re sponse to a students ques tion that he paid a six figure Federal and state income tax or at least 100000 annually But the abortion issue touched off the most emo tional reactions at both meet ings as groups on both sides of the issue gave their views in formal presentations or more oftenin shouts from the audience The Governor a veteran of such sessions tried to shut off the furor at the Long Is land meeting by calling on an unidentified man who was seeking his attention and was wearing a volunteer firemans badge Instead of talking about volunteer firemen the man shouted that the present abortion law was a ridicule on what we as firemen do and denounced Mr Rockefel lers veto of the bill that would have repealed the lib eralized abortion law Meanwhile a new womens group The Feminist Coalition pledged initially to defend the states abortion law was formed yesterday by three feminist organizations that appealed to Catholic women of courage to join them An Ursuline sister two former nuns and a Roman Catholic layman appeared at the announcement confer ence with representatives of the Manhattan Womens Po litical Caucus the OnetoOne Committee lobbying arm of the New York Chapter of the National Organization for Women and the Radical Feminists Our first job is to make it clear to legislators that reproductive freedom is majority issue even among Catholics said Gloria Stein em editor of Ms magazine who presided at the news conference at the Community Church 40 East 35th Street The coalition will share an Albany office with Citizens for Abortion Rights and Re ligious Liberty This organi zation was formed recently by the New York Civil Liber ties Union and the Clergy Consultation Service an abortion referral agency as a statewide umbrella for grassroots organization and lobbying
New Voice in Debate on Breast Surgery,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/12/archives/new-voice-in-debate-on-breast-surgery.html,Two years ago Mrs Rosa mond Campion found a lump the size of an olive pit in her left breast She entered a Manhattan hospital for a biopsy and the lump was diagnosed as being cancerous In most similar cases a woman in Mrs Campions situation would have awak ened from the anesthesia to find that her breast had been removed in an operation called a mastectomy But Mrs Campion a strong willed 50yearold Manhat tan author refused to sign the necessary papers to al low the surgery Then to the dismay of her surgeon who angrily warned that she would be dead in three weeks Mrs Campion flew to the Cleveland Clinic where only the visible tumor was removed in a highly con troversial operation called a lumpectomy The proce dure is much more common in Europe than it is in the United States Controversy Rages I feel that I and I alone am in charge of my body Mrs Campion said in a re cent interview in her East 36th Street apartment and that neither men nor sur geons nor a 103yearold tradition of removing the entire breast if a lump is cancerous could tell me what to do As a result of a book she has written about her experi ence The Invisible Worm 495 Macmillan Mrs Campion has been caught up in the current medical con troversy over which proce dure for breast cancer is safest and best And she is also part of a larger movement in which more and more women many of them feminists are ques tioning the medical care they are receiving from their doc torsusually male I think what I did was the highest level of womens liberation Mrs Campion said proudly I said No to a group of doctors who told me You must sign this paper you dont have to know what its all about Women are finally beginning to question things like this Although Rosamond Cam pion is a pseudonym the author is not the only woman who in recent months has told of her personal experi ences with breast cancer in the hopes of helping other women Mrs Birch Bayh wife of the Indiana Senator told about her surgery to United Press International last July And last month Shirley Temple Black held two press conferences after she under went a simple mastectomy in a Stanford Calif hospital Dont sit home and dont be afraid the former child star warned Dont let van ity get in your way Its not so bad Simple mastectomy is the removal of the entire breast The rationale behind it is that breast cancer frequent ly arises in more than one spot at the same timeand that all malignant spots may not be apparent at the time of surgery A more extreme operation radical mastectomy involves the removal of the breast and surrounding lymph nodes and major chest muscle The reason for this procedure is that a doctor cant tell for sure whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes unless they are removed and examined by a pathologist Currently in 60 per cent of the women diagnosed as hav ing breast cancer the cancer cells have spread to the lymph nodes Which procedure is the most effective Most doctors admit they dont know The surgeon who performed Mrs Campions lumpectomyDr George Crile Jr who re cently retired from the Cleve land Clinicreported to a meeting of the American Col lege of Surgeons in 1970 that his results with the simple removal of the lump were the same as what other doctors were getting with radical surgerya cure rate of about 70 per cent Critics of Dr Crile say his high success rate with the lumpectomy is because he limits the operation to women with apparently early breast cancer Currently a national study of breast cancer surgery is now being conducted at 31 medical centersbut it is limited to comparing the ef fectiveness of the radical mastectomy to the simple mastectomy plus radiation therapy The chairman of the study Dr Bernard Fisher a surgeon at the University of Pitts burgh said recently We dont presently have suffi cient scientific information to know what is best to do What is known is that cancer of the breast is the leading cause of cancer deaths in women and the leading cause of all deaths in women between the ages of 40 and 44 Experts estimate that about 73000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed next year while 32400 women will die of breast cancer dur ing the year What I hope my book will do is save lives Mrs Cam pion said as she puffed on a cigarette a habit for which she is often criticized these days What Im saying is that if a woman has been hurting for a while [Mrs Bayh had only soreness no lump] or even if a lump looks only like a pimple she must rush to her doctor I dont want to be an evangelist about this thing I realize Im no doctor she added And I know the only reason I was able to have a local excision was because my tumor was small and dis covered early But you know even the most sophisticated and intelligent women are afraid to say I have a lump on my breast They think its going to go away Mrs Campion is a native New Yorker whose career began at the age of 17 when she had a short story pub lished in The New Yorker Since then she has written under various namessix novels one biography and about 50 magazine articles She is married to a Manhat tan lawyer and has two grown sons The 5foot2inch 97pound woman who admits she has always been proud of her 362334 measurements said she had at no time felt that her marriage would suffer if her breast had to be removed But she did briefly consider suicide she said even to the extent of stocking up on sleeping pills To me the breasts yield aesthetic pleasure she said and I think a woman is en titled to as much pleasure in the act of sex as a man is If she thinks a breast is some thing useful or rewarding to her she should be allowed to keep it and not treated like an idiot child who is taken to the principal and told Naughty naughty Underground Is Small She said her only possible symptom before she discov ered the lump was a weight loss from her normal 97 pounds to 85 pounds She re calls telling her gynecologist about the loss and his reply ing Youre the envy of all my patients Mrs Campion said she learned of Dr Crile through an article in McCalls maga zine And then speaking in the secretive tones that wo men used several years ago before abortion became legal she added There is a small under ground of hospitals and sur geons who are willing to do a local excision rather than a radical I know of a surgeon in Staten Island and one in Manhattanand one in Lich field Minn And of course they still do it at the Cleve land Clinic Today nearly two years after her lumpectomy Mrs Campions treatment consists of a weekly selfexamination of her breasts and a visit once every six months to her gynecologist She has never had radia tion therapy although in most cases doctors who per form operations less ex treme than the radical mas tectomy recommend follow up treatment with radiation to kill off any stray cancer cells Most cancer cures are measured by fiveyear survivals Im not worried about getting cancer again she said firmly In fact Im much more scared about get ting mugged in this city

In Search of a Majority,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/14/archives/in-search-of-a-majority.html,Finally in 1972 it has become clear that the 1960s are history rather than present The great pendulum of change and idealism that set in motion the Peace Corps the War on Poverty the peace movement and black power first passed through the political center and is now swinging back There is no question yet of reversing its direc tion first the backward swing must be dampened The crucial question is whether those of us who are  cated to making a better world can break the habit of talking more and more stridently to fewer and fewer disciples and begin to listen with as much love and compassion as we have finally managed for the most dis possessed among us to that great anxious proud insecure relatively af fluent American middle It will not be easy Their claim on our conscience is very faint compared with that of ghetto blacks and Puerto Ricans or the rootless migrants or the Indians exiles in their own land not to mention the starving masses of the Third World or the devasted peas ants of Indochina After all they have jobs almost all of them living wages at least and frequently much more decent homes cars access to medical care and more and more leisure time But they have had to work hard for these rewards and a central tenet of the American ethos has always been that hard work is and should be re warded Now as the average work ingman sees his neighborhood deteri orate his schools lose the quality of sanctuary they once had and his streets become perilous he wonders whether his work has been in vain His doubts are deepened by the burgeon ing welfare rolls and the call for still more generous support for the needy It would be easyand certainly part of the truthto refer to this cluster of fears anxieties insecurities jeal ousies and hostilities as racism All of us incline naturally to blame circum stances and forces outside ourselves to explain our complaints against the world and race is nothing more than a pernicious but very handy device for giving these complaints well defined boundaries and thus apparently mak ing them more manageable Up to a point moral exhortation and the legal process can help to mitigate the im pact of racism It was never enough however and now it is less adequate than it has been in a long time If we agree that poverty and racism are the two most heinous grievances in this country and I think they are then we must devote ourselves to eradicating them As we allow our list of grievances to lengthen to include womens liberation abortion mari juana and acid sexual freedom gay liberation and withdrawal from Viet nam the task of building the majority constituency becomes difficult We must make it possible for those who have been turned off by the forces of change to bite off smaller more digest ible portions of the agenda for change By the same token we must avoid the insidious categorizingakin to racismthat writes off working peo ple as stupid bigoted and jingoistic and rejects often because of nuances of manner demeanor educational background and style potentially con structive and progressive leaders who could be valuable resources for prose lytizing within their own groups There is no doubt that such leaders exist and their almost complete ab sence in those institutions that are the generators of changekey government agencies the universities the media foundations contributes enormously to the tendency to categorize and thus to polarize Those of us who do not comfortably identify ourselves socially or politically as liberals or conservatives have our own agenda to offer It has been slow aborning which is a whole topic by itself and a long way yet from being delineated and articulated The old rubrics of liberal and conservative simply will not suffice The more use ful questions now are which changes can we have an impact on and which must we accept which will we try to slow and which accelerate who among us shall work at creating the future we want who will nurture the past we do not want to lose who will enrich the present

"Feminist Leader Favors Action, Not ‘Nebulous Baloney’",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/17/archives/feminist-leader-favors-action-not-nebulous-baloney.html,MONTCLAIR What feminists are trying to do said Deborah Hart the first state coordinator for the Na tional Organization for Women is to set ourselves simple reasonable goals and then to accomplish them Thats much better than a lot of nebulous baloney The womens Movement has always had two aspects she said in an interview in her office at the Hillside School here The inner things we want to do for ourselves and the attack we want to make on the world But the key to successful feminism today is action A Montclair resident Miss Hart is a reading specialist in the Montclair school sys tem and an active member of the Essex County chapter of NOW She was elected to her new post at a recent meet ing of 150 members of the 13 New Jersey chapters of the feminist organization Miss Harts election reflects a nationwide trend toward more coordination of ac tivities  New Jersey is following the example of six other states  and the growing belief among many NOW members that the em phasis in feminism should now shift from conscious nessraising to action But there isnt the con flict between action and talk that you might think said Miss Hart who is 33 years old Theyre closely con nected Women who join feminist organizations seem to have these two basic needs We want to repair some of the psychological and emotional damage thats been done to us over the years and for that we need sisters But in addition most of us come into the movement angry about something and if were to develop into sane healthy people we have to identify specifically what were angry about and then act in some positive way on the world outside to change those things The areas in which the statewide chapter will be concentrating Miss Hart said will be for the repeal of abortion laws a better under standing of lesbianism the implementation of the equal rights amendment helping women in politics the amendment of state laws regulating the sale of con traceptives to minors im provement of childcare pro grams and for better career education for women Priority Areas Miss Hart is a strong advocate of task forces to deal with specific problems and partly through her efforts the New Jersey chapter is beginning to or ganize in that manner The task force on employment is already functioning she re ported and its one of the most important areas One of Miss Harts earliest introductions to the problems of women came at a meeting of the Administrative Council of the Montclair school system in 1969 She suddenly became aware that every administrator in the system was a man And every subordinate was a woman Miss Hart said And when you think about that  when you realize how many more women there are than men in any school system and then low few of them are ever promoted to administrative jobs  you realize that somethings going on So now something else is going on Miss Hart con tinued Theres a lot of op portunity Committees for all kinds of things get appointed all the time in school systems and now we see to it that women get on these groups in reasonable numbers For instance not long ago a middleschool task force of seven men and two women was appointed by a Montclair principal So we stopped it and called for an election by the faculty The result was six women and three men And its a better group Miss Hart believes that battles like these although small in appearance are im portant for several reasons First of all everybody needs training in leadership she said Men get it all the time and learn Women have to fight for it In the second place we need to concentrate on things we can accomplish Of course we want to change peoples attitudes toward women but thats a job for a generation and besides you cant measure it The things we can accomplish most easily are the things that people would rather give us than fight over That way we can achieve a lot  choose objectives that are big enough to make a dif ference to us but just too small to provoke a fullscale battle Women are learning fast about the nature of the battles they are waging ac cording to Miss Hart Were much more sophisticated than we used to be she said We used to lodge com plaints and expect something to happen No more Theyll tell you anything to get you off their backs So now we stick with it Miss Hart went on to describe her successful ef forts to desegregate the classes in shop and home economics in the Montclair school system Obviously she said girls should have a chance to learn to use tools if they want and boys should have a chance to learn to cook if they want No big deal But of course there was a lot of opposition The shop teachers didnt want girls and the parents of the boys wanted to be sure that the girls didnt do the boys out of shop And the principal talked a lot about scheduling problems Thats one of the things people talk about when they dont want to do something  scheduling problems But we leaned on him and finally ho said hed do it Time went by nothing happened and finally he said he couldnt do it after all So we said wed follow the procedures available to us that kind of segregation was after all illegal All of a sudden we had integrated shop and homeec and the scheduling wasnt such a terrible problem after all The girls are hammering away and the boys are making crepes or whatever And thats one more lesson for us Miss Hart also likes to re call an episode in a swim ming pool in the summer of 1970 I went in without a bathing cap she said and caused all kinds of commotion Women had to wear caps the rule said and men didnt no matter how long their hair was And do you know why They told me the reason was that womens hair was less firmly rooted than mens hair That still makes me laugh I mentioned to them that I knew more bald men than bald women and what about that But they didnt think that was very funny So we went to the Mon mouth County NOW people and the next week a bunch of us went in without caps And then to our amazement so did about a dozen other women wed had never seen before They just gathered round and jumped in with us And that was the end of the bathing cap rule in that pool
Adoption Group Changes Emphasis,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/17/archives/adoption-group-changes-emphasis.html,FARMINGDALE L I  A Long Island group that for years sought homes only for adoptable children is now finding temporary homes for children who would other wise be placed in juvenile detention centers For the last threeanda half years the Open Door Society a group of parents originally dedicated to find ing homes in the New York CityLong Island area for hardtoadopt children has found homes for more than 400 children whom adoption agencies found difficult to place because of race age or physical or mental handi cap But in the last six months the number of children need ing adoptive parents has declined substantially At the same time the members of the society which has head quarters at 1337 Waverly Avenue here have become aware there are children be ing sent to childrens shelters and juvenile detention cen ters because the Family Courts have no other place to put them Now the group is concentrating on finding homes for these children Thus far the society has placed about 30 of these children in homes in the Long Island area Four are with Mrs Susan Wilder muth a housewife in Ocean side who is active in the so cietys campaigns She said the society became aware of the problem of placing ju venile delinquents through the lawyers who represent these children in court pro ceedings It was through them that we came to know that such children were available to our families and the Family Court came to know that there were families who could take these kids she said In the past she said the court sent a child to a juvenile detention center or childrens shelter because the court has no place to put them The children dont fit into any of their agen cies Usually the child is too old for fostercare plans or is unqualified for other reasons The court normally separates the child from his family because of neglect financial insufficiency or abuse The overwhelming major ity of these kids have never broken a law said Samuel Duhlberg a lawyer who often represents these chil dren Most ho added are neglected children or per sons in need of supervision which he said is roughly equivalent to being a way ward minor Such children got that identification for such things at being truant or running away from home he explained Mrs Wildermuth said that most of the societys fam ilies were middle class and were working toward reunit ing the child with his nat ural family Mrs Wildermuth was quick to point out that the Open Door Society still seeks homes for adoptive children especially the hardtoadopt She cited a number of fac tors in the decline of adopt able children including lib eralized abortion laws greater use of birthcontrol pills and a liberalized social attitude that allows unwed mothers to keep their chil dren The important point Id like to stress Mr Duhlberg said is that were it not for these people these 30 or 35 decent kids would be in an institution Of all the kids Ive seen  and Ive seen them all on a personal basis they are all happy Isnt that the way we should judge a program
Drug Program Intended to Save Not One But Two Generations,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/18/archives/drug-program-intended-to-save-not-one-but-two-generations.html,I really didnt want my baby I didnt want to take care of her I used to stay up nights crying I just felt my life had stopped Actually 22yearold Diane McDaniels life as a drug addict with a daily compulsive hunger for heroin did not stop at all for six months after the birth of her daughter Tamiko now 2 I used more drugs then than I had in the previous twoandahalf years I was on drugs Miss McDaniel recalled the other day I would come home at 3 in the morning and my daugh ter would wake up she said If I fed her at all I was so high I would nod out and wake up an hour later when my brother or sister would hear her crying Sometimes I would dip out even if I was alone with her For the last 17 months Miss McDaniel has been learning to he a mother while putting the drugshattered pieces of her soul back to gether in a tightly disciplined and innovative parents pro gram conducted by Odyssey House The venture which it was started in October 1971 in  East 52d Street brownstone and was moved last April to Mabon House a cavernous former hospital on Wards Island donated by the state is a journey into totally un charted waters Projects Goal Considered the first drug program in the country to deal with mothers and in some instances fathers and their children as a single unit its goal is to salvage not one generation but two and in the process to ascer tain whether mothering if it does not come naturally can be taught The current population of one pregnant woman ten mothers one father and twelve children mostly un der 2 is about 50 per cent less than normal The sudden increase in dropouts is at tributed to the Christmas syndrome the desire of the patients to be with their families during the holidays The program which takes 18 to 24 months was born out of Dr Judianne Denson Gerbers observations of the first six mothers to be gradu ated from Odyssey House They got their babies back and we began to think we had made a mistake by get ting the mothers well sep arately from the children said the founder of the psychiatricallyoriented com munity These girls [drug addicts in general] have feelings of inadequacy thats part of the reason they use drugs she said They have severe dam age to their own concepts of themselves as women and then you confront them with having to be a woman in re lationship to somebody who takes all the time and can  give very little back and they just cant cope Then too she continued Many of them never had very much love themselves Its our opinion that in order to he able to give love you must have received it you must know the texture of mutuality Mutuality is the key word at Mahon House First there is the mutuality of the egodemolishing experiences that contribute to drug use then there is the mutuality of the curative process One resident after another told a visitor of having been abandoned by a father mo lested by a foster father beat en by a stepfather rejected by a mother of turning to drugs and then of having to find ways to pay for those drugs Sure I stole beat people [sold them flour instead of narcotics] stuck up people robbed houses prostituted All I could think of was the next shot of dope said Bev erly Pope 17 who was ad mitted to Mabon House on an emergency basis shortly be fore the birth last week of her daughter Monique be cause my mother had put me out As at all branches of Odys sey House the patients pro gress through four levels of increasing privilege and au thority They are responsible for the operation and main tenance of the house In treatment there is the mutuality of unrelenting in teraction in group therapy reprimand confrontation en counter and marathon ses sions The cure is based on selfunderstanding rather than substitute drugs with exceptions made for some pregnant women who are given methadone to protect the fetus from acute with drawal symptoms To an observer the texture of that mutuality is not al ways loving Burst of Anger Im angry at you Geraldine Sheridan exploded suddenly in a fiveminute ex pletiveloaded tirade at an other woman during a class in mothering two such classes are conducted each week I just cant stand seeing your filthy diapers lying around any more You just leave them around full of  and I dont like being set up [to wash the diapers] Youre damn lazy No Im not the accused mother whispered Oh yes you are the assemblage retorted each member citing examples of the womans negligence You may think this is the first time weve told the girls not to let their infants feed themselves not to put a child in a towel instead of a diaper to sterilize the bottles to get up when they hear their babies crying at night Mrs Josette FilsAime the profes sional administrator of treat ment said summarizing a few of the topics that had been discussedand rational izedin the class We have to tell them the same things over again and again Problems have ranged from leaving bibs in the refrigera tor to imperiling the life of a baby the staff has gone to court twice to obtain cus tody of children whose mothers were judged to be homicidal But whatever the manifestations of neglect not one woman has  accepted Mabon Houses offers to ar range an abortion or tempo rary foster care In many cases the baby gives them an instrument with which to get back at society at the father of the child at their own mothers said Dr Antonio Domantay associate director of medical and psychiatric services for all the Odyssey House fa cilities The haltered child syn drome he added is handed down from generation to gen eration In addition the baby is looked on as proof that they are capable of doing something And so it was in a way for collegeeducated Gloria Smith 20 who is uncertain of the identity of her 3 monthold sons father be cause I was prostituting at the time A Game I Played A friend asked me to get pregnant she explained and I said Yeah It was a garrie I played I didnt think I could get pregnant because I hadnt been for three years I figured there was something wrong with me as a woman and that I couldnt provide chidren for a man As Dr DensenGerber sees it childbearing also provides symbolic restitution This is how theyre going to be pure again good again Theres a tremendous drive to purge themselves she said They dont care about what theyre bringing the child into We perceive the child as a person they per ceive it as an object Thy residents assessments of their motives for giving birth are less harshly ana lytic but more touching I was very upset when I learned I was pregnant said Diane Carleton 21 of Fair field Conn who is currently the only white member of the house The racial balance changes almost daily because of new admissions and drop outs I was still in high school I didnt know how to tell my parents or what to do but I wasnt going to give it up I always wanted to have something of my own I could really love she said When Jennifer [now 2] was born I thought Shes mine shes something for me  Except for brief periods spent in prison on charges of possession of narcotics and forgery or in other rehabili tation centers or when she was too drugged to cope Mrs Carleton who has been married twice kept Jennifer I took care of her myself even though I was on heroin and speed she said After all I was always at home and there were always peo ple there [to purchase the drugs she was selling] I made sure she was fed and clothed and I thought I was giving her a lot of attention But she continued when I was Sick I didnt want to be bothered with her so I would yell at her or push her out of the way or stick her in her crib Now Im trying not to let my feel ings come out on her If Im upset I know I shouldnt get mad at her Diane McDaniel has learned that control of her own moods is not enough I started noticing after I came here that I would give Tamiko her bath put her pa jamas on and everything and the whole time I would never say a word to her she said Then she would wake up at night and cry and cry When I put myself out we would have fun and she would sleep all night I guess she had been crying for my atten tion Finances a Problem For Miss McDaniel who is expected to graduate from Mabon House by the summer the prognosis is considered excellent For the program as a whole the future is more tenuous As of now Mabon House is totally dependent on con tributions for everything from money to milk and has at times come close to financial disaster But beyond financial con siderations the staff is not even certain that it is op erating on psychologically valid assumptions I wonder if the entire con cept of mothering as a na tural instinct is off the wall and the supposition that it can be taught is in question We want to see if with prop er input it can Dr Densen Gerber said adding If I had to flip a coin now I would say that it cant This has profound ramifi cations for the entire country If mothering cant be taught youve got to get many children away from their mothers But she mused this doesnt mean that Odyssey House doesnt work Like cancer you dont give up be cause people are dying of it You simply work harder

context are practically gameanalyzable The American ambassador takes a darker view When the CIA man inevitably remarks that you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs the ambassador comes back with a marvelous subtle and succinct comment on our foreign policy Has it never occurred to you he says that omelettes are simply edible abortions and not what eggs are for in the first place Larry Ivansong is an appealing character unwillingly caught in this mesh or mess of intrigue His wife is a pleasant complement to the authors own Chinese wife There is a fine scene in which Larry is to be filmed in bed with a woman in order to be black mailed by the Chinese but he is aware of the plot and arranges for the woman to be his wife in disguise To conceal their dis taste and depersonalize the situation they agree to follow the Kama Sutra instead of their natural impulses in their perform ance But she mistakenly reads a rival Chi nese manual the Ananga Ranga and the resulting pretzel of arms legs and bodies is a puzzle even the Chinese Intelligence cannot untangle Inexhaustible Machiavellianism The United States lands half a battalion of Marinesmany of them longhaired pri vates in

babyfaced pacifist Meanwhile Ivansong and Polak an American television correspondent are trying to interview the Paramahamsa Bonze a false prophet who can read the future clearly in the polished mirror of his own beatitude and who seems to be calling the shots for the rival factions in Mekong The only path to his sanctuary is through Flakey a farout archhipster and pharma cist for all the heads in Mekong He is a counterculture snob and Ivansong and Polak win him over by oneupping him in a superior psychedelic idiom I dont frisk all the kedgeree Wherefore chant like a flamingo I see youre on the swerve okay The ghetto reeks of candy and you got the old roseola on your near fore  so why all the dragoon The book is full of wickedly inspired touches A highranking British official who makes love to his wife only to keep his weight down hangs himself from the beam of a large scale used for the diplo matic bags Informed of the tragedy his wife asks What did the scale register There is a Chinese agent who apostrophizes his favorite cat in convoluted Marxist terms and a Eurasian who transfers his passion from his pet gibbon to a preter naturally longarmed American girl There is a perfect takeoff on those clandestine meetings weve all seen in spy movies In Theater of the Absurd counterpoint Greeen pretends io sell Ivansong a second hand car while giving him his instructions But perhaps the author himself best sums up the plot when he has the bogus prophet confess You can understand the principle that there is an underlying principle to the Cosmos but the trouble is you cant get to see the underlying principle itself

Here's to me and my generation— Mr. Burgess makes a Christmas toast,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/24/archives/heres-to-me-and-my-generation-mr-burgess-makes-a-christmas-toast-a.html,Christmas is traditionally a season for putting off guilt Guilt is in order for nearly all the year but it should start to diminish about St Lucias Day and be thoroughly dissolved in spirits on Christ mas Eve December 26th is the feast of the first Christian martyr Stephen who was stoned to death and guilt canand usually does along with crapulencecome back with a thud on that date But Christmas is all about handing over the burden of collective guilt whose record is what we call history and personal guilt autobiography to an avatar who is well qualified to look after it And so what I write now is not to be read after Christmas Day and perhapsas it represents a kind of giftit should not be opened before Christmas Day I am 55 years of age which means I be long to a generation that is blamed for a great number of the public wrongs that oppress the present timepollution conspicuous consumption overpopulation racism militarism religious in tolerance thalidomide deformation food additives sexual and national chauvinismneed I go on Somebody had better be blamed so my generation will do as well as any I was in West Berlin couple of years ago and was refused a drink at a Bierstube called Der Moby Dickan establish ment given over narcissistically to das Jugendbecause the towheaded stripling bartender said I was of the generation that started World War II This meant presumably that I had also brought Hitler to power persecuted Jews and intellectuals and provided a subject matter for Mr Kurt Vonne gut Jrs SlaughterhouseFive So it goes I resented the accusation on a basis of historical impossibility When Hitler came to power I was only 15 When the war began I was only 22 When the war ended I was approaching 30 and though now old enough to start plenty of trouble for todays youth or Jugend the horrible future atomic bomb and allwas well on its way to realization without any active support from me Blame an earlier generation then Blame all the earlier generations then while your hand is in Blame Adam and Eve and youre getting nearer to the root or apple core of the trouble Its all a matter of Original Sin and the meaning of Christ mas has to do with Original Sinnot the wiping out of it but Jesus Christs taking over some of the burden of the guilt that belongs to Original Sin Were all prone to evil but we all have the responsibility of fighting it where we see it My generation fought it in Spain and then in Nazified Europe and Nipponized Asia Sometimes despite what seemed clearly to be a necessary though wearisome crusade I find myself derided by the young as a creature who fell for the bloated rhet oric of the warmongers or else thundered at as a killer of the innocent see Mr Vonneguts masterpiece again Or sometimes I am merely pitied see The Naked and the Dead and Catch 22 as one who was a victim of a kind of pseudo democratic fascism not much different from the honestly totalitarian variety A lot of todays young have seen the light and decided to opt or cop out of the 20th centurys barbarism The 20th century has indeed been barbarous though not much more barbarous than other centuries It was surely to the credit of my generation that we recognized the bar barism as an abomination to be fought We put an end to Hitler and Mussolini and the aggression further east and that surely makes the 20th cen tury heroic as well as barbarous Sometimes I feel that the aftermath of World War II was far more enervating than the bad six years themselves If my generation was not quick to put the world right in the late forties and early fifties it was because of a genuine exhaustion It was also because of the need to pick up the threads of ones personal life againjob hunting remaking a marriage broken through separation starting a family building a house We grumbled but we werent all that self  pitying The big whines began with the young men who hadnt known our war And that rejection of the past that was expressed in the words of a British rock groupEducations a dead sceneor in the pronouncement of Mr Dennis HopperThere aint nothin in books mandid not appeal to those men and women who had most cause to revile the past The veterans who went to the colleges and universities and became schoolteachers did as I know from my British experience as one of their instructors very great good The old American jibe about male schoolmarms rang strangely when the schoolmarms had killed Japs and Germans and now stomped into the classrooms on artificial limbs My generation brought a new reality to teaching India and China were no longer just names in an atlas The need to learn to write and to read good English took on a fresh importance in an age that saw the vital urgency of being wellinformed of being wise to the tricks of the political language manipulators so that there should be no more tyrannies on the Hitlerian model MY generation produced great books and it is probably still pro ducing them George Orwell wrote a warn ing about the future  Nineteen Eighty Fourwhich should serve as a bible for all the be sieged libertarians for a long time to come Minter Grass rebuilt the German language out of the soggy mess or atavistic noise it had become under the Nazis Norman Mailer and Saul Bellow slapped the American tongue back to life after a long period of sentimental or demagogic or journalistic devitaliza tion None of the younger poets have been able to touch the achievement of Dylan Thomas Lowell Roethke or our senior member but still one who was formed out of the terrible thirties Auden What the poets of our generation have had in common is a trust in language and in form The beat whiners began to rhapsodize loosely making poetry a new kind of demagogic noise while the older poets shaped chiselled and saw there was still much to learn from the past On a lower level of communication the turning of the Atlantic into a river the aerial shrinking of the globe was the work of men who had taken to the air in a bad time The technicians and crews of the civil airways had flown and serviced fighters and bombers A lot of advancesin medicine in dietetics rocketry and so onhave come out of the impositions of war and perhaps my generation ought not to take credit for them But we are all whether we like it or not instruments of history or the Zeitgeist or whatever we care to term the big impersonal plastic force and all that is ours is the ability to cope with challenges I think we coped I think we are still coping It is chiefly in the area of what are called life styles that the gap between the middleaged and the young is manifested Although my generation has a reputation for indiscriminate fornication bat tles and brothels wars and whoresthe colloca tions are Aldous Huxleys we were fairly naive and even romantic about sex There was not a lot of permissivenes about in the late nineteenthirties though the forties brought a plethora of quick eveofbattle grapplings and a number of us were shy and sexstarved Our substitute for copulation was not masturbation of which if we indulged in at all we were ashamed helped along by pornog raphy hard porn was banned magazies like Play boy didnt exist It was rather the manual of sexu al knowledge the textbook of techniques The whole business was rather like learning to drive car out of diagrams but it equipped us with a fair knowledge however theoretical of what to do when we got into bed with somebody If there was no freeandeasy commerce between the sexes as with todays kids there was a lot of mystery in flamed imagination the glamour of scarcity value Its a pity we are growing so bald and ugly we could show some of these youngsters a thing or two Glamour was the great word we sought it in our film stars we found it in our cafesociety pop songs Our girls dressed to be glamorous not to look like epicene ploughboys We ourselves wore cheap but decent bankpresident lounge suits and were finicky about ties Theres a kind of hypocrisy today in the torn jeans espadrilles sweatshirts What the Spanish peasant must wear against his will now in America is usually negative advertisement of affluence There was never anything wrong in trying to rise to an occa sionthe long dress and perfume and special hair do for a dance the tails or tuxedo or at least clean white shirt We dressed up rather than down There was in dress and coiffure a concern with sexual polarization you always knew whether it was a male or a female you were hungrily following The men had no doubt they could their hair long if they wanted to but they gallantly left that privilege to the women A beard was rightly re garded as a special badge of status or talent all right for Christ and the prophets or a painter or the occasional poet but not to be grown by the cab driver or the plumber Too many today follow Huxleys ironic prescript We judge by appearances merely If I cant think strangely I can at least look queerly We drank but we didnt take drugs And yet many of us had in our enforced travels the chance to get to the hard stuff In North Africa there was kef in the Far East opium pipes bubbled We had rightly or wrongly the belief that the beatific vision was something you were not meant to come by easily You fought for the vision the ecstatic timelessness the euphoria through music or poetry you didnt get it through the nose or the bloodstream It was always as DRAWING BY GERRY GERSTEN sumed that you got nothing easily A thing was sometimes evaluated in terms of the difficulty of acquiring it and this represents a somewhat healthier philosophy than the one current today One young British musician recently said that he couldnt read or write a note of music but he was one of the best arrangers in the world he said to his players Give me like a Spanish sound there or Make that sound you know a bit like you know trumpets and man you got the best arrangement you ever heard That was not our way in anything We always assumed there were no short cuts We never groused about difficulties We were not particularly religious We went in for agnosticism or even sheer howling Marxist atheism but that was probably saner than the sort of religiosity that flourishes now Charles Manson as avatar Jesus Christ Superstar Tune in to Ulti mate Reality and it doesnt matter whether its God or the Devil itll still be better than Vice President Ag new Theres a lot of pietistic or mystical mush about these days a lot of halfdigested Orientalism but we liked something tougher such as cynicism or disbelief We had despite the evi dence to the contrary a now outmoded faith in the capacity of sick communities to make themselves well You didnt slough off the dis credited government or im plausible political system like so much gangrene and then build a wretched dysagrono mic pantisocratic commune sustained by halfbaked Ve danta or secondhand Oxford Groupism What you did was to stand for revolution but revolution with a practicable blueprint We were proved by events to be vain idealists but some of the ideals mi raculously though briefly be came fact There was some thing like a workable anarchic society in Catalonia until Franco smashed it  a so ciety made by the generation before ours the real Hitler and  Mussolini one There was even an attempt in these United States to build the just but glamorous society John F Kennedy was born in the same year that I was Some of our notions of conduct were perhaps ingenu ous It was always assumed that you didnt hit a man when he was down Ten peo ple didnt jump one and see no cowardice in it We didnt justify wrong by elevating it into a metaphysical systemWe believed vaguely in the sanctity of life practicing contraception but abhorring abortion We considered prop erty sacrosanct and there perhaps we were wrong The trouble was that possessions were difficult to acquire and once acquired they seemed to be extensions of ones own person All right then most of our ideas were wrong and our main achievement was nega tivewe defended the bad against the worse as our late Poet Laureate put it We let Hitler get away with too much and delayed our attack on public evil through indo lence or cowardice But late was better than not at all If I may think particularly of my own country now we initiated a sort of social rev olution in 1945 when we were at our poorest and tiredest We jettisoned an empire We thought in terms of a new free global society And if I may finally think of myself as a representative of my generation I fought a war begot a son never got too drunk never wantonly missed a days work never thought it a virtue to be in debt paid my way published nearly thirty books treated women courteously never used an obscenity if I could find a euphemism for it never worked an obscenity to death believed in the future of man kind kept moderately clean remained more sympathetic toward the young than they have been toward me helped a colony to emerge to na tionhood taught myself the piano tried to be a good hus band and didnt boast too much about anything Here at Christmas is To me Open another bottle Tomor row is for hangover and for nodding in bleak acquiescence at the vilifications that will be newly showered on me and my age group Because every vilification will prob ably be justified Till then a sort of selfcongratulatory Christmas 
"Going against 100,000 years of biology",https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/24/archives/the-nochild-family.html,Cathy and Wayne N are in their late 20s have been mar ried five years and are child less The last time a member of Cathys family asked When are you going to start a family her answer was Were a family Cathy and Wayne belong to a growing number of young married couples who are de ciding not to have children A recent survey showed that in the last five years the per centage of wives aged 25 to 29 who did not want children had almost doubled and among those 18 to 24 it had almost tripled What lies be hind this decision which seems to fly in the face of biology and society Perhaps the most publicly outspoken childless or child free as they like to put it couple are Ellen Peck author of The Baby Trap and her husband William an advertis ing executive who is president of the National Organization for NonParents which the Pecks founded last year to defend the social and eco nomic interests of what they feel is a discriminatedagainst minority group couples With out Children The Pecks insist neither they nor the organiza tion are against parenthood just against the social pres sures that push people into parenthood whether it is what they really want and need or not Its a lifestyle choice El len says We chose freedom and spontaneity privacy and leisure Its also a question of where you want to give your effortswithin your own fam ily or in the larger commu nity This generation faces se rious questions about the con tinuity of life on earth as well as its quality Our grandchil dren may have to buy tickets to see the last redwoods or line up to get their oxygen ration There are men who complain about being caught in a traffic jam for hours on their way home to their five kids but cant make the asso ciation between the children and the traffic jam In a world seriously threatened by the consequences of overpopula tion were concerned with making life without children acceptable and respectable Too many children are born as a result of cultural coer cion And the results show up in the statistics on divorce and childabuse Her husband adds Every friend relative and business associate is pressuring you to have kids and find out what youre missing Too many people discover too late that what they were missing was something they were totally unsuited for And Ellen again From the first doll to soap operas to cocktail parties the pressure is always there to be parents But lets take a look at the rate of parental failure Per haps parenthood should be re garded as a specialized occu pation like being a doctor Some people are good at it and they should have chil dren others arent and they should feel they have other alternatives Less evangelical than the Pecks who appear regularly in the media extolling the vir tues of nonparenthood but equally convinced that having children is not for them a number of young husbands and wives who were asked about their decision not to have children made these comments The main reason we enjoy our lives together is because we are together I ant not in the kitchen washing baby bot tles while he thinks of an ex cuse to get out of the house be cause the baby is screaming The thing I find amusing is there are people our age with two or three children strug gling along and they tell us we are missing something Meanwhile we ride in a new car own our own lakefront home spend our summers on our boat go away every weekend and spend every Christmas holiday skiing in Europe And they tell us we are missing something Im sure there are some very happy families with chil dren but the unhappy ones far outnumber the happy ones I dont want to take that chance Most married people I know had no choice They were pro gramed to have three chil dren and be Cub Scout lead ers Then there are those of us who stop to think about the big fantastic world out there waiting to be explored feel that most people are so busy washing diapers and trying to balance the budget that they merely exist and look around them but never see Theyre too busy wiping runny noses After five years both sets of parents are putting on the pressure for us to have kids They have taken to calling our cat and two dogs their grandchildren A mans life isnt anywhere near as greatly altered as a womans once the baby ar rives He may need to in crease his earnings but there is still the job a productive life outside The woman will have to sacrifice many things I would feel trapped in that role Its depressing how crucial my sister and I are to my mother  she more or less lives for us I will never let that happen to me I want to live my life while Im young My parents were always telling me that after my younger brother and I were out of school they would do all the things they wanted to do My father will be 60 by the time my brothers out of college I dont think its selfish to stay childless Who are you hurting It would be worse to become pregnant and not really want the baby It might start out as a great ego trip but all youd wind up with would be problems When we say we dont want kids people ask us What if everyone felt the way you do What a silly question Are these the voices of im mature selfcentered egotists or of responsible adults con sidering the consequences of their decisions Professional observers agree that many people have chil dren for the wrong reasons sometimes for no reason at all Men often drift into fa therhood without ever making a deliberate choice For many women pregnancy can be a way to escape from unre solved conflicts to achieve instant identity or strengthen a poor self image to gratify a need for the attention and affection they feel they never had as children I talked with a number of specialists in the field of human behavior about what these couples had said Their reactions varied widely A family therapist described the decision not to have children as a basic instinctual re sponse to the world situation today implying that some thing like the herd instinct in animals was opeiating as a response to the dangers of overpopulation crowding pollution and nuclear war causing women to feel a reluctance to reproduce and leading them to seek new ways of realizing themselves outside of family life More than one psychiatrist suggested that those who want to remain childless are narcissisticmaking a virtue out of necessity by rationaliz ing their inner conflicts about giving care vs being taken care of These are people who cant tolerate the idea of caring for children who have no margin of love to spare them said one adding Youre going against some thing with 100000 years of biology behind it A col league of his chimed in Well we all rationalize our deficits and these people probably shouldnt have children what ever their real motives are for the same reason there ought to be liberal abortion laws There should only be enthusiastic parents in this world Some observers suggest that perhaps what we are seeing is not a real change at all that like the sexual revolution it is not really a revolution in behavior but in expression It may be says one Connecti cut psychoanalyst that an identifiable group that has ex isted all along is simply com ing out of the closet like homosexuals or swingers The spirit of the time is to do your own thing and not hide it and these peoplemay reflect an increased frankness and open ness rather than any real change Dr Helen Kaplan associate professor of psychiatry at The New York HospitalCornell Medical Center and head of its Sexual Disorder Program thinks there has been a kind of sexual revolution and that what it amounts to is the separation of morality and sexuality Sex used to be permissible only for purposes of procreation in marriage We no longer think it is im moral to have sex without having children and that leaves couples with a choice about whether they want to have them or not They no longer have to feel guilty about not wanting it Dr Kaplan believes there is a strong maternal urge in many women from early childhood on  and its not just culturally determined eitherbut that women vary tremendously in their degree of maternal need And while women who experience deep maternal drives cant give up having children without feel ing a real sense of depriva tion not all women feel this way Psychologist Donald M Kaplan no relation to Helen believes that while some peo ple have always opted not to have children the increased frequency we are seeing is in those children of the nineteen forties and fifties who were raised by parents whose char aoter style had shifted from what sociologist David Ries man called innerdirected to otherdirected and that these otherdirected parents had two relevant effects on their children One was to give them a greater feeling of narcissistic entitlement  what one expects from life The other was the loss of a sense of certainty They are more open to selfdoubt he says more preoccupied with their bodies their lifestyles less able to maintain stable attachments to others The de cision to have a baby he thinks is the kind of decision such people might be most likely to postpone It cant be modified cant be undone Many of these young adults are ambivalent about relinquishing the role of the one who is cared for and tak ing on that of the one who does the caring says Dr Kaplan Dr E James Anthony is professor of child psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine and coau thor of Parenthood Its Psy chology and Psychopathology In a recent conversation Dr Anthony said Many people Ive talked to are very con cerned about their own future and the future of children in this rather troubled world In the past there was always a feeling implicit in the culture that parenthood was something very significant attractive enriching creative Now it seems to be going by the board There seem to be so many other opportunities for women to express themselves creatively and family life re quires them to give up so many things that the empha sis on family life as a good and creative thing a way to contribute to the future of the world doesnt really ring a bell with many young people I think that part of whats happening is that the ambiv alence of parents today is be ing passed on unconsciously to their children Children are a great deal of trouble and perhaps more so today than ever before They can be a pain in the neck Their pre cocious development adoles cent actingout drugtaking all loom as problems The young people feel If they dont really want us why should we want to have chil dren Then they rationalize this feeling in terms of the external questions like what the world has to offer They ask questions like Why add to the population explosion Why create people who will have to face all the problems that are approaching in the next century Children are a great deal of trouble and per haps even more so today than ever before They can be a pain in the neck Just how deeply ingrained are mothering and fathering Does such a thing as father liness really activate men Can they do without it easily Some suggest its just a ques tion of having a fling and then nine months later having to think about the responsibil ities of a family Many young men say they dont feel the need to immortalize them selves in children With women theres the question of what has been called the disappointed womb whether there is a real need in women to experience some thing in what Erikson calls that inner space Many wo men I talk with are conscious of this kind of enrichment they talk about being fulfilled in pregnancy of feeling com plete and better than they have ever felt in their lives but later many find handling children is a bit of a nuisance Still having a child has been experienced as marvelous miraculous What happens if a woman abrogates this ex perience Its a much more serious decision for her than for a man There is something powerful about this basic biological means of creation To deny oneself may be a lit tle like Beethoven having this powerful talent and being told you must never use it Despite their stated motives for not having children the question arises whether young people really in fact lead rich er lives today I find that many college students today feel strangely empty They live in a world full of stimuli of all sorts but lack a sense of inner satisfaction that may relate to these basic biologic things Whatever else they dis agree on the experts all seem to be saying that its not whether you have children or dont that really matters what matters is that you are comfortable about what you do If you dont have children and you have much inner con flict about it youll be miser able in your childlessness if you have children and regret it youll be miserable and your children will be miser able too The point seems to be to know yourself to accept your deeper feelings and not make such an important life decision because its the thing to do or to satisfy unrealistic fantasies or to give your par ents what they want or to escape from other responsibil ities Some people are afraid to admit their own feelings of the kind many of the child less couples interviewed could accept about themselves what they called being sel fish They are ashamed to admit they would rather travel than bring up children But what if that is what would make them happiest Deeply held feelings are not easily changed and if you do not recognize what yours really are you will not make the choices that are right for you For many if not most peo ple the joys of parenthood as well as its problems are what life is all about To see ones children grow and develop in to individuals and to see one self continue on in them can be the richest experience be tween ones own birth and death But there are also peo ple for whom living a full life and realizing themselves take other routes And we live in a time in which attitudes seem to be freeing up in a way which enables increasing numbers of men and women to question the way every body lives if that is not the way that is right for them The more people continue to ask themselves such questions as whether or not they really want to raise a family before they begin to do so the fewer unhappy parents and troubled children there will be

Panel of Times Critics Appraises 1972 as a Year of Settling Down in the Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/26/archives/panel-of-times-critics-appraises-1972-as-a-year-of-settling-down-in.html,It was a year of settling down in all the arts but television which launched a conscious drive for more quality programing and a more per missive approach to sensitive themes It was a time when avantgarde movements lost their dominance when a pluralism of possibility emerged and artists who painted composed or performed in realistic modes gained the respect that had been withheld from them in recent years was a year when jazz returned to the scene This was the consensus that emerged in a yearend roundtable on the arts and culture held by nine critics of The New York TimesClive Barnes Anatole Broyard John Canaday Vincent Canby Hilton Kramer Christopher LehmannHaupt John J OConnor Harold C Schonberg and John S Wilson Ada Louise Huxtable could not attend because illness Among the main themes of the roundtable which was moderated by Arthur Gelb metropolitan editor and Grace Glueck cultural news editor were these In painting and sculpture extreme avantgarde movements were back by audiences inured to their excesses The revival of realism con tinued and galleries became more willing to show all forms of art In music young composers turned to a kind of neoromanticism analo gous to realism in painting Many musicians gave up wilder forms expression in favor of simpler and more directly communicative work Jazz found young audiences after a decade in the shadows of rock The novelgiven up as dead by some only a short time agoshowed vigorous signs of life particularly the realistic novel Movement litera ture failed to build on the interest it had engendered in recent years Black writing was quieter not as hostile as it had been Sociology became almost poetic in 1972 Comparatively few young American filmmakers made their mark 1972 but it was a vintage year for Old MastersHitchcock Buuel and Tati With the exception of the vigor supplied by black audiences the industry continued to slide economically Broadway got some new theaters at last but the theater entered a period of questioning its own viability Institutional theater made im portant inroads sometimes at the expense of the oldline producers The BalanchineRobbinsStravinsky festival set the standard in bal let America maintained its position as the only country with a strong vigorous moderndance movement Here are some excerpts from the critics roundtable Q How do you regard the year in the arts in each of your fields Do you feel this was a healthy or unhealthy year creatively speaking Innovative Sterile John would you start CANADAY I think its been a pretty healthy year in painting and sculpture but not a terribly exciting year It was a year when extreme avantgarde move ments got the final black eye having reduced themselves to such boredom rather than such absurdity that the ptiblic was no longer interested in them The socalled revival of realism went on and a much quieter and a much slower kind of innovation than weve been having with all the fire works In other words I think it was a time of settling down in the arts that was altogether a very good thing You could show anything in the galleries this year from the wildest abstraction to your own self stark nakedwhich people didand I think get a much more con sidered reaction to it from critics than youve been able to in the past Any thing went by which I mean not any thing extreme but just anythingcon servative extreme or what not I call that healthy SCHONBERG In avantgarde music you get something curiously analogous to the return of realism that John has mentioned In other words for about 15 years the avantgarde musicians have been pursuing many pathstheyve been following everything That seems to have come to a dead endthe Cage phenomenon seems to be over and academic serialism seems to be over And now the young composers seem to he turning to almost a kind of neo romanticism which in a way is analo gous to realism in painting Last night I attended a concert of the Evenings for New Music which is com ing out of Buffalo with Lukas Foss and by God you heard some things over there that would have been literally booed off the stage in any avantgarde program of music 15 years ago They were consonantal there were triads there was an attempt at melody there was an attempt at expressivity And I think that the young people have given up the wilder forms in favor of a re turn to something simpler and more directly communicative LEHMANNHAUPT It was a year characterized by the revival of realism the comeback of the novel I think was a very good year for the novel and in particular a very good year for the realistic novel I think it was a bad year for what might generally be called movement literaturethe young womens lib did not produce anything particularly in teresting within their particular scheme of rebellion A possible exception in black writing was Ishmael Reeds novel Mumbo Jumbo which was both very avant garde and quite interesting quite suc cessful with severe limitations In the trend toward nonfiction novels the socalled witnessing novels like Norman Mailers Armies of the Night that movement died down and there was an interesting polarity which could he exemplified by the success on the one hand of David Halberstams The Best and the Brightest which was a kind of extension of new journalism in a way and yet it became credible be cause of the way he treated it and on the other hand a hook like Hunter Thompsons Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas which became almost psyche delic using somewhat similar tech niques The thing that struck me as most in teresting was a novel by Theodore Weesner called The Car Thief which for the first hundred pages seems al most like had creativewritingschool writing And I really began to realize that the old realism had almost become a kind of symbolism and assumed a kind of symbolic quality where it was almost commenting on itself I think this has happened before in the history of literature certainly but it would in dicate again a revival of realism OCONNOR In television its been on the whole a healthy year that has had several developments The one most commented on has been the new per Missiveness Certain theme subjects have been used in very strange places Maude became pregnant and got an abortion Movie of the Week had That Certain Summer a quality type of film on homosexuality Theres also been a kind of conscious drive toward trying to get more quality nil television And this has been stimu lated by the success of the BBC Mas terpiece Theater things over here And what youre getting now is that Joseph Papp certainly the most exciting force in theater at the moment in New York is being brought into television You get Laurence Olivier in Long Days Jour ney Into Night coming up Also get ting away from the weekly series youre getting the miniseries where a speciafic program is on once every four weeks This gives a chance for better writing more time for acting direction production qualities And I think thats been the most encouraging sign this year WILSON This has been the happiest year for jazz probably in the last 10 years the decade in which jazz has been overshadowed by rock This year for the first time jazz be gan to come back and find an audience once again There are more places where jazz is being played now there are more jazz records being put out Theres a growing interest in what has already happened in jazz as can be seen by the number of reissues that are coming outfor all periods of jazz The fact that the Newport Jazz Festival met in New York had a great deal to do with this but it wasnt the starting point of the thingit just came along at a time when the whole thing was be ginning to pick up again So far as the avantgarde people are concerned its very much the same as Harold was mentioning They are still there but theyre moving back toward realityvarious kinds of reality Some of them are going back to African roots and rhythms some are going to Eastern music some are getting into electronic music But its not just the sort of wild thrashing around that was going on for quite some time KRAMER In speaking of the year in the art world were speaking of two quite separate things one is what artists are actually doing and the other how it is being received In terms of what artists are doing I think the situation is as John indicated a situation in which almost anything goes That is there is a sort of plural ism of possibility now and people who paint in a realistic mode are not as condescended to as they were say five or six years ago But they have not necessarily pushed out of the picture people who are doing very extreme things In terms of how all this is being received thats rather a different story because I think its universally agreed among dealers journalists mu seum people and artists themselves that theres a tremendous lull in the art world right nowthat the art world somehow doesnt command the kind of publicity the kind of authority the kind of excitement that it did for most of the nineteensixties And whether one thinks thats a good thing for art or a bad thing sociologi cally that is the most significant thing about the art world this past year that its sort of gone into a kind of publicrelations slump in which in the realm of gossip and popular culture the visual arts dont weigh in as heavily as they have been doing for about 10 years CANBY I think the most interesting thing this year in films is that the best films weve had are from men most of whom are over 50 or 60 Even one of our best films is by a man who is dead which is pretty good Thats The Tokyo Story which was made in 1959 by Yasujiro Ozu who died in 1963 and we saw it for the first time this year But weve had marvelous films from Bunuel Tati and Hitchcock and only a few films by comparatively young direc tors American directors There have been really no exciting new filmmakers discovered that Im aware of One of the problems of course is that movies are a business and the best way to make it in business is to have some sort of reputation which you only get having done something And Holly wood is very reluctant to take a chance The American film industry and it is an industry and not an art primarily is in a very sick state Films are losing more money today than I think they ever have before And the way that the industry and the major film com panies are handling this is to spend less meaning theyll lose less But it sort of cuts down the chances too of exciting things happening The most lively aspect of American filmmaking has been I think black filmmaking Most of the films have been rather very bad but theyve also been very alive and very vital and theyve had something very few other films have and thats a very vital audi ence which has an affect on the film makers themselves You cant really re main unmoved by some of these films when you sit in the audience and see how theyre received The emphasis on older filmmakers this year would probably lead one to believe that the good films are more conventional more classical this year as a result But in a strange way its just the opposite because the older filmmakers are some of the most idiosyncratic Buuel is an unrecon structed surrealist still and somebody such as Ozu is so austere that most film audiences cant put up with the sim plicity of his technique The more conventional things are being done by the young people coming along who are trying to make it by having big popular successes Of course the most successful film of the year The Godfather was made by a very young man Francis Ford Coppola who managed in that one film I think to distill the best the popular film has to offer There are some new areas being ex plored by people making films by com puter This is an area that may be quite exciting Ive not seen anything that in teresting at this point  BARNES I have a feeling Ive seen some plays written by computers I dont really want to talk about art I want to talk about money as far as the theater is concerned The economics of the theater at the moment is the most interesting thing One fascinating ele ment is that for the first time since well before the Second World War Broadway has new theaters going up Weve had three open this year Well have another one in the new year One of them the Uris which is empty at the moment is the largest theater on Broadway the largest legitimate house in the United States This is the current sign of health in a way but it is perhaps misleading Broadway has been in a period of reassessment Its in a period of ques tioning its own viability What we are doing I think is moiling to the same situation that London is inwe are moving toward what is fundamentally an institutional theater By institutional theater I mean a theater that is funda mentally nonprofitmaking that is it takes as its purpose to provide theater rather than to make money Traditionally the American theater unlike most of the world theater has been the realm of the entrepreneur the people who went into it for a buck But its questionable now whether the old buccaneering producers can survive and stay alive It is possible that the sub sidized theater the nonprofit theater the institutional theater is going to be come the norm One obvious sign is the Shakespeare Festival Joseph Papps operation It is remarkable what hes achieved This year he took both Tonys for the best musical in Two Gentlemen from Verona and for the best play Sticks and Bones But Joe is only part of the picture There are other institutional theaters the American Place Circle in the Square and the Chelsea Theater in Brooklyn which are again doing extremely inter esting work On Broadway the most extraordinary things have been happening people los ing a million dollars in a night on a musical that on the face of it didnt seem to have a chance of success when it started It is very grim to see some of these monstrosities falling like some great dinosaurs into the gloom But I think that has been offset by the development of the regional theater Outside of New York the theater is very much flourish ing Q Is this true of the dance As far as dance is concerned this has been a year thats been dominated by the BalanchineRobbinsStravinsky Festival which was a grandiose week for the New York City Ballet probably the only company that would dare do it They had one week of performances of 30 ballets of which more than 20 were world premieres Theres never been such a burst of creative activity in dance Not every one was a master piece but out of that number I think at least 10 will survive into the repertory which is a rather goodly number What has happened to modern dance is interesting inasmuch as were the only country that really has a strong moderndance movement Modern dance is one of our few indigenous art forms and it came in this country before clas sic ballet In recent years the more ob vious popularity of classic ballet has been really putting it down somewhat but this year with the ANTA Marathon modern dance made a very big attempt to get a showcase BROYARD I found it an average year for books I thought what we lost in one field we gained in another Un less we go back all the way to last fall and include the novels of John Updike and Bernard Malamud I think it was a fairly unexciting year in fiction with the possible exception of the occasional unexpected small novel by a relative unknown I think the womens novels were dif ferent Women were looking for a big ger bed to sleep in They were writing what I would call existential novels in which they were groping for a new way to express themselves and not really finding it They were more or less in the position of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man trying to define their role and so far not succeeding Black writing was fairly quiet this year not as hostile as it has been I still think the best portrait of a black came from a white writerSkeeter in Updikes Rabbit Redux Black soci ology showed some hopeful signs of achieving perspective on itself I thought Al Murrays book South to a Very Old Place actually had some goodnatured irony in it for a change Education seems to be repeating it self There were a number of apocalyp tic books in education but now I think its all been said Ind its mostly a ques tion of implementation The most excit ing field this year for me was sociology It seems that American sociology is in a mood of national soulsearching Theres where the real fancy writing came in I would say sociology became almost poetic at times this year Theodor Roszaks Where the Waste land Ends was very exciting in its in dictment of technological man and a little bit unconvincing in holding out hope for a renaissance of religion I thought Rollo Mays Power and In nocence was quite good especially the part about American innocence I think some of his remarks about American innocence exposes one of the most un examined American postures that Of Im just a nice guy standing here an innocent bystander in the world I thought Andrew M Greeleys Un secular Man was about the best ex amination of the religious revival not a very hellfireanddamnation sermon but pretty reasoned fare In psychology I thought the new schools were coming on It seems to be pretty well agreed in the field that the Freudian analyst snoozing in his chair over his erudition is not the answer to the patients prob lems and it seems theres a great deal of interactional or transactional psy chology going on some of it absurd and some of it apparently very effective  Q Youve all been describing a sort of settling down in the arts and a revival of older forms Are there societal reasons for this LEHMANNHAUPT Nixon KRAMER One reason for it in the art world and maybe in other spheres is what people call the recession but which I think is really a depression This combined depression and inflation weve been going through has had an absolutely devastating effect on dona tions to cultural institutions university budgets museum budgets publishing budgets Theres been a real economic collapse in some quarters and this has provoked many institutions and artists themselves into reexamining what they Were doing and cutting out a lot of the fun quotient to get down to what might really bring audiences in and what was really essential about their enterprise BARNES I think Its partly a question of this nostalgia People all tend to go back to a period of security and pros perity although that prosperity was very much for the few But you know its interesting that so much of this nostalgia in so many art forms goes back before the Depression to the Twenties which appears to be emerging as some kind or mythic golden age KRAMER Theres a lot of nostalgia for the Depression too though obvious ly by people who didnt live through it CANADAY I dont know whether you call it a societal reason but I think that as far as painting and sculpture are concerned the reaction is simply one against excess One avantgarde move ment after another has come on so rapidly and the effort has always been to be a little more sensational for so long that it simply couldnt be kept up You run out of sensations And I think that it is partly a matter of lassitude and disgust You can even see some of the critics backing down on certain painters theyve been extremely en thusiastic about for years and they now recognize dont quite merit it  Q Vincent youve talked about the contribution of older men to the movies and how Buuel surrealism continues to attract an audience What do you think of this societally CANBY Well Id like to answer that in a different way because movies are really a business and they follow busi ness trends as much as sales at Macys do One of the most interesting things thats happened in the last year in films has had nothing to do really with the quality of films but with where the money is coming from to make the films We have the most curious combinations and groups of investors coming along to finance films Realestate people in California will put up 3million to fi nance a film with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor and lose their shirts but theyre looking for tax writeoffs KRAMER What happened to the film audience Why is it that people like me dont go to the movies any more CANBY Why youre old now KRAMER Was the movie audience al ways a young audience Or is that a fairly recent development CANBY This is something thats been happening over the last 20 years KRAMER When I was young my parents went to the movies every week CANBY Now they stay home and watch television Televisions really usurped what was the motionpicture audience and this is something that reached a crisis in 1953 when there were maybe 25000 or 30000 theaters in this country And we now have may be 13000 or 12000 I mean the audi ence just collapsed LEHMANNHAUPT Are fewer people going to the movies this year CANBY Its about the same this year as last LEMANNHAUPT When was the great dropoff or has it been a gradual thing CANBY Well for the last five years its been fairly stable but the problem has been that like theater the hit films may absolutely go through the roof The Godfather this year will do a total world profit of about 150million Now thats maybe 20million to 40 million more than the next most profit able film When that happens a lot of other movies dont make a dime They dont last a week KRAMER I just find movies either boring pretentious or offensive CANBY How do you know when you never go KRAMER But I have gone until fairly recently Q When did you stop KRAMER I stopped going two or three times a week about seven or eight years ago I stopped going every week about two or three years ago I stopped going once a month about six months ago CANBY Youre Mr Average Man KRAMER In my case television doesnt account for it because I cant stand television either So I think theres some reason beyond my personal taste and my age that must account for that And I think it has something to do with changes in the way movies are made gave up on the theater long before movies because the theater is just be yond redemption And I think the fact that Clive could make an opening state ment about the theater and not say a single thing about playwrights is indica tive of why I dont go to the theater BARNES I could have said something about playwrights KRAMER But it wasnt the first thing that came to mind Because in the thea ter the writer is no longer important BARNES But you didnt mention a single painter KRAMER But I did talk about the ways painters were producing their work BARNES I talked about the way the theater had organized itself KRAMER And thats why one has stopped going to the theater Because one has felt that youre sort of hooked into a social problem or an economic problem rather than going to see some thing that you can enjoy and find significant CANADAY Canaday gets bored at the theater thats why he doesnt go to the theater very much I used to go to the movies for entertainment but late ly Ive discovered Ive got to go to them as a kind of intellectual exercise When I was a movie fan and I used to be an avid one I would just sort of sit bad and be entertainedmaybe by a lot of junk but at least I was entertained And now Ive got to think CANBY I think I could give you list of at least 150 films that wouldnt bother your intellect one bit  CANADAY These films that we see in New York all the time particularly the foreign films how much well take The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoi sieyour favorite film this yearas an instance How wide a circulation does that have outside of New York CANBY Very small Two years ago when we had a similar seminar we were talking about the socalled cultural ex plosion which is just very dead Be cause I think a film such as The Dis creet Charm of the Bourgeoisie may be 10 years ago would have played 300 or 400 theaters throughout the country And I think this year it will be lucky if it plays 30 or 40 CANADAY Thats very odd Why CANBY Because it will make all its money in New York which has a large audience for it Chicago San Francisco perhaps Los Angeles perhaps Dallas or Houston and maybe 15 other cities in all It will play one theater only there will be no second run If you miss film such as The Discreet Charm in Chicago theres no second chance to see it Its very difficult for us sitting in New York to truly judge what is going on oftentimes because as Clive said we have more opportunity to see more different kinds of films here Its movie buffs paradise because in addi tion to the firstrun secondrun third run theaters we have film repertory theaters and museums If you just bide your time theres hardly a great film that you cant see say in a 12month period without straining That is not true of any other city in this country and perhaps not in the world WILSON May I say something about the societal reasons for settling down in jazz In the jazz field the sort Of advanced edge of jazz certainly is al ways running parallel to whats going on in the black world And one of the things thats happened in that respect is that during the nineteensixties the avantgarde of jazz was primarily black musicians expressing their blackness just asserting themselves And the settling down has come in because the black musicians have gone beyond that theyre finding some def inite direction to go in rather than just be black They are finding roots theyre finding specific things to do beyond being black BARNES How large is the jazz audi ence Is it a large audience or is it still fairly small WILSON Its a growing audience right now and yes it is becoming young audience Jazzs problem in the sixties was that it lost its young audience to rock What has hap pened in the last year is that young people who had been listening to rock are beginning to discover jazz and they are discovering some of the people who are real veterans of jazz A man like Charles Mingus whos been around for 25 years is suddenly discovered by a young audience Sonny Rollins who dish appears every few years and come back came back this year after being away for about two or three years and suddenly he was a hero to kids who never even heard him before BARNES Is rock losing something I mean for example the Fillmore East closing down and things like that Is that indicative of something WILSON The reason the Fillmore East closed down was because the rock artists were playing stadiums and get ting fantastic fees Q Chris when the question was first asked about societal reasons you said President Nixon Why LEHMANNHAUPT I think hes ob viously more a reflection than a prime force I think theres something more to be said than simply nostalgia and the economic depressionwhich is why I said Nixon symbolically You can look at the publishing indus try and theres no question but that in the last four or five years its suffere economicallyprincipally because Fed eral funds have been cut off and they are therefore publishing less stuff for libraries and schools which did tend to support the books that you see in stores I think there has beenand I think it has been reflected in publishinga kind of slowingdown on the part of readers on the part of reviewers on the part of writers And a reassessment of the kind of wild period that weve all been talking about that we went through in the nineteensixties And thats what I meant In a sense Nixons election may have also been a reflection of that I have a theoryits an untried one that an agitated society tends to produce less reflective art I mean to go back to Wordsworth Rage is not conducive to recollection in tranquili lity And I think that there has been a settling down and consequently peo ple are withdrawingwriters and nov elists are withdrawing into themselves BROYARD I think that our socalled modern writers have always attuned themselves too closely to conditions as opposed to the human condition Theyve always written topically And as the late Delmore Schwartz said You cant go on being indignant about the same things all the time So I think the indignation has become repetitious And since fiction is not at its best in a prophetic vein without the indignationt they dont have very much to do except poke around in the nooks and crannies of the human condition Most of th5 good books Ive read in fiction this year are doing that But by definition then theyre not big books Theyre eccentric books WILSON As a suburbanite Id like to ask what is the significance of the fact that a hardcore pornographic filth like Deep Throat is so accepted that it can play in Princeton N J CANBY Now dont ask me I thinic sociologists and psychiatrists could answer you Im amazed Im told that in some upstate city where they used to have six conventional theaters three of them an now pornographic This yearend review of the arts will he continued in tomorrows editions
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/27/archives/the-abortion-issue.html,To the Editor James A Farley in his letter of Dec 5 makes several assumptions about abortion unwarranted by fact No proponent of the right to abor tion has advocated its use as a solu tion to social problems There are many less drastic forms of population control which are now commonly exercised without legal restraint or personal qualm Nor has anyone ever advocated that abortions be forced on those who object to them on moral grounds The real issue is not abortion but the right of the individual to make per sonal moral and physiological deci sions without reference to the abstract beliefs and religious practices of others Mr Farley would be deeply upset if he were legally prevented from hav ing a tooth extracted because its re moval would offend those religious groups who believe that tampering with the human body is a crime For tunately he is legally permitted to make that decision in terms of his own conscience in consultation with his dentist He is neither forced to have his tooth extracted nor prevented from doing so Mr Farley cites the referendums In Michigan and North Dakota as proof of the groundswell of distaste for abortion Why at this point in our history is it necessary or desirable to subject the protection of religious liberty contained in the Bill of Rights to a popularity contest Does Mr Far ley really believe that an individuals rights beliefs or reigious practices can be decided by majority vote In his equation of child abuse with abortion Mr Farley expresses his own religious belief that a human being is created at the moment of conception Yet others believe that the fetus cannot be considered a hu man being if it is not capable of de veloping into a whole sane adult Still others believe that a fetus be comes a human being when it is born and not before Under our Constitution Mr Farley is entitled to his own definition of a human being and he is entitled to be have in accordance with that defini tion Why does he wish to impose legal restraints on the behavior of those who do not share his personal religious beliefs New York Dec 19 1972

lawyers psychothera pists and even architects and tax accountants There are varying indica tions that this urge of women to put their more sensitive personal business into the hands of other women may be spreading beyond the movements activists Dont you think I should get a lady lawyer so as to support womens lib a mid dleaged suburban client recently asked a job reentry counseior revealing with that lady that her conscious nessraising hadnt covered terminology but that her heart was in tune with her younger sisters Requests for women pro fessionals come in at the rate of helf a dozen a day

for example supplies at least three names per inquiry from a roll of more than 40 therapists and a number of therapy groups The National Organization Women has in its files of women professionals a similar list of therapists with a femi nist approach to such ques tions as rage depression and aggressiveness in women Im getting a hundred let ters a week said Dr Phyllis Chesler an associate of the psychotherapy collective author of Women and Mad ness and a leader in the As sociation for Woman in Psy chology which split off from the American Psychological Association over feminist is sues Its clear that for edu cated middleclass women the therapist no longer must be a male authority figure as God was once a man but few women psychiatrists identify themselves as femi nists Dr Chesler said The trading of names is all the brisker of course be cause of the rarity of women in most professions Women lawyers were boosted to meager 46 per cent of the profession by this years graduates Three per cent of American gynecologists and obstetricians are women In psychotherapy the percent age of women has been vari ously put at from 6 to 10 per cent In the opinion of Kris Glen of NYU and others women who are really political about the movement feel that the average male pro fessional wont understand their positions at all when it comes to marriage and di vorce medical examinations and birth techniques abor tion child custody and sup port or even contracts and wills Even mildly political women Miss Glen said are beginning to feel they would be more comfortable with a woman lawyer Women gynecologists some what reticent about discuss ing their practices neted that some women have always preferred women doctofs but also that their reasons for choosing them do seem to be changing I dont

Medicine,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/money-is-part-of-the-treatment-hemophilia.html,Until a decade ago death at an early ageafter great suffering and disabilitywas the inevitable fate of most hemophiliacs Then medication was developed capable of stopping even preventing the bleeding that is the central symptom of the inherited disease Yet according to a recent Govern ment survey only 4 per cent of the nations 25000 hemophiliacs are given regular preventive treatment with the medication The rest use it only to stop a serious bleeding episode The reason Costup to 80 a treatment up to 40000 a year for preventive treat ment of the most severely afflicted In recent months pressure has grown to make public funds available to bridge this gulf between medical knowledge and its application A At its last session Congress en acted a measure that entitles victims of kidney disease to Medicare bene fits In November the president of the American Medical Association called for extension of similar aid to victims of hemophilia and other cata strophic illness And recently Senator Harrison A Williams Democrat of New Jersey said he would introduce legislation in the next Congress to provide financial assistance to hemo philiacs  Earlier this month a law was en acted in Pennsylvania appropriating 250000 to help hemophiliacs pay for their medication A similar bill has been passed in New Jersey  Two months ago a class action suit was filed in the Federal District Court here against the Department of Health Education and Welfare The suit demanded that the Federal Gov ernment supply free medicine to pre vent or stop bleeding for all hemo philiacs The suit argues that since the Government provides free metha done for narcotics addicts the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that it also supply free medication for those af flicted by the blood disease Hemophilia is a disease of the bodys blood clotting system Those most severely affected lack one of two essential proteins found in the blood Factors VIII and IX in technical jargon and needed for normal co agulation This deficiency means that it is much more difficult for hemo philiacs to stop bleeding than it is for normal people In the most severe cases even a minor wound such as a scraped knee can be a threat to life For most hemophiliacs however the most severe problems come from internal hemorrhages These may be lifethreat eningespecially in the case of cere bral hemorrhageor crippling if blood collects in body joints such as the knee for example The progress made in treating the disease has resulted from the ability to isolate and supply on a commercial basis the missing blood factors needed by hemophiliacs These factors can be infused into the vein to end a bleeding episode or even to prevent abnormal bleeding much as insulin taken by a diabetic prevents diabetic coma The new medications are derived from blood plasma and are expensive because of the cumbersome work in volved in the separation process A recent Government survey found that a prophylactic supply of this blood frac tion may cost a severely affected suf ferer more than 40000 a year And even less severely affected patients may need to spend 20000 The progress made with this dread disease however has presented society with a dilemma Hemophilia is genetical ly transmitted for the most part If hemophiliacs survive marry and have children in increasing numbers the certain result is that there will be many more hemophiliacs in future generations Most hemophilia victims are males because inheritance of the disease is sexlinked Women are carriers of the genetic defect  though they rarely suffer the disease which shows up in the carriers male children Women from families with histories of hemo philia have always had to think of avoiding pregnancy or resorting to abortion Now as more and more male hemo philiacs grow up and marry they and their wives will have to make similar choices about having children unless of course society some day makes the choice for them Some observers sug gest that society may be more likely to insist on making the choice if has to pick up the bill
Mate Legislators Face the Happy Prospect of a Budget Surplus When Session Opens,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/state-legislators-face-the-happy-prospect-of-a-budget-surplus-when.html,The states 210 lawmakers face a significant budget sur plus for the first time in sev eral years when they gather Wednesday in Albany to con vene the states 196th regular legislative session The prospect has alreadyi triggered partisan rhetoric and political infighting on the pre cise amount of the surplus and on how it should be spent In contrast to last years in terminable lamentations of fis cal crisis and hold the line the states 197273 fiscal year is expected to end on March 31 with a surplus ranging ac cording to various estimates from 66million to 550mil lion with many guesses in be tween The Issues Other major issues that will confront the Republicancon trolled Senate and Assembly will be attempts to repeal the states liberalized abortion law the question of no fault auto mobile insurance and a pro posed loosening of the states constitutional limitations on gambling There will also be various court reform plans proposed increases in welfare and education aid attempts by New York City to obtain changes in the civil service sys tem and a host of other issues almost all of them bearing price tags The budget debate this year will change Assembly Speaker Perry B Duryea Republican of Montauk L I said in a recent interview Rather than one of cuts itll be what is the amount of surplus this year and what do we do with it Mayoral Politics Enmeshed in the crush of many interests in the state for the funds will be the perennial politickingheightened in 1973 by a horde of prospective mayoral candidates in New York City and by the fact that 1974 is a gubernatorial election year The more blatant politics in the 1973 session will be mayor al politics one seasoned Al bany politician said recently while the more subtle politics will be gubernatorial politics Actually the political jockey ing has already begun focusing for the present on the projected surplus Governor Rockefeller who has not ruled out seeking fifth term in office originally estimated the surplus at 66 million but now says it might be a little more although to date he has not publicly re vised his arithmetic Estimates Vary At the other end of the spec trum is the Assemblys minori ty leader Stanley Steingut Democrat of Brooklyn who has said the surplus could be in the neighborhood of 550million The Governor recently gave a candid response as to why there was such a diversity in reckoning the amount of the anticipated surplus saying It depends on where you sit po litically If youre the opposi tion the figures look bigger If youre in the administration the figure looks smaller Mr Duryea widely touted as a prospective Republican gu bernatorial candidate has cau tiously hinted that the surplus might provide some relief for I heavily taxed homeowners Shortly after he uttered this carefully worded possibility Mr Rockefeller called an Al bany news conference to damp en the notion and to say that the surplus amounts should be used to eliminate various fiscal gimmicks from the proposed 197374 state budget Chief among these devices are rolloversa reference to some 400million in delayed payments for education and welfare programs that the state resorted to in the balancing of the 197172 budget This meant that the 400 million in payments under the 197172 budget for welfare and school districts came out of thej 197273 state budget The Governor has said he wants to get back to a sound system of current payments by returning to the states orig inal payment schedule rather than permitting the rollover tactic to continue Many Democrats and some Republicans feel that Mr Rocke feller is intent on squirreling a large part of the surplus away for 1974a gubernatorial year and one in which should he decide to run again he would be loath to seek new revenues but would be delighted to have a fiscal boon sequestered in the states ledgers One suspicious Democrat is Assemblyman Albert H Blu menthal of Manhattan a may oral contender who amplified his candidacy recently by writ ing the Governor a Christmas letter on the citys needsa practice of incumbent New York Mayors until Mayor Lind say abandoned it two years ago Mr Blumenthal said he was most outraged at this moment by the apparent decision to bury some 300million to 400million in surplus funds that should be available at the end of this fiscal year March 31 In the weeks ahead the ac tual amount of surplusin con trast to last years 483million deficit and a 23million deficit the year beforewill be more accurately pinpointed as the various interest groups con verge on the states coffers The spenders will be town and the cutters will back in town Mr Duryea said and well have all the trap pings of a fullscale budget de bate but against a different backdrop There will be 59 new law makers among the 210 legisla tors who will meet in joint session Wednesday to hear Mr Rockefeller 15th annual State of the State message in which he will describe in general terms his proposed legislative program for the year and assess the states competitive position Sources in the Rockefeller ad ministration who have worked with the Governor on his mes sage say that among other things he will propose the following to the Legislature where the GOP controls the Assembly 83 to 67 and the Senate 37 to 23 A 10 per cent increase stateaid payments to recipients of home relief and to persons receiving aid to dependent children This would return clients in these two indigent I categories to roughly the lev els of aid they were getting until a few years ago when cuts were made A bill that would preclude 130000 current recipients Medicaid from possibly being removed from the programs rolls In 1971 the Legislature approved such cutbacks in Med icaid but the legislation was suspended by the courts How ever administration sources said that new Federal legisla tion would permit the state have the court stay vacated but that the Governor feels this should not be done Aid to victims in upstate areas such as the Southern Tier where many were left homeless by the tropical storm Agnes According to the sources the Governor is plan ning to include funds in proposed new budget that would permit the state to sume the local share of urban renewal projects implemented of the storms ravages Tax abatements for flood vic tims whose homes were dam aged or destroyed will also proposed the sources reported The establishment of a state commission to explore the uses and possible regulation of practice of acupuncture and recommend a state policy speci the sources said and will urge the lawmakers to resist polit ical pressure for enactment of any legislation that would at tempt to deter the cause of hu man rights On more than one occasion Mr Rockefeller has said he will try with renewed vigor to see some form of nofault automo bile accident insurance passed in Albany During the 1972 session a nofault plan he supported suf fered a number of dilutions and still was rejected by the law yerdominated Legislature A sufficient number of lawmakers responded to the intense lobby ing against nofaidt insurance by the New York State Trial Lawyers Association whose members are heavily engaged in negligence work There are hints that Mr Rockefeller will have a few harsh words for such powerful specialinterest lobbying in his message In addition the Republican leaders of both houses say they will press for nofault Insur ance The new Senate majority leader Senator Warren M An derson Republican of Bingham ton said in a recent interview I would expect that a mean ingful nofault bill will come to the floor and should be passed Mr Duryea said We have to legislate a savings in insur ance premiums Court Reform Backed Court reform is also ex pected to have a special cachet in the Legislature in the up coming session Mayor Lindsay has already released a detailed court reform program and the Governor has pledged to sub mit proposed courtreform leg islation There will undoubtedly be other courtreform plans offered by lawmakers during the session The second passage of a pro posed constitutional amend ment easing current restric tions on gambling will also come up for legislative action If it is passed as it was last year then it will be submitted to the voters in a November referendum Mr Duryea said he feels that the issue would be a big one and that an airing of the rami fications of casinos and other forms of gambling in the state was needed I want to personally be as sured if we legalize gambling that the statethrough a pub lic benefit corporation  will always be the final arbiter of what happens Mr Duryea said New York City according to its Albany representative Rich ard A Brown will continue to keep a wary eye on attempts by the state to take over the citys Offtrack Betting Corpora tion Mr Brown said that the citys two major program goals were court reform and reforms in the Civil Service system aimed at increasing perform ance and easing the restrictions for entry into middle and up permanagement positions As a member of the Big Six Mayors lobbying group Mr Lindsay and the Mayors of the states five other largest cities will continue to push for state takeover of welfare costs as well as for substantial aid to combat street crime Mr Brown said The Big Six will also renew their efforts to gain a 21 per cent share of state revenues rather than the 18 per cent they are now receiving This re quest is expected to receive a stony response from the Gover nor The prospects for a repeat ofl the anguished and emotional arguments surrounding the states liberalized abortion law are also strong despite Mr Rockefellers veto of a repeal bill that passed last year The liberalized law permits a woman to have an abortion on demand up to 24 weeks of pregnancy Opponents want restoration of the old state law permitting abortions only when a mothers life is imperiled Mr Rockefeller still opposes repeal but the issue is never theless expected to reach the floors of both houses despite the personal reluctance of the leadership to bring it up again Education Issues In the field of education the following things are expected to come up New attempts to impose tuition at the City University of New York and to absorb it into the State University system The city is expected to again resist such moves while seeking a greater percentage of support from the state Moves to increase the funds in the socalled Bundy aid program which helps pri vate colleges suffering from lack of funds The beginnings at least of discussions of a possible state takeover of the raising and distribution of funds for public schools partly by means of a uniform statewide property tax that would re place the share of local prop erty taxes that now support the schools Wore attempts to find ways to skirt restrictions in the State Constitution barring use of pub lic funds for parochial schools All attempts by the Legislature over the last few years to find ways around the restrictions are either pending in the courts or have been nullified by the courts LocalInterest Bills There will also be the usual plethora of localinterest legis lation and proposals dealing with prisons transportation consumer interests such as the generic labeling of drugs and the environment as Well as the lunbroken chain of bills sub Imitted by such powerful inter ests as the banking and insur ance lobbies The Senate will experience some major changes because most of its key committee chairmens jobs are vacant One of Mr Andersons first or ders of business will be to fill the powerful post of chairman of the Senate Finance Com mittee He will also appoint new heads of the Judiciary Commit tee the Education Committee and the Codes Committee Political observers will also be watching to see if the Demo cratswho because of the No vember elections became more of a minority party than they [were last year  are going to [play a real part in key legisla tion or will resume the igno minious role of disgruntled on lookers assigned to theist a few years ago by the Republicans
The World,https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/learning-to-make-love-or-debauchery-france.html,Mrs Nicole Mercier is a liberal 28 yearold French high school teacher of philosophy She is among a large number of younger teachers who be lieve that French education is too rigid and who have been seeking ways of involving students snore actively She sees nothing wrong with teaching sex education in schools Georges Jaujard is a conservative Lieutenantcolonel in the French in fantry He clings to the traditional way of doing things and believes that there is a systematic campaign to bring on the decay of the young He does not want his 16yearold daughter learning about explicit sex in school Mrs Mercier and Colonel Jaujard are locked in a battle that reflects in microcosm a clash of the old and the new ways of life in France today The battle has rocked the provincial city of Belfort for weeks and calm re turned temporarily last week only be cause of the Christmas holidays Early in December a pamphlet Let Us Learn to Make Love a rather far out guide to sexual health reached the Belfort schools months after it had circulated widely in high schools in Paris and most other places in France Written by Dr Jean Carpentier who is of the leftist bent the pamphlet discusses sexual organs and urges adolescents to indulge themselves sex ually in defiance of what he terms hypocritical moral authority depriving the young of pleasure The booklet also recommends the free availability of contraceptiveswhich are sold legally in France A boy in Mrs Merciers class of stu dents 16 to 18 years old asked that the pamphlet be discussed in connec tion with the study of the theories of Freud and Wilhelm Reich The teacher put the proposal to a vote of the students and no one objected But Christine Jaujard told her father and he was enraged This is an invitation to debauchery he said of the pamphlet He sought out the Prosecutor of the Republic of Belfort Jacques Stamm who was sympathetic and said Mrs Mercier and her hus band also a philosophy teacher were clearly in liaison with subversive elements Mrs Mercier was ques tioned by police and charged with offending morals The charge triggered a storm that divided the city of 60000 into two hostile camps Teachers and students went on strike forcing Belforts three high schools to close for five days Citizen protest meetings were held and various groups supporting both sides of the question circulated pamphlets Mrs Mercier the focus of what has become a national debate is be wildered by it all I have never belonged to a political group she said I have always acted as an individual The Belfort affair is seen as an out growth of the controversy over whether there should be sex education in French schools The prevalent French belief long has been that sexual attitudes are family and religious mat ters and not proper for schools Things have loosened up lately though partly as a result of all the questioning that took place in France during the student revolts of 1968 There can be sex information of a technical nature imparted in the junior and senior years of high school when parents associations ask for it pe sponsibility is left up to the director of each school Some instruction also takes place on a more systematic basis in the technical high schools on the theory that students in these schools will be facing life earlier than their con temporaries in the academic schools In the Ministry of Education there is a commission now at work on a report to be presented next April on how to introduce sex information into regular programs of study If all goes well this could happen in the 1973 1974 school year But the indignation of some parents in Belfort gives a foretaste of possible opposition Something of a breakthrough on the sex front has just occurred in Parlia ment where the establishment of a Higher Council of Sex Information was approved despite some opposition from the Government and from con servatives The council is supposed to propose measures to the Govern ment to promote objective informa tion for married couples adults and children It is also supposed to help finance groups that disseminate in formation on birth control and other sexual problems Abortion however remains illegal How far all this will go is uncertain because the social barriers raised by centuries of tradition and Roman Catholicism are still high and many Frenchmen want to keep them that way

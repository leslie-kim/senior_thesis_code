Creating a women's world,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/02/archives/creating-a-womens-world-the-feminists-behind-daughters-inc-a.html,PLAINFIELD Vt There are five women at this huge farmhouse kitchen table nursing warm gin cold coffee and five manysplendored visions a feminist future Scattered on the table is the manuscript of a new book by a young writer whose last novel dealt coolly with women revolutionaries and homemade bombs Four of the women at the table are revolutionaries of a different but no less unusual stripe June Arnold publisher and novelist who dreams of building a feminist literature in which the power of womens words can reshape both the language and the culture in which they are written Parke Patty Bowman lawyer and editor who dreams of creating a great and powerful womens publishing house a prototype of feminist business where women and some day men will work successfully at what pleases them without having to please a boss or become one Bertha Harris novelist editor critic and teacher of womens studies who dreams of unleashing armies of beautiful furious demons in womens writing including her own Charlotte Bunch political theorist and strategist dreams of what must be done with dreams am the outsider here a fellow woman writer with feminist credentials but a notquitetrusted stranger I am the only woman at the table who is not clearly womanidentified The term does not signify lesbian sexuality although it may Rather it is used to define a woman whose primary working relationships are with and for other women with and for feminism I live with a husband and two adolescent sons Three of the four others here have been but are no longer married Two have young children But perhaps the widest gulf between us is as writers as professionals My books and articles are published by men whereas these women control their own works and the works of other women who are by and large womanidentified like themselves The ironic fact is that I would not even be here were it not for an establishment newspaperone of the many that do not review the books these women publish or report on their activities Still the mass media and their audience are intrigued by the phenomenon of women like these retreating advancinginto brave new feminist worlds of literature health sexuality and politics I am here to ask what they are up to and if it is really significant trend or merely another passing strangeness in a movement some say is already tearing apart over strangenesses of one kind or another At the moment June Patty Charlotte and Bertha are engaged in editing the spring 1977 list of books including the one on the table that will bear the imprint of a small thriving fouryearold house called Daughters Inc It is a house of and for women operating along with a traveling womens bookstore as a selfdefined feminist community that floats lightly and with apparent ease between New York City and this snug little corner of central Vermont The women of Daughters Inc a dozen of them or two loosely linked moving at different rhythms come together and separate fluidly when the work of the publishing house or the work of feminism demands attention They have bought a brownstone in New York and are transferring their main operation to the city Vermont winters have proved harder and lonelier than they anticipated when they moved here four years ago and the constant commuting now that they have grown is difficultespecially in bad flying weather In New York they can work closely with an expanding womens printing company Tower Press The Daughters community is not unique Indeed it is one of thousands suddenly springing to life across the United States in places as unlike as Greenwich Village and rural Plainfield There are feminists setting up shop as publishers printers farmers healers and even moneylenders in East Lansing Mich and Albuquerque NM Washington DC and Wolf Creek Ore Iowa City Austin Reno Philadelphia and Slingerlands NY These women do not constitute a ladies auxiliary for any hacktotheland counterculture Nor are they founding hippiestyle convents for troubled young female dropouts Like many in this vigorously moving part of the movement the participants in Plainfield are past youthfrom their early 30s to their 50s some have grown children some have children with them some have left children and husbands behind some still live with their families but devote their energy to allwoman enterprises They believe they are building the working models for the critical next stage of feminism full independence from the control and influence of maledominated institutionsthe news media the health education and legal systems the art theater and literary worlds the hanks Daughters Inc is not necessarily typical either in its politics or in the separatist life style of its members In my dictionary a separatist is one who withdraws from an established church or political bodyone who secedes But Patty June Bertha and Charlotte are not seceding they insist They are only withdrawing for a tirneto gather their strength and find their individual and collective voices It is easier to do that in a separate place a room of womans own Men they point out have always practiced this kind of separatismin their offices their army command posts their clubs bars and Senate cloakrooms And they never thought there was anything strange or lifethreatening about those support systems I mention that I have heard stories about separatist womens bookstores that will not sell books to men will not even allow men inside to browse and some that refuse to admit a woman accompanied by a teenage son June and Patty say the stories are exaggerated but everyone knows there are still extremists at large in the feminist press and elsewhere At a recent conference of feministmedia women there were lesbianonly workshops from which heterosexual women were excluded and there have been scattered incidents of lesbian poets or other speakers refusing to address mixed audiences of both gay and straight women The extremists are a small minority June says    most of us hate to see women fighting one another over this point We think each woman has the right to decide how separate she wants to he and from whomand for how long I ask how many of the womanidentified feminists they know still live with men They say maybe a third of the women in the feminist press network are married and living with their husbands Another not inconsiderable number are sexuallyor at least emotionallycelibate which they define as not committed to deep onetoone relationships of any kind But woman  identified the operative word also strongly implies a woman who is not supported by a manand neither wants nor expects to be In its publishing operation too Daughters Inc acts according to judgments and priorities that occasionally clash with those of more separatist feminist groups Its hooks are all written edited composed and designed by women but until now they have been printed by a male printer and shipped through the US Post Office Other feminist publishers print their own materials and distribute them only through Women in Distribution WIND a twoyearold collective that han dies over 160 titles and distributes nationally to womens bookstores Furthermore the women who run Daughters Inc select manuscripts for form and literary merit as well as for feminist content Others edit only for clear political messageon the ground that style and artistic quality are at this moment in feminist time beside the point Daughters has published 16 novels in three years including the autobiography of a London charwoman the memoirs of a seltconfessed drunken mother a fiction that dispenses with the pronouns he and she substituting a neuter na and a comic first novel about lesbianism that has sold 70000 copies without the benefit of ads or reviews in major newspapers mass distribution or guest shots by the author on network television Most first novels even with aggressive sales and publicity campaigns sell about Besides discovering and working with new women writers to develop something called the radical feminist novel Daughters has reissued important prefeminist womens books such as Penelope Mortimers The Pumpkin Eater a 1962 novel whose heroine feels whole only when she is pregnant or nursing babieshardly a creation reflecting a feminist party line Daughters founders defend the book among others as a valid expression of the female experience and therefore entirely worthy of all womens attention Daughters women and other feminist publishers and writers share a common philosophy Paraphrasing A J Liebling they declare that freedom of the press belongs to those who own the press In the other fields of new feminist endeavor the sentiments are the same Most of these women say they do not intend to remain separated foreveronly for as long as it takes to change the world Are you building an alternate society I ask the women at the table Of course not June Arnold exclaims with an infectious grin We are building the real society Theirs is the alternate June and Patty are grappling with an enviable problem The bestselling novel on their list Rubyfruit Jungle by Rita Mae Brown has just sold out its seventh printing The problem is that a group of men want to make a movie version of the book Rubyfruit is an outrageous parody of a Horatio Alger success story featuring a lesbian heroine The title is her affectionate nickname for the female genitalia June and Patty must decide whether to sell the books reprint rights which they control to one of the mass paperback publishers Sell out as they see it for a whopping sum of maleconglomerate money The author wants them to do it they dont Why not sell I say Why would it have to compromise anything Daughters Inc remains Daughters Inc Only it would be able to expand its publishing list raise its advances to writers stop dealing with male printers Maybe even start its own massreprint line You could become  really powerful Bertha stares into her coffee cup Her new novel lover just published by Daughters was lavishly praised in The Washington Post in one of the few major reviews of feministpress novel as a dazzling wonder of a book a Joycean spellbinder It will probably reach 10000 readers like her two previous books which were published by a conservative male house Bertha supports herself and her 13yearold daughter on her salary as a teacher of social sciences at a small New York college Though she is one of the rare writers whose creative muse is both nourished and inspired by her teaching her jobalong with the jobs of five other women may fall victim to the latest wave of city faculty budget cutbacks Bertha would be one of the women to benefit hugely if Daughters Inc took the financial leap into bigtime publishing Charlotte whose finely honed political analysis illuminates the pages of Quest A Feminist Quarterly perhaps the movements leading jour nal of ideas is thinking ahead She recognizes the urgent question of when and how to grow as a key issue for healthy feminist enterprises Choosing her words carefully Charlotte says It is the kind of decision June and Patty will have to make soon She pauses and then addsIts a decision well all have to make soon The others nod reacting not so much to what she says as to the undertone of reassurance She invariably gives the impression that she is facing an issue but not forcing it To feminists this is a crucial quality Charlotte Bunch 32 has been described as one of the movements hidden leaders But she seems to be trusted by an impressive number of otherwise disparate even clashing groups The trust is built at least in part on the fact that she has risen from within the ranks of the movement Gloria Steinem who works periodically with Charlotte when she contributes to Ms Magazine says There isnt a feminist hooked into the internal communications network of the movement who does not know and respect Charlotte Her name is a touchstone Success as Charlotte defines it is a matter of gaining power to control your own life Her vision of a feminist future extends that definition women building new institutions that control increasingly larger portions of their livesand Charlotte has been to extreme separatism and hack She thinks that women must now begin to commute in ever  shortening cycles between separatism and the countrys political and social centers where other women are already working to make changes from within Eventually she believes it willwe willall come together Some critical observers of feminist enterprises like Daughters have clubbed them toys and ridiculed the women involved in them for wasting precious time playing at autonomy I hey are damned for dabbling in a makebelieve female culture while the real womens movement hovers between life and political death Yet at the same time the women who succeed in these ventures are also attacked for surviving and making money  for imitating malemodel capitalism instead of finding the true feminist nonprofit nonexploit ivy non tureless andor ideologically pure way to liberation A broad streak of classic Marxist Socialism has been running through the womens movement since the early 1970s thanks largely to the numbers of young women who cut their radical teeth in the civilrights and newleft movements of the 1960s and then broke away in bitter disillusionment over the sexism of their young male colleagues Patty Bowman and Charlotte Bunch were both ac tive in the male left before their feminism forced them to veer off in their radical new As Patty puts it the new male left regards women as tradable propertyjust as the old male right does Besides she notes every class revolution ends up with just another bossman installing his own brand of censorship his secret police statues of himself and museums of his boyhood home We talk briefly about China and the fact that nobody really knows whats going on there now But referring to the recent purge of Chiang Ching Mao Tsetungs widow Patty says wryly We do know that an uppity woman still lands in the slammer Charlotte admits that developing a truly new political theory of feminism will be slow and painful Its so much easier to fall in love with either socialism or reformism she says Theyve both got history tradition and a fully developed body of thoughtnot to mention male financial support and prestige All the old trappings of security and male approval Feminism still cant promise a woman anythingnot even rhetoric let alone answers But weve got to find our own way Weve got to draw from other movements without losing ourselves in any of them Otherwisecome the revolution any revolutionwomen will still be dominated men We are talking about successor how to succeed without really sacrificing feminist principles I ask what would happen if Daughters and other feminist presses lured all the major women writers away from the male press June looks surprised Why would we want to she asks Go after major women writers Stars who were built by the male press We dont need them Patty says half jokingly We use manmade machinery to print our books But we dont have to use their women says June Besides we want to discover new womenthirdworld womenwomen whose books cant get published by men We wouldnt even want most of the womens books they publish Susan Brownmillers book on rape I persist Wouldnt you have wanted to publish that Yes she admits but there are very few of those But there are a few I say Even a few could make a big differencecouldnt they Wider readership public attention money to grow on That word money again June bristles We dont need their money We dont need their writers Patty muses It would be nice to cooperate with the others in some ways Buy our paper and boxes in volume Maybe buy our own  You could give more women jobsthey could quit working for men I say June still shakes her head We can afford to grow slowly We can afford to do it our way What if I suggest wellknown establishment women writers came to you voluntarilyif they were willing to take much less money than they could get from a male publisher Some of them do Patty says They give us books that their male publishers wont touchthemes that arent commercial They come to the feminist presses when they have to And they go back when they can says June I dont see why we should go after women like that How could we trust Charlotte says If they came to us with a book we really wantedand they were willing to sacrifice money and their male publishers seal of approval I would trust them That would be a commitment Maybe Id even trust them more than some women who publish with us only because they cant get published anywhere else I still dont see I say how you can afford to say no to so manyand what seem such easyways to grow bigger and stronger June shrugs I can afford to say no to anything she says lightly and then laughs Women have to learn they can afford to say no Shortly before I came to Plainfield Patty June Charlotte and Bertha attended secret feministpress convention held at a Campfire Girls camp near Omaha Neb One hundred and thirtytwo women representing more than 80 feminist companies engaged in various phases of publishing gathered together for the first time to chart their course and define their ultimate goalnot to become a unified underground womens press but actually to lead a feminist takeover of the nations media They were and are serious The only question is how they expect to succeed Many people including feminists are not aware that the feminist press has grown over the past five years into a lusty if dissonant Greek chorus of movement voices with exotic names off our backs Amazon Reality Sinister Wisdom The FlyByNight Printing Collective Paid My Dues and even with wry mischief The Vanity Press Despite such whimsy their novels periodicals pamphlets poetry and political journals now reach a regular readership of over 300000 women It is only through such papers as Big Mama Rag and off our backs that women all over the country learn where major feminist conferences areand suddenly they seem to be everywhere all the time Conferences on crimes against women womens art and music festivals rallies in support of individuals in trouble demonstrations for prostitutes rights for abortion against rape Such meetings are the vital connective tissue for movement womenserving as a return trip out of isolation a way to reach out touch and feeling A correspondent from the feminist newspaper off our backs reported from the Women in Print convention in Nebraska We went out into this big meadow and made a big map of the US standing where our cities were and we were everywhere It is astonishing to learn that such bursts of forward motion are happening at a time when the regular news media are filled only with the token advances of a handful of women stars in corporate jobs and politics or else with elaborate handwringing over the movements death or dismemberment all accompanied by rueful sighs or rude yawns It is late at night that we talk about our children I ask What about boy children have two teenage boys I see them growing into young men who will read Penthouse Magazine because their friends do One already hides it under his mattress He feels guilt not because its sexual but because its sexist and he knows I disapprove And I feel guilty because Ive created a new set of adolescent inhibitions about sex and it frightme June nods Her son Gus is 17 and goes to school in New York City June believes Gus is a different sort of boy because of his life in a feminist world He even got into a fight with his English teacher she tells me proudly because Gus insisted the pronoun he does not include she I say it is very hard to raise a boy child to fight against his worldto renounce masculine power and privileges only to he looked at as an oddball or worse by his peers Isnt it like deciding to remove a tomcats claws I ask and then sending him out to play withto compete withthe other tomcats June says there is no choice You have to remove the claws and then teach him how to survive by his wits his brains Hell learn to outsmart and outrun the others And in the end hell be the one who survives In the feminist world thats to come hell marry the best woman I say it seems to me that boy children are casualties of this painful transition period Feminist mothers are concentrating on themselves and their daughters the coming generation of free women Tune laughs We have trouble with the daughters too Some of them arc hopelessly attracted to macho men she explains and to male brutality and violence Why is that everyone wonders I think theyre trying June says seriously to get in touch with the violence within themselves Were all still afraid of that We have to begin to see it as energy as a great untapped force Power and eroticism Think of the passion little girls have for their horses We should never take away their horses It is 2 AM the fourth day of my visit before we get to the subject of sexand of lesbianism Charlotte has just written an article for Ms about lesbian separatism in which she said No woman is truly free to be anything unless she is also free to be a lesbian We agree that the term lesbian is no longer just a sexual definition Many feminists now consider it a highly charged political wordused to describe any woman who lives independently from men Charlotte explains that it if a logical extension in the sense that if your life is not bound up with men then in mens eyes you might as well be a lesbian Patty says Its a political stand to call yourself onelike the King of Denmark wearing a yellow armband to declare himself a Jew when the Nazis ordered all Danish We so need to develop new words Charlotte says We need words that support women and all forms of womens sexuality But she and the others reject the notion newly popular in some quarters that to be a feminist a woman must tty explore convert to lesbian sexuality Its not only a frightening idea says Charlotte its utterly false The worst thing about it is the overemphasis on sexuality as a definition of ones self Its just another way to create guiltthe way people are made to feel guilty if they arent hypersexed As if we all ought to be in a constant state of sexual fever chasing big Os instead of Over a year ago a woman who was completing a doctoral dissertation on feminist separatism wrote that the possibility of separating was always exaggerated because lets face it men are everywhere It strikes me that separatist women rarely talk about the strong ties they still have with men in their own lives I ask What about those of you who still hold regular jobs in male  dominated businesses Most of the feminist presses are far from selfsupporting or staffsupporting Some feminist publications or the women who work for them are supported by grants from churches or maledominated foundations Charlotte Bunchs own magazine Quest has been partly funded by the Institute for Policy Studies a prestigious Washington DC think tank where she is a fellow and the first woman to receive tenure Charlotte mentions that Quests male connection may in fact be severed soon Ironically and not untypically Charlotte predicts that the cutoff when it comes will propel Quests staff into the moment of leap which they havent quite seized for themselves Part of what holds them backbesides lack of moneyis the same emotional stumblingblock that hampers so many womens ambitions fear not of failure but of success fear of acquiring the power to make ones own dreams come true instead of waiting for a prince or even an ordinary man to do it Daughters Inc has not needed funding through grants but some of the writers it publishes have depended on such supplementary income in order to write Daughters does not discourage this practice on political grounds though again it clashes with the notion of full economic independence But the women of Daughters express concern over the recent news that one of their sister publishing houses the Feminist Press in Westbury N Y has accepted a grant to produce a nonsexist educational textbook for McGrawHill The discomfort is caused by their intense conviction that male money like male power can be habitforming Besides as they see it what the Man giveth the Man can and often does take away I have been plowing through dense thickets of feminist ideology including all the essays in two years issues of Quest A Feminist Quarterly which tries to winnow and tie the key branches into neat bundles marked theories of revolution processes of change or money fame and power mention that the one area in which I find the thinking blurry and uninspired is future visions in which contributors were asked to spin out fantasies of a feminist tomorrow The collected thoughts came from among others professors of law anthropology and womens studies as well as poets an architect a political scientist There were childlike drawings of cities with wombshaped feminist undergrounds feminist Rube Goldberg systems including a giant percolator that would draw people by vacuum pressure and perk them crosscountry in 15 minutes and stories about childwomen learning to trust one another Nobody came up with clear practical image of a political structure or technology not a concrete nutsandbolts blueprint of any kind Bertha thinks the vagueness may be a result of womens exclusion from the present world of technology We have to dream from our reality she says as in fiction Patty adds that women were asked for their ideas on building a futurea realm they have traditionally been excluded fromand of course their ideas were startling Women see an environment for comfort  for the aging children foodvery personal things Men build to escapo those very things Charlotte points out that the tendency to keep analyzing what we dont like and whyinstead of working out details of what we want insteadis typical of the early stages in every revolution So are the endless talking the thrashing out of differences factions and schisms and the need to refine and define ourselves Like adolescence I suggest Awkward but unavoidable Future Visions did include a fascinating interview with Joanna Russ a wellknown woman sciencefiction writer whose book The Female Man is something of a feminist classic In the interview Ms Russ was asked why her futurist world Whileaway had no men in it She replied I tried but the Whileawayans wouldnt let me She added that she could not imagine a twosexed egalitarian societyand that she didnt believe anyone else could Some women still believe passionately that we can function without leadership A few still think we can eliminate power But most of us are no longer naively saying they dont exist The realization that were going to have to deal with thembecause theyre going to happen anywayis the first step The speaker was Charlotte Bunch four years ago in an interview taped by the Feminist Radio Network And the question of leadersof who will take responsibility for womens decisions for womens collective actionhas yet to be answered As Charlotte herself admits women are still afraid to lead afraid to let each other lead afraid to be takenor to take themselvesseriously But if that is so I ask her then how and when will feminists ever realize their brave fantasies of taking over the media and the health and education establishments and all the other areas they speak so boldly about If they stay where they are huddling together for warmth and support playing hideandseek like little girls then arent these independent feminist enterprises merely toys and pastimes after all Charlotte says quietly We are beginning to ask that question ourselves Its a very good sign Listening to the women of Daughters Inc one begins to feel the stirring of old hopes the sense of excitement about women moving that many of us have not felt for a very long time Patty gets on the phone with one of the women from Tower Press June goes to her study in the converted stable to begin work on her own new novel Her latest Sister Gin was published by Daughters last fall Bertha gathers up the pages of MF Beals Angel Dance A Feminist Thriller which she will finish editing in New York And Charlotte prepares to fly to Washington to help close the next issue of Quest which analyzes the many faces of work work work Whether women like these will be leading the next phase of the womens movement re By their own definition and choice they are not an army these distinct and separate bands of women going quietly about their business in the womanspaces they have carved out for themselves Separate yet undeniably linked They still examine themselves incessantly picking nervously at every speck of weaknessor of strength They cling warily to their nonalignments even as they reach out toward one another through their media their meetings and perhaps after all their intuition Wouldnt it be pretty to think that the womens movement is not in the least shattered but only divided into valuable fragments like pieces of an immense interlocking picture puzzleor better yet a quilt patiently handstitched by many women working both separately and together That was the way they always made quilts and it was always amazing to see them become whole and beautiful A sampling of separatist sentiments On separatism Collectively women will use separatism in their struggle for liberation not because it is right or wrong realistic or fantastic difficult or groovy but because we have no choice Kings do not sit down with peasants Americans dont take tea with the Chinese and whites will not reckon with racism until the collective force of the opposition gives them no choice LUCIA VALESKA PhD Candidate University of New Mexico On women workers The existence of CLUW Coalition of Labor Union Women is a potentially crucial turning point [It] proves that the issues raised by the Womens Movement are not the gripes of neurotic middleclass ladies but    issues of great importance to a broad spectrum of workers    Without a strong revolutionary womens movement a working womens organization cannot succeed and without a successful organization of working women the Womens Movement cannot be revolutionary ANNE MARIE TROGER On religion Wimmins religion sicthe word women is spelled differently to separate it from the male derivative women will not in any way be similar to patriarchal churches There will be no separation of clergy from people    of body from soul    We know wimmin who can heal by touch by astral massage by foot reflexology We dont quite know where all of this is leading but we seem to be doing something if not everything right Z BUDAPEST Founder The first presentday Feminist Church to the Goddess for women Only On power Women must have power We must have it in all spherespolitical economic and culturalas well as power over our own beings  Some argue that a revolutionary womens goal is the end of powerto create a world not based on any power dynamicsand that association with male power will necessarily corrupt us    Perhaps ultimately we can dream of an end to power But first women must gain enough control over society to end patriarchal domination and destruction of the world in that process we hope we can change the nature of power but we cannot avoid or ignore it CHARLOTTE BUNCH Institute for Policy Studies Washington On Marxism I consider myself a Socialist but    at this point a marriage between Marxism and Feminism would be a typical union in which the female partner lacking a firm identity gets swallowed up    Like other newly born perspectives Feminism has been operating largely with borrowed concepts    We still have no adequate descriptive concepts to help us understand womens roles or the power relations between women and men We still do not understand what sexism is LINDA

"770,000 Women Turned Down in 1975",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/02/archives/770000-women-turned-down-in-1975-though-legal-abortions-are-not.html,It was in January 1973 that the United States Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision invalidating most state antiabortion statutes The ruling established the right to abortion at least in the earlier stages of pregnancy and it appeared at the time that the abortion issue was settled Now almost four years later it is clear that things have worked out only partly as expected Many women have benefited from the Courts decision But many others who want abortions have difficulty finding someone to do them or cannot find anyone at all Since the Court legalized abortions 36 million of them have been performed in this country The number being done in rural and suburban areas has gone up Nevertheless 95 percent are still performed in a few large cities especially New York and California which had more liberal abortion laws than other states even before the decision The result is that as many as 770000 women who needed abortions in 1975mostly the young poor and ruralcould not et them and almost half a million of the women who did undergo them had to travel to another county or state do so Why almost four years after the Courts ruling does this uneven pattern of availability persist Studies by Planned Parenthoods Alan Guttmacher Institute show that most hospitals still prefer to avoid the operation Their medical boards fear political pressure from antiabortion groups and many physicians in private practice find abortion a distasteful and boring surgical procedure As of early 1975 only 27 percent of the 5400 nonCatholic shortterm general hospitals in the United States provided any abortion services a response so limited as to be tantamount to no response according to the institute The Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments within the next few months on whether public hospitals have an obligation to make their facilities available for abortion Meanwhile to fill the need 350 abortion clinics have opened many of them staffed by moonlighting doctors whose primary jobs are as hospital residents These clinics are safe and cheaper than hospitals They charge about 175 for an outpatient abortion during the first three months pregnancy compared with the 300 to 500 asked by most hospitals which usually keep the patient overnight billing her for inpatient services even though 90 percent of women who have abortions do so early in pregnancy and therefore have no need for prolonged care The procedure generally used for aborting early pregnancies is a suction technique called vacuum aspiration which has largely replaced the more painful dilation and curettage Clinics provide 55 percent of all abortions private hospitals 32 percent public hospitals 10 percent and doctors offices 3 percent From these figures it appears that middleclass women are benefiting most from the Court decision because they have easier access to private hospitals and clinics while lowerincome women tend to depend on public hospitals for their medical needs however wnen abortions were illegal miacile and upperincome women were generally able to obtain one just the same even if it meant traveling to turope wtule the very poor sufrerea most Now since legalization the number of abortions is more than twice as high for lowerincome black women than for inmateincome write women 31 per 1000 women or childbearing age compared with 14 per 1000 women of that age These rigures indicate that many poor minority group women who want abortions are in fact now able to obtain them One reason is that clinics otters accept Medicaid payments tnus opening even private xacilities to the poor Because abortion is more readily available fewer women at all social levels are dying from selfinduced or other unskilled abortions Before the Supreme Court decision there were 30 deaths for every 100000 illegal operations Today as the most common nondiagnostic surgery abortion is safer than tonsillectomy or even childbirth mere are 3i deaths per 100000 legal abortions compared with 15 for every 100000 live births In addition to reducing deaths abortion saves taxpayers 550 million a year in welfare costs that the Department of health Education and Welfare estimates would nave gone to support unwanted banies born to lowincome women Medicaid spends about suu million a year in taxpayers money to pay for abortions for tnese women so tne cost benefits are clear Hidden Need Hundreds of thousands of illegal abortions were performed in the late 1960s and while everyone agrees that the rate is rising no one knows how many would not be done today if they had remained illegal However increased availability of the procedure has disclosed a great and previously hidden need for it In Orlando Fla for example there were no reported abortions in the first quarter of 1973 at the time of the Court decision One year later in the first quarter oi7 1974 and with abortion legal and easier to come by 1150 were performed there Much of the need that has come to light is among unwed teenagers Onethird of all abortions are now obtained by women under the age of 20 and studies show that while young women of all income levels are beginning sexual activity at earlier ages with very poor contraceptive methods since 1973 fewer young unmarried girls are giving birth The legalization of abortion has not entirely done away with the psychological trauma it causes The decision to abort is still a difficult one for the millions of women who make it the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science reports that emotional stress and pain are always involved However the Institute adds the feelings of guilt regret or loss elicited by a legal abortion are generally temporary and appear to be outweighed by positive life changes and feelings of relief Terri Schultz is a freelance

Planned Parenthood Organization Asserts Yellow Pages Censors It,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/08/archives/planned-parenthood-organization-asserts-yellow-pages-censors-it.html,Planned Parenthood of New York City accused the New York Telephone Company yesterday of arbitrary and discriminatory censorship for refusing to let the organization list its services fully in an advertisement in the 1977 Manhattan Yellow Pages The telephone company replied that it was merely acting under state guidelines in prohibiting the advertisement of specific medical procedures by licensed physicians or by third parties in their behalf At a news conference in which he made public a letter of complaint to the state Public Service Commission Alfred F Moran executive vice president of the nonprofit Planned Parenthood organization said that it had been asked by the phone company to indicate only that it offered information about sterilization infertility and abortion instead of that if actually offered those services It seems Ma Bell is acting like Grandma Bellbirth control has been out of the plain brown wrapper for years said mr Moran Its time that the phone company realizes that all these services are fully legal and used by millions of New Yorkers every year Mr Moran said Planned Parenthood might take the case to court if the commission did not tell the phone company to publish the ad as it was written or if this was too late to print it in a separate erratum listing Spokesmen for the Public Service ComMission said it was investigating the complaint but noted that it was in the process of challenging a State Supreme Court decision that greatly limited its jurisdiction over Yellow Page directories Although the advertisement was submitted last October the organization was informed for the first time two months later that changes would have to be made Mr Moran asserted He said that he was told informally that a midDecember deadline would be extended but that he was then told only late last Tuesday that the final deadline would be yesterday The advertisement for the organizations Margaret Sanger Center at 380 Second Avenue listed birth control pregnancy detection abortion up to 12 weeks sterilization infertility treatment referral and counseling and special services for teens at moderate fees Mr Moran said the phone company at first wanted reference to sterilization and infertility deleted altogether although it found abortion information acceptable We didnt understand what their mentality was to make this kind of distinction he said adding They can deal with sexual therapy [in directory advertisements] and massage parlors but when it comes to people controlling their own reproduction their mind goes blank The complaint to the PSC said among other things that requirements for the advertisement were inconsistent with those for other ads The Yellow Pages it said include listings of physicians specialties and even a listing under clinics for a society offering abortion birth control help regardless of agefree pregnancy tests Rebutting the accusations the telephone company said it accepts advertising in its yellow pages for abortion and birthcontrol information and referrals It added Currently however our regulations which were formulated under guidelines established by state authorities do not permit the advertising of specific medical procedures by licensed physicians or third parties in their behalf
Birth Rate in New York City Is the Lowest Since 1936,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/09/archives/birth-rate-in-new-york-city-is-the-lowest-since-1936.html,The birth rate in New York City last year reached its lowest level since 1936 the Department of Health reported last week Dr Pascal J Imperato the new Commissioner of Health attributed the decline to the increased use of family planking and the sixyearold state law that legalized abortions The decline reflected a national trend that saw the birth rate go down in 1976 to 146 births per 1000 population from 148 in 1975 The citys birth rate per 1000 as computed by the Department of Health was 108 Cr a total of 109250 live births This lgure was the lowest rate since the 136 recorded 40 years ago During the four decades the rate fluctuated considerably reaching a high of 22 in 1947 the bumper year during the baby boom following World War II And while the rate remained relatively high during the 50s and the 60s which recorded average rates of 209 and 202 the rates then began to decline in 1969 Dr Melvin S Schwartz assistant commissioner for biostatistics said that the decline in births had come at a time when the citys relatively static population was getting younger Dr Schwartz said that last year the citys infant mortality rate had reached a low of 191 deaths for each 1000 live births compared with the 193 rate in 1975 Dr Schwartz attributed the lower mortality to the increased use of prenatal counseling He said that department statistics showed that the death rate of infants of women without husbands was higher than other infants The infant mortality rate also was higher for infants with teenage mothers Maternal Mortality Declines The maternal mortality rate declined to 26 deaths per 10000 live births a rate that was 60 percent lower than the 61 death rate recorded before abortions were legalized For the general population the department listed the death rate slightly higher than 1975 77166 deaths compared with 76312 essentially because of an outbreak of respiratory diseases early in the year As for venereal disease the department said that while syphilis declined there was an increase in gonorrhea increasing from a rate of 609 cases per 100000 to 629 and reflecting a national trend The 10 leading causes of death in 1976 were the same as 1975heart disease cancer cerebrovascular disease influenza and pneumonia cirrhosis of the liver diabetes mellitus homicides accidents circulatory system diseases and perinatal mortality The first three diseases represented 70 percent of all deaths While ranked 12th in 1970 homicides were in seventh place last year
With knife and compassion,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/09/archives/with-knife-and-compassion-mortal-lessons.html,The great questions are the nature of life and death and because they are no easier to answer by shooting expeditions off to Mars than by a painstaking attentiveness at home we can all have at least a sense of participating in the attempt Lately the common bias has leaned toward an agnostic view that death and life are enemiesmortal enemies no less Its a mistake to hobble such a crucial quest with biases however and to forget that from another older perspective there may be a dear kinship between the two the sort of friendship that exists for example as we hear clearly between trumpets and trom The first virtue of Mortal Lessons Richard Selzers careening passionate book of knowledge is that his eyes are wide open He is a surgeon and there have been a lot of writing doctorsthe seriousness of the profession encourages long thoughts But he is not too busy and selfcertain not to get up early and watch the Dalai Lamas physician who is visiting the Yale Medical School make a complicated diagnosis on the basis of plumbing the patients pulse for half an hour and Inhaling three times the smell of the foam of her urine whipped up for several minutes in a wooden bowl He goes to see a shortorder cook who has refused to be operated on al though a cancer has eaten a mouthsized hole in the top of his headgoes to check on him repeatedly and finds that the tumor has healed by itself with nothing in the way of treatment besides washings with holy water This is to say that Dr Selzer is utterly empirical His book of essays will tell you all you want to know about your liver and your bladder your bones and prostate gland Also the process by which compassion arises in a doctor in the course of his career Slowly it gathers  until it is a pure calling  an exclusive sound like the cry of certain solitary birds  Out of the resonance between the sick man and the one who tends him there may spring that profound courtesy that the religious call Love Love and flesh is what he writes about The botfly larva excavating the archeologists arm the abortion Selzer doesnt do them in which the expelled fetus cried He has a special passion for the stomach and a special faculty for describing his own tools especially the knife or conversely the undertakers implements the many fates of a dead body embalmment or the crematorium or a medical schools cadaver tank His previous book was a collection of short stories Rituals of Surgery that less successfully went at the same chunk of experience But the essay is the traditional form with which to have a go at organizing ones impressions and a doctor daily grips the subject of life and death with both hands Indeed Selzer uses the image of a mountain climber dangling along the wall of the body cavity to describe the sensation of operating At his worst Selzer fills his paragraphs with rhetorical questions such as What plague is this that so thrives in the night a whole forest is notoriously laid waste from the chapter on baldness alternating them with overblown 17century prose that reads like a takeoff on Samuel Pepys and Sir Thotnas Browne He can sound like any one of 90000 other professional men who will sit down this evening after work under the influence of the midlife crisis and an eccentric course of reading to put down various childhood recollections and philosophical blowings An impatient person will simply want to rip out the last third of the book and skip the autobiographical essays placed there because earlier at his best Selzer invites comparison with the invaluable Loren Eiseley Like Eiseley Selzer didnt begin to publish essays before his middle years and now has at his fingertips a store of information from his primary career that no professional writer could match Full of the gift of wonder open to poetry and the other arts or to any sort of inkling that may reach beyond his scientific specialty he has a great deal working for him Like Eiseley he drives mostly at high speed Both lack the variety of a professional writer probably because they dont realize that the balancing of excitement and mundane humor and nutsandbolts trivia that made for excellence in their primary careers is just as much a part of good writing Eiseley thinks in overdrivemoves about forever in the posture of Rodins Thinker meditating for the world it seems just as some Benedictine monks believe they are doing the praying for all the rest of us He cannot even suffer from insomnia without considering it his duty to apply his mind to serve mankind right then and there And Selzer too although he has more humility but less power and originality than Eiseley overwrites hitting only the high spots in distilled highpitched jottings keeping his lighter moments for the practice of medi cine no doubt Nevertheless hes marvelously promising The flooring of my own faith in life is the year I spent working in a hospital morgue seeing the contentment or sometimes the joy and even radiance that in the closing instants of life had seized the faces of many of of the dead I had assumed they might have finally recognized what death was but recent research by Russell Noyes and Roy Kletti of the University of Iowa with people who have survived neardrownings hairraising falls and other horrific mishaps would seem to hint that on the contrary these dead peoplein a panoramic rush of memories of enormous velocity may have been reviewing the course of their own lives instead As they gave up hope of saving themselves and surrendered themselves to death they may have discovered an overall benignity to life an ebullience in retrospect Codas on matters like this would fit Selzers talent perfectly

A Little South Of Center,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/16/archives/the-weekly-in-review-a-little-south-of-center.html,WASHINGTON Jan 15The Presidential transition period or exhibition season is now over for Mr Carter He has picked his assistant coaches and his first and second teams and has made clear that he will be sending in the plays from the Oval Office This interlude between election and inauguration has been a period of intense even excessive speculation considering how very little hard evidence we have on these amiable strangers Every players record has been examined every tea leaf has been turned over and analyzed but the plain fact is that even with a scorecard nobody around here knows much about the new players There are however already some obvious changes in style manner and emphasis It is too early to tell whether Mr Carter is left of center or right of center but he is certainly South of Center with a different pace and tone and approach to his job He has first of all worked with hard selfdiscipline He has already spent more hours questioning and listening to his Cabinet appointees and the Joint Chiefs of Staff than most recent Presidents usually did in months He kept them at it four and five hours at a time without a break and what is less reassuring without a joke Small talk is apparently not his favorite pastime His new colleagues have of course been watching him very closely and they seem to have some common impressions He is informal cautious hell on waste and pretense and maybe even a bit of a tightwad When he in structed Fritz Mondale to make a quick trip to Europe and Japan right after the inauguration the Secret Service planned the normal security arrangements for a Vice President They would fly the bulletproof limousines to London Paris and Tokyo Carter vetoed it Why he asked Mondale should we assume that you need more protection than theyd give to their own presidents or prime ministers Mr Mondale is working in Room 443 of the Old Senate Office Building in his shirtsleeves surrounded by the debris of defeated Senators Mike Blumenthal is camping out at Room 3000 in the Treasury Building an abandoned office with holes in the ceiling Plain as Plains Ga is Carters austere approach though Washirigton will probably try to fancy him up later There are going to be a lot of unemployed chauffeurs and flunkies around here after a few days and its not only the White House staff dominated by the men who helped him knock over the Democratic Party and capture the White House who are on notice to cut staff by 30 percent The word bas also gone out to Vance Blumenthal and Mondale to do the same Mr Carters Cabinet is an important symbol Not a Kissinger or a Simonno Lone Rangers like Kissinger at State or economic theologians like Simon at Treasurynot a boatrocker in the crowd Mr Carter has been very insistent on this point He hasnt told the country yet where hes going but he has decided very carefully who is going with him and has insisted that they all go together For example he not only picked a Cabinet of people he thought would cooperate with one another but insisted on this principle of cooperation in the selection of deputy secretaries of the departments He gave the Secretaries of State Defense Treasury etc a free hand to pick their No 2 men but made them discuss together and try to agree on a subCabinet that would be experienced and compatible No football coach whether George Allen of the Washington Redskins or Bear Bryant of the University of Alabama ever put more emphasis on teamwork than Jimmy Carter or paradoxically insisted more on the coachs right to call the signals It is now plain or soon will be that once Mr Carter has to decide between the terrible choices on defense welfare health abortion busing and many other things that many of his supporters are going to be disappointed aggrieved or even hostile For it is not reasonable that he can continue to satisfy the diverse and even contradictory political leaders and forces that brought him to the Presidency or that he will be able to represent such different things to such different people But knowing this he has clearly been determined to reassure his potential political economic and international adversaries and avoid turmoil as much as possible within his own official family All this he has done during the transition not to the satisfaction of the extreme liberal and conservative elements within his own party but with an admirable sense of balance a respect for the people who doubt or oppose him and maybe most important with a courtesy and attention to human sensitivities unmatched around here in recent memory So Washington awaits his arrival The bleachers are up along the Long March from Capitol Hill to the White House now gleaming under snow and ice and seldom more beautiful Carter has done very well in the transition period but the exhibition season is over and in a few days the big test will begin
West German Women: Few Gains in Equality Since the War,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/18/archives/west-german-women-few-gains-in-equality-since-the-war.html,BONN Jan 17The West German Hausfrau is a long way from liberation after a quarter of a century of democratic reforms that have created equality of man and woman mainly on paper Politics in West Germany is still a male preserve with women in small minorities in the political parties and in Parliament Running West German industry is almost exclusively a mans business Women more than a third of the labor force earn a third less than men When times are tough unemployment becomes a womens problem At the beginning of this year 52 percent of all unemployed West German workers 516585 of them were women Men Have to Earn More I have to work just as hard as the men in my textile plant said Gisela Lohrey in Giessen the other day They make more money than I do and Ive been working for 27 years The boss just tells me men have to earn more they have to support their families Mrs Lohrey says she gets little sympathy from her husband who works on the railroad She shrugs and quotes him I didnt send you out to work he tells me West Germany has no powerful womens liberation movement like the one in the United States It has been mainly in recent years that politicians have become aware of womens problems Where change has come it has been in legal areas such as the divorce law or the credit lawwomen have been able to get bank loans without their husbands for nearly 20 years At the close of last year a parliamentary commission of inquiry on Woman and Society found among other things that West German women make less money have less education and far less freedom to choose careers and improve social standing than men The problem isnt the law said Dr Helge Pross a sociologist who was one of the consultants to the commission The problem is the way people think German women have had a harder time asserting themselves than many of their European neighbors After a brief emancipation during the Weimar Republic of the 1920sand 30s Nazi ideology set women back into the Stone Age perverting Germanic myth to make womans highest purpose the bearing of Aryan children to perpetuate the master race The masters of course were to be men All Persons Shall Be Equal In 1949 the West German Constitution had this to say in Article III All persons shall be equal before the law men and women shall have equal rights But last years commission report found that the Constitution and reality are far apart We dont need an equalrights amendment Dr Pross said but we have to change a whole cultural tradition West German schools have only morning sessions Working mothers of schoolage children either have to leave the children alone during lunch and in the afternoon or they have to find household help Erika Rohleder a labor union leader in Giessen said My husband died when our children were 8 and 10 I was left alone and had to work halfdays at first after I made the children understand why I had to go away and leave them If her children had been preschoolers when her husband died Mrs Rohleder said there would have been nothing I could doand she would have had to go on welfare Other single women with children like Henriette Drr of Bonn have to live with their parents to get by Mrs Drr leaves her home at 7 every day and comes back at 3 leaving her daughter Kerstin a thirdgrader in her mothers care Many parents still think education for daughters is a luxury A 30yearold woman in Frankfurt works as a buyer for a department store On graduation from high school she wanted to study medicine She wanted to her husband said but her father told her he wouldnt give her the money He didnt believe a woman should go to university at all Younger women less restricted by the prejudices of the past push their way through to studies more often But still only 32 percent of all West German university students are female The Countess Who Smoked on TV The most prominent businesswoman in West Germany is Dr Elisabeth NoelleNeumann who started her own publicopinion institute after World War II Even journalism a field relatively open to women has few at the top Countess Marion Donhoff publisher of the weekly Die Zeit is a notable exception Werner Hofer is the host of a weekly television talk show Frhschoppen an untranslatable term meaning roughly a freeandeasy gathering over wine When he was asked why he has had so few female guests over the last 25 years he replied that there were few good ones He added When Marion Dnhoff took her seat at my side for the first timeshe occasionally puffed a cigarette thenI got a scolding letter A German lady does not smoke and certainly not a countess Women workers are automatically classified by unions and employers as light workers The average hourly wage for male industrial workers in West Germany in 1975 was 443 women made an average of only 320 an hour As the parliamentary commissions report put it Untrained male workers had in general higher earnings than female skilled workers And yet there is little militancy among female workers Mrs Rohleder the labor union official told of being asked to arrange a discussion with some women working in the Giessen area I had trouble she said Most of them were afraid that word would get back to their employers or to their husbands and didnt want to participate In the 1930s Dr Pross said unemployment was an explosive political issue in Germany Today even though its been higher than one million for most of the last two years its not a cause of instability Maybe one of the reasons is that most of the unemployed are women That is not widely known here West German newspapers have emphasized the statisticsmore than a million out of work a record postwar numberwithout breaking them down But if unemployed women many of whom held only part time jobs and foreign workers are sub tracted the figure is much less ominous Only 477508 West German men were out of work at the beginning of this year nothing remotely comparable to the Great Depression of the 1930s According to the Federal Labor Office in Nuremberg there are now only 2000 women seeking only parttime jobs among the 182000 unemployed there Few such jobs are available Because so many women are untrained or parttime help Dr Pross said theyre the first to be fired in a recession and theyre the last to be hired when its over For the 96 million women who do work daily life poses many obstacles Mailmen repairmen and deliverymen operate 8 to 4 so working couples either miss deliveries or one of them has to take a day off to be at home when the plumber comes Shopping hours end rigidly everywhere at 630 PM forcing most people to face a crowded rushed period at the end of the working day to buy groceries Cleanliness is a Chore The unspoken assumption of the law is that one member of the household the woman has all day long to do that Kindergartens and daycare centers are hardly ever open all day long Gertrud Schne told of going to work 15 years ago to help her husband pay for their house in the central West German village of Hungen The kindergarten she said of her life today opens up in the morning and closes and sends the kids home for lunch Theyre not set up to give you an uninterrupted free block of time for work or anything else Even the traditional German virtue of cleanliness works to keep women in the home at traditional tasks especially in small towns My neighbor came over the day after we moved in an American woman who lived outside Frankfurt recalled with amusement and informed me that in this town we wash our windows once a week Theres an old German saying Politics is mans business Dr Pross said Weve made enough progress so that no West German politician would ever say that publicly But her commission found that women make up less than 20 percent of the membership of the major political parties The smaller the town the fewer the women who take part in public affairs Of the 518 members of Parliament elected last October only 38 are women Two of them Marie Schlei a former schoolteacher from Berlin and Antje Huber are in Chancellor Helmut Schmidts Cabinet respectively as Minister of Foreign Aid and Minister of Health The Health Ministry is not even in charge of the countrys vast health insurance system That is the business of the Minister of Labor who is a man From 1972 until last month the ceremonial post of President of Parliament was held by Annemarie RengerLoncarevic who is a Social Democrat Her selection for the post whose duties consist mainly of seeing that members of Parliament remain civil while haranguing one another was regarded by some women as a symbolic step But in December even that job was returned to a man the Christian Democratic leader Karl Carstens since the Social Democrats had lost their position as the largest single parliamentary bloc in the October elections Women here still do not have the right to choose abortion over childbirth The Government of former Chancellor Willy Brant tried to make abortion legal but the law was declared unconstitutional Today as in the past almost all women who want abortions for any but medicalemergency reasons cannot get the job done here Those who have enough money go to the Netherlands or some other country where it is legal or it is tolerated How long will it take to change all this To the end of the century Dr Pross said But slowly things are changing Already there are big differences in expectations and in education in life styles between women under 30 and those over 30 The biggest problem most women have is their own lack of selfconfidence
The Growing Women's Studies Movement Gets Organized,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/18/archives/the-growing-womens-studies-movement-gets-organized.html,SAN FRANCISCO Jan I7 A sense of historic purpose pervaded deliberations at the University of San Francisco this past weekend as more than 500 women from throughout the United States met to found the National Womens Studies Association The new organization is unusual among academically oriented groups in that it is closely tied to a broader philosophy the womens liberation movement which helped give birth to the first womens studies programs just seven and a half years ago Since then womens studies has been one of the fastest growing areas in higher education More than 100 colleges and universities now offer majors or minors in the field at least a dozen offer masters degrees and three have programs at the PhD level About 200 other schools have courses related to womens studies Womens studies can include anything from the writings of Louisa Mae Alcott to the influence of pioneer women in the early West Rape and abortion are obvious topics but the studies often include such subjects as women and violence the difficulties in operating womens health clinics efforts to make women feel more comfortable with mathematics and help with acquiring the skills and confidence to compete for jobs as executives But being new and sometimes controversial the programs in many institutions have continued on a tentative basis despite surging enrollments And with the onset of financial exigency in higher education professors and students in womens studies contend that the programs are especially vulnerable to cutbacks by administrations that often did not welcome them in the first place The formation of the National Womens Studies Association this past weekend represents in part an effort to unify and strengthen the disparate programs a step that supporters hope will lend legitimacy and protection to womens studies and stimulate further growth of the new field The new organization plans to back feminist causes of all kinds and help lobby for the support of womens studies on campuses and in elementary and secondary schools around the country It expects to encourage the development of a network for distributing information on womens studies and to cooperate closely with womens projects in the communities Compared with the number of colleges and universities in the country the number of womens studies programs that are recognized and buddeted is serial said Blanche Hersh coordinator of womens studies at Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago But for every existing program Professor Hersh continued there are 20 edging toward formation and one of the most exciting things about this conference is the prospect that the creation of a national association will accelerate the process Many of the convention delegates who ranged from teenagers in jeans to whitehaired grandmothers in pants suits wore Tshirts proclaim ing such messages as support for the equal rights amendment or simply emblazoned with the word Arise In spite of a determination to avoid divisiveness the women found themselves split in their reaction to finding two male delegates in their midst at the first plenary session I understand it completely but Im representing my college Norman F Cohen a historian who teaches a course on sex laws at Occidental College in Los Angeles said For me to be excluded would be to deny my college representation since they sent me as their delegate The other male delegate was Jack Winkler of Yale University a teacher in classics and womens studies Later in framing the constitution the subcommittee on membership narrowly turned down 17 to 16 a proposal to limit men to nonvoting affiliate status in the new association In forming the organization the women were sensitive to the fact that unlike many academic societies the National Womens Study Association will not be organized around a single discipline such as history or political science or mathematics While critics contend that womens studies is not an academic field those engaged in the programs maintain that they are dealing with a concept that can best be addressed only through an interdisciplinary approach that draws on traditional disciplines and creates something new in the process Another aspect of the reservations about womens studies has to do with the level of scholarship and research Catharine Stimpson a Barnard College professor who edits Signs a popular new journal in the field defended the state of scholarship in womens studies as as good as anything going Sometimes it may be flawed by advocacy she said But less so than people think When there is advocacy it is easily discernible and it is there for good ends Some of the research priorities may be set by the politics of the womens movement but that is all right as long as youre neither corrupt nor deceitful about what youre doing
"Policy Setter, K. M. Cahill, M.D.",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/18/archives/policy-setter-km-cahill-md-kevin-m-cahill-md-as-careys-1ayear-aide.html,ALBANY Jan 17There is one fact about Kevin M Cahill MD on which virtually everyone here is agreed that in the area of health care he is the single most important policymaker in New York State What people disagree on is whether that is good or bad In two years as Governor Careys 1ayear special assistant for health affairs Dr Cahill has emerged as the most controversial member of an administration that has had its full share of controversy His supporters say that he has been exactly what the outsized and complacent health establishment in the state needed mostsomeone with no ties to the bureaucracy and with the full confidence of the Governor who could sweep into Albany shake up old assumptions and bring health care into line with new fiscal constraints His detractors say that as a doctor in private practicehis specialty is tropical medicineDr Cahill had little training to deal with thorny issues ranging from Medicaid rates to mental retardation and that his attempt to do so on his onedayaweek visits to Albany has disrupted the normal functioning of two major state departments and can have no lasting effect Both campsand each includes some of the people closest to the centers of power hereagree that the 40yearold doctor distantly related to Governor Carey by marriage is one of the most interesting men to emerge from private recesses of the Governors inner circle He has lived and practiced medicine all over the world served as an adviser to Roman Catholic cardinals and heads of state and published books on everything from the relationship of medicine and foreign policy to how to avoid the discomforts of turista Family Doctor and a Best Friend Dr Cahills relationship with the Governor is equally interesting In addition to being the Carey familys personal physicianhe cared for Helen O Carey the Governors wife before her death from cancer in 1974he is also one of Mr Careys best friends They socialize frequently and talk on the telephone several times a day Dr Cahill who lives with his wife and five sons on the Upper West Side of Manhattan stays in the Governors Mansion when he is in Albany Hugh is a wise and incredibly good human being Dr Cahill said the other day during an interview in his Fifth Avenue medical office which is connected to the Governors office by two tielines He has a total commitment to bringing the healthcare system into balance with reality so it can continue to survive I will translate that commitment into action even if it means stepping on toes Im not a heroworshiper and Im not infatuated either with power or with Hugh Carey I simply like him very much and Id rather work on problems in a relationship that I enjoy For his part the 57yearold Governor who usually refers to friend in public as Dr Cahill just as the doctor frequently refers to the Governor as Hugh described Dr Cahills role the other day in these words Kevin Cahill is the guardian the pioneer the referee and the counselor in programs of public health Most of the people who have top positions in the Carey administration did not know the Governor before he called them to Albany and his relationships with them while no longer formal are still essentially businesslike An Unusual Member of the Team So his very closeness to the Governor would make Kevin Cahill an unusual member of the Carey team even if it were not for the unusual breadth of his responsibilities His broad mandate is overall supervision of two of the stale governments biggest and traditionally most unmanageable departments Health and Mental Hygiene He described his own role himself at a meeting last fall of leading hospital and health care officials saying The Governor wants no buffer between his office and the real problems of the healthcare system My appointment was not an accident or the reflection of friendship but a deliberate decision by the Governor to have a single individual in his office responsible for issues that today more frequently than not transcend traditional departmental barriers The meeting he addressed on that occasion took place at the Fifth Avenue headquarters of the American Irish Historical Society an organization that Dr Cahill serves as presidentgeneral and to which he is devoted The grandson of Irish immigrantshis County Kerry grandfather was policeman and his Dublinborn grandfather was a bookiehe is intensely proud of both things Irish in general and of the workingclass origins of most IrishAmericans His words of greeting to the health officials were typical of his approach to the subject With the warmth and poetry and innocence of my Irish background he began tempered by the streetwise wisdom of my immigrant forebears whose tale this society celebrates I welcome you to our home Dr Cahill travels frequently to Dublin as professor of tropical medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons there In the United States he is director of the Tropical Disease Center at Lenox Hill Hospital and a professor of Public Health at the New Jersey College of Medicine in Newark He conducts a portion of his busy private practice by mail analyzing samples sent to him by parasiteafflicted residents of remote regions He headed the medical relief effort after the earthquake in Nicaragua several years ago went to Guatemala in an advisory role after the earthquake there last winter and will travel to Somalia next summer to review the progress of a healthdelivery system he set up there some years back To those who question what a tropicalmedicine specialty has to do with overseeing a health department in one of the Northern Hemispheres most industrialized areas he points out that both jobs contain the same challenge of allocating scarce resources in the best wayplus the courage to recognize that you cant solve everyones problems His Varied Tasks Dr Cahills specific tasks in the two years have ranged from helping to devise a new malpractice insurance system in the midst of a doctors strike in 1975 to chairing task forces on Medicaid fraud and juvenile crime He has advised the Governor on reorganization of the Mental Hygiene Department on the veto of a bill restricting the access of teenaged girls to abortion on hospital affiliation contracts on the construction of a new burn hospital on a nursinghome rate freeze and on hospital employee strikes Except for the Urban Develoment Corporation and the spring borrowing the list is a virtual accounting of the administrations major policy problems Sometimes his involvement can be extremely detailed During the last legislative session he was a strong advocate for a measure known as the nurse practice bill which redefined in general terms the responsibilities of nurses and their relationship to physicians Many nurses opposed the bill and many legislators said they could not understand it The bill came up once in the Assembly and was defeated Albert H Blumenthal of Manhattan then the majority leader recalls that after the bills defeat the Governor telephoned him to ask him to bring the bill up again for another try Soon after that Dr Cahill appeared in Mr Blumenthals office Mr Blumenthal listened to the arguments for the bill and then told the Governor that he was sure the bill was doomed According to Mr Blumenthal the Governor said he understood but asked him to please bring it back as a favor to A Call From Dr Cahill More recently he was deeply involved in an administration decision to strip the Board of Social Welfare of most of its regulatory powers One of the boards members Cynthia Colin was up for reappointment to the board but in a meeting with Dr Cahill had expressed reservations about the new policy She was startled by an evening call from Dr Cahill who using the telephone in his car told her in a tone that could not have been more pleasant or regretful that in view of her feelings he could not recommend her reappointment While Dr Cahill says he does not give the Governor advice on nonhealth mattersthere are things I cant fathom he saidone of Mr Careys other close advisers said that the Governor bounces most ideas about everything off of Kevin Mr Blumenthal like most legislators who have dealt with Dr Cahill admires him and thinks his influence has generally been a goad one Hes very singleminded quite stubborn and rigid the former Assembly leader said but hes an easy man to deal with Theres no deceit to him When he talks hes clearly saying exactly whats on his mind The health bureaucracy isnt evil But they are impossible It takes someone like a Cahill who has the absolute faith of the Governor and knows how to use it to get anything done An Enthusiastic Talker Dr Cahill is a slight boyishlooking man an enthusiastic conversationalist whose mild relaxed manner can as Mr Blumenthal observed conceal a strong will and complete selfconfidence When he turns those steely blue eyes on you Mr Blumenthal said you know youve got a fight on your hands If his most outspoken admirers are in the Legislature some of his harshest critics are in the upper reaches of the Carey administration These men valuing their own relationship with Governor Carey insisted on speaking off the record but their criticisms of Dr Cahill bore a strong similarity Hes very bright but he doesnt know what he doesnt know one highranking official said Hes a czar on a onedayaweek basis In fairness its hard to say that anyone could do much to improve DMH [the Department of Mental Hygiene] but it just stands to reason that someone who worked at it every day with any intelligence and vision would do a better job Hes grown a lot on half his time another said But hes made a lousy choice of people and hes living with it Hes on the defensive Theres a lot that simply hasnt worked He has the authority but not the responsibility a third official said So while from a policy point of view his record isnt bad from an implementation point of view its a disaster Its a Catch22everyone knows there will never be another independent voice on health so no strong person would work under him As a result hes left relying on secondrate people Dr Cahill is aware of these criticisms and says they misread his aims and methods A Reply to Criticisms I never intended to run the departments on a daybyday basis he said adding that he put in the week of an average civil servant on his unpaid state job Yes there is a different chain of command now because health issues now cross departmental lines so frequently that questions can no longer be decided purely at the departmental level We found two departments in chaos and totally demoralized Now theyre coming back up The current structures are not the best but theres an evolution and greater access than ever before It is a conflict that probably only time and distance will resolvetime to see how his plans including a major state of the health message the Governor will deliver next month are translated into action and distance from the pain of rending delicate bureaucratic tissue In fact people seem to calm down about Kevin Cahill only after they have left his sphere of influence One such former official is Beverlee Myers who was in charge of Medicaid in the Social Services Department until she resigned last year to teach at the University of Michigan There were times there when I hated his guts she said by telephone from Ann Arbor But thinking back his influence has been very good Hes been presiding over a retrenchment where its difficult to show positive results but hes brought together the major departments to a degree not possible before He is a fascinating individual

Abortion Is a Hotly Debated Issue in Many Lands,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/22/archives/abortion-is-a-hotly-debated-issue-in-many-lands.html,Fierce and often emotional debates on the ethics and legality of abortion have been under way for some years in the United States where the Supreme Court declared abortion legal four years ago and just about everywhere else in the world In Europe the outcome has seen such anomalies as Roman Catholic France to the horror of most Spaniards and Portuguese legalizing abortion in January 1975 and the Dutch and West Germans retaining their legal strictures against it A challenge to the French law legalizing abortion was turned back by the countrys Constitutional Council The law permits abortion on demand during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy thus ending a total ban that lasted 54 years In West Germany Parliament approved legislation in 1974 to permit abortion only to have the Supreme Court rule it same time exempting physicians from unconstitutional The court said the statute contravened the constitutional principle that everyone shall have the right to life and inviolability of person The Dutch Senate rejected an abortion bill last month and no new attempts are expected at passing one at least until after the general election this spring The Swiss Parliament narrowly defeated a liberalized abortion bill in 1973 Britain made abortions legal in 1967 subject to certain conditions and Sweden approved a law in 1975 to leave the decision entirely to the woman up to the 12th week of pregnancy at the performing the operation if it is ethitally repellent to them Abortion on demand is allowed in the Soviet Union but there are inducements for Soviet women to have their babies especially in the European section of the country The Government frowns on the operations which is openly discouraged Moslein countries have strict laws against abortion and even in Lebanon it is illegal even if pregnancy costs the mothers life India permitted abortion on demarid in 1971 and it has been allowed virtually on demand in Japan since 1948 although many Japanese are troubled by the practice and did not relish their countrys onetime reputation as an abortion parsdise The issue of abortion stirred controversy in the United States during the Presidential election last fall and antiabortion forces notably the Roman Catholic Church are hoping for passage of a Constitutional amendment overturning the Supreme Court decision of January 1973 But even some foes of abortion concede that the chances of such Constitutional action seem unlikely and recerit court decisions have given them little encouragement A Federal court judge here for instance ruled last October that a new Federal law denying Medicaid payments for abortions was unconstitutional and the Supreme Court refused to stay Judge John F Doolings action pending appeal The Supreme Court also held last July that states may not require women to get their husbands consent for an abortion and a Federal panel in Hartford struck down one of Connecticuts last barriers to abortion by declaring that state officials had no right to veto abortions sought by minors who are wards of the state The New Jersey Supreme Court held last November that nonsectarian hospitals may not withhold their facilities for elective abortions

"Liberalized Abortion Bill in Italy Passes in Chamber, Goes to Senate",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/22/archives/liberalized-abortion-bill-in-italy-passes-in-chamber-goes-to-senate.html,ROME Jan 21Over the objections of the Vatican and the governing Christian Democrats the Chamber ofDeputies tonight approved legislation that would give Italy one of the most liberal abortion laws in Western Europe The bill which now goes to the Senate for expected approval would in effect allow abortion on demand It would permit women over age 16 to decide with or without authorization by a doctor to terminate pregnancies during the first 90 days The existing law which the new one would replace held that abortion was a crime against the race The governing Christian Democratic Party and the Roman Catholic Church fought vigorously against the liberal abortion bill and Pope Paul VI spoke out against it several times In recent weeks noting that the church regarded abortion as the killing of an unborn child The bill carried tonight in the Chamber of Deputies by a vote of 310 to 296 The vote was a result of a long campaign by reformers Early last year they gathered more than 800000 signatures on a petition calling for a referendum aimed at repealing the existing law The issue became so heated that a bitter debate in Parliament over the legislation brought down the government and forced a general election last June The election prevented the referendum from taking place and the reformers including the small but vocal Radical Party carried the struggle into the new Parliament The passage of the bill once again reflected the declining influence of the Roman Catholic Church in Italian politics In a defeat for the church hierarchy in May 1974 for instance Italians voted by a 3to2 margin to retain a controversial law permitting divorce in this overwhelmingly Catholic country In political terms too the Vatican has suffered setbacks Despite its warnings of incompatibility of Marxism and Christianity the Communist Party here has continued to gain ground After the last elections a Communistbacked mayor took over the City Hall of Rome itself Moreover the Vatican is struggling to preserve some of its privileges as negotidtiona continue over the revision of the Concordat that has governed churchstate relations here since 1929 The proposals for revision include abolition of the provision recognizing Roman Catholicism as Italys state religion and also involve concessions by the Vatican on marriage laws and religious education The church has also been under attack by some on the political left for its vast property holdings in Rome amid charges that the Vatican has engaged in property spedulation and avoided taxes Church spokesmen have denied the charges Under the abortion bill approved by the Chamber a woman in her first 90 days of pregnancy could go to a doctor of her choice and request an abortion If the doctor considered it urgent he would authorize it immediately If lie did not agree he would give the Woman a dated document and suggest that she think it over for seven days After that time she could simply take the document to a hospital or special clinic and declare that her social or eco nomic position or psychological health would be jeopardized by the birth That would be enough She would then obtain an abortion free of charge under the nations health service After 90 days of pregnancy however the abortion could be authorized by doctor only on serious medical grounds And girls under 16 would have to obtain authorization from a parent or guardian in any case The existing abortion law introduced during the Fascist era has not prevented Italian women from obtaining abortions Many have resorted to clandestine opera tions others have flown to England or the Netherlands while others have gone to doctors willing to perform the operations for a price under the guise of an illness A court ruling two years ago allowed termination of pregnancies on grounds of physical or mental health But it left the decision in the hands of doctors and fell far short of the demands of the reformers Senate action on the liberalized bill is likely to produce a lively debate and a closer vote But most politicians now expect the bill to become law
500 Bills on Family Life Await Action in Trenton,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/22/archives/500-bills-on-family-life-await-action-in-trenton.html,TRENTON Jan 21For much of 1976 New Jerseys 180yearold State Capitol Building was enlivened by women demonstrating in such bizarre costumes as barrels mid formfitting tights Some of them wore placards Stop ERA and Stop the Income Tax and Stop Abortions The demonstrators crowded their way into the corridors outside the Governors office and the two houses of the State Legislature whereunder the watchful eyes of state policemen and capitol guardsthey tried to press their viewpoints on legislators and the Governor But other than waging a losing battle over the equal rights amendment none of these visible demonstrators brought their efforts to bear on an estimated 500 or so pending bills that could have significant effects on women and families in the state Legislators as a rule tended to view these demonstrators as being kooks but like legislators everywhere those in New Jersey are willing to lend their ears even to small blocks of voters Backlog of Legislation As a consequence the New Jersey Legislature has a backlog of yearsold legislation that could if it ever passed reorganize laws covering divorce adoption child care consumer protection abuse of children medical tests for newborn babies and the court procedures followed in rape cases Some of these bills have been hanging around the Legistlature for a decade or more and many of them are regularly reintroduced session after session With the current Legislature at the midway point in its twoyearlong session only three minor new laws with special effects on womens rights or families have been passed One makes minor changes in the admissibility of evidence in rape trials another provides that the surviving dependents must be allowed to keep a group health insurance policy for 180 days after the death of an insured and the third makes it unlawful to use leadbased paint in daycare centers or other places where children may play or congregate Indeed the current Legislature in its first year barely came to grips with any minor legislation passing only 109 laws of which at least 90 were of a technical nature The biggest dispute over womens rights in the 1976 Legislature concerned the equal rights amendment The Legislature approved that proposed amendment to the Federal Constitution in 1972 In 1975 the Legislature adopted a resolution asking New Jersey voters to approve a similar amendment to the State Constitution but in November of that year the voters rejected it an action that set in motion last year the effort to repeal the states ratification of the Federal ERA Although many women especially those associated with conservative organizations endorsed the idea of repealing New Jerseys approval of the ERA the Legislature decided not to vote on it what with supporters of the ERA being more politically active Despite the keen disappointment at the voter rejection of an ERA for the State Constitution the New Jersey Division on Women a state agency set up to protect womens rights has concluded that no such amendment is needed Patricia Q Sheehan the Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairsthe parent agency of the Division of Womensaid that the State Constitution already provided for equal treatment of men and women When the 1947 State Constitution the one now in effect was being debated delegates to the convention adopted a special provision that said wherever in this Constitution the term person persons people or any personal pronoun is used the same shall be taken to include both sexes It will be at least four more years before a new equal rights amendment to the State Constitution can be voted on by the people The New Jersey Constitution provides that if a proposed amendment is defeated it cannot be brought up for a vote again until after the passing of three general elections Many of the problems that are peculiar to women or to families in New Jersey are handled administratively and n the past few years the state government has been reorganized to include special agencies to handle women and family rights In addition to the Division of Women the State Public Advocate and the State Civil Rights Commission have as part of their responsibility the protection of those rights that women have been able to obtain for themselves in recent years Partly through their efforts the State Government has been recruiting women to work for the state and this has been so successful that almost half the states 55000 employees protected by Civil Service are now women The State Insurance Commissioner James J Sheeran on Sept 1 1975 adopted a regulation prohibiting discrimination in the writing of insurance One family problem that may get some attention from the New Jersey Legislature this year is visitation rights of divorced fathers Several organizations of men have been set up to try to persuade judges to enforce these visitation rights and leaders of these groups have said they will ask for some change in state divorce laws unless they can win a definitive court suit The New Jersey Advisory Commission on the Status of Women has been pushing for changes in rape laws asking the Legislature to set up a rape prevention program The legislature has also been asked to prohibit a victims sexual history from being introduced into evidence at rape trials The new rape law addresses this point but only peripherally It provides that a victims sexual conduct occurring more than a year before the rape cannot be introduced into evidences unless there is a clear and convincing reason for doing so Birth and Adoption Records A bill to allow adopted children to see their birth and adoption records after they reach the age of 18 years passed the State Senate last year and is now pending in the State Assembly It has caused waves of protest Assemblywoman Marie A Muhler one of eight women in the New Jersey Legislature said that such a law would provide nothing but heartbreak and dismay The old adage of curiousity killing the cat could certainly apply to the adoptee lovingly raised by adoptive parents who might well find that his or her mother was a prostitute or that the father was a hardened criminal Mrs Muhler said Currently in New Jersey adopted children if they were adopted through one of the state agencies can get information about their parents national ity medical history and educational background There are an estimated 50000 adopted children under 18 in the state The bill to allow them to see their histories is expected to come up for a vote in the Assembly in about three weeks

Italy's Abortion Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/23/archives/italys-abortion-bill.html,The Italian Chamber of Deputies has approved legislation to legalize abortion ending a battle for reform of the laws dating back to the era of Benito Mussolini and indicating the further decline of the Roman Catholic Church as an influence in Italian politics An earlier draft of abortion legislation caused a bitter parliamentary row which helped bring down the Christian Democratic Government and forced elections last June The election produced a proabortion majority in Parliament and cleared the way for last weeks vote The measure must now be approved by the Senate but that is considered routine Catholic spokesmen and Pope Paul VI have attacked abortion as legalized murder but the deputies were apparently more influenced by popular demand and previous experience which led to reform of divorce laws also opposed in vain by the church Unofficial estimates say that about a million illegal abortions are performed annually in Italy the same as the number of live births Thomas Butson and Barbara Slavin

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/26/archives/letters.html,Transit Cutbacks The Federal Burden To the Editor Recent letters to The Times J Quinn Jan 5 S Schwalb Jan 11 and V Muraven Jan 18 suggest that the transit network in New York is very much in everyones mind as well it should be Cutbacks have reduced the citys transit to and possibly below its minimum feasibility However the blame is being misplaced It is easy to use the city as a scapegoat and it is inconceivable that there are still people who do not understand that the City of New York cannot raise any more money than it now has The State of New York has been undergoing serious economic contraction for perhaps twenty years and cannot be expected to increase its share of the transit subsidy burden The Federal Government on the other hand is in a position to increase its share There are those who feel But why should we always depend upon the Federal Government to bail us out all the time The Feds have agreed to subsidize transit in all cities coast to coast It has been going onfor years only the money is distributed according to a formula that gives funds at rates whose variance can only be called bizarre According to figures published by the Regional Plan Association the subsidy based not upon ridership but upon a ratio of local population to transit riders or what Washington wants to classify as transit riders New York gets 207 cents per transit rider while Boston receives 435 and Chicago 501 The discrimination between the East and West is even more blatant as Houston gets 1375 cents per transit rider Wichita Kan 3162 and Grand Rapids Mich 4504 So in New York where the transit system already exists hence doesnt need to be built where the need for transit is greatest where the cost of living is perhaps highest where energy costs are highest where the people are least able to absorb fare hikes and service cutsin New York we are forced to go backward and accept the least amount or return on money that came after all out of our pockets Even more disturbing has been the trend of the Federal Department of Transportation under Secretary Coleman to steer the major part ofDOT monies to the development and maintenance of types of transit that use gas and oil run on petrochemiCal tires and roll on you guessed it highways All in all the most effective course of action for all New Yorkersto take would be to urge their elected of ficials to have this Federal attitude changed Mr Javits record On the subject of transit is not noteworthy and Mr Moynihans record as an alleged New Yorker has yet to take shape Public pressure in the right place works wonders Public pressure in the wrong place is ac Waste of constructive energy and ignores avenues of change that are open to us under this political system C HABERMAN New York Jan 18 1977 The New Grind To the Editor At last A sure way to beat the coffee barons I simply buy my fresh coffee beans at a Spanish grocery and chicory already roasted at the same place I grind them together in an oldiashioned coffee mill and presto fine coffee at a very cheap price One thing wrong however The coffee grinder cost me 50 at an antiques shop JACK CASNICK New York Jan 16 1977 Niagara Mohawk On the Use of Hydropower To the Editor A few comments are in order from the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation in response to the Jan 5 letter by the Rev Jack Woodard of Trinity Parish His letter refers to a 19thcentury grist mill on Spruce Creek in upstate New York and to deed restrictions upon the use of the property for generation of electricity Restrictions and reservations are quite common in the sale of property Water rights not unlike mineral air and other rights are property rights of ownership separate from the fee itself The restriction in the Spruce Creek deed does not prohibit Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation from utilizing the property for the production of electric energy The limitation in the deed prevents other parties from utilizing any electric potential of the creek This restriction as any restriction covenant easement or reservation would show in any title search or title policy Mr Woodard also asserts a Niagara Mohawk facility on East Canada Creek near Spruce Creek is an excellent example of a number of small hydroelectric power generating installations    which are deliberately not being used by the power companies to generate electricity We assume the writer is referringto the old Dolgeville Hydro Station which Niagara Mohawk removed from service in the early 1960s A relic it was retired be cause of the high best related to repairs and renovation Because of drastic rises in fossilfuel costs we are restudying watersheds for development of hydro potential where feasible Niagara Mohawk owns 79 hydro stations with an aggregate capacity of about 660000 kilowatts or 11 percent of our total electric system Hydropower is a majar influence in our companys rates being lower than rates for consumers served by other key New York State utilities The restriction mentioned by Mr Woodard is an illustration of Niagara Mohawks longterm concern in protecting our customers as are restrictions and reservations in other deeds By retafning such rights Niagara Mohawk is protecting our ratepayers wherever nominal hydropower of the past may become important for customers in the future If these rights were conveyed rather than retained for the benefit of our customers we then could be justly criticized JAMES BARTLETT Executive Vice President Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation Syracuse Jan 12 1977 Of Gary Gilmore and Machismo Culture To the Editor Perhaps the most frightening aspect of the Gary Gilmore execution worse than the public exploitation including his own of a mans death is the commitment to machismo it located in the public heart Machismo has been too narrowly defined in terms of mens Olympian sexual appetites and performances when its final flowering is in glorious death This helps explain why machismo is so vital a part of military culture Gary Gilmore excited interest precisely because he touched so many impulses of a machismo culture Over the objections of liberals courts and the establishment in general he asserted his right to bold death and summoned his own firing squad Without so much as touching his girlfriend he persuaded her to join him in a suicide pact and she submitted The manner of death chosen by Gilmore is usually reserved for gallant adversaries and performed by military units It is also a neglected part of our machismo culture that the hero profit from his daring and Gilmore and his friends accomplished this goal Gary Gilmore afforded us by having us declare what we really admire an indepth look at ourselves He unfortunately turned us on But his tawdry tale has warned us how far we still are from our stated ideals WILLLIAM LOREN KATZ New York Jan 19 1977 To the Editor The tragedy that transcends the execution of a homocidal misanthrope is that a more perfect sop could not have been created for the American conscience by capital punishments champions While the complexity sensitivity and finality of this issue demands the most judicious thinking of which we are capable Gilmores death has served only to stir up a fare of media pabulum Executions can only be viewed as triumphant vindictiveness WILLIAM A GRACE Freeville NY Jan 18 1977 To the Editor Amidst all the furor about the execution of Gary Gilmore Id like to throw in my 13 cents worth To my mind many more worthy persons should have been executed before he was long ago eg Charles Manson and several female members of his family the Boston Strangler Sirhan Sirhan anyone remember him and many of the hundreds of others who are now languishing in the socalled Death Rows of many prisons who committed far more terrible crimes than did Gilmore terrible as his were Please call to mind the man who tried to murder F D Roosevelt in the early 1930s but instead killed Mayor Cermak that man was trill con victed and executed within a matter of weeksnot months nor years My sentiments are that any person who kills another with premeditation should get first a fair trial then if found guilty an execution immediately without the interference of dogooders and bleedinghearts such as the ACLU I subscribe to the precepts of the Koran An eye for an eye    DAVID DEHUFF Commander USN Ret Farmington Conn Jan 18 1977 To the Editor On the eve of Gary Gilmores execution the television networks were busy with all kinds of sordid coverage and varied commentaries regarding the death penalty statutes in the United States Many of these comments arguing for the reinstatement of these laws viewed it as a viable deterrent of those crimes falling within the mandate My mind was busy registering the masses of tax dollars that would now be directed toward judiciary committees Congressional investigative subcommittees Senate debate not to mention monies already being spent in the courts for lawyers and appeals and in the jails housing those people on death row And after the hundreds of thousands possibly millions of tax dollars are spent murderers and rapists will still plague society I submit that crimes of this nature are the result of disturbed minds for which the sanctions of the law probably do not matter The problem is not the laws but instead one of mental health and hygiene Possibly adequate medical attention and the availability of treatment and facilities would serve as the proper preventative for these occurrences Perhaps tax dollars could be spent more wisely on these measures instead of being wasted in areas that do nothing more than punish the victims of an illness SHERYL SOROKA New York Jan 18 1977 Joseph Califanos Alarming Words To the Editor Despite the bright promises to women during his campaign Mr Carter has served notice with the appointment of Joseph Califano as Secretary of HEW that certain rights of wornen will have a low priority under his Administration In his confirmation hearings before Congress Mr Califano stated according to a Jan 14 news article that he would work actively to bar abortions under all Federal health programs ineluding any national health insurance plan that is enacted He said I personally believe that abortion is wrong These are discouraging words for women to hear on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the Supreme Court decisions of Jan 22 1973 which granted all women the right to decide in consultation with their doctors whether to have a legal abortion They are alarming words to those in the religious community who are concerned about the separation of church and state Mr Califon is apparently faithful to the Catholic doctrine that the fetus is a person from the moment of conception and that therefore abortion is murder This belief is not shared by most of the other religious organizations in the country In a pluralistic society the enforcement by law of the beliefs of any one religious group is a threat to the freedom of religion guaranteed by the Constitution Obviously Mr Califano is insensitive to the dividing line between his personal beliefs and his obligation as a public official to execute fairly and impartially the law of the land The 23 Protestant Jewish and other religious organizations which are members of our coalition affirm their support of the Supreme Court decisions and call on government officials to carry out the letter and spirit of that mandate SIGRID RAPHAEL Coordinator Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights Scarsdale

Actions Taken by Supreme Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/26/archives/actions-taken-by-supreme-court.html,WASHINGTON Jan 25The Supreme Court took the following actions today Special to The New York Times ABORTION Without comment the Justices affirmed a lower Federal court order that barred Indiana officials from enforcing a portion of the Indiana abortion law that required minors seeking abortions the first 12 weeks of pregnancy to get parental consent The lower court had based its order on the Supreme Courts decision last year in a Missouri case invalidating such parental consent requirements Bowen v GaryNW Ind Womens Serv No 76764 ANTITRUST Following the Governments suggestion the Court declined to review a Federal district judges recent ruling that the district court had jurisdiction over at least some aspects of the Governments civil antitrust suit against the American Telephone and Telegraph Company the Western Electric Company and Bell Telephone Laboratories The lawsuit filed in 1974 charges the companies with attempting and conspiring to monopolize and monopolizing interstate trade and commerce in the telecommunications service and equipment markets The companies contend that there is no jurisdiction in view of the extensive regulation of their conduct by the FCC and state regulatory agencies and had wanted the Supreme Court to review the district judges preliminary findings now rather than let the case proceed ATT v US No 76939 Voting 90 the Court ruled that in order for plaintiffs to recover treble damages on account of violations of Section 7 of the Clayton Act the plaintiffs must prove more than injury causally related to an illegal presence in the market The Justices in an opinion by Thurgood Marshall said that plaintiffs must prove antitrust injury which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful The injury should reflect the

Yellow Pages to Run Planned Parenthood Ad,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/29/archives/yellow-pages-to-run-planned-parenthood-ad.html,The New York Telephone Company decided to let Planned Parenthood of New York City run its full advertisement in the 1977 Manhattan and Bronx Yellow Pages after all Earlier this month Planned Parenthood accused the company of arbitrary and discriminatory censorship for saying the advertisement should indicate only that Planned Parenthood offered information about sterlization infertility and abortion instead of that it actually offered those services The company replied that it was acting under state guidelines in prohibiting the advertisement of specific medical procedures by licensed physicans or by third parties in their behalf However a telephone company spokesman yesterday said that the company now believed after further discussions with Alfred F Moran executive vice president of the nonprofit organization that the disputed phrases represented factual information that should go into the ad
Population: Winning the War,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/30/archives/population-winning-the-war-population-winning-the-war.html,There is evidence that the population bomb is being defusedThe number of human beings on the planet reached 4 billion last year but population experts for years longfaced with gloom have been sounding optimistic lately if not downright cheerful The declines in birth rate indicate that the world is at least headed toward rather than away from a more slowly increasing population says a study by the Population Reference Bureau a nonprofit organization Its Federally financed report says the world birth rate declined from 34 per 1000 people in 1965 to 30 per 1000 in 1974 and could drop as low as 20 per 1000 in less than 10 years Availability of family planning aids and increasingly tough pressure from some of the worlds heavily populated nations are credited for the decline Demographers think some of the slowing resulted from recent famines But even with bumper crops there is no slackening of the optimism that uncontrolled population growth has been checked at least temporarily The year 1976 saw remarkably favorable food conditions says Lester R Brown president of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington which is partly funded by the United Nations but family planning is clearly the overriding factor in controlling population growth This slowdown in population increase is reversing a longstanding trend of gradually accelerating growth that may have begun with the discovery of agriculture 12000 years ago he has said Birth rates are falling impressively in nations with 40 percent of the worlds population in Western Europe North America and East Asia he says with the birth rate down by almost half in Western Europe and a third in North America and Asia in the 1970s In West Germany Austria and Britain the population growth stopped completely But whats remarkable experts say is the rise in use of contraceptives in underdeveloped countries where low levels of education make difficult to teach the benefits of family planning Another change is the dramatic acceptance of abortion Today 64 percent of the worlds people live in areas where abortion is legal up from 38 percent at the start of 1971 In India with a population of 620 million the Government has declared that the growth rate will be brought down to 14 percent a year from the current 21 percent by 1984 which means reducing the birth rate to 25 per 1000 from 32 per 1000 It is clear that simply to wait for education and economic development to bring about a drop in fertility is not a practical solution said last years tough Indian policy statement The Government says that in eight months of this new policy 6 million sterilizations were performed against 26 million for the entire preceding year And 20 million of the 110 million couples in the reproductive age group are using other methods of birth control such as the intrauterine device Money and job inducements with threats of penalty against failure to practice birth control are bringing Indians and particularly Government workers to familyplanning centers One recent national decree says that those having a fourth child will lose salary increases leave and travel benefits The Uttar Pradesh Government says annual pay rises will be stopped if the employees fail to be sterilized Fifteen dollarsa substanial amount for the pooris offered as an inducement to voluntary sterilization In addition abortion is available across India in Government hospitals no questions asked and a law is being enacted raising the marriage age of young women to 18 from 15 and of young men to 21 from 18 Opposition has been fierce In New Delhi and parts of Uttar Pradesh Moslems rioted against compulsory sterilization and more than 100 were killed by the police The opposition has not slackened the tempo of the program says Vemaraju Bhanumurthy of the Ministry of Health and Family Planning On the contrary the tempo has picked up and the progress is very rapid indeed One criticism of the Indian program is lack of effective followup at the birthcontrol clinics and the program seems to have made little or no impact on the rural population some of whom believe vasectomy means impotence In China with 850 million to 900 million people birth control is tightly organized from Peking down to every neighborhood and farm The program aims at limiting each family to two children and reducing the rate of population growth to 1 percent annually by the year 2000 The world population increase was 164 percent in 1975 In such cities as Shanghai Chinese figures suggest the rate may already be less than 1 percent but in parts of the countryside it is still above 2 percent The program begun in the 1960s and supposedly voluntary was intensified last year and includes a marriage age of 28 for men and 25 for women Families are required to space children five years apart and birthcontrol devices and sterilization operations are free Southeast Asia has one of the fastest growing populations in the world but there have been some successes too One exception is Laos which is encouraging population growth and even banned contraception to make up for war losses and refugee flight And in the entire area there is another problem Much of Southeast Asia is still largely agrarian says a senior population expert with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Bangkok So small families make no economic sense to these people They need big families to work their farms for security in their old age This is the cycle we must break And we must do it quickly With an overall growth rate of 214 percent a year in Southeast Asia the current population of 327 million people will double in 29 years One of the striking success stories is in Singapore where the growth rate dropped to 16 percent annually from 24 percent five years ago The Government of the crowded island republic which set the ideal family size as two children gives tax incentives for small families but phases out the incentives with a third child The Government also tells parents it cannot guarantee a place in public school for a third child and gives priori ty in the most elite primary schools to children of parents who have been sterilized These successes do not mean the threat of overpopulation is ended In Latin America and parts of Asia andAfrica the growth is still a threat In Egypt for example after a 10year family planning program the birth rate dropped to 35 per 1000 from 43 per 1000 but better health care also brought a drop in the death rate The country has about 38 million people now and twice as many are foreseen in 30 years We were focusing on one aspect and forgetting about the others says Dr Aziz Bindari chairman of the Egyptian Population and Family Planning Board We were forgetting that fertility behavior is part of social behavior After 10 years of effort we are starting to realize the problem is not that simple as merely handing out birthcontrol advice and devices The country must also provide a means to create an environment that will make the largely agricultural society realize there is a benefit to smaller families he says Sometime near the beginning of this decade the rate of world population growth reached an alltime high and then began to subside says Mr Brown of Worldwatch confidently There is every indication population will contiue to slow through the last quarter of this century
Canada —Traumaic Change,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/30/archives/canadatraumatic-change.html,OTTAWADramatic political and economic changes have robbed Canada of the reputation for stability that was once envied around the world In the past several months    Canada has undergone a series of events which can only be described as traumatic says John Robarts a former Premier of Ontario He lists doubledigit inflation controversial wage and price controls the victory of the Para Quebecois in Quebec and a loss of confidence in government particularly at the Federal level These developments have left Canadians wondering about the future of their country says Mr Robarts who now heads the Ontario Royal Commission on Metropolitan Government In addition to the problems that Mr Roberts listed Canadians see all about them visible signs of economic dislocationstubborn unemployment inflation rising consumer prices soaring production costs and the depletion of energy resourcesso that Canada is now a net importer instead of exporter This has removed the glow from the oncebright Canadian economy To the deep concern of many Canadians high wages and low productivity have caused a reversal of the historic flow of capital from south to north The work ethic isnt dead in the United States They work harder there and there is much less government interference said Tom Tyson president of RennCupit Industries of Calgary Mr Tysons company is planning to establish a plant for fabricating steel and making agricultural machinery in the Midwest In many industries the United States has become a more attractive place to locate said the American Ambassador Thomas 0 Enders Over the past 10 years unit wage costs in manufacturing increased almost twice as much here as there Canadian costs in many sectors now exceed United States costs In the early 1960s one United States direct investment dollar out of three came to Canada said the Ambassador a specialist in economic affairs Now its one dollar out of six he added Statistics Canada the Government informationgathering agency reported a net outflow of 43 million in investment money from Canada to the United States in the first half of 1976 reversing the trend of many years An Americansurvey reported that more than 40 Canadian enterprises moved into the United States in the first nine months of last year cornpared with 22 in the yearago period The value of 14 concerns on which statistics were available was put at 174 million And consumers are joining businessmen in the trek across the border making Canadian license plates common in American shopping centers for while the fall of the Canadian dollar below par with its American counterpart has helped Canadian exports by making them cheaper it has also meant higher costs for imports that were already highpriced by American standards For example a Sony tape recorder purchased in a discount shop on New Yorks Eighth Avenue recently for 124 costs 299 in an Ottawa store a Haspel tropicalweight suit bought for 100 in Honolulu a city with a reputation for high prices had its counterpart in a mens shop here for 130 Compared with Ottawa prices food in Ogdensburg [NY] is a bargain said Carol MacIvor a comparison shopper for The Citizen an Ottawa newspaper She said that a dozen standard items purchased for 1036 in the American town would have cost 1331 at the market she uses in Ottawa a saving of more than 22 percent overall although meat and a few other staples cost slightly less in Canada Furthermore when analysts are disturbed by a slowdown in home construction Canadian property developers are also channeling their investments to the United States to avoid Canadas tax disadvantages and costly delays in obtaining official approval for projects The Urban Development Institute of Toronto representing major builders estimated the flow of construction money across the border at 15 billion The pace of economic activity in Canada in 107 will experience a substantial slowdown said the latest report on the economy by the Conference Board a private advisory organization The board in a report that paralleled most other forecasts predicted that growth in the gross national product would slide from 5 percent in 1976 to 3 percent in 1977 with unemployment near the 8 percent mark The weaknesses now evident in the outlook for 1977 are particularly worrisome in view of the existing high level of excess capacity said the president of the board Robert R deCottret He added The challenge now before us clearly is to avoid an abortion of the current economic recovery such as occurred in the early 1960s The yearend report of the Parisbased Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development also predicting various slippages in the Canadian economy in the coming year would go no further on the positive side than to aver that Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeaus Government stands a chance of achieving its modest economic goals of putting down inflation raising employment and increasing production by the end of 1977 Inflation and unemployment were cut to slightly under the American levels by last December under the strictures of Prime Minister Trudeaus wage and price controls but the overall rate of recovery has remained behind that of the United States Mr Trudeau in the yearend news conference said that the limits imposed on pay rises and profits under his antiinflation program had created a whole some new mood of restraint in the country however much the curbs might displease business and labor But some economistsbelieve that the controls by interfering with normal economic forces are doing more harm than good The Trudeau program said the Canadian Imperial Bank in a yearend news letter will probably dampen both consumer and corporate spending thereby keeping the rate of domedtic economic recovery below that which would otherwise be expected The Economic Council a group of industrialists academic economists and labor leaders formed to advise Government on fiscal affairs the labor representatives withdrew under protest against the wage controls reported that recovery was underway but might require a stimulus such as a tax cut to keep it from losing momentum How deeply the political uncertainties raised by the Parti Qubcois victory in Quebec will affect the Canadian economy remains to be seen A steep fall in the price of stocks in Quebec companies following the election last Nov 15 was termed an overreaction by some analysts but outside investments in the province were expected to reflect a cautious tone for some time In Federal Government buildings signs urging users to save energyby switching off unneeded electric lights and staying out of elevators when stairs will doremind Canadians that they are now net importers of petroleum after years of balancing put chases abroad with oil exports Canada remains a storehouse of untapped natural wealth but much of it will stay in the ground until the technology is developed for extracting oil from the Alberta tar sands and for overcoming forbidding conditions in the Arctic to permit movement of huge stocks of petroleum and natural gas to markets inthe south And Canadians are finding these economic travails require difficult adjustments As Canadians we have been cushioned so long from unpleasantness that facing up to reality if it is unfavorable has to be avoided says Premier Frank D Moores of Newfoundland a member of the opposition Progressive Conservative Party
Nurses and Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/30/archives/long-island-weekly-nurses-and-abortion.html,NURSES have traditionally been thought to be the guardians of lifeto care for all human beings regardless of their age or condition Yet in abortion they must stand by and watch a human life cease to be Sometimes they must literally watch There is one kind of abortion procedure called the hysterotomyin which the baby is delivered alive but at so premature a stage that the baby usually cannot survive for a very long period of time Nevertheless the baby can live for 12 hoursor even for 24 hoursstruggling for life and gasping for breath The only difference between such a baby and a baby born prematurely is that everyone wants the premature baby to live and will do all possible to save that baby On the other hand the whole purpose of the hysterotomy is that the premature baby will not be allowed to live The defenders of abortion sometimes respond that only a few thousand babies are involved in hysterotomy abortionsas opposed to hundreds of thousands of unborn children in other kinds of abortions But by what standard is only a few thousand to be considered an insignificant number If a nurse has seen only one such baby struggling for life it is something she will never forget Furthermore similar procedures are occasionally followed with other babies who are not considered to be desirable and they are followed in our finest medical institutions For example on Oct 15 1971 The Washington Post reported the death of a baby in Johns Hopkins The Post article began as follows For 15 daysuntil he starved to deaththe newborn infant lay in bassinet in a tqck corner of the nursery at the Johns Hopkins University Hospital A sign said Nothing by mouth The babys life could have been saved by a simple operation to correct the intestinal blockage that kept him from digesting any food But because he was born a mon goloid the parents refused to give the hospital permission to operate The article goes on to quote the doctors involved as emphasizing that mongoloid children can lead happy and productive lives Nevertheless because this baby was not wanted the child was allowed to die According to The Post Dr William Bartholome senior assistant resident in pediatrics at Johns Hopkins and the doctor in charge of the case said similar lifeanddeath decisions were made at least twice a week at the hospital It was a long agonizing wait Bartholome recalled I tried not to look at the baby and when I did I didnt want to touch it The nurses were full of horror and disbelief   Dr Bartholome concludes that It took 15 days for the baby to become dehydrated enough to die That was an awfully long time The incident at Johns Hopkins emphasizes two facts of which the public may not be awarethat such lifeanddeath decisions are made routinely in many hospitals and that many nurses are full of horror at this course of action but are powerless to do anything about it Meanwhile additional proposals are being made for the future In the phamphlet Dilemmas of Euthanasia a booklet published by the Euthanasia Educational Council that contains the transcript of its fourth euthanasia conference Dr Alfred Jaretzki associate professor of surgery at Columbia University writes    People keep talking about how the doctor is the one to kill this individual I suggest or I submit that maybe this is not a doctors role Maybe it will be a lot easier if you separate it from the doctor The doctor is educated in devoting his life to trying to save in dealing with illness and public health We are now talking about purposely killing It does not take a doctor to do that mercifully I just wonder whether in your minds and perhaps in future legal steps it should be taken out of the doctors and nurses hands What Dr Jaretzki seems to be saying is that the medical profession may have a scruple that will prevent it from being the social engineers of euthanasia the scruple that doctors and nurses should cure and never take life All I can say is that I hope that such scruples will continue in our medical professionfor it seems to me that care and preservation of life is what nursing is all about
Abortion Issue Flares Anew,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/30/archives/new-jersey-weekly-abortion-issue-flares-anew.html,TRENTON IT IS as the other side said much like water wearing away stone Last Monday RighttoLife demonstratorswho are using songs and red roses to wear down legislative resistancesat in the gallery of the State Senate and watched approvingly as their latest antiabortion bill slid through on a 27top6 vote While proabortionists fumed in anger the Senate adopted a bill asking Congress to call a convention to write an antiabortion section into the United States Constitution Despite Senate rules the antiabortionists clapped and cheered A fight between the antis and the pros has gone mostly unnoticed publicly in recent months while the bill has wended its way through the Senate committee to the floor for a vote The abortion issue has become one of the most controversial and emotional ones facing the New Jersey Legislature And on every legislative day pros and antis demonstrate in the hall and sometimes come close to confrontation Each session of the Senate has been preceded by clusters of earnest antiabortionists standing in front of the Senate chambers singing Senator Feldman give life a chance Matthew Feldman of Teaneck is the President of the Senate and as such makes up the Senate calendar He put the antiabortion bill on the calendar last Monday The proabortionists who prefer to be known as representing the right to choose do not expect to be able to stop the antiabortion bill if it comes to a vote in the Assembly Dorothy D Schoenwald of the American Civil Liberties Union which opposes laws to outlaw abortions because they consider such laws to be an invasion of privacy said that if the bill got out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee it was almost certain to pass given the current political climate in New Jersey Mrs Schoenwald said she was perplexed a bit by current developments Every opinion poll shows that the public does not want antiabortion bills she said Fran Avallone of East Brunswick the coordinator for the RighttoChoose the states most active proabortionists group said she had no expectation at all that the Assembly would not pass the abortion convention bill It is a prospect she said that bothers her beyond the implications of outlawing abortion If the antiabortionists succeed in getting a national convention call they will end up rewriting the entire Constitution she said Arguments made on the Senate floor that such a convention could be restricted to passing an antiabortion amendment to the Constitution are completely without foundation she said At such a convention the delegates would be free to rewrite any part of the Constitution they chose to tinker with she said This could spell trouble for such American traditions as the First Amendment to the Constitution which guarantees freedom of speech and of religion The bill that the New Jersey Senate passed would seek to take advantage of a section of the United States Constitution that permits amendments at a national convention The Congress would be obliged to call such a convention if 34 states adopt the same law the New Jersey Senate passed Four states already have passed the law and it is pending on a dozen or so others The executive director of the New Jersey Right  to  Life movement Christopher Smith a 23yearold who became interested in abortion laws while attending Trenton State College said that the Senate vote did not just happen The 15000 members of RighttoLife in New Jersey have been very active in lobbying the 40 members of the State Senate to vote for the abortion and convention bill he said adding that the coalition which has chapters in each of New Jerseys 21 counties will now turn its attention to the 80 members of the Assembly We are also trying to get a bill which would require hospital and abortion clinics in New Jersey to keep records of complications which develop after abortions said Mr Smith He said that the antiabortion movement in New Jersey was attracting new members and that its members were willing to become involved The crowds of antiabortionists who demonstrated in Washington the Saturday after Jimmy Carters inauguration as President included more than 5000 from New Jersey he said On almost any issue RighttoLife can turn out several hundred demonstrators he said In recent weeks the organization has turned its attention to colleges and it now has chapters on a halfdozen campuses in the state he said Mrs Avallone disputed that RighttoLife was growing Theyre just getting louder she said The antiabortionists are getting active politically because they have lost in the courts every time she said and were unable to persuade Congress to pass an antiabortion bill They know that local legislators are more subject to pressure she added Although Congress would not pass an antiabortion bill it did adopt an amendment to the appropriation for the Federal Department of Health Educa tion and Welfare forbidding the use of any of its funds to help pay for abortions This prohibition is now in abeyance on an order from a Federal judge and the question likely will be settled eventually by the United States Supreme Court Mrs Avallone said she also had a suit pending in Federal Court in New Jersey attacking the taxexempt status of the RighttoLife group The RighttoLife organization has become involved in politics she said which is a ground for losing the taxexempt status and when the Internal Revenue Service would not move against RighttoLife she filed her suit It is scheduled to be heard in February  No date has been set in the Assembly for hearings on the abortion convention bill and it may be several weeks or even months before it could come up for a vote on the floor

Abortion Law Is Approved in Israel,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/01/archives/abortion-law-is-approved-in-israel.html,JERUSALEM Jan 31  Over the strenuous sometimes impassioned objections of religious Jews the Israeli Parliament today passed a law that legalized abortions but fell short of providing abortion on demand The vote on the bill was by a show of hands at a scantily attended session of the Parliament Some members of the Orthodox Jewish bloc who vigorously opposed the measure missed the vote because they were in front of Parliament taking part in a demonstration opposing the abortion law The new law is to go into effect one year after publication which is expected soon The law permits termination of a pregnancy after approval by a threemember committee consisting of two doctorsone a gynecologistand a social worker Some of the reasons for which a legal abortion could be obtained are If a mother is under 16 or over 40 if the pregnancy resulted from incest rape or was out of wedlock if it can be determined the child would be born physically or mentally handicapped or if the birth would injure the physical or emotional health of the mother Some Feminists Unsatisfied The law did not totally please Israeli feminists who wanted legislation sanctioning abortion on demand without a screening by a committee It represented a defeat for religious interests that have long lobbied against a liberalized abortion statute In effect the law ratified a common practice in Israel A recent study showed that 467 percent of all Israeli women have had at least one abortion by the time they reach 40 The estimates of the number of abortions in Israel which has a population of 35 million range from 40000 a year a figure used by the government to 70000 a figure used by a number of feminist organizations Since 1952 there have been no prosecutions of doctors who performed illegal abortions The bill passed quietly today was the subject of a fierce parliamentary debate last week At the time many amendments proposed by opponents of the measure were defeated indicating that the bill was assured of eventual passage Opponents of the bill included some members of Likud the major opposition bloc to the Labor Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the religious blocs represented by the National Religious Party and the United Torah Front They argued that aborting a fetus constituted homicide under Jewish law and should be allowed only when a mothers life was endangered Some opponents claimed that studies had shown that a womans fertility rate dropped after termination of a pregnancy and that Israels desire to increase its population would therefore suffer Others noted that the population increase rate of the Arab countries far exceeded Israels and that such a law in effect sanctioned small families to the detriment of the state The arguments were countered by women activists in the Parliament including one of the chief sponsors of abortion reform Shulamit Aloni leader of the Civil Rights Movement a small political party A womans body is her own Mrs Aloni said 9t is not there to service the state the army or the nation To make children is very easy To bear them is harder and to bring them up harder still Every woman has the right to decide for herself whether she will do so or not Various drafts of the abortion law had been before the Parliament for at least two years

for the diocese says the goal of the project is to offer programs to an audience that is already dissatisfied with commercial television fare He called them programs for families They are aimed he said at three audiences The first or inner circle is the Catholic audience Programs for Catholics will include a number of religious education series designed for the needs of parishes and parishioners These will probably include training for religion teachers and other parish leaders The second is the general religious audience for whom programs will originate with other religious groups such as the Lutheran Laymens League and Southern Baptists Father Ayres said he hoped to persuade other groups including Jewish organizations to produce programs for Channel L The third is the general audience for whom programs on such subjects as health family counseling music law and ethnic groups are planned The Diocesan TV Center is operated for the most part with funds from the diocese including a 3 assessment on each of 35000 children in elementary schools within viewing range The programs being beamed from the Diocesan TV Center are all taped in advance either by other organizations supplying programs at little or no cost or at the Uniondale center Most of the programs are in color Eventually shows will be carried live from Uniondale Father Ayres hopes Some of the programs made at the center and now being shown on cable television are described as follows Prayer Dancers artists priests and musicians describe their approaches to prayer Death and Dying To help the viewer understand the meaning of death to discover the Catholic Churchs viewpoint of death The Touch of God Artists demonstrate how shapes sounds pictures and movements express Gods presence in their lives Behold Your Mother Host Dr Joseph Kelly helps discover the Virgin Marys role through a study of Catholic Church paintings and stainedglass widows Do You See What I See Designed for primarygrade teachers this series demonstrates techniques for detecting common visualperception problems in children and suggests procedures for eliminating them New Land New Colony New York Historical highlights in the development of New York State emphasizing our rich cultural heritage The Long Wand Lighting Company contributed a series called Lilco Film Festival A Look at Varied Aspects of Long Island Community Life One of the programs still in the planning stage is a series featuring Bishop John R McGann of Rockville Centre Father Ayres is a rockmusic and hymn composer and host of two radio shows that are carried regularly on WPLJFM one featuring rock stars and the other a telephone talk show He said the Diocesan TV Center would not hesitate to deal with controversial subjects such as abortion but he added Were not here to deal with two or three issues that are Catholic issues We want to deal with the whole spectrum of issues What were really involved in is Jesus Christ which is the issue He was asked who was going to call the shots on programming I am he said adding The Bishop is the chief teacher of the diocese so ultimately he is responsible Ive been doing programming since 1968 in this diocese probably 2000 radio and television programs have never once beep censored or told What to do Or what not to do Is there any violation he was asked of the churchstate separation principle in cable televisions carrying the programs of a churchrelated facility Its a private group that has given us a channel the priest replied Id think they would give time to other people who have facilities that can produce shows And he noted the ecumenical participation in the programs Mr Dolan president of Cablevision said he did not think there was a problem These channels are available really for everybody If the church prefers to step forward and take advantage of it thats due to the enterprise of the diocese he said  He added that if other groups that relate to the community and have something to say wanted to make use of cable television it would be in our best interest as well as theirs The cable system is one of several on the Island Father Ayres IS already thinking about them 
A Library That Finally Sets the Record on Women Straight,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/07/archives/a-library-that-finally-sets-the-record-on-women-straight.html,CAMBRIDGE MassRadcliffe College collects not only women but womens collections in fact a whole library on womens history Comfortably housed here in the Radcliffe Yard this monument to women began with a collection donated in 1943 by Maud Wood Park Radcliffe 98 first president of the League of Women Voters To supervise the monument headed by Harvards Prof Arthur M Radcliffes president appointed a board Schlesinger the distinguished historian Who in 1922 deplored colleagues writing as though onehalf of our population have been negligible factors in our countrys history After Professor Schlesingers death in 1965 The Womens Archives was renamed in honor of him and his widow The Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America overflows with source material of rare pathos on rights and suffrage social reform professions politics labor government feminism household arts Among the collections are those of the BeecherStowe family of the National Organization for Women and of the Lydia Pinkham Medicine Company in 3371 folders 60 volumes and several untapped bottles Here repose accessible to scholars the Susan B Anthony papers purchased at auction by a Radcliffe trustee and his wife Included is the manuscript of the suffragettes text on The True Woman 1857 Why is it that the pages of all history glow with the names of illustrious men while only here and there a lone woman appears who like the eccentric comet marks the centuries Would that she could see even her jots and tittles here enthroned sharing dominion with sisterly accounts such as that by Dr Eliza T Ransom writing from Berlin in 1922 I have assisted him [a German obstetrician] several days in operationssomething no Amer surgeon ever offered me   He hypnotisesdelivers his babies operates  everything under hypnosis So wonderful Counts 5 five and they come out absolutely unconscious of what has occurred no nauseano vomitingnothing Cultivation of Charm Not one to throw out the bath water with the baby Dr Ransom also cherished tradition In a broadcast during the thirties the script is here she praised the cultivation of feminine personality and charm And here is the letter from Anthony Comstock once guardian of morals in the United States Post Office Department to Miss Florence Cross who had received obscenity through the mails You are a brave and heroic woman There are few wh6 would have the courage to do what you have done to place in our hands the infamous things that have been sent to you through the mail    I will do all in my power to avenge the insult offered you In its most recent report on the years 1974 to 1976 the library announces the acquisition from Corliss Lamont of correspondence on what it calls A shameful episode in womens struggle for fair conditions of employment at a neighboring institution The Harvard Scrubwomen The contents of two large boxes document the affair of Harvards scrubwomen As the Schlesinger report puts it The controversy arose when Harvard dismissed without notice nineteen scrubwomen in November and December of 1929 rather than pay them the minimum wage of 37 cents per hour  It was Mr Lamont who led the fight against such practice and helped raise a fund for the scrubwomen It was A Lawrence Lowell Harvards president who bobbed and weaved as in this letter in the Lamont collection   of course I am responsible for everything that goes on and I do not want to shun the responsibility but that does not mean that I actually know everything or decide every question The field of womens history has grown so dramatically that the library is collecting not only materials of that history but is also documenting the history of that history History of Birth Control With Rockefeller Foundation money the Schlesinger has been compiling an oral history of pioneering in birth control and abortion Mary S Calderone medical director of Planned Parenthood 1953 to 1964 Every other year I would write to the AMA trustees and I would say Look heres whats happening Dont you think its high time the AMA reconsidered its position And theyd write back formally and say No we see no reason to change our stance of 1937  Sarah R Weddington who successfully pleaded the landmark abortion case before the Supreme Court  I can remember arguing to an imaginary Justice Burger in my mind what it would be like to be pregnant and not want to be Im not sure I ever really phrased that in a way I was satisfied with Lana Clarke Phelan a leader in the abortion campaign    when I got out of the hospital the doctor told me not to have another baby or Id die Well that scared me a little bit but he didnt tell me how not to   Not a word about contraception Oh I asked him how not to and he said Stay away from your husband  Loraine Leeson Campbell president Planned Parenthood 19561959    the whole womens movement or whatever its called leaves me cold A Cookbook Collection But few enthusiasms are scorned here In the office of the library director simmers a cookbook collection largely reflecting the tastes of its donors Samuel and Narcissa Chamberlain The library had long sought a first edition of The Boston CookingSchool Cook Book by Fannie Farmer and finally found one in the library of the late Professor Schlesinger His widow who is 90 promptly donated it My mother is an excellent cook said Prof Arthur M Schlesinger Jr Mother and son are the two honorary members of the librarys advisory board Though the recipes on the library shelves can hardly be improved on much of the editorial sauce Is dj vieux In Cooking As Men Like It 1930 George Frederick complains about women who come out of the kitchen and slur all interest in food in favor of chimerical pursuits of one kind and another which so often come to naught   The American Frugal Housewife so plainly 19th century is contemporary enough to suggest substitutes for coffee  some use dry brown bread crusts and roast them others soak rye grain in rum and roast it others roast peas in the same way as coffee None of these are very good    after all the best economy is to go without More Blunt Truths In letters by Lydia Maria Child author of that guide to economy there are more blunt truths as in this from 1862 Cutting out flannel for negroes is not so attractive to the imagination as meditating upon German poetry but in the world beyond you may find that it was really a higher education for the soul The library also collects womens periodicals everything from Seventeen whose charms can be intoxicating to Sobering Thoughts whose message is abstinence Published by Women for Sobriety Inc this journal asks How much debris do we carry with us into sobriety from those nightmare days of drinking The library lifts its showcase glass periodically and deposits treasures on a single theme Currently the theme is books by Radcliffe authors Included is An Elucidation by Gertrude Stein reprinted in book form because as the publisher explains the original journal publication had the right words in the wrong order through an inadvertence in the printing establishment Some collections arrive without solicitation others have been acquired after years of diplomacy Prospects become particularly generous when cleaning house for example during a move It is usually a son rather than a daughter who volunteers to donate a mothers collection Awaiting a Cataloguer About 270 manuscript collections are catalogued the rest are future toil The Betty Friedan collection for example awaits its cataloguer who will find the accumulated papers and oddments a perfect delectation of random order Linda Henry carefully skirts these riches as she toils on the papers of Joanna and Martha Elizabeth Bucknall sisters who established a girls school in Newark in 1841 Ive taught in college Miss Henry said and these 19th century high school students write better than almost anyone I ever taught After finishing the Bucknalls Miss Henry may turn to the papers of Jeannette Rankin 18801973 the first woman elected to Congress and the only person there who voted against participation in both World Wars At 91 the veteran pacifist announced that if she had her life to relive shed do the same things but this time Id be nastier Six months have been allotted to cataloguing her papers under a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities which also provided funds for transcribing and editing the Maimie Letters written by a reformed prostitute and former morphine addict to Fanny Quincy Mrs Mark DeWolfe Howe Excerpt I lived in luxurious home until I was sixteen and then for years after that had the easy life that immoral living brings and I just cannot he moral enough to see where drudgery is better than a life of lazy vice  Industrial School Archives Timothy Stroup is processing the archives of the North Bennet Street Industrial School founded by Pauline Agassiz Shaw stepdaughter of Radcliffes first president The sheer bulk of the collection has taken us by surprise he said It may take Mr Stroup two years to complete his work and meanwhile the industrial school eager to celebrate its centenary is pressing him to determine whether it was founded in 1879 or 1881 We have six people processing manuscripts so we feel well be catching up with the backlog said Patricia M King the librarys director The new collections tend to be bigger so were having to learn to process in less detail Were learning to weed out Among items that have turned up in the collections are spectacle cases picture frames rubber stamps rubber gloves lace collars suffrage buttons gavels paperweights hotel bills household account books check stubs Jeannette Rankins collection included dresses and shoes and a brocade hot water bottle cover said Eva Mose ley curator of manuscripts We sent it all to the Smithsonian They were very glad to have the clothes and we were very glad not to have them But the library romantic to a fault graciously accepted the plaster cast by Harriet Hosmer the 19th century American sculptor of the clasped hands of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning The hands are displayed in the front hall with letters from the literary couple who were so attached On the fourth floor drawn by the richness of library archives perch researchers preparing the fourth volume of Notable American Women This Radcliffe project whose first three volumes were published by Harvard University Press has already covered notables who died before 1951 The fourth volume will include biographies of about 450 women who died between Jan 1 1951 and Dec 31 1975 Doubtful Moments Carol Green one of the editors has been compiling long lists of nominees for inclusion and she has her doubtful moments I was doing 1968 she said and I felt I really did not want to relive this year Scholarly neutrality of course forbids such concessions to personal preference Even the Schlesingers dedicated to the cause of woman must occasionally conform to the ends of man Thus the library may soon solicit the records of a home for aged couples If the deal goes through Dr King would never be doctrinaire enough to refuse half the records as though humankind could eliminate man from its midst
A Poll of East Side Catholics Ties Attendance Drop to Loss of Faith,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/10/archives/a-poll-of-east-side-catholics-ties-attendance-drop-to-loss-of-faith.html,A survey of Roman Catholics on the East Side of Manhattan indicates that sharp declines in attendance at mass over the last decade have resulted from a toss of faith in the supernatural rather than disagreement with the churchs moral teachings or changes in ritual Among other findings of the poll which raises important questions for parish practices and religious education are that Catholics who are young highly educated and divorced are the most likely to drop out Although as the report notes the area surveyed is not typical in many respects either of the archdiocese or the nations Catholic community the findings are regardedas an important index of patterns of religious behavior among the growing numbers of middleincome and uppermiddleincome Catholics The questionnaire was commissioned by the 14 parishes on the East Side from 59th to 96th Street and was conducted by mail last spring under the supervision of sociologists from the Archdiocesan Office of Pastoral Research A total of 266 Catholics answered the questions half responding to a random selection of 2222 names from a telephone directory that lists subscribers by address the other half drawn from the membership roles of the 14 parishes The poll represents the first such study of churchgoing patterns in the archdiocese and shows that churchgoers differ markedly from nonchurchgoers over such basic Catholic beliefs as the existence of God the divinity of Christ and the reality of heaven and hell By contrast many church officials have tended to link lower attendance to unhappiness with certain policies of the institution The study found that while 79 percent of those who attend mass regularly said they believed without doubt in a personal God only 39 percent of the nonattending group agreed At the same time 91 percent of the regular worshipers compared to 50 percent of the dropouts concurred with the conviction that Jesus is the divine Son of God Catholic mass attendance has been recorded annually by the Gallup surveys They show a dramatic decline from a weekly averages of 71 percent in 1964 to 54 percent in 1975 Figures from the archdiocese depict an even lower attendance trend among New York Catholics A Pastoral Research Oflice estimate places the present rate of weekly churchgoing in New York at onethird the total number of Catholics a drop of 44 percent since 1965 Among the leading theories about the decline supported by a recent survey by the National Opinion Research Center in Chicago is that it is traceable to disillusionment with church teachings on sexual morality particularly the ban on artificial birth control And Their Frequent Explanation Another frequently mention explanation is that Catholics in large numbers rejected the reforms of Vatican Council II which ended in 1965 The New York study composed of 41 questions disputes both assumptions Thirtyfour percent of the 266 respondents no longer attend mass while 66 percent do Actual mass  attendance figures estimated among the 54000 Catholics on the East Side show just the reverse One third attend mass regularly and twothirds do not In addition to showing a marked loss on conviction about the central mysteries of the church the nonchurchgoers cited dissatisfaction with the liturgy particularly preaching a lack of clarity on the part of the church in stating what it believes and the inability to satisfy personal needs as main incentives for abandoning Sunday attendance They Want Leadership The director of the survey the Rev Philip J Murnion said The church as a community of clear positions strong leadership and important relationships has been lost somewhere along the way People do not want that old time religion They are not asking for retrenchment to rigid rules and clerical dominance He continued They favor an outreaching church lay participation and a revival of a sense of community around faith and mutual caring They want leadership Attitudes toward morality provide a significant if not decisive indication of differences between those who Maintain the tradition and those who do not Regular worshipers the study says ara much more likely to accept the churchs teachings on sexuality including the stand against abortion divorce premarital sex and artificial birth control But serious doubts arise even among those counted mcst loyal Sixtyfour percent of the churchgoers polled said they did not agree that the use of artificial contraceptives was immoral Six percent of the nonchurchgoers said the same On abortion 63 percent of churchgoers called it immoral compared to 19 percent of the nonattenders Fortynine percent of the former group stated that divorce and remarriage without church approval was wrong as opposed to 9 percent of the nonattenders The two groups showed an equally strong commitment to ending racial injustice but the nonchurchgoers were more inclined to oppose discrimination against homosexuals and churchgoers more dedicated to helping the poor Father Murnion points out several areas of overlap and some apparent ironies between the two groups For example those who attend mass indicate considerable doubt about beliefs in the supernatural although not as much as their counterparts and nonchurchgoers while rejecting many tenets of the faith still for the most part pray at least once a week Divergences on Doctrine In no area of the survey was the split between the two groups more apparent than on doctrines that have provided the foundations of the faith Fewer than half pf the disaffected group attested to a belief in eternal punishment baptism as a spiritual rebirth or the existence cf hell One of the ways the area surveyed differs from the rest of the archdiocese is in family income While 75 percent of East Side families earn 10000 a year or more 51 percent of the families in the archdiocese as a whole fall into that category The archdiocese takes in Manhattan the Bronx and Staten Island and 10 neighboring New York State counties In summing up the study Father Murnion sounds a disquieting note for the church In effect the younger more educated people are far more likely to have lost conviction about the mysteries of the faith about orthodox positions on sexuality and to have ceased attending mass We wind up then with an older some what less educated populaton at church a group considerably more likely to be orthodox in faith and morals but among whom there are broad areas of unorthodoxy as well

The Littlest Inmates,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/13/archives/westchester-weekly-the-littlest-inmates.html,ANN POE a correction officer at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility was on the job late one winter afternoon Wearing a pink smock over her blue uniform she sat at her desk with a tiny baby propped on her shoulder and patted its back Come on come on baby she chanted Lets get that burp up Miss Poe is assigned to guard the nursery at the facilitythe only prison for women in the statewhere babies live with their mothers who are serving time Last month there were seven babies in the nursery all born after their mothers had been sentenced One of the mothers 21yearold Brenda McMichael led the way into her babys 5footsquare room one of many such cubicles that line a corridor in the building Mrs McMichael said she had been in prison since last August serving a sentence of up to four years for a crime she would not discuss The twomonthold baby Shameeka Tyshawn was curled in her crib sucking a pacifier A pale green crocheted blanket was folded on a straight chair standing against a wall and the top of a pink metal cabinet held baby powder shampoo cotton swabs a bottle of vitamin drops and a pair of small white shoes Before Mrs McMichael left the babys room she pulled up the barred side of the high metal crib then gave it an extra tug just to be sure Women who forget to raise the sides can be punished she said The babies mothers share a row of bedrooms a shower room a laundry room and a kitchen for heating bottles mixing baby cereal and cooking meals and snacks with food purchased from the prison commissary Mrs McMichael walked down the hall to join her friends three young women sitting in a small recreation room rocking their babies in carriages and watching an old Frank Sinatra movie on a blackandwhite television set In another room two women lay on their beds smoking cigarettes listening to music on the radio and cooing at their chubby infants On a third bed a pregnant woman with a pale face and long blonde hair knitted silently At first the room seemed cozy and warm with the friendly air of a college dormitory But as the sky outside darkened and babies began to cry a feeling of confinement intensified The nursery area is in an old redbrick building that is also used as the prison hospital It is cleaner and less confusing than the newer living units where the other 400 prisoners are housed said Evelyn Laboy 24 years old who was sitting in the recreation room rocking her monthold daughter Dionne But I find myself depressed most of the time she added There are the same girls all the time the same gossip Theres nothing to do but look at your baby Its not a normal environment Mrs Laboy who is serving a threeyear sentence for drug possession was in her second month of pregnancy when she was arrested She already had two children a 5yearold boy and a 1yearold girl who are now being cared for by her mother and motherinlaw When I got here I was pretty sick she recalled I didnt want to eat I was losing weight Then she said she became involved in an IBM training course and in law and psychology classes New mothers stay in the nursery area for six weeks after they have given birth Then they are allowed to return to educational or vocational classes in the prisons school building A nurses aide cares for the babies while their mothers are away and the women keep an eye on one anothers children The prison has a nursing staff and a pediatrician visits periodically Still the mothers worry about illness Suppose my baby was to get sick Mrs Laboy said What would I do Id have to call an officer then she would call the nurse and if the nurse thought the baby was not sick maybe she wouldnt call anybody Each woman said the happiest time since her arrest was the few days spent in Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco where the babies were born At the hospital each prisoner has a private room and a correction officer stays with her all the time To me the guard was like having company said Mrs McMichael whose husband died last May Nobody came to visit me Nobody comes to visit us now Most of the women are unmarried and some have other children But Debbie Davis a wan 18yearold from a small town near Buffalo was already in jail when she found she was pregnant She said that in a county jail where she was at the time some of the officers had suggested an abortion But there was no way they were going to take my babys life she said Mothers in the prison are allowed to keep their babies for as long as a year or they may send them out to husbands grandparents or foster homes after four weeks Although they express concern about the unnatural surroundings the lack of fresh air and the absence of male figures most choose to keep their babies with them After working here five years I still dont know if Its better for the babies to stay or go said Sister Elaine Roulet a counselor In the prison It depends on the mother how she feels about the baby and herself what are her options Each must be treated as an Individual

"Helping Hand Awaits, Unwed Mothers",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/13/archives/new-jersey-weekly-helping-hand-awaits-unwed-mothers.html,DURING the last six years Mr and Mrs Joseph McCullough of Haddon Heights have welcomed almost a dozen young women into their home providing them with shelter and understanding during the final phases of an unwanted pregnancy The McCulloughs are part of a network of more than 100 families in New Jersey who offer their homes free of charge to young womenmost of them teenagersto help them through the mental and physical rigors of pregnancy and childbirth The families are recruited by Birthright an international organization that offers women an fit ernative to abortion it is staffed by trained volunteers and operates on financial donations from individuals and organizations We are a prolife service said Denise Cacciolone national director of Birthright We dont like the term antiabortion because thats negative We have a positive attitude toward life and offer positive and constructive solutions to the problems of an unwanted pregnancy We offer positive solutions not destructive ones which is what abortion is Mrs Cacciolone who is married and has two children said that abortion is destroying our society It produces a negative attitude toward children and toward life in general she contends Women who undergo an abortion can have serious results later on in life Mrs Cacciolone asserted adding No one tells them what they are doing to themselves The ramificatiort of abortion can result in farreaching psychological problems five or 10 years later In a brochure describing the organization it is noted that Birthright is independent nonpolitical and nonsectarian and prepared to help you whether you are single or married and regardless of age race or religion Our help is free and confidential Give life a chance and well help you every step of the way Mrs Cacciolone explained that the organization which has 20 offices in New Jersey and 265 across the country offered medical psychological and legal help to about 5000 pregnant women in the state since the first office was opened in Woodbury in 1970 Birthright was founded in 1968 by a Toronto housewife We have girls as young as 12 come in but the average age is between 15 and 19 Mrs Cacciolone said adding that most of the youngsters are Caucasian and about twothirds are single Its really like the girl next door she observed When a young woman comes into a Birthright office seeking advice she is given a medical examinationif she has not already had oneto determine if she is pregnant She is then given medical and psychological counseling to help her through this crucial period in her life If the woman is a minor the visit and any information about the pregnancy are kept confidential We go ahead and deal with her as if she were just another person Mrs Cacciolone said We advise these girls to tell their parents and even offer to go with them According to Mrs Cacciolone some families abuse the youngsters or even throw them out of the house when they find out that they are pregnant especially if the girl is carrying a biracial child I feel that shelter is our second most crucial service Mrs Cacciolone said First comes the medical care the prenatal care so that the girl will deliver properly and the baby will be healthy Shelter is usually provided by a private family that opens its home and hearts to girls during this crisis period In many cases the mother is invited to the home after the child is born and the family helps her to get back on her feet Although adoption procedures are available about 75 percent of the new mothers decide to keep their babies Joan McCullough said that she first became involved with Birthright when her husband an attorney in Collingswood was active in a RighttoLife group and she was called to see if she would provide shelter for a young girl I did and Ive been with it ever since she said We ask the girls to be part of the family and ask them to hold up their end by doing chores or by staying with the children or by pitching in and doing the dishes Most of them do their part Mrs McCullough said that some of the pregnant girls who lived with her were rebellious and that two had been asked to leave In the beginning we took in anybody who needed a home Mrs McCullough recalled Some of the girls were very mixed up and not very responsible Mrs McCullough added that as her own family grewshe has six children ranging in age from to to 11she had to make sure that the pregnant women coming into her home could be trusted with the children whenever she and her husband were out One of the girls she had asked to leave Mrs McCullough said had made a date with a group of boys and had asked another pregnant girl living in the McCullough home to cover for her absence and to leave the back door open We have a very good relation with so many of the girls she said Many of them come back to visit and bring their babies Its such a pleasure to see them and to know that we helped Were fortunate that we are able to afford it and that were able to share our blessings with them

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/18/archives/letters.html,In arguing that the right of dissent should be upheld in your Feb 1 editorial A Worthwhile Complication you listed as a selfish reason for encouraging dissent abroad the nourishing of dissent here at home While that is a bonus to expect from a forthright policy in support of civil liberties outside the United States it is not the only selfish reason for such a policy Especially in the setting of the 1975 Helsinki accords a countrys internal conduct is made a contributing factor to the security of its neighbors To the Editor The accords are the outcome of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe The ten principles by which the signatory states agreed to guide their relations with one another include the promise to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms including the freedom of thought conscience religion or belief The context in which that pledge is given makes it clear that improvement in EastWest security and cooperation is as contingent on that nations tolerance for unpopular views at home as it is on that nations tolerance for the sanctity of its neighbors frontiers In societies where all political decisions are made by tiny closed ruling groups the existence or apparently tiny groups critical of official policy is one of the few political restraints on capricious behavior at the top The effectiveness of that restraint in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe depends now at least on the degree of Western attention given to those critical voices But the service dissenters perform is not for their benefit alone To the extent that their activity must be tolerated because it is echoed from abroad it gives the West an added confidence that Communist decisionmaking must reckon with at least some of the same rules of the game by which democratic governments are bound Our security  not just the vigor of our internal debate is bound up with gradual acceptance in the East of the code of conduct for human rights formulated in the Helsinki accords DANTE B FASCELL Member of Congress 15th Dist Fla Washington Feb 1 1977 The writer heads the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe To the Editor Since your Feb 5 editorial on India did me the honor of quoting from my OpEd article published last Nov 12 permit me to say that the defection of Jagjivan Ram from the Government has suddenly given him a status in the eyes of Mrs Gandhis critics which he never enjoyed before To most objective Indiawatchers the description of Mr Ram as the widely acknowledged political leader of the poorest people in India its 85 million untouchables will come as a surprise That designation was appropriate for the late B R Ambedkar alone and since his death in 1956 nobody has been able to claim the same place in the hearts of Indias untouchables Mr Ram was widely perceived as a chronic hangeron in the Cabinet and his pique resulted from his being demoted from a key ministry to a lesser position in the Government He rightfully belongs with the geriatric leadership of the new opposition party consisting of some strange bedfellows It is an unfair oversimplification to depict Mrs Gandhis supporters as subscribing to the view that poor people dont need democracy The convenient amnesia of some regarding the situation that prompted the imposition of emergency rule probably permits such an assertion to be made The nearanarchic summer of 1975 featured almost daily protest marches student riots labor strikes and inflammatory speeches exhorting the police to rebel and the railroad workers to stop loading food grains in order to bring the Government to its knees by producing mass hunger A bomb killed a Government minister The press and the opposition were engaged in a strident campaign to paralyze the duly elected Government without artidulating any agreedupon alternative course for India The national priorities were being shunted aside so that a small minority could indulge unabashedly in this orgy of socalled democratic processes For Mrs Gandhi not to have acted as she did would have been the biggest copout of our time Some of your readers wrote plaintively of torture of political prisoners in India Now that the political prisoners are being released en masse and are able to speak freely I wonder what happened to all those horror stories Perhaps instead of creating eplieineral heroes out of a few disgrueetled defectors we should await the verdict of the people next month GHULAM FARGGQ Wingdale N Y Feb 6 1977 State School Aid Beneath the SugarCoating To the Editor This is in response to your Jan 24 editorial SugarCoating School Aid Medicine The Roslyn School District Nassau County is one of the rich districts rich in schoolaid terms refers to property valuenot residents income For fiscal 197677 we received 14 percent of our operating expenses in state aid The Governors recommendation guaranteeing no less than 30 percent of the amount of operating aid received by the district in 197677 would reduce Roslyns aid 10 percent We dont ask for as many dollars as other districts but if much more aid is removed we will become financially independent from the state but still subject to its mandates This is not a partnership The state aid formula is in desperate need of revision It has been studied and shelved for years Under Governor Careys formula Levittown the same Levittown asking for equality in court would be reduced over 13 percent or S2 million Ninetyfive percent of the states 787 school districts are save harmless districts but not all are rich Governor Carey does not propose a rational system but a onetime slash that will endanger one of the very things making New York an attractive place in which to live invest and worka superior educational system Governor Careys bonus incentive plan not only threatens teachers organizations but it aims at the heart of our systemlocal control The taxpayer not the Governor should control public schools The attempt to provide relief for the overburdened taxpayer is a valid goal but will not be achieved Responsible school trustees will not be able to cut back sufficiently to meet his requirements The tax burden will shift from the more progressive income base surcharge to the local property base We all know that today property is not the accurate measure of wealth that it was in the days of our Founding Fathers The Governors proposals are far from adequate A comprehensive plan for reform has been prepared by the Educational Conference Board an umbrella group composed of seven recognized organizations in the state representing parents teachers school boards and administrators New York State cannot ask Washington for a fair return on Federal tax dollars while denying school districts a minimal return on state tax dollars It is a sad contrast to find President Carter seeking educational leadership from New York State during the same week that our own Governor proposed a sugarcoated medicine that may alleviate some symptoms but not the real problem ARLENE SILBERZWEIG Roslyn Heights LI Jan 25 1377 The writer is president of the Roslyn School Board The Abortion Issue And Secretary Califano To the Editor I am compelled to respond to your Jan 31 editorial in which you judge that the position held by Health Education and Welfare Secretary Joseph Califano in personally opposing abortion is by implication an endorsement of injustice The gist of your editorial is to have us believe that the Supreme Court decision which ruled that state laws prohibiting abortion were unconstitutional actually constituted a moral sanction for abortion which was certainly not the case The reference to Secretary Califano as one who endorses injustices is highly subjective and simply does not follow Is it justice to coerce individuals with deeply held ethical moral and religious views to act contrary to them or to risk serious penalty with respect to social economic or political status by consequence of adhering to their principles Even if the answer were in the affirmativeand this is debatableit leaves unanswered the issue of morality Is it possible that a politicaljudicial position may in fact be an immoral one SALVATORE J LAGUMINA Garden City L I Feb 4 1977 To Rescue the City To the Editor The daily complaint of our city politicians against outside financial control reeks of gross hypocrisy For it is these same politicians of the past and present who are largely responsible for our state of economic chaos As is obviously and grossly apparent their idea of financial management does not work in real terms They do nothing more than bite the hand of the people attempting to save them If our blinded public bureaucrats desire financial stability why dont they first create and then promote New York as a lucrative tax haven for business For it is the corporations and other financial organizations which feed New York certainly not our bulging government ranks or welfare recipients People dont need rhetoric they need jobs The most efficient managers of jobs and finance are the private individuals and organizations that are now fleeing in the face of insane taxation Open your eyes and give the businessmen a chance before we do drop dead RICHARD D BROWN New York Jan 31 1977 Have Legislators Lost Their WIN Buttons To the Editor The new Federal pay raise of around 29 percent for Senators Congressmen judges and supercrats proves one thing Weve replaced the Imperial Presidency of 1972 with the imperial Bureaucracy of 1977 With the Speaker of the House at 75000 per year plus Senators and Congressmen at 57500 and Federal judges from 54500 to 75000 should be apparent to the average American taxpayer at 11000 a year that his or her Government in Washington is now approaching the sovereign income level What are they trying to do Catch up with the Presidential salary of 200000 per year plus 50000 expenses Whatever happened to the war on inflation Have our legislators lost their WIN buttons How can our Federal officials legislators and judges understand inflation if they are insulated or indexed from it If President Carter wants to demonstrate real fiscal leadership and sacrifice and keep in touch with the common people he can start by reducing his own salary This might discourage our Imperial Bureaucracy from asking for even another pay raise in 1978 At 200000 per year salary plus lifetime pensions at 66000 a year our American Presidents are overpaid and overpensioned This sets a bad example for the rest of the Federal bureaucracy Lets turn down the fiscal thermometer in the White House with a 65000 Presidential salary cut This could take some deficitspending heat off the Treasury and help to balance the Federal budget by 1981 SID TAYLOR National Taxpayers Union Washington Feb 11 1977 Gov Browns Way To the Editor Governor Browns first step in replacing professionals on regulatory boards with a majority of public lay members who by virtue of a lack of background in the specialties and of expertise in the special language involved will attempt to administer occupations and professions in the public interest [news story Feb 7] is as naked an example of misuse of power as one may ever wish to see Those who have had the opportunity to attain some high level of skill and training because they chose to invest time and effort will be controlled by those who preferred to stay in the background if Governor Brown gets his will The Governor of course has ambitions for the Presidency where the public interest can gain him ever further reaching controls of the competent by the incompetenta prospect of terror INGE FRIEDRICH Guttenberg NJ Feb 7 1977
Trenton Topics,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/18/archives/trenton-topics-byrne-signs-a-measure-requiring-hearing-test-for.html,TRENTON Feb 17Before 60 of New Jerseys 49000 deaf residents Governor Byrne signed into law today a bill that will require that every newborn child in the state except those whose parents have religious objections be given a test for the detection of hearing impairments The measure was sponsored by State Senator Anthony Scardino Jr Democrat of Lyndhurst It calls for a simple inexpensive test approved by the State Department of Health that is expected to detect hearing ailments in one of every 2000 infants A Hearing Evaluation Council will advise the Health Department on the implementation of the law The council will consist of three medical professionals a person who is profoundly deaf a person with impaired hearing a hearing person whose parents are deaf and a citizen of the state who is interested in the concerns and welfare of the deaf The delegation of deaf residents from frolicsome youngsters to the elderly toured the State House with guides using sign language to explain the features of the building and the workings of the Legislature The deaf residents also carried signs bearing messages such as Deaf want voice in the government and We need oldage homes for the deaf Many of the residents wore buttons with tht message Deaf prideDeaf power Their silent communication in sign language contrasted sharply with the sloganshouting contest that developed between groups favoring and opposing state abortion laws who were also in the State House The residents visit was sponsored by the New Jersey Association for the Deaf Inc Its purpose was also to press for passage of another bill S1220 also sponsored by Senator Scardino which would establish a Division for the Deaf in the State Department of Labor and Industry The aim of the measure would be to advance educational and employment opportunities for the hard of hearing and improve their institutional facilities One of the delegates was Susan Barnabie of Cherry Hill the daughter of two deaf parents Miss Barnabie who is girls athletic coordinator at Peddie School in Hightstown has normal hearing but can read lips and converse in sign language She served as a communicator between members of the delegation and others in the State House  The State Department of Environmental Protection says in a report made public today that New Jerseys autoemission controls are more effective in curbing carbon monoxide pollution than Californias where moreadvanced control systems are in effect and that New Jersey vehicles produce less carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons than autos tested in New York State The report entitled A Comparison of Nationwide Inspection Program Idle Emission Data analyzes testing results in New Jersey and New York and in the cities of Chicago Cincinnati Portland Ore Phoenix Ariz and Riverside Calif New Jersey has had a mandatory idle vehicle  emissions inspection  maintenance programknown as IM in the tradesince Feb 1 1974 Before that a nonmandatory testing program had been in effect since July 1972 In contrast New York State emissioncontrol tests are still voluntary Among other conclusions of the study conducted by John C Elston of the State Environmental Protection Department are the following Tests show a significantly higher level of auto emissions in the Southwest as sampled in Arizona compared with the Northeast and Arizona demonstrates a vehicle population in need of corrective maintenance Samples from vehicles in New York State show significantly less hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions than those from Arizona but not as low as those from New Jersey The report concludes that engine maintenance plays an important role in the control of auto pollutants and that the annual emission inspection and maintenance program as carried out in New Jersey is essential to achieving cleaner cars New Jerseys environmentalprotection officials shared their findings with the State of Arizona just before a recent referendum on the proposed repeal of Arizonas autoemission testing program The result was that Arizonans voted decisively for going ahead with their emissions testing program  Jacob Landau an artist who lives in Roosevelt in Monmouth County presented 25 of his prints today to the State of New Jersey in recognition of a grant he had received from the State Council on the Arts in 1975 Alvin E Gershen chairman of the Arts Council an agency of the New Jersey Secretary of States office accepted the collection of lithographs with the comment that they were created by one of New Jerseys premier artists The lithographs by Mr Landau are entitled Meditations on Love and Death  A demonstration against the restoration of the death penalty in New Jersey will be held outside Morven the Governors mansion in Princeton at 1 PM Saturday The demonstration sponsored by the Princeton Students Against Death and the Revolutionary Student Brigade will and a mass meeting at the Princeton include a picket line in front of Morven Theological Seminary according to its organizers A bill restoring the death penalty in this state has been approved by both the Assembly and Senate and awaits Governor Byrnes signature
SCHOOL MEDITATION ADVANCES IN TRENTON,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/18/archives/school-meditation-advances-in-trenton-assembly-passes-a-bill-to.html,TRENTON Feb 17The Assembly passed today a bill to require publicschool teachers to conduct a brief period of solemn meditation with the participation of all the pupils at the beginning of each school day The Assembly also approved 49 to 19 a bill calling for a Federal constitutional convention to consider outlawing abortion The measure which recently passed in the Senate went to Governor Byrne If he signs it New Jersey will become the fourth state to have enacted such legislation Although the meditation bills sponsor Assemblyman Thomas J Deverin Democrat of Cartaret insisted that the measure had no forced religious connotation opponents and supporters of the bill argued its merits in terms of whether its effect would be to return prayer to the classroom The measure which passed by a vote of 65 to 5 and was sent to the Senate is patterned after the statute enacted by Massachusetts before the 197576 school year The statute was challenged as unconstitutional by the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union but was upheld by a Federal District Court last summer Similar statutes have also been enacted in Connecticut Virginia Mississippi and Maryland according to a spokesman for Amercians United for Separation of Church and State For the life of me I cant understand why anyone would oppose this bill Mr Deverin said It contains not one harmful thing for the schools for the children or for education The pupils can reflect on what they want to They can pray if so disposed hope the teacher breaks a leg or think about passing a test Mr Deverin and some supporters including Assemblyman Willie B Brown Democrat of Newark said the meditation period might improve discipline in the schools An opposite view was advanced by Assemblyman Harold Martin Democrat of Cresskill who said the practice would dampen the enthusiasm of the pupils He also said he opposed the bill because its prime purpose is really to introduce religion into the schools A number of Assemblymen supported the bill because they believed prayers should be said in classrooms and they complained that the Deverin measure did not go far enough I think all of us in this house believe in God believe in a diety said Assemblyman J Jack Gallagher Democrat of Cherry Hill Were hedging with this bill and are afraid to admit it Because the Constitution has been interpreted to protect other peoples interests we suppress our own Assemblyman Michael F Adubato Democrat of Newark pointed out that every legislative session started with a prayer He said the same practice was observed by Congress even though prayers were banned in the schools Doesnt Go Far Enough My three children could never understand that and I couldnt ever explain it to them he said This bill doesnt go far enough but at least Ill be able to answer my children proponents of the solemn meditation bill are counting on the more conservative cast of the current United States Supreme Court as compared with the 1963 Court which ruled that the saying of prayers in public schools violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of church and state The Supreme Court has changed for the better said Assemblyman Brian T Kennedy Republican of Wall Township There is nothing ominous nothing sinister and in 1977 nothing unconstitutional in this bill The antiabortion bill would have Congress set up a convention to amend the United States Constitution to include a provision that every human being shall be deemed from the moment of fertilization to be a person and entitled to the right to life Hyland Opinion Sought The passage of similar measures by a total of 34 states would force Congressional action according to the proponents of the bill but any amendment proposed by the convention would have to be approved by 38 states before it would take affect The bills opponents argue that the convention once convened could not he limited to the consideration of abortion and could repeal part of the Bill of Rights in the words of one opponent Sponsors of the successful bill said they would seek an opinion from  General William F Hyland on whether the measure needed the Governors signature or whether it could be forwarded to Congress immediately The New Jersey Right To Life Commit tee the antiabortion group that lobbied for passage of the bill issued a statement this evening congratulating the lawmakers for their action As only the US Supreme Court not the Congress or New Jersey State Legislature made abortion on demand the law of the land the constitutional convention must be seen as consistent with the highest democratic principles the statement said Before the legislative session began members of the committee and members of a proabortion organization faced off in the corridor outside the Assembly chambers They chanted songs and slogans at one another under the watchful gaze of state troopers The brief demonstration broke up and the two groups watched the vote from the balcoNY above the chambers
Laughing Last,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/20/archives/laughing-last-alger-hiss-as-dad.html,The Hiss Case A sibilant whisper of a generations obsession One can hear echoes of the late 1940sthe ferocious debates in faculty lounges and barrooms the immersion in apartment leases vacation schedules typewriter markings pumpkin papers automobile transactions as later generations would debate the condition of Bullet 399 or the linguistic ambiguities of a White House tape No wonder Alistair Cooke called his account of the Hiss Case Generation on Trial Whatever side you took in postwar America you were signaling far more than your opinion about the guilt of a wellbred welleducated New Deal bureaucrat who may have been a secret Communist and a conveyor of documents to an underground organization For Alger Hiss innocent or guilty was the symbol of a class of privileged young men who threw in with a national Administration that reshaped the relation between the individual and Government Innocent he was the victim of a monstrous highlyplaced conspiracy out to slander the good name of social reform Guilty he was the witting agent of a monstrous highlyplaced conspiracy riddling the Government with people whose first loyalty was to a totalitarian ideology embodied in a foreignand potentially hostileGovernment Argue for Hisss guilt or innocence as you would the one innocence impossible to maintain was your own What Tony Hiss has done in Laughing Last is therefore almost unimaginable He has managed to strip away from the figure of Alger Hiss all intensity all passion and virtually all political symbolism What he puts in their place is a pervasive sensibility of triviality an excessively casual chatty almost sloppy account of his father as cross between Old Shoe and Good Old Boy full of quirks and foibles eccentric relatives anecdotes droll and otherwise a bit of a kook but a character whose presence in a political conspiracy is rendered ludicrous This tone I believe is deliberate much as a defense lawyer in a murder case will attempt to keep the jury relaxed and laughing The more human the defendant the harder it is to visualize him committing the distinctly unamusing and inhuman act of murder In Witness Whittaker Chambers seeks to convince us of conspiracy with a tone of passionate emotion what one of his detractors IF Stone unfairly called TimeLife Dostoyevsky Alger Hisss book In the Court of Public Opinion is an icecold effort at a defense brief But Laughing Last has the tone of a boozy cocktaillounge anecdote recounted by a wellbred eccentric peppered with tiresome obscenities and unsolicited personal revelations all with the effect if not the intention of moving the Hiss affair from the region of Darkness at Noon into Here at the New Yorker Consider the highly affected use of slang Prison is variously called the clink the can stir and the case itself is described as the time Alger Hiss got into a jam with the reds Alas his son calls him throughout the book is painted as a lad straight out of Our Gang hookyplaying cigarettepuffing prankloving poolshooting a picture oddly out of synch with the casual revelations of a father who committed suicide a sister who committed suicide and a brother who drank himself to death in his twenties The Hiss case itself is reduced to a bad 1940s Warner Brothers movie Whittaker Chambers is the fat guy with the bad teeth a con man and his testimony is a sham Alger Hisss innocence is deduced from the assertion of a Mafioso who served time with Hiss and who says I was running the numbers in three different Pennsyl vania cities You have to know people to run a business like that And I know that Alger Hiss is no Communist The credibility of Prof Alan Weinstein now convinced of Hisss guilt is refuted by a fellow stationery salesman of Hisss who saw him on television and something rubbed me the wrong way Hisss maid during his New Deal days is quoted as mistaking economists for ecommunists apparently designedthrough snobbism if not racismto laugh away the idea that there were any Communists in Washington during the New Deal Perhaps the least agreeable aspect of this highly disagreeable book is Tony Hisss determination to wrench the affair into a 1970s frame of reference by subordinating the political concerns to a series of gamy private revelations Thus we are told little about Alger Hisss politicsapart from his love of the New Dealexcept that he was politicized at Harvard which meant he decided that there were things that needed changing in this country that there was a vibrant vigorous strong American tradition of supporting the underdog that significant reform was possible Thanks to Laughing Last we now know that Alger Hiss stood somewhere between Frank Capra and Mother Bloor We are informed that Alger Hiss didnt know any or at least didnt know anyone who ever claimed to be a Commie Unless we are to take this with utter literalnessthat Alger Hiss never met anyone who said Hello there I am a Communistthen that assertion in the context of the 1930s scems absurd on its face We are told however that Hiss was a virgin when he married at 25 that he had tried sex earlier but he couldnt  on that occasion that his stepson was a homosexual that his wife had had an abortion And in the lingering tradition of the New Journalism we are also told of Tonys own problem with impotence and his own homosexual liaison What we do not get is much of a sense that we should care about what happened to Alger Hiss almost 30 years ago Since the antiCommunist right in America helped perpetrate so many reprehensible deedsblack listing political persecution the rise of Joe McCarthy and Richard Nixonperhaps Tony Hiss assumes we will see Hiss as another heroic victim of repression But when a book devotes almost as much attention to anecdotes about Oliver Wendell Holmes as it does to the Hiss Trials it raises a familiar suspicion about much of the American literary left that it is more comfortable poring over its scrapbooks than in looking at the world as it is today and what ought to he done to change it After 30 years two wars a civil rights revolution and a decade of unparalleled domestic upheaval the Hiss case debate  whatever the merits  has the familiar ring of emigrs in a Union Square cafeteria debating the tactics of the Kronstadt Uprising Whether innocent or guilty Alger Hiss is a victim either of his enemies calumny or his own denial of reality The irony here is that out of his sons determination to prove him a figure vindicated by history Alger Hiss has become victimized again For if this be the best case that his own flesh and blood can make for him then Alger Hisss last laugh is hollow indeed  Alger Hiss

The Death Penalty And the Governor,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/20/archives/new-jersey-opinion-the-death-penalty-and-the-governor.html,AFTER several months of negotiation the New Jersey Legislature has reached agreement on the reinstitution of capital punishment Now that both houses have passed a compromise deathpenalty bill Governor Byrne is being pressed to sign the legislation into law It is ironic that Mr Byrne should have the final voice in this matter While he was a judge of the State Superior Court it was he who helped to void the states previous deathpenalty act Now as Governor he must decide again whether the state should use death as the ultimate criminal punishment This time however his actions will have farreaching political as well as judicial implications Unlike the state income tax capital punishment is popular with the voters Brendan Byrne must make a pragmatic judgment Is he willing to further risk his political fortunes by refusing to sign a piece of popular but controversial legislation He must first make a moral decision Can death as a form of punishment be justified Are the risks implicit in a legal system that condones and participates in killing acceptable JeanPaul Sartre has written that once an action is committed it enters the realm of human behavior Once a precedent is set the original act is often expanded into a rationale for a series of larger moreorless related actions Once the concept that the state has the authority to deny life is reintroduced into our culture what effects might it have In a society that still cherishes its Wild West past the reinstitution of a dual morality may open a Pandoras box of moral and ethical dilemmas Acting on behalf of all people should government do what no single person is allowed to dokill In the abstract how do you judge which members of society have lost their right to life If religious forces argue that the sanctity of life renders abortion and euthanasia to be criminal acts are the lives of societys criminals and misfits any less sacred Capital punishment is premised upon the assumption that life is not a right but a privilege Once it is established in law that this privilege can be denied there are a multitude of areas where it can be applied If murderers through antisocial behavior have sacrificed their right to life what of kidnappers and rapists Is death the proper penalty for acts of treason What of the terminally ill and the mentally defective those who drain resources from the mainstream of society Are they candidates for elimination in the name of the common good Even if specific restrictions are placed on official executions they wont deter extralegal actions Reinstitution of capital punishment validates the notion that a human life can be taken for just cause The ultimate unthinkable horrordeathnow becomes thinkable Having decided that someone should die it is a short step to actively insuring that they do die If the legal system fails to provide the desired verdict somein the name of a just causemay seek to deliver retribution on their own Witness the hundreds of black men and women lynched during the first half of this century Many of them were Americans whose only crime was to have the wrong skin color Even the enforcement of law itself is so given to prejudice and chance that it cannot be the final arbiter of life and death Sacco and Vanzetti were executed as much for their political beliefs and ethnic background as for any crimes they may have committed A Connecticut teenager Peter Reilly was imprisoned and with recent changes in the law might have been executed for a murder he did not commit If one reviews the records of past executions it soon becomes clear that it is usually the poor who are killed by the state Welltodo defendants can afford attorneys to plead their cases The poor bear the brunt whenever capital punishment is enforced Justice is an ideal but its application is subject to human shortcomings The execution of Gary Gilmore in Utah took on all the overtones of a circus sideshow with the sale of buttons Tshirts and records as souvenirs News accounts added to the spectacle as correspondents recounted how they were led to where Gilmore was shot in order to observe the blood still dripping from the chair in which he spent his last moments of life A Texas court has ruled that television stations in that state may film and broadcast an actual electrocution American society views itself as civilized and in such a society mass murder is viewed as a crime But after repeated exposure the abnormal can become normal The value of human life plummets as death becomes in the words of William Calley no big deal Obviously the majority of the members in the Legislature have been able to resolve these dilemmas in their own minds Now it is up to Governor Byrne to decide whether he in good conscience can answer the questions himself
"Church in Spain, Badly Split, Approaches Election Warily",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/22/archives/church-in-spain-badly-split-approaches-election-warily.html,MADRID Feb 21As representative democracy dawns in Spain the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church is urging its bishops and priests to stay out of politics But the church which evolved from being Francos most enthusiastic supporter in the civil war into a shelter for political dissidence in the regimes last years is today a badly splintered mirror of Spanish society itself A number of rightist bishops and priests defend Francos heritage A broad conservative and centrist bloc inclines to various strains of Christian democracy in the Italian mold And on the left independentminded priests are active in Socialist and Communist parties The big problem of the church in Spain is the strong division among Catholics themselves says the Rev Bernandino Hernando editor of the influential Catholic weekly Vida Nueva If you look at the divisions of the political parties it is the same as in the Catholic Church Seems to Be Several Churches So divided is the Spanish church today that it sometimes gives the impression of being several churches linked by the common denominator of Christianity and the sizable subsidies furnished by the Spanish state Presidine over this uneasy mosaic is Vicente Cardinal Enrique y Tarancn the relatively liberal president of the Spanish episcopal conference who led the church through its tumultuous confrontations with the fading Franco regime The style of the whitehaired 69yearold Cardinal has been to avoid doctrinal showdowns and headon confrontations among the churchs many factions Now he seems to be attempting to avoid what some priests here call the blunder of the Italian bishopsthe attempt to use the weight of the church to influence the way Christians vote A key document issued by the episcopal conference this month said We desire that the church in conformity with conciliar doctrine and taking into account our historical experience maintain an independent attitude toward the various political parties Advice to the Clergy The document stated that Christians were free to vote for the party of their choice though it urged them to avoid parties that preach violence or that favor the suppression of human rights The same applies to bishops and the clergy it continued though it suggested that they not assume functions of active militancy or leadership in political parties The episcopal conference is the voice of Spains 80 bishops and auxiliary bishops but some observers of the church wonder whether they will all follow their own orders Here in Spain the church and politics have always been mixed up says Enrique Miret Magdalena an author and Catholic activist Even though Tarancn says the church should get out of politics the bishops are still involved Indeed church and state are linked in Spain as in few places in the world The profession and practice of the Catholic religion which is the religion of the Spanish state shall enjoy official support declares Article 6 of the Statute Law of the Spanish People bequeathed by the late Generalissimo Franco Priests Paid by State Accordingly priests are paid however poorly by the state Church schools are subsidized and religious education is fostered by government bureaucrats The penal code reflects official Roman Catholic views on such matters as abortion and contraception This linkage of church and statestarting with the explosive question of divorceis expected to come under assault when Spains first freely elected parliament in 41 years begins writing a new constitution this summer Already King Juan Carlos anticipating the temper of the times has renounced the right wrested from the Vatican by Franco to name bishops It would be ironic in this situation priests were elected this spring to the new twohouse parliament as they were under the Second Republic from 1931 to 1936 when the civil war broke out turning most of the hierarchy against Spains legal government Two ultraconservative bishops sit in the outgoing Parliament May Work Behind the Scenes It is possible that a handful of priests might be elected to the new parliament But according to a number of informants it is more likely that bishops and clergymen will work behind the scenes for the parties of their choice A bloc of about 10 ultrarightist bishops is expected to favor the neoFrancoist Popular Alliance at the polls An influential group of 17 conservative bishops may swing its weight behind the centrist Popular Party which has many Christian Democrats in its ranks There is some question about the actual influence of the Spanish bishops who in many cases are separated from the aspirations of restless younger priests They live in a world apart and have something of an inferiority complex says the Rev Luis Snchez Torrado a Madrid parish priest who was active at the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council They are like a general staff without troops And if the Spanish bishops are going to be ridiculous like the Italians continues the 44yearold priest who is representative of a rebellious current among the clergy we are not going to follow them ChristianMarxist Dialogue Father Snchez Torrado and other priests are embarked on one of the liveliest dialogues in Spain todaybetween Christianity and Marxism The dialogue which began under the Franco regime witnessed the evolution of a number of militant Christians toward Marxism A number of the small Marxist parties to the left of the Communist Party are peppered with activists who began their political lives under the shelter of the church On the left the Communist Party has been most receptive to practicing Christians Alfonso Carlos Comio a member of the partys central committee is an avowed Christian and more than 40 priests are said to be party members The Communists are known to have sounded out a number of priests as to their availability as independent candidates on the partys electoral lists but so far none are known to have accepted
Carter Asks Congress to Disregard Ford Proposals to Cut Funds for Social Programs,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/23/archives/carter-asks-congress-to-disregard-ford-proposals-to-cut-funds-for.html,WASHINGTON Feb 22  President Carter asked Congress today to disregard most of the Ford Administrations proposals for cuts in the Governments social programs and he requested a modest amount of additional money in some areas Mr Carters expensive campaign promses for national health insurance welfare reform and doubled expenditures for education were not reflected in the budget revisions the new Administration subnitted to Congress That meant that significant spending for such initiatives is not expected before the start of the fiscal year 1979 which begins in October 1978 Symbolically Important Nonetheless the Carter proposals bore the distinct mark of an Administration more intent than its Republican predecessorson playing a direct role in attacking he nations social problems In that regard the Presidents revisions in proposed expenditures for grants to states and communities and for measures to help the unemployed while not surprising were symbolically important The Ford Administration had recommended eliminating dozens of programs under which the Government grants funds to state and local governments for specific projects and folding those programs into overall block grants in the areas of health education social services and child nutrition Mr Carters budget includes money for the categorical grants The Ford Administration had also proposed ending or phasing out the three major jobs programs now in effect on the ground that an improved private economy could take up the employment slack Mr Carter by contrast sought an expansion in those programs as a central part of his Administrations effort to stimulate economic growth Housing is one of the areas where Mr Carters budget envisions an expansion of the Federal effort He asked for a total increase of 25 billion in appropriations in the current fiscal year and the next one for subsidized housing programs The money would be spent over a 15year to 40year period and only 70 million would actually be spent by September 1978 Still according to budget estimates there would be enough money in the current fiscal year under the proposal to increase the number of families receiving rent subsidies from 235800 to 400000 Aid to Distressed Cities The Administration also recommended that 400 million be set aside in the fiscal year that begins next Oct 1 to assist distressed cities Patricia Roberts Harris the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development said the funds would allow the department to assist in a frontal attack on a myriad of social economic and developmental problems in a given city In the health area the budget revisions reflected the Administrations drive to hold down hospital costs and Joseph A Califano Jr the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare announced that legislation was being prepared that would allow the Government to set a ceiling on hocnital charges across the country Mr Califano said the legislation would represent the first step in making national health insurance financially feasible While the precise level of the ceiling is still under study the department calculated that a 9 percent annual limit on increased hospital charges would save the Government 5829 million a year in Medicare and Medicaid payments By using the 9 percent figure the new Administration left the impression that it was willing to allow medical costs to rise somewhat more than President Ford had contemplated Mr Ford wanted to hold Medicare reimbursements to hospitals and doctors at a level 7 percent above their current rates The new Administrations revisions contained no specific recommendation for limiting doctors fees Mr Carter also withdrew the Ford Administrations recommendation for requiring higher monthly Medicare payments for all the elderly to finance protection against catastrophic illnesses The Presidents health budget gave special attention to the needs of poor children it outlined a new program to enable communities to screen and treat underprivileged children and set aside money for immunizing poor children especially in rural areas The budget also included an additional 35 million for what the Department of Health Education and Welfare termed alternatives to abortion The money would be spent for such efforts as family planning services adoption facilities and sex education Welfare Cuts Restored In the areas of Social Security and welfare Mr Carter restored the cuts proposed by his predecessor in a number of programs The President withdrew for instance Mr Fords recommendations for reductions in expenditures for food stamps and child nutrition programs and restored allotments to children who attend college and whose parents receive Social Security benefits Mr Carter also canceled the Ford Administrations plans for raising the Social Security tax rate and for eliminating the earned income tax credit which benefits the working poor The Presidents principal initiatives in the field of education would allow an additional 500 million to be spent for special eduation for disadvantaged children and would increase the amount of Federal scholarships available to college students from poor families Among the other recommendations in the area of social policy were the following An additional 900 million to be spent in the current fiscal year to allow communities to receive their full entitlements under countercyclical revenue sharing a program that helps areas with high unemployment An additional 50 million in the next fiscal year for mass transit and an increase in the amount of overall transit grants available to meet operating costs An expansion of the staff of the civil rights division of the Justice Department but a withdrawal of Mr Fords request for extra money to curtail illegal traffic in firearms Mr Carter also asked for funds to pay the salaries of 600 additional employees to strengthen the regulatory activities of the Environmental Protection Agency

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/25/archives/letters.html,To the Editor The Committee on the Present Danger through the chairman of its executive committee Eugene V Roskm denies that it opposes effective arms limitation but to the contrary insists that it favors hardheaded and verifiable agreements to control and reduce armaments letter Feb 17 The problem is how to reconcile this assertion with the committees stated major premises The committee attributes the Soviet military buildup to a drive for dominance The meaning of the phrase is spelled out The Soviet Union has not altered its longheld goal of a world dominated from a single centerMoscow By way of challenge to this imperial ambition the committee urges higher levels of spending across the board Proceeding from these premises it is difficult to visualize a realistic basis for arms negotiations coincident with an increasing arms buildup on both sides and carrying the bargaining chip approach to ultimate absurdity The committees basic assumptions rather point toward an inexorable and accelerating arms race which must continue until the Soviet economypresumably weaker than oursfaces exhaustion thus compelling the Soviet Union at last to abandon its goal of world domination During this long and ominous confrontation the United States would devote whatever social and economic resources the corninittees program made necessary to meet the competition On the other hand suppose Soviet armament buildup were to some extent at least viewed as a reflection of concern about and response our owna possibility of which the committee taircs ies account If this were added to the balance of judgment a critical issue becomes not higher but more selective spending with a view to continuing reductions and increasing quality of mutual deterrence Along with President Carter one may even envision a substantial elimination of nuclear stockpiles undoubtedly as hardheaded an objective as any the committee is likely to conceive The committee itself risks creating both a present and future danger by recourse to rhetoric and imprecision rather than the objective factual analysis which its literature promises The level of public discourse is a determinant of the level of public spending and the committees distinguished membership no doubt will be equallyconcerned with both ERNEST A GROSS Its Time to Separate Freedom From License To the Editor Belatedly throwing the book at Larry Flynt and his salacious Hustler magazine for the promotion of pornography obscenity and engaging in criminal activity was the best thing to happen to publishing since the invention of the printing press A true libertarian with no wish to impose my oftimes arbitrary and capricious views on others I think its about time we used our discriminatory faculties to separate freedom from license When 10 out of 10 people who dont even know me adjudge that I am too drunk to drive for safetys sake Id best recognize the validity of their decision Conversely when pure unexpurgated filth is pandered to the public under the protection of the First Amendment we should be easily able to discern that the US Constitution has been subverted for ignoble purposes and the American people through an enlightened judiciary should holler Enough already Weve come a long way since that landmark Ulysses decision and have absolutely no desire to take one step backward in restricting mans inherent right to publish However in bending over backward to protect the individuals rights we have a coequal right to protect society from those who would pander to our basest emotions with no selfcensorship whatsoever and bring the quality of life down to the lowest possible common and how common denominator for their own selfaggrandizement A dog rolling over and playing dead is a cute trick millions upon millions of Americans doing the same thing on the issue of pornography is disgusting exhibition STAN LIPTON Rockville Centre L I Feb 17 1977 About the Land Claims Of Maines Indians To the Editor Your Jan 29 editorial Who Owns Maine does not go far enough in citing the justice of the claims that are being made by Indians in Maine Our program work in the state has made it very clear to us that the claims have been presented in a responsible manner and that the tribes have been more than willing to discuss a settlement that would have as little disruptive impact as possible on the other residents of the state Not as much can be said for the highest public officials in the state who have consistently refused to acknowledge either the justice or the legality of the claims It is simply not correct to say as The Times editorial does that the tribal land claims are a vague claim from distant past Furthermore such language makes it all too easy to dismiss any rectification for injustices committed against native Americans The Indians legal actions are not vague nor are they distant In fact the issue before the United States Government is there precisely because it is specific point of a specific lawa law enacted by white men and positively interpreted by white judges In 1975 the Federal District Court in Portland Me upheld the claims of the Maine tribes vat salt f Indian lands since 1790 wcre illegal under provisions of the Indian NonIntercourse Act which called for Federal approval of such sales The moral claims of Maines Indians have always been impressive of course but now they also seem to coincide with the law Oppressed and deprived groups have constantly been told to work within the framework of the laws and the political structure then told to go along if the results go against their claims Those in power should do no less if the results go against themselves The results may be inconvenient and difficult but there can be no justice or any lasting settlement unless there is clear acknowledgement of the basic validity of the claims of Maines Indians En NAKAWATASE Native American Affairs American Friends Service Committee Philadelphia Feb 3 1977 Toying With Canadas Sovereignty To the Editor I read with some apprehension Dennis E Kellys Feb 11 letter To Invest in a Divided Canada He speculates that an investor of size might consider encouraging or even investing in a Quebec moving toward independence thereby leading to a loss of stability in the rest of Canada with one result being that the western provinces in the hope of better exploiting their vast natural resources with American technology and outlets might elect to break away from the confederation and join the US It is not unlikely that others have considered similar possibilities But let me recommend that if Americans seek to invest in Quebec it be for good business reasons rather than for purposes of political intrigue For in the latter course lies a clear potential for disaster It is true that with our ties of language culture and trade the US and Canada have a close community of interests However it should be borne in mind that we each have different histories and distinct traditions and that Canadians like Americans feel strong sense of identity with their homeland Should it come to light that certain interests on this side of the border are surreptitiously toying with Canadas sovereignty for selfish ends I feat our own nation would inherit a legacy of suspicion and hatred on the part ofthe Canadian people that would probably never completely abate The lot of confidence in us internatkr2211y timid be catastrophic Havent we nad enough disasters lately Much has been written and spoken about the deep friendship and exemplary relations that exist between our two countries Durhig this crucial period for our neighbor we have singular opportunity to demonstrate that that friendship is truefirst by minding our own business while Canada wrestles with its problem and second by lending quiet unobtrusive support if and when needed in order to help out a friend In so doingwe will surely be serving our own best interests R P Hordmiss Clifton Park NY Feb 14 1977 The Right to Life Groups Priority To the Editor In your recent editorial Personal Defeat Private Hell you stated that during the Gary Gilmore episode Right to Life people who are so steamed up about abortion being murder said nothing This is not true Right to Life groups here in Connecticut and at the scene of the execution protested the killing Some papers reported that civil liberties groups plus other organizations protested Right to Life groups were among the others but were not named When the Right to Life group was formed in Connecticut we wrote into our constitution that we would only be concerned with the protection of innocent human life as we felt we could not adequately cover both the abortion issue and the capital punishment issue When you realize that over a million are killed in abortion each year but there has been only one execution in the past several years you can see why we chose to put our emphasis on the unborn In the future would you please remember that many of our members not only belong to the Right to Life organization but also to groups that oppose capital punishment Right to Lifers are not hypocrites we just_ feel it is one million times more important to concentrate on abortion at this time PAUL BAUCH MD Member Board of

Editor As one of the many people who watched the TV program Roots and who sympathize with Alex Haleys need to know where he sprang from and what was his heritage I would like to speak out for another group of people who might be described as rootless those of us who are adopted Mr Haley tells of going to the National Archives and finding a name on microfilm It turned out to be his Aunt Liz This success apparently triggered his search Several years ago I went to the Hall of Records and found my way to the office that keeps the adoption files I was quite sternly told by the person in charge that I would never be allowed to see th records of my aInotion I understand the nbed for secrecy when an infant is adopted For example the real parents might change their minds and great confusion and unhappiness could result The rules are made to protect everyone from everyone else The same rules apply to every case no matter what the circumstances And hardest of all the rules are never changed no matter how much time goes by Mr Haleys book and the television_ show have dramatized a need thit think most people have to identify with someone who can give them a sense of continuity and of belonging Those of us who were adopted and who would like to know who our real parents were are being told that we will just have to ignore this need For us to find our roots is not important to them

Constitutional Protection for the Unborn,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/26/archives/constitutional-protection-for-the-unborn.html,CINCINNATIFour years ago the United States Supreme Court shocked some Americans and pleased others by approving abortion in a wide variety of circumstances with few significant restrictions The decisions which have since been broadened by further judicial rulings are controversial Out of the controversy has emerged a growing movement to amend the Constitution and restore legal protection to the unborn All would agree that the Constitution should not be amended lightly Those of us who favor an amendment to protect the unborn are obliged to examine our premises carefully and respond candidly to serious objections when they are raised Sometimes It Is said that the Supreme Court acted responsibly by allowing abortions freely in the first six months of pregnancy but permitting reasonable restrictions in the last trimester This is defended as a fair compromise in a society where very diverse views on abortion are widely held In fact the alleged compromise is a fiction Courts are assigning increasingly less importance even to viability Yet this was already clear in the Supreme Courts 1973 opinion which made ample provision for abortion up to the very time of birth Such minimal restrictions on abortion in the third trimester as were stipulated by the Court are meant to protect the wellbeing of the mother not the child But the fundamental reason for saying that the compromise is no compromise at all is that human life develops along a continuum From conception on there is a genetically unique being which given favorable circumstances will develop steadily through all the stages of pre and postnatal maturing There is no logical reason to hold that this life is inviolable after a certain point in the maturing process but can be destroyed more or less freely before that point For the unborn to enjoy protection under the law remedial action is required Since the judicial trend is in the other direction the remedy must be one which establishes new parameters for the courts in other words a constitutional amendment We who support an amendment are sometimes accused of asking the law to do what we cannot do ourselves If we cannot convince people by moral suasion to refrain from abortion isnt it presumptuous of us to ask the law to forbid people to have abortions And why imagine that coercion will work if people are not convinced that abortion is wrong The objection points to a real problem but it is one which pertains to much besides abortion Moral argument alone has never been able to prevent much wrongdoing Underlying all forms of legal constraint is the reality that law though imperfect is needed to protect values which are basic to society and to forbid behavior which grossly violates such values So if abortion does violate a fundamental value important to society it is appropriate that it be proscribed by law just as it is appropriate for law to proscribe other kinds of wrongdoing Further the law itself is a nii0 educator one of many agents in society which teach people to distinguish right from wrong To say that those who oppose abortion are free to teach that it is wrong but ought to keep hands off the law begs the question of what the law is teaching on the subject The law now teaches that abortion is morally permissible Those who disagree desire to change the law in order in part to change its moral teaching An amendment to the Constitution will reduce the number of abortions in two ways The existence of legal penalties will deter some abortions and the educative impact of the law will teach that abortions ought not to be sought or performed A realistic estimate of the number of abortions in the United States the mid1960s  before widespread legal liberalization and the Supreme Court decisions but after some years of proabortion agitationwould put the total at perhaps 100000 annually and no more than several hundred thousand Now there are more than a million What the law has helped bring about it can help to undo A constitutional amendment to protect the unborn is needed and would be efficacious Clearly the perception of both its necessity and its effectiveness depends upon the perception that abortion is wrong in one way or in many That prior perception depends finally upon the value one assigns to human life For many of us there is something ironic in talk about the quality of life when the violation of life itself is sanctioned in the practice of legalized abortion This is why a constitutional amendment to protect human life before birth is so desperately needed today
Antiabortion Bill Stirs New Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/27/archives/antiabortion-bill-stirs-new-debate-antiabortion-bill-stirs-new.html,THE New Jersey Legislature has focused new attention on the abortion issue with a bill asking Congress to call a nationwide convention to consider an antiabortion amendment to the Federal Constitution that would prohibit abortions from the moment of conception Opposed until now mostly by womens groups that do not want abortions outlawed the move is beginning to attract the attention of organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union These organizations fear the consequences of a runaway convention that might try to rewrite other sections of the Federal Constitution including the guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press In the past opinion surveys have shown that sizable percentages of the American public do not completely agree with these constitutional guarantees But antiabortionists say that fears that such a convention might hurt the Constitution are groundless They quote former Senator Sam J Ervin Jr Democrat of North Carolina as saying that Congress could limit the scope of such conventions by law No one knows though because the Federal Constitution has never been amended through the convention route In 1908 a drive was organized to call such a convention to amend the Constitution to require Senators to be elected by the people instead of by state legislatures Congress proposed such an amendment before enough state legislatures passed bills asking for the convention In 1955 a number of state legislatures made an attempt to get such a convention to strike down the United States Supreme Courts oneman onevote ruling which required state legislatures to be districted by population This move fizzled out before enough states demanded a convention Efforts to call constitutional conventions are made under Article 5 of the Constitution which reads The Congress whenever twothirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary shall propose amendments to this Constitution or on the application of the legislatures of twothirds of the several states shall call a convention for proposing amendments which in either case shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of this Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of threefourths of the several states or by conventions in threefourths thereof as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress provided that no amendment which made be made prior to the year 1808 shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article and that no state without its consent shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate  Clauses I and 4 of Section 9 of Article I deal with the importation of persons probably slaves and with poll taxes In 1971 after the scare over the one man onevote proposal Senator Ervin introduced a bill in Congress to set up ground rules for such a convention The bill passed the Senate but never came to a vote in the House of Representatives It attempted to provide security against a runaway convention by requiring delegates to sign oaths that they would not take up any matters but those contained in the Congressional resolution calling the convention The Ervin bill also made the following suggestions 41That delegates be elected from Congressional Districts with two delegates elected at large in each state SI That such conventions finish their work within one year unless Congress grants an extension of time flThat the convention must convene within one year of passage of the Congressional resolution calling for it That applications from individual stAtes for such a convention be valid for only seven years In its msuccessful attempt to persuade the New Jersey Legislature not to adopt the antiabortion convention idea the New Jersey chapter of the ACLU called the idea illconceived and imprudent We believe the decision whether or not to abort [a pregnancy] whether made on medical moral or religious grounds is essentially a private decision the ACLU said The Constitution has traditionally guaranteed this privacy and freedom for people of different beliefsreligious political or otherwise The ACLU is not alone in its posi tion Survey after survey taken in New Jersey as well as nationally has shown that a majority of the people interviewed opposed a constitutional amendment to prohibit abortions But the reality of public opinion is ignored by New Jersey legislators as they listen to a small but vocal group the Right to Life Committee The ACLU said that the Legislature is embarking on an uncharted course in passing this bill In the 200year history of the United States the Constitution has never been amended by a constitutional convention The method is untried unclear and it will require legislative and probably judicial resolution of numerous controversial constitutional questions before it can be implemented Questions raised by the ACLU included Does Congress have the constitutional authority to limit the subject matter of a constitutional convention to one subject In addition to posing questions such as those raised by the Ervin bill the ACLU also asked if one Congress could bind a succeeding one upon such fundamental questions of constitutional law and policy This apparently was a suggestion that the Congress meeting after a constitutional convention had been called could relieve delegates of any pledge limiting them to discuss only abortions The organization behind the national drive for the convention Americans for a Constitutional Convention a New Yorkbased group said the drive got under way when Congress refused to face the issue of abortion Many of these very same Americans who are deeply troubled by the spread of abortion on demand since the Supreme Courts 1973 proabortion decisions are beginning to realize that perhaps their best recourse to restore the right of the unborn is to seek a constitutional convention says a pamphlet distributed by the ACC In a report acompanying the Ervin bill the committee that approved it Said that holding a wideopen convention would be neither practical nor desirable and might even be inconsistent with Article 5 of the Federal Constitution Although the New Jersey legislative action was in the form of a bill Attorney General William F Hyland has ruled that it would be inappropriate for the Governor to sign it since it Is strictly a legislative matter under Article 5
Pope's U.S. Delegate Takes Powerful Role,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/27/archives/popes-us-delegate-takes-powerful-role.html,Archbishop Jean Jadot who was appointed Papal Delegate to the Roman Catholic Church in the United States four years ago is being credited by many churchmen today with dramatically transforming his role from a largely ceremonial function to one of power and influence Since Pope Paul VI appointed the Belgian Archbishop as the ninth Apostolic Delegate to this country he has made a deep mark in such areas as the selection of progressive bishops the drive to increase the chprchs emphasis on social justice and the trend toward more pastoral approach to moral issues As the Popes representative the Archbishop was expected to be the Vaticans eyes and ears acting as the official funnel of information between the American church and Rome He also inherited the traditional responsibility of forwarding nominations for hierarchical posts to the Vatican But Archbishop Jabot according to some who have watched his performance closely has taken a more active part in these matters than his predecessors steering a difficult course between the role of policy shaper and the pitfall of exceeding his mandate by appearing too meddlesome Colleagues portray the lean balding prelate the first nonItalian to hold the post as sagacious modest candid attentive and impish Since taking up residence at the delegation center an elegant threestory building on Washingtons Embassy Row he has built up a large stock of personal authority and increasingly has exercised it in sensitive areas of church affairs The Jadot Faction During his tenure Archbishop Jadot has overseen the appointment or transfer of 50 bishops almost onesixth or the total in the nation In some church circles these bishops are referred to as the Jadot faction Many people are saying that since Ive come the kind of priest who becomes a bishop has changed he said in an interview But I dont agree entirely It had started before me Nevertheless the bishops named in the last several years are generally younger more liberal and parishoriented and less magisterial than those selected in the past With those who already leaned toward this new style the progressives became a major factor in shaping church policy at a time when the church was moving through a period of change Archbishop Jadots critics believe he puts too much emphasis on social action and too little on church doctrine He emphasizes the significance of the churchs instruction for guidance but says You must take the Gospel and the teachings and then look at the situation here in a parish or country as is Without endorsing variations from tradition the Archbishop clearly sympathizes with those who are willing to risk unorthodoxy in reaching out to nonchurchgoers In the controversy over rites of general confession and absolution offered by Bishop Carroll Dozier of Memphis late last year for example Archbishop Jadot remained officially impartial but made no effort to stop the rites which were frowned on by the Vatican Criticized for Activism These attitudes and his emphasis on social action have evoked criticism from a relatively small number of Catholics Al Matt the editor of The Wanderer a conservative Catholic journal published in St Paul Minn believes the Archbishop is listening to the wrong people is too permissive about doctrine and represents the sort of activism I have been very wary of Though Archbishop Jadot prefers to work behind the scenes and downplays his importance he has been outspoken when he feels strongly about an issue choosing his forum carefully For example when he gave the opening address to the semiannual meeting of American bishops last November Archbishop Jadot used the occasion to voice distress at inequitable treatment of racial and ethnic minorities After lauding those who are working for social justice he added Sometimes I wonder if the majority of our priests and people realize our shortcomings in these areas and even our arrogance toward our brothers and sisters who are in some ways different from ourselves It was a typical Jadot speech pithy independent full of challenge somewhat unpredictable If hes got a conviction says Bishop James S Rausch outgoing general secretary of the Bishops Conference hell express it Though he has scrupulously refrained from involvement in specific causes and politics in the American church the Archbishop is known to criticize bishops actions in private It was his displeasure with the way the top leadership of the hierarchy re sponded to the two major Presidential candidates during the campaign chiefly on the issue of abortion that resulted in the leaders later declaring that they were politically neutral Likewise he made known his unhappiness with some of the initial negative reactions to the milestone Call to Action conference in Detroit in October The 1350 lay and clerical delegates from 150 dioceses proposed number of controversial proposals including the ordination of women Without signaling support of any particular proposal the prelate has praised the consultative process that produced the recommendatiens and has suggested that the bishops should weigh them carefully The same sensitivity to those who dissent on doctrinal questions has been directed toward questions of morality During consideration of a statement on morality at the November meeting of bishops those who favor the Archbishops pastoral style of personal concern as opposed to those who advocate strict interpretation of the rules spoke against the document on grounds that lacked sufficient sensitivity to Catholics who painfully disagreed with the churchs moral teachings While the Archbishop was not overtly involved the fight was led by some of the bishops whose appointments he has facilitated As a result about a quarter of the bishops voted against the statement in a highly unusual public display of dissent In helping to select and transfer bishops the Apostolic Delegate sends the name of three candidates to Rome The choice of one of them is virtually assured Transfers Significant Often transfers are considered more significant than appointments For example the former prelate in Phoenix Bishop Edward A McCarthy was sent to the Archdiocese of Miami where the large Cuban Catholic community had complained bitterly that their needs were not being met Bishop McCarthy officials say is held in high esteem by Spanishspeaking Catholics in Arizona and his appointment was immediately hailed by their counterparts in Miami The Archbishop moves about the country without fanfare turning up at assorted church meetings or dropping in on dioceses for days at a time to offer himself as a listening post to clergy and laity He has come to know the country in depth more quickly than I ever expected says Bishop William Borders who was transferred to Baltimore from Orlando Fla He reflects the local church more accurately than his predecessors Msgr John Eagan of the University of Notre Dame says The Pope wanted to know the truth about the United States and felt he wasnt getting it tie is now The Archbishop has visited 48 of the 50 states setting a pace that astounds many of his colleagues One recent weeks schedule for example included trips to Minneapolis to install a new bishop and to Alaska to install the first Eskimo deacon Archbishop Jadots appointment to the United States followed two decades of international service including 15 years in Africa The New York TimesGeorge Tames Archbishop Jean Jadot Apostolic Delegate to the United States at the delegation center in Washington

Bernardin Finds Gain in Esteem for Catholics of U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/03/archives/bernardin-finds-gain-in-esteem-for-catholics-of-us.html,Despite recent troubles the Roman Catholic Church in the United States basically sound and gaining esteem throughout the Catholic world according to the head of the American hierarchy Archbishop Joseph L Bernardin The 48yearold Archbishop whose threeyear term as president of the Conference of Bishops ends next fall reflected on the state of the church in an interview last week in his chancery office in Cincinnati Acknowledging the controversies that have rumbled through the church during his tenure Archbishop Bernardin said he was hopeful because these rumblings indicate that the church is alive It doesnt mean we agree about what has happened but the church is the center of change and that is a sign of vitality he said Among other issues that have produced tensions are abortion the role of the bishops in the recent Presidential campaigns the Call to Action proposals for change and womens ordination Following meetings last summer between leaders of the hierarchy and the tWn major Presidential contenders Archbishop Bernardin drew criticism from many Catholics when he used the term disappointed in reference to Jimmy Carters stand on abortion and the word encouraged with respect to Gerald R Fords view A storm arose among those in the church who believed that the Archbishop had given a tacit political endorsement and had reduced the issues too narrowly to that of abortion The explosive Call to Action conference in Detroit last Octboer composed of clergy and ality from 150 dioceses produced another debate by issuing a package of 186 recommendations for the bishops to consider including suggestions to ordain women and married men The white packet covered matters of social justice human rights personal morality and church doctrine Additional conflict has resulted from last months Vatican statement barring women as priests The Archbishop defended his behavior following the meetings with the Presidential candidates asserting that the press had misrepresented him by implying that he was dwelling solely on abortion and making partisan choices I constantly insisted that we werent endorsing candidates he said And made a point of making sure I had discussed far more than abortion but thats what the media picked up On the subject of womens ordination the Archbishop conceded that he had advised the Vatican to release the statement I dont deny that I was in consultation he said Because of the developing ferment in the church especially in America I thought it better to restate the churchs position now rather than later Stating that he fully accepts the statements conclusions he added At the same time some of the theological under pinnings of the declaration need to be explored more But not with a view toward changing the conclusions Many women are in disagreement he said But we can work with them While the 1968 ban on artificial contraception directly affected large numbers of American Catholics Archbishop Bernardin said the cause for allowing the women priests is not a burning issue for most people Far more crucial he said is the widespread disaffection from the church in recent years Citing a recently released study of Catholics in the East Side of New York which concluded that loss of faith in the supernatural was the main cause of the decline the Archbishop urged the church to take its teaching mission more seriously He said that some parishes were too large to feel you belong to them and stressed that parish revitalization had replaced social action as the byword in many dioceses Needs of People Stressed Referring to the role of bishop in church with growing lay influence Archbishop Bernardin said that sensitivity to the needs and aspirations of people and openness to dialogue were now prime qualities Conflicts over authority have flared in many disputes since the Second Vatican Council An emerging style of leadership that is attentive to the laity and willing to use the new consultative mechanisms have helped ease the crisis he said Ideologically there is no great difficulty trying to understand authority as applies to the church he said Here in the archdiocese for example people understand that ultimate authority rests with me But they also know they have a right to have a part in the decisions The difficulty of implementing the Vatican II consultative process has continued to produce clashes he said but many of them have been constructive Though he disagrees with many proposals that came from the Call to Action meeting the first national consultation in the American churchs history Archbishop Bernardin believes that similar meetings will take place in the future perhaps with greater restrictions The bishops will consider the proposals for the first time publicly at their semiannual meeting in May in Chicago Associated Press Archbishop Joseph L Bernardin
Uganda Refugees Bring Out More Evidence of Atrocities,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/04/archives/uganda-refugees-bring-out-more-evidence-of-atrocities.html,NAIROBI Kenya March 3Penniless Uganda refugees continue to arrive here carrying not much more than their recollection of atrocities stories similar in horror to the ones that have been sifting out of Uganda for six years This morning for instance a young man who arrived here three days ago told how he found his fathers mutilated body and left his job in a government ministry to flee The young man was well spoken and well educated like most the refugees who have come to the United Nations High Commission offices here registering for asylum Such accounts have not been unusual since President di Amin took power in 1971 Similar evidence has been affirmed by the International Commission of Jurists which on the basis of evidence presented to it by refugees concluded in 1973 that 25000 to 250000 people had been killed in Uganda Former Uganda ministers and diplomats now in exile have also spoken about waves of systematic repression with thousands of victims The very vagueness of the death estimates has tended to erode their credibility In a world of computer exactitude it is hard to realize that in the center of Africa great masses of people can he slaughtered without documentation of television without lists of victims compiled by the Red Cross and without sustained outcry from a horrified world Uganda however is remote a land of lush growth and lakes There are crocodiles who are said to grow fat on the evidence of slaughter The young man who told about how he had fled recalled that on Feb 18 he returned from work to he informed by his young sisters that their father scientist had been arrested by men in plainclothes who took him away in a car with the license plates UVS 211 According to the son his father a man in his 50s had served time in prison during the presidency of Milton Obote the man Mr Amin deposed The father had been politically active then a leader in a Catholic opposition party The family is neither of the Acholi nor Longo tribes which have reportedly been principal targets of President Amins wrath and there was no hint that it had fallen under suspicion said the young man During the next few days the refugee said he and his brothers made discreet inquiries about the fathers whereabouts without success Then three days after the disappearance a taxi driver told them of the discovery of a body 18 miles out of Kampala They found the dead man and identified him as their father He had three bullet holes in his head his eyes had been gouged out his teeth had been knocked out and he had been knifed in the stomach said the son The next day after hearing that he too was being sought the young man set off for the border The extent of the killings was described earlier by Ali Sanji who until he left Uganda three years ago was the highestranking civil servant of Asian origin He had worked in the public service unit one of three security agencies charged with torturing and murdering Ugandans From Vancouver British Columbia where he is now a salesman Mr Sanji said he had signed death warrants for thousands of Ugandans He said he had done so because I was afraid for my life There were also the comments of Emmanuel Wakjweya a finance minister who fled to London in 1975 He declared that the Ugandan Government is a oneman show adding I have naturally been worried about the lack of value on human life which is a horrifying aspect of the situation Wanume Kibedi a former minister of foreign affairs who fled was both more specific and bolder in the allegations he made in a 13page open letter to Mr Amin in 1974 After saying that in Uganda disappearance had become a euphemism for death he wrote I want to confirm here and now that indeed you are personally responsible for the liquidation of all the people who have disappeared in Uganda since you came to power You have in effect placed thugs completely above the law since they know that they can kill maim and loot with impunity In the letter he listed government officials who had been killed The arrests of some of these he said were reported to him by Mr Amin himself There was Benedicto Kiwanuka the chief justice of Uganda who was reportedly killed in 1972 his skull crushed in Makindye Prison There was a man named Kalimuzo vice chancellor of Makerere University and James Bwogi of the Ministry of Education Both said Mr Kibedi were abducted by agents of the state research bureau another security force and were never seen again Mr Kibedis uncle Shaban Nkutu was taken from his home at Jinja and his body was found in the Nile In addition to people of prominence the letter lists victims of no particular eminence who were all abducted in view of witnesses and were never seen again He said close acquaintances who had vanished included Henry Kasigwa the town treasurer of Jinja municipal council Lume Kisadha the personnel manager of a textile plant and Kagupire Kasadha an engineer Mr Kibedi wrote that Mr Kasadha the engineer had been arrested at work and put in the trunk of a car He said word of the arrest had been brought to him at the Foreign Ministry within 15 minutes and that he had taken up the case with President Amin vouching for the engineers loyalty Mr Kibedi then described efforts he made to find his friendbut to no avail He added After a few weeks I learned he had been killed The description of the arrest tallies with he report of the International Commission of Jurists in which one witness was luoted as having said The technique is to drive tip to a house or office of he victim He is arrested and his shoes ire removed and remain on the street is a pathetic reminder He is thrown into he boot of a car and he is driven off lever to be seen again According to refugees arriving here nost of the victims are humble peopleillagers soldiers or workers But it has been easier to document the disappearnce and murder of men of position There was for example the case of Lieut col Michael Ondanga also a foreign ninister On Feb 19 1974 he was dississed from his post and vanished A week later his body was found in the Nile Mr Amin ordered an investigation It concluded that the colonel had been killed by gangsters who the Government says sometimes impersonate policemen Also cited was the case of Dr George Ebine the countrys only gynecologist According to accounts of witnesses soldiers dragged him from the operating theater at Mulago Hospital and killed him on the street His patient died According to some informants this killing was related to the death in 1974 of Mama Kay one of President Amins first four wives Her dismembered body was found in the back of a car in 1974 According to the informants she was pregnant at the time of her divorce and had obtained an abortion rather than give birth to a child out of wedlock Her decision reportedly infuriated Mr Amin This list goes on Joseph Mubiru governor of the Bank of Uganda who disappeared in 1971 Bishop Festo Kivensere a Protestant whose dismembered body was found in 1972 George Kamba former ambassador to West Germany who vanished Andrew Adimoulu permanent secretary of the Ministry of Education who also disappeared Among the victims many are said to be army officers such as Gen Hassan Malara who was killed in 1973 along with his wife and five children In 1973 a Roman Catholic priest Clement Kigundu disappeared He had been the editor of a Catholic magazine that criticized Mr Amins rule A few days later his body was found in a car The Government announced that he had died in car crash The same explanation has been given in several suspicious deaths most recently in the case of the Anglican ArchDishop Janani Luwum who died Feb 16 after being arrested with two government ministers on charges of complicity in a lot to overthrow Mr Amin The official explanation drew international expres5ions of disbelief A number of foreigners have also iisappeared There was Dora Bloch a assenger on the hijacked Air France lane who was in a Kampala hospital Arhen Israeli raiders rescued her fellow hostages Several Kenyan businessmen and a student have vanished without a trace And in 1973 Nicholas Stroh 33yearold American freelance journalist and Robert Seiddle a 46yearold American lecturer at Makerere University were killed at Makindye Prison The list is by no means comprehensive Refugees here suggest that there are few hundred victims of prominc  But they insist that there are many times that number of humble and anonymous people who have perished either because of their tribe or their religion or because they had differences with one of Mr Amins underlings David Martin a British journalist and author of a critical biography of Mr Amin who was perhaps the first to document the charges believes that Mr Amin has built an expanding cycle of repression to hide his insecurity He kills real or imagined adversaries then kills those who can expose him Others have talked of his reported mystical visions and have said they believe he is intent upon extending Islam into Christian Uganda and establishing the paramount position of his own small Kakwa people Finally there are observers who think his actions are rooted in Ugandas bloody history

aspect of the situation Wanume Kibedi a former minister of foreign affairs who fled was both more specific and bolder in the allegations he made in a 13page open letter to Mr Amin in 1974 After saying that in Uganda disappearance had become a euphemism for death he wrote I want to confirm here and now that indeed you are personally responsible for the liquidation of all the people who have disappeared in Uganda since you came to power You have in effect placed thugs completely above the law since they know that they can kill maim and loot with impunity In the letter he listed government offidials who had been killed The arrests of some of these he said were reported to him by Mr Amin himself There was Benedicto Kiwanuka the chief justice of Uganda who was reportedly killed in 1972 his skull crushed in Makindye Prison There was a man named Kalimuzo vice chancellor of Makerere University and James Bwogi of the Ministry of Education Both said Mr Kibedi were abducted by agents of the state research bureau another security force and were never seen again Mr Kibedis uncle Shaban Nkutu was taken from his home at Jinja and his body was found in the Nile Witnesses See Abductions In addition to people of prominence the letter lists victims of no particular eminence who were all abducted in view of witnesses and were never seen again He said close acquaintances who had vanished included Henry Kasigwa the town treasurer of Jinja municipal council Lume Kisadha the personnel manager of a textile plant and Kagupire Kasadha an engineer Mr Kibedi wrote that Mr Kasadha the engineer had been arrested at work and put in the trunk of a car He said word of the arrest had been brought to him at the Foreign Ministry within 15 minutes and that he had taken up the case with President Amin vouching for the engineers loyalty Mr Kibedi then described efforts he made to find his friend but to no avail He added After a few weeks I learned he had been killed The description of the arrest tallies with he report of the International Commission of Jurists in which one witness was luoted as having said The technique is to drive tip to a house or office of he victim He is arrested and his shoes ire removed and remain on the street is a pathetic reminder He is thrown into he boot of a car and he is driven off lever to be seen again According to refugees arriving here nost of the victims are humble peopleillagers soldiers or workers But it has been easier to document the disappearnce and murder of men of position There was for example the case of Lieut  Michael Ondanga also a foreign ninister On Feb 19 1974 he was dississed from his post and vanished A week later his body was found in the Nile Mr Amin ordered an investigation It concluded that the colonel had been killed by gangsters who the Government says sometimes impersonate policemen Also cited was the case of Dr George Ebine the countrys only gynecologist According to accounts of witnesses soldiers dragged him from the operating theater at Mulago Hospital and killed him on the street His patient died According to some informants this killing was related to the death in 1974 of Mama Kay one of President Amins first four wives Her dismembered body was found in the back of a car in 1974 According to the informants she was pregnant at the time of her divorce and had obtained an abortion rather than give birth to a child out of wedlock Her decision reportedly infuriated Mr Amin Others Who Disappeared This list goes on Joseph Mubiru governor of the Bank of Uganda who disappeared in 1971 Bishop Festo Kivensere a Protestant whose dismembered body was found in 1972 George Kamba former ambassador to West Germany who vanished Andrew Adimoulu permanent secretary of the Ministry of Education who also disappeared Among the victims many are said to be army officers such as Gen Hassan Malara who was killed in 1973 along with his wife and five children In 1973 a Roman Catholic priest Clement Kigundu disappeared He had been the editor of a Catholic magazine that criticized Mr Amins rule A few days later his body was found in a car The Government announced that he had died in car crash The same explanation has been given in several suspicious deaths most recently in the case of the Anglican ArchDishop Janani Luwum who died Feb 16 after being arrested with two government ministers on charges of complicity in a lot to overthrow Mr Amin The official explanation drew international expresions of disbelief A number of foreigners have also disappeared There was Dora Bloch a bassenger on the hijacked Air France plane who was in a Kampala hospital Arhen Israeli raiders rescued her fellow hostages Several Kenyan businessmen and a student have vanished without trace And in 1973 Nicholas Stroh 33yearold American freelance journalist and Robert Seiddle a 46yearold American lecturer at Makerere University were killed at Makindye Prison The list is by no means comprehensive Refugees here suggest that there are a few hundred victims of prominc see But they insist that there are many times that number of humble and anonymous people I who have perished either because of their tribe or their religion or because they had differences with one of Mr Amins underlings David Martin a British journalist and author of a critical biography of Mr Amin who was perhaps the first to document the charges believes that Mr Amin has built an expanding cycle of repression to hide his insecurity He kills real or imagined adversaries then kills those who can expose him Others have talked of his reported mystical visions and have said they believe he is intent upon extending Islam into Christian Uganda and establishing the paramount position of his own small Kakwa people Finally there are observers who think his actions are rooted in Ugandas bloody history

Ending Aid To Unborn,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/06/archives/long-island-weekly-ending-aid-to-unborn-can-the-county-end-aid-for.html,THE county has decided to sue the State Commissioner of Social Services Philip L Toia in an effort to force termination of what Westchester officials regard as a costly unnecessary and illegal program aid to the unborn Although a Federal court has ruled that the grants averaging 50 a month violate Congressional intent and hence are void 19 states including New York continue to spend millions of dollars a year for the optional program County Executive Alfred B DelBello who will ask the Board of Legislators tomorrow for permission to sue the state said the grants were intended not for the mother but for the unborn child and there is no justification for it The County Commissioner of Social Services Charles W Bates said that if an expectant mother has needs they should be metand they are being metin programs established for those purposes We provide milk special foods nutritional needs clothing housing If the grants are not enough they should be raised not given through an unborn child Westchesters action could have wideranging implications in social political and financial areas A member of the Womens Task Force an advisory group said after a meeting with county officials last week that there appeared to be ironies The county is legally hound to issue the grant to the recipient but that is impossible of course so the mother gets the money one of the women said But for what purpose All her needs apparently are being met if she is eligible The program would appear to support the view that a fetus is a person thus backing righttolife arguments Officials have raised the question of abortionsis the money to be used for that purpose and if so should the county seek a refund What about twins Mr Bates asked Theoretically we should be obliged to grant a second sum retroactively in the case of twins le said that beyond the dilemmas posed by these ironies was the confusion you create by stretching programs and thats what this isa stretched program There are also large sums involved Westchester is obliged to pay 100000 of the 400000 granted each year to an estimated 500 Westchester County recipients but the figure for the state is between 5 million and 10 million Mr Bates said Mr Bates wrote to his counterpart in Albany last month to suggest termination of the program especially in view of the fact he said that a court of appeals ruled in 1974 that it went beyond Congressional intent underlying the Social Security Act The Federal program is optional but when the state opts in as Mr DelBello put it the county is obliged to pay its share25 percentof the total cost The state pays another 25 percent and Washington 50 percent Mr DelBello said the program was initiated in Wisconsin in 1941 before many of todays social services aiding pregnant women  including Medicaid were developed He said Whenever we ask Federal officials to justify it they say its for medical needs or nutritional needs or some other need When we point out that these needs are met by existing programs they flip to another area Its Mr DelBello said it was typical of the kind of thing we have come to expect as the welfare program developed in this state over the years Westchester devotes 58 percent of its annual budget to social services or 234 million of about 400 million The county he said had been examining its welfare costs and discovered several areas of abuse only to be thwarted in each case in seeking relief Mr DelBello indicated that he was a bit concerned about public reaction to his efforts to eliminate the program although in the long term it is likely to be politically beneficial Though Mr DelBello may incur the wrath of righttolife advocates as well as those who would respond to any attempt to cut socialservice programs his effort at welfare reform would likely get support among the majority of the countys taxpayers Mr DelBello sought to test reaction in his meeting with the Womens Task Force Gerald Harris the county attorney said later that they agreed it seemed wasteful and illogical Mr Harris explained later that when the fetus is four months old we treat it under the program as an additional child in the household Its the equivalent of giving the same amount to a fetus as to a 10monthold child From what we know however the grant serves no useful purpose other than as extra income for the mother whose needs are met totally through medical assistance nutritional allowances hospital care and other support services to the extent the recipient is eligible he said Mr Bates in writing to Mr Toia said he was responding to your recent expressions of interest in improving methods for cost control by drawing attention to the apparent illegality of the New York State aidtotheunborn program The assistance Mr Bates said was established on the basis of a Federal optional program created by the Department of Health Education and Welfare which in 1974 he noted was seen by the Court of Appeals to be void If the Federal regulatory underpinning is illegal Mr Bates said it follows that the state regulations promulgated on the basis of that regulation are similarly illegal and should no longer be enforced The county he said has been litigating the question in State Supreme Court in White Plains for the last year but has now decided that more effective action could be brought in a suit against you as State Commissioner Under these circumstances he wrote it is my profound hope that you will deem the optional aidtotheunborn program as an appropriate one for termination Mr DelBello said that any action would likely be pursued in State Supreme Court in Albany

LETTER FROM MERCY COLLEGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/06/archives/long-island-weekly-letter-from-mercy-college-students-ideas-and.html,The students at Mercy College care about ideas That becomes evident not only from the personal involvement with issues we feel but also from the articles have received from them during my editorship this year of the campus newspaper Careers our education and the political system concern us So does the extent of public knowledge about birth control and the maintenance of the laws on abortion In a poll on birth control taken last November among students from 18 to 25 years old only 49 percent of them either were aware of or used the range of birth control methods The other 51 percent maintained that they were either unaware of or afraid of birthcontrol methods The minority was shocked both because of their fellow students lack of knowledge and because it was clear that many students were relying on abortion as a way out A lengthy article was published in the college paper along with addresses and phone numbers of birthcontrol centers in Westchester As for abortion it was soon discovered in the wake of discussion on birth control that students wanted to remain available but for what purposes it wasnt clear Students expressed an interest in having courses dealing with birth controlsomething I feel the administration would never agree to The administration has indicated that we should be informed on these subjects but does not seem to wish to aid in informing us Mercy College originally a Roman Catholic institution still has some cobwebs to dust away on moral issues Many students hope they do it before the percentages of birthcontrol users drops even lower Last Novembers Presidential election was of great concern to the students
TV VIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/06/archives/tv-view-atlast-scenes-from-a-marriage-as-bergman-concieved-it-tv.html,Before going into selfimposed exile from his native Sweden last year following a humiliat ing dispute with government officials over taxes Ingmar Bergman confided to an interviewer I live on a small island Faroe in the Baltic Sea with mostly farmers and fishermen For the first time they really liked something had done They discussed it with me on the ferryboat the island    Nothing I have done means anything until two other people start talking about it on the basis their experience That something was a series of six 50minute episodes called Scenes From a Marriage Surprisingly the project was created and produced for television a fact that continues to confound those who insist on underestimating both the solid achievements and the potential of the medium Here was one of the worlds foremost filmmakers turning intentionally to television and fashioning a work of immense popularity and stunning artistic achievement    This week following at least three years of negotiation tactical postponements and special preparations the original sixpart series is being brought to American public TV as a presentation of New Yorks WNET13 A scathing deduction of some sort can be drawn from the fact that public TVs established practice of corporate underwriting was unable to attract even a single company to invest this project Serious purpose and accomplishment it seems might be controversial Corporations arc generally more comfortable with the blander stuff of entertainments In any case with support from member stations the Public Broadcasting Service WNET will begin its weekly presentation of Scenes From a Marriage this Wednesday at 10 PM The Wednesday episodes have been dubbed into English the Swedishlanguage versions with English subtitles can be seen Saturdays at 9 PM also beginning this week As filler the new full hours open with introductions by Liv Ullmann and close with excerpts from a Jorn Donner interview with Ingmar Bergman in Sweden in addition following the Wednesday showings of Episodes Five and Six Channel 13 will carry a live WNET ReportsThe Marriage Scene during which viewers will be invited to speak via telephone with experts in psychology marriage and family counseling and related fields When first shown on Swedish television in 1973 Scenes From a Marriage was spectacularly successful Presented in the prime time of early evening the episodes which were telecast on successive Wednesday evenings became the focus of intense national interest Friends returning from Sweden at the time spoke of an incredible public preoccupation with the series It was an unavoidable topic of conversation at cocktail parties Marriage counselors were bombarded with questions Bergman himself was getting so many telephone calls about marital problems that he was forced to change his number Subsequently new liberalized divorce laws were passed in the Swedish Parliament A condensed version of the series was released at a feature film and in the United States the critical reactions were enthusiastic The National Society of Film Critics gave Scenes From a Marriage awards for the Best Film Best Actress Liv Ullmann Best Screenplay Ingmar Bergman and Best Supporting Actress Bibi Andersson The Best Actress and Best Screenplay recognitions were duplicated in the New York Film Critics awards Revealingly Hollywood whether out of fear or loathing maintained its snobbery about television and refused Miss Ullmann a Best Actress nomination in the Academy Awards on the grounds that Scenes From a Marriage had not originally been conceived as a feature film In comparing the film condensation with the TV version the films 168 minutes with 300 minutes spread over sixweekly installments discerned differences are occasionally dramatic usually subtle Perhaps the most significant deletions for the film were made at the beginning and end In Scene One entitled Innocence and Panic we now learn that Marianne Liv Ullmann is pregnant and has an abortion In the final scene In the Middle of the Night in a Dark House Somewhere in the World she has a long intimate conversation with her widowed mother Most the other editing was executed so artfully that at least for anyone who saw the film more than two years ago it is often difficult to identify the oncedeleted passages with complete certainty The major differences between the film and TV versions are less matters of content than development    It would be specious to argue that the film in the condensing process is analogous to poetry with the looser TV production approximating prose There poetry and prose in both versions The poetry though happens to be largely visceral Bergman had the invaluable assistance of his favorite cameraman Sven Nykvist But the theatrically released film was stripped to the bare bones leaving the impression of a couple in splendid isolation despite the presence of secondary characters The TV series provides more details longer exposition greater exposure for those secondary characters One surprising result the character of Marianne comes off a shade less nobly than in the film while Johan the husband Erland Josephson gains a tiny measure of sympathy The dramatic cracks are filled in leaving an increased awareness of time and place and biographical facts In the beginning while Johan and Marianne are being interviewed for an insipid magazine article on their ideal marriage we learn that they have reached their tenth wedding anniversary and have two daughters He at 44 is an associate professor at the Psychotechnical Institute She working in a law firm was the youngest of seven brothers and sisters and is already divorced from one husband whom Johan contemptuously refers to as an imbecile millionaire By storys end another 10 years have passed Marianne is now married to somebody named Henrick Johan to somebody named Anna The two have passed through marriage and divorce only to wind up clinging to each other in a small vacation cottage Have they missed something important Have they ever loved or been loved Johan finally answers only for himself I think I love you in my imperfect and rather selfish way And at times I think you love me in your stormy emotional way In fact I think that you and The journey from facade of a perfect marriage through bitterness and even physical violence to an acceptance simple tenderness is devastating and exhilarating It encompasses the past discussing Ibsen or quoting Strindberg Is there anything worse than a husband and wife who despise each other It comments on the present on such passing phenomena as Johans apartment life in concrete suburbs where he is met at the door by I3yearolds who amuse themselves by mugging the elderly On one key level much more obvious in the TV production it grapples with the contemporary womens liberation movement But in the Bergman manner the central concerns revolve around a basic search for self and the possibility of that self entering an honest relationship For Bergman the destructive masquerade of parental and social pressures begins in the cradle The rest is simply a testing of alternatives The couple in the first episode Bibi Andersson and Jan Malmsjo have exploded into open hatred Mariannes middleaged divorce client in Episode Two has endured a loveless relationship for the sake of her children and now that they arc raised she wants out of marriage because everything is getting meaner grayer and losing all dignity In the final episode Marianne discovers that her own parents spent a whole lifetime without touching each other Although Miss Ullmanns introductions sometimes topple over into the queasy terrain of soap opera No relationship between people is perfect Hollywoods happy ending is a manufactured product which never finds its equal in real life Scenes From a Marriage just about completely avoids that pitfall by purposefully playing almost rccklessly with that possibility The threat of veering into soapopera superficiality is quickly sidestepped by ridicule or direct criticism The characters are turning in upon and around themselves constantly nearly always surprising us disarming us    Miss Ullmann has already received international praise and awards for her portrayal of Marianne The breathtakingly beautiful and talented actress deserves every bit them In the meantime however the contribution of Erland Josephson as Johan has not generally received the recognition it deserves His transformation from cocky husband a man who seems to have grown small in some way extraordinarily perceptive totally convincing Josephson has worked with Bergman for 30 years in the theater and films collaborating with the director on several screenplays He himself is also a director and is currently the head Swedens Royal Dramatic Theater As a reviewer I have never been satisfied with any sort of voice dubbing in films but it must be conceded that this Englishlanguage version of Scenes From a Marriage comes very close to almost total acceptability Written and directed by Paulette Rubinstein the dubbing manages convey the vocal qualities and emotional content of the original Swedish soundtrack to a remarkable degree tends to fall apart only in those scenes of extremely passionate intensity A suggestion watch both versions this first week and then choose the more compatible form The subtitles in the Swedish version are being specially devised for TV presentation

"The $73,000 abandoned babies",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/06/archives/the-73000-abandoned-babies.html,Michael Vladek lying in a crib in the childrens ward of Rings County Hospital in Brooklyn does not see or hear or speak or eat He is kept alive by a tube that leads from his nose to his stomach Severely braindamaged by a mother who either beat him or threw him on the floor Michael has spent all but six months of his six years as a boarder baby at Kings County Michael not his real name is among nearly 300 children who have lived in New York City hospitals for months or years at an annual cost of 73000 a child in Medicaid funds What is incalculable is the cost of the confinement to the childrens own development as human beings The boarder babies have been kept in both public and voluntary hospitals because of what one frustrated young social worker calls a complete breakdown of the system thats supposed to be respon sible for child welfare in this city The existence of hoarder babies became front  page news last November when the New York Assemblys Select Committee on Child Abuse released a report indicating that several hundred children who did not need hospitalization were being confined in at least a dozen city hospitals at the Medicaid rate of 200 a day The cost of care for children in other institutions with specialized educational and rehabilitative programs is only a third to half of that amount But neither the parents nor the other institutions childrenmost of whom have multiple mental and physical handicapsso the hospitals have been keeping them The recent publicity has focused on an old problem In 1970 Mayor Lindsays task force on child abuse released a report on 207 hoarderbaby cases Nothing was done about the situation This time around city and state officials used words like outrageous deplorable insane and disgraceful to describe the boarderbaby scandal They blamed the situation on those proverbial villains insensitive bureaucrats In the wake of the recent publicityand after an order from Gov Hugh Careystate and city officials began moving some of the children out of the hospitals and into less costly institutions and foster homes But the flurry of action prompted by the publicity has not made any real changes in the system that produced the boarderbaby situation Theres nothing to prevent this from happening again to hundreds more kids in the next five years says In tracing the history of Michael Vladek and another child Teddy Kent also a pseudonym caught in the boarderbaby morass I found little to support the insensitive bureaucrat theory The records did turn up some evidence of bureaucratic callousness but there was much more evidence that individual bureaucratsin the hospitals and the maze of state and city agencies concerned with child welfarehad made efforts far beyond the scope of their jobs to find suitable places for the unwanted children When the efforts failed to produce results they were frustrated not so much by the indifference of other bureaucrats as by a system that divides responsibility for a child among several agencies ultimately prevent ing anyone from taking full and final responsibility for the fate of the child Michael exemplifies one type of child who ends up as boarder baby Because he is chronically and hopelessly braindamaged Michael does not belong in a hospital He needs custodial care in an institution for people whose condition cannot be improved or cured Teddy Kent is an example of another kind of boarder baby An epileptic whose mother refuses to keep him at home Teddy can be helped in an institution devoted to rehabilitation but instead was hospitalized at Kings County for five years At least a dozen public and private agenciesall of them receiving Mx moneyrefused to accept Teddy because his seizures made him a difficult patient After intense pressure generated by the State Assembly investigation one statefinanced center was ordered to take him in December The tragedy is that it may be too late to help Teddy realize his potential because his development has been so greatly retarded by years of confinement in the hospital  The one thing nearly all boarder babies have in common is they were horn into homes where the parents were unable or unwilling to take care of them Michael Vladeks mother Donna was 21 and already the mother of an infant son when she became pregnant second time The man with whom she was living left her when he found out she was pregnant Abortion was illegal in New York State at the time so Michaels mother tried to end the pregnancy herself She took hotmustard baths and drank a solution of dark beer and castor oil An injection with an unknown solution produced no results so she swallowed another mixture of Lestoil and vinegar Finally she deliberately fell on her stomach when she was six months pregnant Nothing worked Michael was born on Nov 8 1970 At the age of two months the baby was admitted to Kings County with what the medical report described as convulsive  type seizures and a swelling of the left eye The swelling was diagnosed as a subdural hematoma a hemorrhage beneath the skull The blow or fall that resulted in the brain damage also brought on partial blindness Michaels mother had insisted in interviews with doctors and hospital social workers that she had no idea what could have caused the swelling Finally she changed her story and said the baby had fallen off the bed while she was changing his diaper She told the hospital social worker she had not admitted this earlier because her mother had advised her to keep quiet so the hospital wont think the child was beaten and trouble for us Michael Vladek was discharged from the hospital into the cutody of his mother on March 30 1971 For Michael this was the point when the system that is supposed to protect children failed to do so The hospital records make it clear that the medical staff and social workers were convinced Michael was a battered child But as far as the records indicate the case was either not reported to the Bureau of Child Welfare or it tion nor his hyperactivity constitute justifiable reason for prolonged and damaging institutionalization But Teddys mother would neither take him home nor sign papers allowing hint to he placed in a foster home or a residential treatment facility Why would a parent want to condemn a child to prolonged hospitalization instead of allowing him to receive the care he needed Its not all that unusual says Fezzuoglio Its easier for the mother to tell herself that the child is sick in the hospital than to admit that he is retarded Or more to the point in the case of Teddy to admit that he has a problem that could be dealt with in the home as well as in a special school A social worker at the Bureau of Child Welfare who was involved in Teddys case says she has found handicapped or retarded children kept at home for years because the parents do not want to admit that the children need help The difference here she says is youve got the child in a hospital at a very big cost to the taxpayers Because the public doesnt pay when a parent just shuts the kid up at home you dont hear a fuss I had one kid who was locked away in a room for five years But well its not in the newspapers because its not costing anyone money In the spring of 1973 the Bureau of Child Welfare initiated a court case to try to gain custody of Teddy so that he could be placed in a foster home or a treatment facility The Family Court is also part of the bureaucracy dealing with child welfare and Teddys case was not decided for 18 months Hearings were delayed time after time Sometimes they were put off because the case had been transferred from one judge to another by the final hearing seven judges were involved In the end the bureau was denied custody because the judge found no evidence of parental neglect Meanwhile because of the continuing hospitalization Teddys development continued to fall further and further behind that of normal children his own age Most epileptics are not retarded Teddy has a rare and unusually severe form of epilepsy Kings County has few resources to help a child like Teddy becauselike all hospitalsit is geared toward the treatment of people with acute illnesses There is only one psychologist for nearly 200000 children who pass through the hospital each year The hospital used to have aides who would take the boarder children outside to play but they all lost their jobs in the citybudget cuts The nurses on Teddys ward helped him make considerable progress after drugs brought his seizures tinder better control By his seventh birthday Teddy was able to tell the nurses when he wanted to go to the bathroom feed himself identify many of the parts of cause he was an epileptic and others because he was too retarded The really sad thing Fezzuoglio says is that nobody knows just how retarded Teddy is Can you say a kid is retarded because he doesnt know the difference between spring and fall when that kid has hardly been outside The list of agencies that either turned Teddy down or failed to respond to Fezzuoglios inquiries is a long one New Yorks Graham Home for Children the Bird S Coler Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island St Christophers School on Long Island the Hebrew Academy for Special Children the Keystone Residence in Scranton Pa the Stonegate School in Connecticut the National Childrens Rehabilitation Center in Leesburg Va the Brooklyn Developmental Center even the Greater New York chapter of the National Epilepsy Foundation Some of these agencies are entirely financed by public funds others are private but like private nursing homes for the elderlyreceive much of their money from public funds There is a Catch22 Quality to many of the replies from these institutions Bird S Coler for example is a municipal hospital An official there told Fezzuoglio that Teddy could benefit from their rehabilitative program but he could not be accepted because he was a boarder baby If Teddy did improve considerably with special instruction the official said then there would be no place to send him when he was ready to leave The hospital could not take that responsibility The National Epilepsy Foundation asked if it could assist Kings County in its efforts to find a place for Teddy replied that it could not because the case was al ready being handled by the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene Both the state agencies and the citys office of Special Services for Children had already failed to find any institution that would accept Teddy Then in November came the State Assembly report emphasizing the cost in Medicaid money for each boarder baby The report of the waste of moneyunlike the earlier reports on the waste of livesmoved state and city officials to act It was this effort that finally produced the transfer of Teddy Kent from Kings County to the Brooklyn Developmental Center The center had turned Teddy down in July In December the center was ordered by city and state officials to take the child  This is not a story with happy endingfor Teddy or the other boarder babies Thomas Shirtz of the Brooklyn Developmental Center says Teddy can be helped but only through a long period of individual instruction Would it have been better if hed gotten out of the hospital five years ago Of course it would have Shirtz says Theres no way to make up for that time with a normal child much less one with handicaps The inability of the childwelfare system to intervene before a baby winds up in any institutionto work with parents within the community is the real problem Thomas Shirtz points out that many children like Teddy Kent live at home with their parents and receive private therapy If hed been born into a rich family Shirtz says the parents would have paid for the special therapy he needed in a private school Michael Vladek who is still at Kings County might have been able to help his motheror taken Michael away from her before he was so badly abused Shirtz is the head of a new program designed to work with mentally handicapped people and their families in community centers The program was developed by state and city mentalhealth officials in response to a complicated Federal Court decree in 1975 that followed revelations of inhumane conditions at the Willowbrook state institution It is beginning in Brooklyn and is expected to serve as a prototype for similar communitybased projects in other areas of the city In spite of all the publicity about boarder babies the city and state are giving with one hand and taking away with the other The panel advising Mayor Beame on further city budget cuts has recommended a 40 to 60 percent cut in the number of hospital social workersthe people whove tried the hardest to find help for the boarder children Dr Vincent J Fontana chairman of Mayor Beames task force on child abuse believes there will be no end to the boarderbaby cycle without a law prohibiting the confinement of children after their medical needs have been met Fontana is also the director of the New York Foundling Hospital and he has been promised by state officials that his institution will receive a license to provide skilled nursing care for severely handicapped babies within a matter of weeks or months instead of the two to three years that are usually required They can cut the red tape in this extraordinary situation with all the newspaper publicity he says If there were legislation they would have to do it all the time On the hospital wards where boarder babies come and go staff members are understandably skeptical about the idea that a law can break the cycle of neglect While I was talking to the nurses on Michael Vladeks and Teddy Kents ward at Kings County a small boy came up and asked if he could use my ballpoint pen to draw pictures I gave him the pen and he settled down to draw something that looked like a dragon One of the nurses shook her head and told me the boy had been brought in the night before with his brother after their baby sister had been found dead in their apartment She had been beaten to death by her mothers boyfriend her 4yearold brother had witnessed the event The wheels of bureaucracy were turning to move some of the old boarder babies out of Kings County Somewhere else the wheels were presumably beginning to turn to place these two new boys in foster homes or institutions But in the meantime the hospital would keep them

Women's Advocate Now Fights Houston Council to Keep Her Job,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/12/archives/womens-advocate-now-fights-houston-council-to-keep-her-job.html,HOUSTON March 11When the Government of Taiwan presented the city of Houston with a statue of Confucius a few months back it was Nikki Van Hightower the citys official Advocate for Womens Rights who spotted the inscription on the base and quickly branded the Chinese sage the sexist of his time The Confucian quote to which Mrs Hightower objected was Men have their respective occupations and women their homes It was later given a less offensive translation by scholars lar with the nuances of the Chinese language and despite her protests the statue was accorded a place in the citys new public library The controversy was brief but typical of the sort that has propelled the Womens Advocatethe only city office of its kind in the country as far as I know the officeholder saysinto the local headlines with some frequency It has also generated pressure rom citizens groups for her removal This week the Houston City Council eard from representatives of Right to Life and antifeminist organizations taking issue with some of Mrs Hightowers public stands The council which has no women members voted overwhelmingly to reduce Mrs Hightowers 18375 annual salary to a 1 a year with a threat that if she did not resign voluntarily her post would be abolished I dont think that taxpayers dollars ought to be expended by city government to promote legislation said Councilman Louis Macey who opposes Mrs Hightowers efforts to rally opinion against an effort to rescind the Texas Legislatures fiveyearold endorsement or the equal rights amendment Mrs HightowerVan is her maiden namesat in her cramped office early yesterday morning answering phone calls from wellwishers and alarmed allies in the womens movement who asked what they could do to help her stay on She found a few moments to talk about her unusual job and the crisis that now threatens it I have no real power she said adding that she also had no staff and no funds beyond those allocated to pay her own salary so much of what I have done has been involved with organizing and mobilizing women she continued Ive done a lot of work on behalf of the women in this community Its time that the Mayor and the City Council heard from them If they dont want me in this job Ill leave Her single predecessor as Womens Advocate Poppy Northcutt resigned last year bitterly critical of the City Council for what she called its lack of concern for womens rights Mrs Hightower said that she had not heard from Mayor Fred Hofheinz who appointed her 10 months ago since the City Councils vote of 6 to 1 against her The Mayor who created the advocates office in 1974 cast the single dissenting ballot Mrs Hightowe said she was not concerned over no hearing from him Barbara Strong a Hofheinz aide said the Mayor still believed in the need for a womens advocate on the city payroll and was still supportive  Mrs Hightower But she added he was not clicking his heels in leaping to her defense because she does some times speak precipitously but her job is to work with womens groups and be a thorn in his side Asked for an example of Mrs Hightowers outspokenness the Mayors aide recalled an occasion when the Womens Advocate had called a member of the School Board a moron after he said that the only thing a woman can do better than man is be a woman Mrs Hightower says she has not apologized for her choice of language at that time and did not intend to It was a moronic statement It was crude and insulting Mrs Hightower also has fought to remove pay toilets from womens rest rooms at the Houston Intercontinental Airport asked that certain city officials stop referring to themselves as male chauvinist pigs in the presence of women subordinates and has upbraided other officials for deriding female coworkers as menopausal Foe Cites Legitimate Abuses Suzanne Thomas a 32  year  old mother heads a Houston citizens committee and resents Mrs Hightowers public declarations in favor of abortion on demand full legal rights for lesbians and ERA She expressed criticism of the Advocate before the council on Wednesday and said after the session There are so many unfair things happening to women in Houston now that Nikki Van Hightower would have her hands full just talking of legitimate abuses of womens rights There are more substantial arguments There are women starvingwell not starving but you know what I mean Several of the 40 or so womens organizations here that Mrs Hightower helped to form a citywide womens coalition are reportedly preparing to rally behind her by joining with Mr Hofheinz in his efforts to persuade the council to leave the Womens Advocate job intact Asked what course she would follow if her salary were taken away Mrs Hightower replied Oh Ill resign I wont work for nothing She came to the city government from the University of Houston where she taught political science she has a New York University doctorate Since she took the controversial post Mrs Hightower said she had helped to obtain several promotions for women in city government which is one of her principal constituencies she added however that Houston was still in bad trouble with affirmative action In her other roleliaison between the Mayors office and the general womens community of the cityMrs Hightower said she had brought some changes for the better at the womens jail and had encouraged the establish ment of a crisis housing center for beaten wives I cannot work miracles in here she said Again she said that they didnt give me any power She characterized her job as a pressure point that in addition to its practical effect provided many women with an important psychological boost I am their city official she said There is no other one They can call me I cannot work miracles in here They didnt give me any real power If they dont want me in this job I wont work for nothing Ill resign
GOLDEN CLAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/13/archives/golden-clan-it-began-in-the-summer-of-27-when-the-inventor-thomas-e.html,The precise moment when the Irish Catholics passed truly into society is unclear but it is almost certain that the place where it happened was Southampton True there were Irish living in the marbled sepulchers of Newport but Newport was full of the gaudy rich meat packers steel barons and oilmen who looked for something they could not find in Cleveland say or Detroit and who went to Newport to be snubbed and to indulge themselves in the innocent vulgarity that only the seriously rich afford The members of the 400 had gone to Newport first causing a colony of artists and writers to flee in some horror and while there were Catholics among the 400 there were no identifiable Irish Catholics the first Irish Catholic of great prominence in Newport being Mrs Hermann Oelrichs the daughter of James Fair of the Comstock fortune Theresa or Tessie Oelrichs followed an honorable tradition among the great ladies of Newport She went mad Mrs William Backhouse Astor the Mrs Astor who for years presided over Newport in diamond stomachers and solitary majesty died in 1908 and in her last summers there she stood alone in the drawing room of her mansion exchanging pleasantries with people who had long since passed on Tessie Fair Oelrichs a pleasant old soul who shunned a maid and would scrub the floors of her mansion Rosecliff herself tried but never could inherit Mrs Astors title as queen of Newport although she did manage to be like her at the very end Tessie a wraith of what she had once been would wander the halls of Rosecliff also being hospitable to people who werent there Things like this always seemed to be happening in Newport Its splendor was contrived attended by enormous publicity and therefore seriously deleterious to the Irish Their progress as the financial writers once said about financier Thomas Fortune Ryan had to be noiseless When it was not the Irish who were always selfconscious about themselves would fall on their faces in deplorable ways or what was worse often cease to be Catholics It is time once again to celebrate the Irish St Patricks Day is this week and this means there will be a good deal made of parades and old songs most of which will be American and only a few of which will truly be Irish This is because the American Irish seldom look back on their pasts while the rich and social among them have looked back not at all When the Irish Catholics tried to move from the middle to the upper classes they found that the people who were there before them did not like it The rich Irish Catholics formed a separate society arid among the most prominent of its bulwarks were the Murrays and McDonnells Their patriarch was Thomas E Murray the inventor and engineer who died in 1929 and who left seven children to carry on his tradition of propriety and piety They did this and had many children of their own and it was these children who moved from a wholly Irish Catholic world into a more homogenized one The old Irish Catholic society is no more and while perhaps this is a good thing it is possible that we are poore for it too Southampton was right for them Southampton said one of its great ladies Mrs Goodhue Livingston was a backwater of God which is an impreciseenough description but at least suggestive of the kind of thing that was good about the place It was nothing more than a sleepy pleasant village in 1875 when a drygoods merchant from New York built a cottage there and then a few years later persuaded his doctor to build a cottage there too This was the beginning of Southampton as a summer resort and it more or less officially became a place for the fashionable rich when a family from New York back from a trip to Venice brought a gondola with them and floated it on Lake Agawam Soon the Irish Catholics began coming with the first of stature being Judge Morgan OBrien who carried himself and his daughters over from Hampton Bays and put up a house that looked like a yellow pagoda on the shore of Lake Agawam Finley Peter Dunne the creator of Mr Dooley came to Southampton and so did a political type called Patrick Francis Murphy and together they all joined the Southampton Club whose president was the starchy Nicholas Murray Butler who was president of Columbia University as well The interesting thing about this aside from the fact that the Irish were there at all was that OBrien Dunne and Murphy were also members of the Occasional Thinkers a kind of club within the Southampton Club over which Dr Butler also presided Butler his friends said found the Irishmen attractive and the Irishmen using him and the Southampton Club as the impeccable references they were soon found their way into the imposing Union Club in New York So Southampton if not eager to have the Irish upon It had seen some of the breed and would probably be at least civil when more came and when the inventor Thomas E Murray bought a summer home there in 1927 it meant that the Irish were coming in abundance Murray bought a great shingled house on the ocean called Wickapogue and then his daughter Anna and her husband James McDonnell bought a house virtually next door Meanwhile Thomas E Murray Jr and his wife who back in Brooklyn had been spending every night of their lives going across the street to visit the older Murrays certainly would not desert them now and so they bought a house on Gin Lane in Southampton Immediately the Joseph B Murrays moved to Water Mill which is just next to Southampton and then Julia and Lester Cuddihy went there and soon Catherine McQuail by now separated from her husband went to Southampton and then the moody Jack Murray and his family came too It was the way of great Irish families in those days to cling together for protection and it meant that in the space of a season or two the whole family with the exception of Marie the daughter who had married a Protestant and wisely chose to stay on in Connecticut had descended on Southampton all in a bunch Now the family did not know it and Southampton may only have suspected it but in time the family would rather transform it In the late 1920s Southampton was a quiet place known mostly for a golf course that had opened in 1891 Southampton had never had many of the flashy rich and even the names of its streetsJobs Lane Meeting House Lane First Neck Lanediscouraged the merely frivolous even had they been able to afford a house there Any resort has sybarites but Southampton when the Murrays and McDonnells went there had fewer than most and the proper Episcopalians who attended St Andrews Dune Church were a great deal like the IrishCatholic Murrays and McDonnells who straightaway began going to the Church of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary Neither group knew it about the other but at bottom they were all Puritans and in any contest between Puritans the ones who believe they are closest to God will always win This meant the Episcopalians hadnt a chace Still it is hard to know now what Southampton thought about those people who fell upon it in those early summers The Murrays and McDonnells never really knew themselves although being Irish they had their suspicions which naturally were unpleasant ones Im sure everyone thought they were being inundated by the Mickey Irish says the daughter of Jack Murray who later married Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt I could sense their antagonism even as a child says her sister the Marquesa di Montezemolo who for years was fashion editor of Vogue Mother always thought the WASPs resented us as upstarts and when I grew older and met the parents of some of my friends I thought so too We were never invited to the parties that the really social people had They thought we were nouveau One of her cousins a daughter of Julia and Lester Cuddihy remembers being in the family bathhouse at the Southampton Beach Club and overhearing one of the very social Schumacher girls in the next bathhouse Southampton she said is being positively swamped by all those Irish The Cuddihy girl says that the Schumacher girl sounded disturbed Mrs Marie Harris a daughter of Thomas E Murray Jr says she is sure that the general feeling in Southampton was one of disdain but that even this was tempered The really aristocratic ones like Washie [Washington] Irving and his sister Kitty didnt talk badly about the Irish at all she says They were always nice to us and if anything we had chips on our shoulders because of their Harvard accents Now this of course is getting close to the heart of things The Irish Catholics carried their sensibilities closer to the surface than most people did and forever expecting a rebuff they built up their own resentments Moreover they could be eminent snobs themselves The McDonnells were the richest branch of the family and generally considered the most social although in an IrishCatholic world that certainly never meant very much In the beginning says one of the McDonnell girls Mrs Charlotte Harris who married into a Catholic family that owned a steamship line we used to sit by ourselves outside the beach club all alone all in a row People called us the Irish group Later they called us the Spellman group I dont know why we sat alone We were afraid or shy or something Then we sat by ourselves because we wanted to By God we were going to show them Now them in this case meant Southampton at large but as the years at Southampton went by the Murrays and McDonnells decided that they were showing the other Irish Catholics too Everyone in the family knew the Kennedys for example and when they moved from Boston to New York in the 1930s Rose Kennedy and Anna McDonnell recognizing each other as being cut from the same stuff became particularly close The feeling among the Murrays and McDannells though was that the Kennedys werent quite right that they were well nouveau and when Mrs Kennedy visited Mrs McDonnell at Southampton the family simply assumed that she was there to find out how she too could set a table or arrange the flowers or whatever it was one was supposed to do She and her daughters were being snubbed terribly in New York a Murray lady recalls so shed come to Auntie Anna for advice She would be driven up in a big black car and wed all say Doesnt she know that out here she should be driving a station wagon My mother was at the Mc Donnells one day that Mrs Kennedy was there and she came back and said Rose Kennedy such a lovely person but what a dreadful voice she has Mother couldnt get over it Then when Joe Kennedy was appointed Ambassador to England there were all those pictures of the Kennedys in the papers We all thought How dowdy how unchic how Irish Catholic We should have been going to England not them There was never much flamance about these Irish but because they were Irish and in the case of the Murrays and McDonnells because there were so many of them people insisted in seeing something like a raffishness about them In fact sometimes the Murrays and McDonnells invited it on themselves On the first Fourth of July that Thomas E Murray was at Wickapogue he assembled his relatives about him and announced that in the evening he would put on a display of fireworks It would he at the home of Thomas E Murray Jr on Gin Lane he said and it would he a proper family entertainment attended by parents children the help and even the pets Accordingly a groom that evening began laying everything out on top of a sand dune for what was to be that most American of entertainments He put out Roman candles St Catherines wheels Greek fire everything and when the family was gathered and Thomas E Murray gave the signal he proudly touched off the first Roman candle Off in a shower of sparks it went only not out to sea but sideways into the next Roman candle which went into the rest of the Roman candles which touched off the St Catherines wheels which ignited the Greek fire which set off everything else It was a marvelous sight and it was made all the more marvelous by the fire it started in the dune grass Up and down the dunes the fire spread lighting the skies and bringing one of the Murrays Irish maids to the window in a small fit of ecstasy Oh what a beautiful display she said while a small Murray child cried out in fear Shut up Thomas E Murray bellowed and a small McDonnell child caught up in the wonder of it all said Goo Grandpa said Shut up  The flames by now were threatening the homes on either side of them The children were dancing round and about and Grandpa was bellowing louder than ever To this day one of his grandsons says it was quite the most exciting thing he has ever seen Someone called the Southampton Fire Department and when it came with all its equipage and volunteers the townspeople met the Murrays McDonnells and Cuddihys for the first time The volunteers spraying chemicals all about put out the fire and left in its place a couple of acres of blackened and seared dunes All that summer and the next people drove up Gin Lane to see them and to wonder what kind of people would do such a thing while the families in the houses on either side of the blackened dunes would regard the Murrays and McDonnells with suspicion for years In an odd way the most flamboyant thing the Murrays and McDonnells over did in Southampton was to withdraw from it and to set up something like a community of their own It was not intended to be this but it became an IrishCatholic retreat and eventually a place of fascination to the gossip columnists who like the people in Southampton were always confused about which Murrays and McDonnells were living there Actually it was only three families living on a great plot of land by the ocean but the families grew so large that there always seemed to be more of them than there really were and to this day Southampton can scarcely separate the strains of Irish that sprang from the It began with the death of Thomas E Murray in 1929 when his son Thomas E Murray Jr ascended into Wickapogue and then bought more acres of his own Anna and James McDonnell were living next to him separated by only two swimming pools in between Subsequently Julia and Lester Cuddihy although they lived in Water Mill bought a strip of land near both of them as a speculation Then Jack Murray who had sold out just before the Crash paid 125000 and got an adjacent 56 acres and the houses on them for his property It meant that the McDonnells the Tom Murrays and the Jack Murrays and all their establishments were now dwelling together just outside the village of Southampton on some 160 acres which included their own small lake It was inevitable that they would not dwell together in perfect harmony but in the beginningwho could tell that Jack Murrays place was called Lighthouse Farm and it had behind it a stable a garage laundry chicken coop caretakers house and cottage for the groom There was a field for growing vegetables too Tom Murrays house was bigger than Jacks and it had even more buildings scattered around it The McDonnells had only their cottage without other buildings but in the cottage were 10 bedrooms a music room library living room dining room breakfast room poolroom and two kitchens all of which except the kitchens were done up graciously in chintz and deep rugs by the McMillen decorators in New York The McDonnell cottage also had rooms for the help but apparently no one ever thought to count them Driven by some insatiable lust perhaps their only one the McDonnells and Tom Murrays kept adding terraces rooms and whole wings to their houses and whenever they did a priest would come in and bless each one The priest would pray make the sign of the cross and then sprinkle holy water The family meanwhile would be following the priest about and soon he would turn and bless them too The terrace or the room or the wing would now be open The Jack Murrays had seven children the Tom Murrays had 11 and the McDonnells had 14 Im afraid to dive in Al Smith a frequent visitor to the pool would say I might swallow a baby Outside the compound in Southampton the Joseph Murrays had five children while in Water Mill the Cuddihys had seven children and Catherine McQuail had two There was a confusion of children furthering the suspicion that the Irish by propagation alone Were taking over Southampton and leading Newell Tilton a society man from there Palm Beach Tuxedo and Newport to suggest that perhaps the place should now be called Murray Bay The dutiful Anna McDonnell had people to help her with her 14 children but being dutiful she insisted on accompanying each of them on every visit they made to a doctor a dentist or even to a clothing store Once she took nine of them to Hildreths in Southampton to buy shoes One by one they filed in and were fitted and when Mrs McDonnell was presented with the bill she examined it in her careful way and then protested to the clerk that it wasnt enough Oh madam he said we always give reductions to Institutions In truth the McDonnell cottage was run something like an institution and by the time of Southampton Mrs McDonnell was becoming something of an institution herself For one thing she was elegant the elegance being neither Irish nor Catholic nor for that matter even particularly American it was a very quiet elegance which meant it was more nearly French If I could only look like Anna McDonnell after having had all those children Rose Kennedy said and when the family heard that it understood perfectly Anna McDonnell was special so was her sisterinlaw Marie Murray but Anna McDonnell was supposed to be perfection She had given birth to all those children and always she had declined anesthetics saying instead that she would offer up the pain to the glory of God To offer it up to find sancity in suffering to find comfort and even joy in it was the most Irish Catholic of impulses conditioned by a thousand years of the race by the clergy and by all that had happened to both Anna McDonnell would not wilt in the heat of any Southampton summer she would always be there perfectly controlled outwardly assured impervious it seemed to either frivolity or discomfort There was the little dress the little hat the little veil all coming from the little shop on East 60th Street that was run by an Irish Catholic lady and greatly favored by other Irish Catholic ladies and always there were the shoes with the pointed toes the strap over the instep and the Louis XVI heels and above the appearance of elegance there was the appearance of propriety There was nothing so important to that generation as propriety and in this the Irish part and the Catholic part strengthened each other nicely and became so inseparable that you could not imagine one without the other A slip a failure the smallest lapse from the prescribed faith and these Irish would fear they were no longer Catholics that their souls were lost A slip a failure the smallest lapse from the prescribed behavior and these Irish would fear they were no longer acceptable that their positions were lost There was a great deal of fear involved in all this but who on the outside would ever know that Therefore Anna McDonnell the only one of her generation who had talked back to her father was not about to be caught up now in seasonal social conventions The demands of church and of blood were too great and at Southampton she ran a staff of 13butler chauffeur two nurses two cooks two kitchen maids four chambermaids and a gardeneras rigorously as she ran herself Every morning she got up went to mass had breakfast and then at 9 drove her station wagon to Bohacks to do the days marketing She planned each meal pondered each leftover and in her unruffled way saw to it that things were exactly as they ought to be Then with the utmost regularity every afternoon Anna McDonnell and Marie Murray would retreat to the private chapel of Thomas E Murray Jr Archbishop Thomas E Molloy had seen to it that he had the privilege of the chapel the same as his father before him and it was a small and beautiful thing with dark panels a wooden altar and a plain gold cross There were the Stations of the Cross on the wall and priedieux covered with velvet for the ladies to kneel on While their peers at Southampton had tea or sat about at the Beach Club Anna McDonnell and Marie Murray would stay in the chapel for a holy hour 60 minutes of prayers readings or other devotions communing with their God and fortifying themselves against whatever it was that lay outside the gates of the compound It had no hedges in those days and it stretched from the ocean back over the dunes past the houses and across the fields to the blacktop road that went into the village of Southampton Among other things the village had Peck  Peck Foulke  Foulke Charles of the Ritz and Bendels but the place where the Murrays and McDonnells went most often was the Church of the Sacred Hearts on Hill Street Its pastor was Father George Killeen and he was a beefy reddened man with a large shock of hair and a booming brogue that was partly Irish but mostly all his own The blesd Virge he would say and niean the blessed Virgin and frequently he would preach about storming the gates of Heaven which would befuddle the youngest Murray and McDonnels Father Killeen was never accused of flouting the legalisms of church doctrine in favor of their spirit and confirmed in his own sanctity he often judged that of others The Tom Murray Jrs and the McDonnells seemed to like that about him probably because he confirmed the contours of their own existence so well although some of the children trooping to confession in squads every Saturday became discomfited by his habit of shouting at them from the confessional booth Bless me Father for I have sinned the children would begin and it hardly seemed to matter whether the sin was mortal or venial Father Killeen would give them hell just the same Of all the priests who were in and out of the family compound in those summers Father Killeen was the most ubiquitous He was always there it seemed stuffed into a scratchy black woolen bathing suit flopping in and out of the swimming pool and looking some of the children thought rather like a piece of wurst In the afternoons he played golf with Catherine McQuail Mrs McQuail separated though of course not divorced from her husband Ennis needed a golf partner and in the way of the Irish Catholic she was she had chosen the priest The meaner spirits in Southampton said there were unspeakable things going on between those two but the meaner spirits could only speculate and they never understood it There is a sexual relationship between the priests and their ladies but it is a surrogate one and therefore not to be confused with the real thing Father Killeen was part of that tradition and he was part of another one too of the IrishAmerican priest who is both sword of the Lord and retainer to the rich It is a difficult thing for a man to be leaving room for a subtle corruption of the souls of both the priest and the rich and sometimes in the recesses of his spirit the priest knows it Then he may become more full of bonhomie than ever before showing that it doesnt bother him or else he may become more judgmental and querulous and ease his spirit by mortifying his own and everyone elses flesh too Father Killeen chose to do both sputtering and splashing about in the pool in rough good humor and whenever he could reminding everyone that damnation was just around the corner for even the smallest infraction The family being Irish put up with it Father Killeen sniffed and complained and said that so many Murrays and McDonnells were attending mass in the private chapel on Sundays that the collections at the Church of the Sacred Hearts were suffering Henceforth the family took up a collection in their chapel on Sundays and turned it over to him Later on he spoke hopefully of becoming a monsignor and so Thomas E Murray Jr by now risen high in the councils of the laity saw to it that this too came to pass Father Killeen had a proprietary interest in the family and most of the family had a proprietary interest in him Nonetheless some members of the family were skeptical but being of the generation they were and believing that a priest was still a priest they would hardly do much about it On Sundays Father Killeen would stand on the steps of his church a railroad watch in hand and count the Murrays and McDonnells as they came in family by family until only the Jack Murrays were left They would always be the last to arrive and Father Killeen looking soberly at his watch and then reproachfully at Jack Murray would say Ah Jack out late again last night and Jack looking straight at Father Killeen would say Yes Father and drunk as a lord It was a small gesture but it was all Jacks own and followed by his wife and seven children he would walk down the aisle of the church where row on row of other Murrays and McDonnells quiet composed and hardly rustling would be clutching their missals just possibly bored and longing to be elsewhere but no doubt offering it up just the same It must not be thought in all this however that the family was a joyless melange measuring its days in communion wafers and plenary indulgences or going through life without the simple pleasures of the rich Almost from the beginning at Southampton the Murrays and McDonnells were doing things that had nothing to do with being either Irish or Catholic and were attractive enough to set the society columnists to writing about them The first and most tireless chronicler was the late Maury Paul a plump perfumed little man who was William Randolph Hearsts first Cholly Knickerbocker With one thing or another Hearst was an irregular Catholic but the society pages of The New York Times and The Herald Tribune seldom recognized any Catholics and Irish Catholics not at all Consequently Hearsts editors reacting to this and to osmotic pressure from their boss began to specialize in them Maury Paul who Cleveland Amory tells us invented the term Cafe Society one day in 1919 when he noticed that the Old Guard of society apparently had disappeared the night before was always looking for new faces and in the 1930s he discovered the Murrays and McDonnells Their names began to turn up with increasing frequency in his columns about Southampton and sometimes he seemed to think they had invented the place It was a turning point in the familys history not so dramatic perhaps as Thomas E Murrays building his first steam engine but seductive enough to some of his grandchildren so that in time they would court publicity and society so fiercely that it would undo them Nonetheless in the beginning it was all more innocent than that and the columnists wrote about the family mostly because the children were numerous goodlooking and full of what was supposed to be a Celtic joie de vivre In fact they were the golden Irish removed by birth and circumstance from their tribal past although not so far removed that they were without at least a few of its warm consolations Ahead for some of them were divorces abortions psychiatrists and bankruptcies but growing up in the decade of the 30s they were the most favored children of all and they had it seemes everything There were the dances on soft summer nights at the Meadow Club the Riding Club the Shinnecock Golf Club The girls wore cotton dresses and the boys wore blue blazers and everyone who saw thorn knew they were a part of that big golden family even if they couldnt be sure which part they were There were the sailing races off Westhampton where one child or another would always win something and there were the swimming and diving contests at the Beach Club where they always won something else Their days were full of grace and when they played tennis at the Meadow Club or golf at Shinnecock the Irish chauffeurs who waited outside all laced up into their stiff tunics of black or clay or fawn would look on them and know they were Irish children but quite unlike any they had ever before These children were always riding horses and going out with the Southampton Hunt Club and competing all over Long Island in horse shows and winning quantities of ribbons and trophies The horse in America is nearly always an impulse of the secondgeneration rich and so even Thomas E Murray Jr skittering about his front lawn had discovered the joys of polo while his brothers and sisters not caring about being atop horses themselves saw to it that their children could ride and jump whenever they wanted to The children could do most things that they wanted to and when the wife of Thomas E Murray Jr told her husband that Marie their oldest daughter wanted to have a comingout party he had said it was ridiculous that he had never heard of such a thing and that comingout parties were for people quite unlike themselves Then of course he softened warmed toward it in fact and decided that Marie would have a party after all I guess if she wants it she can have it was all that he said to his wife but then Thomas E Murray Jr went ahead and had a huge platform built atop the dunes and around it he put up a tent The party was on the Labor Day weekend in 1939 and the flowers had died weeks before and so Tom Murray had gladioluses planted everywhere Louis Sherry was called in to do the catering and Eleanor Holm was hired from Billy Roses Aquacade to swim in the pool for entertainment The man who parked the cars had MURRAY on his cap in gold braid Some 800 people were invited and the only small shadow on Marie Murrays life was her cousin Anne McDonnell Anne had just announced her engagement to Henry Ford and was getting so much publicity in the papers that Maries party was being ignored Still Marie had a very good party Her father called up a team of men from New York and that night they put on a display of fireworks It was spectacular with blazing horses chasing blazing men over the skies of Southampton and for the denouement a picture of Marie unmistakably Marie etched in the sandwith more fireworks The party went on all night and at dawn the younger guests in an explosion of innocence but feeling full of both devilment and romance went to the 5 AM mass at the Church of the Sacred Hearts Father Killeen seizing the moment for all it was worth preached at length to these drowsy and slightly drunken young people on the value of a Catholic education and when he was done they went back to the tent on the dunes where Louis Sherry cooked scrambled eggs and bacon for them and where they sat about and mooned over one another and what was really the ending of a of life for all of them 
LETTERS TO THE LONG ISLAND EDITOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/13/archives/westchester-opinion-letters-to-the-long-island-editor-nurses-and.html,The right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness for a woman begins with her right to determine her reproductive future and when whether and under what circumstances she wishes to bear a child Mary Jane Tobin RN [Nurses and Abortion Opinion Page Jan 30] is throwing red herrings into the abortion issue What she wants boils down to a demand for the outright prohibition of abortion If it should succeed the result would be a real slaughter of innocent lifethe perils of illegal criminal abortion According to a recent study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute one million teenagers becothe pregnant each year and 600000 have babies Many of these teenage mothers are very young The adverse health social and economic consequences of having children while still a child are grave We must educate our children in childbearing We must allow for mistakes In the present state of the art of contraception abortion is an essential lastresort method of birth control The Supreme Court did not invent abortion It made abortion legal and therefore safe Lets keep it that way HARRIET H HARRIS RN Massapequa  I am in full support of Mary Jane Tobins article The plain fact is that many human lives are destroyed simply because others find it convenient to destroy them If the concept of a womans freedom requires that she have the right to destroy her offspring then that concept of freedom is brutal and unworthy Genuine personal freedom must begin by recognizing and respecting the natural human relationships that already exist Freedom cannot be freedom from personal responsibility No amount of statistical calculations moral protestation or legal argumentation can change the fact that an abortion destroys a human life LINDA ANN SIMONE RN Maspeth  As a pediatric nurse I share Mary Jane Tobins feelings in Nurses and Abortion I fear the anguish will accelerate for us all as prenatal diagnosis becomes common procedure for searching out those unfortunate babies afflicted with genetic disease In a number of cases diagnosis cannot be confirmed until the 23d to the 28th week of pregnancy which is near or at the time of viability At this stage there is a good chance that a live viable baby will survive the abortion procedure What to do There are some like Dr James Watson Nobel Laureate for DNA discovery who suggested [originally in connection with laboratoryconceived babies] that newborn babies not be given legal protection until three days after birth That way defective ones could be allowed to die He noted that while some defects can be detected before birth most of them can only be detected after birth and he felt that all parents should be allowed the op tion of those who can choose abortion for defect Should such views be adopted by society for coping with genetic disease then infanticide along with abortion could become standard medical prac tice Dr Michael Kaback who was director of the TaySachs program at Johns Hopkins expressed the view that abortion and infanticide were biologically the same He wasnt sure society was ready for euthanasia If society becomes ready then pediatric nurses will have to share the anguish of obstetrical nurses of having to see life taken as well as saved Unless of course we remove the unfit to extermination wards and hire legal executioners to do the deed EILEEN DOYLE RN Rockville Centre  As a registered nurse I worked in the emergency room of two major New York hospitals before 1973 when the Supreme Court recognized a womans constitutional right to privacy and ruled that a state could not prohibit a woman from obtaining a safe legal abortion How many nurses I wonder could tell their own horror stories if they cared for as I did a woman who in a state of despair over an unwanted pregnancy had used a wire hanger in a desperate effort to selfabort as a result she perforated her uterus One woman I helped care for died of hemorrhage the other of septicemia blood poisoning within 98 hours Two other women had gone to butchers to do the job for them one had to have an emergency hysterectomy the other died of septicemia The atrocities go on and on and on In my opinion the rights of the living the woman supersede the rights of the unborn the woman must be the priority And as a woman and as a nurse I too will do my utmost to care for and preserve life IRENE G WEINBERGER RN Commack The author is chairman of the Women and Health Task Force National Organization for Women Huntington  Most of the voluminous writing thinking lawmaking and moralizing about abortion has come from men In large measure because of this the rights of the fetus have too often taken precedence over the rights wishes and even health of the woman No man can ever fully comprehend the experience the fear the anguish of a woman who is pregnant and does not want to be The abortion issue has always been womans ownuniquely and entirely ours And it has always been more or less misunderstood by men The catalogue of medical horrors resulting from selfinduced or illegally performed abortions is long and bloody It includes a uterus pierced by a knitting needle or coat hanger chemical peritonitis that could lead to death caused by douching with lye turpentine and other caustic substances This catalogue is a book that the Supreme Courts decision has closed for us The National Organization for Women is more determined now than ever to see that the courts decision is upheld Freedom of choice and the availability of medically safe abortion is at the heart of the womens movement It is a right we are not about to give up it is a right we cannot afford to lose SUSAN SHERER Plainview The author is chairman of the Abortion and Reproduction Task Force of Nassau NOW  As a woman who has experienced a therapeutic abortion may I say there is no mystique about abortion except in the minds of those who create it If one considers it possible for a woman to become pregnant more than 400 different times in her life it should follow that she should choose which of the times she would prefer to bear a child Although we respect the feelings of nurses vs abortion more attention should be put on a much larger group women vs those who oppose abortion ROSE SOMA Miller Place The author is chairman of the Reproduction and Control Committee Suffolk NOW  I was happy to see finally an article concerning the prolife issue and especially one written by a prolife person As a nurse myself I am aware of what abortion does and will continue to do by destroying not only the infants life but also the lives of the parents Irreparable damage is done Where there is a tearing apart of the contents growing within the womb there also continues to be a tearing apart of the relationship of men and women As a nurse I will continue to fight for the prolife cause as in years to come it will also be my life I have also been attempting to save ALICE A DEGENNARO Ronkonkoma Letters should be addressed to Editor Long Island

"Marchers Mark Day for Women, Ask More Gains",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/13/archives/marchers-mark-day-for-women-ask-more-gains.html,In keeping with a 68yearold tradition hundreds of women from nearly 40 Womens groups marched through the streets of New York yesterday to celebrate International Womens Day And as the participants had done in previous years the 1000 women who participated in the 30blocklong march were pressing for equal rights for women calling for ratification of the Equal Rights Admendment end seeking an end to sterilization and abortion restrictions The marchers mostly young and middleaged women wearing blue jeans and sneakers chanted familiar feminist slogans distributed pamphlets and flyers and gained supporters and momentum during the fourhour walk When the march began at Herald Square the police estimated the number of marchers at 400 to 700 By the time the group reached West Eighth Street and Avenue of the Americas the estimate had increased to 1000 Aside from an occasional objection from motorists who were forced to wait for nearly 10 minutes at times as the marchers slowly passed by and some cynical objections from antifeminists along the route the march was orderly and without incident Rally at Union Square A rally held at Union Square at the end of the march attracted several prominent names in the American feminists movement Among the scheduled speakers were Eleanor Holmes Norton New York City Human Rights Commissioner Noreen Connell president of the National Organization for Women in New York and Sylvia Wexler of the Gray Panthers Miriam Friedlander a Democratic member of the City Council from Manhattan who spoke at the rally said later that she had participated in the march almost from the time it was first startedMarch S 1909and had iwtnessed a significant change in the womens movement over the years Years ago women were fighting for equality today we are fighting for womens rights across the board said Mrs Friedlander who has served on the City Council for three years She added I have seen the movement blossom watched young and old rich and poor and black and white work together for a single cause One of the youngest marchers yesterday was 12yearold Ellie Marmelstein who attends Intermediate School 70 She was wearing an outfit from the early 1900s and said she was persuaded to join the march by her mother The girls at my school are more concerned about boys and makeup she said One day they will be women and then theyll understand why they should have been here today
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/14/archives/letters.html,To the Editor I found Paul Delaneys March a news article quite interesting Companies Go Underground to Increase Profits and Save Energy The present cold winter January in particular has helped to emphasize that ours and the worlds fossilfuel supplies can be counted on less and less as time progresses Residential and commercial building heating and airconditioning account for about 20 percent of our energy use The prospect of periods like this January without fuel for heating is frightening for the colder parts of the country Action to correct our dependence on cheap fossil fuels should begin soon As a member of the National Academy of Sciences I obtained the NAS publication Legal Economic and Energy Considerations in the Use of Underground Space This is the report of a National Research Council workshop which met in June of 1973 It tells of experiences with the use of several million square feet of underground facilities largely in Kansas City where shale rock below ground is not prohibitively difficult to tunnel An interesting example is given by Spacecenter Inc which operates similar facilities for dry and refrigerated storage underground in Kansas City and aboveground in St Paul The refrigeration temperatures typically rise 1 degree Fahrenheit per day underground after plant shutdown or power loss but 1 degree Fahrenheit per hour aboveground Installation costs were S10 per square foot aboveground for dry storage and 30 for refrigeration vs 250 underground for dry storage and 8 to 10 for refrigeration Operating costs for both dry storage and refrigeration were ten times greater aboveground The underground storage rates higher on a maintenanceprotected from weather heat freezing no roof to maintain b utility costs c insurancefireproofing is easier and storm hazards are nonexistent d strengthalmost unlimited floor loads in Kansas City shale it is 200 tons per square foot e stabilityno vibrations for delicate machines and instruments and f operating costsmachines remain accurate much longer Manufacturing and consulting engineering firms sited underground in Kansas City found that the employees are extremely pleased with the working conditions The staff efficiency was better than for aboveground offices An underground elementary school was opened in Artesia NM in September of 1962 it can double as fallout shelter The conclusion was that worries about the physical and mental health of the students were unjustified and that it is actually benefit to some Ninetenths of those familiar with it recommended that more schools be built this way if the cost did not exceed that for other schools Clearly the feasibility of such construction depends on the geology of the underground of each locality Such construction might be prohibitive in Manhattan where the expense of subway and watersupply tunnels is quite high in the kind of bedrock which supports skyscraper construction The uniform yearround temperatures underground are favorable for comfortable living with low heating and cooling costs Care to prevent water seepage is important but apartments would be much safer from burglary and the surface could be made into landscaped gardens and have solarenergy collectors The subject clearly deserves more serious attention in our national thinking JAMES RAINWATER NEW YORKMarch 41977 The writer professor of physics at columbia was awarded the Nobel prize in 1975 Concorde Toward A Dispassionate Trial To the Editor The Concorde should be given permission to land at Kennedy International Airport because the noise measurements that are being used to exclude the Concorde do not adequately recognize the quality of the noise I am a resident of Queens More specifically I am directly under the Whitestone exit from La Guardia Field when the popular runway 13 is used for takeoff and less than onehalf mile from all takeoff traffic when runway 4 is being used runway 22 is almost never used for takeoff Even so I much prefer the constant noise of a a jet to the intermittent rock screaming of my neighbors hifi Which gets me to the point of why the perceivednoisedecibels method of assessing aircraft noise is not realistic Would you prefer a steady one pound force on your head for one minute or a 600 pound whack with a hammer for onetenth of a second So let the Concorde into Kennedy for a dispassionate trial [Editorial March 9] JOHN RYMAN WhiteStone NY March 8 1977 To Site a New School To the Editor We welcome the proposed Fine Arts Center of the Annenberg School of Communications to New Yorks culture row More than a dozen museums art institutions cultural societies and libraries are located here All these could be available to the Annenberg school to bring to the attention of the vast public which is unable to view the collections in person But to be maximally productive doesnt the Annenberg school need a free hand for operation    not hidden away in the southwest wing of the Metropolitan Museum where it will come under the sway of that museums strong leadership Mr Annenberg could provide his wonderful gift the full scope of activity it deserves by housing it in its own building on the three empty lots across from the Metropolitan Museum between 81st and 82d Streets at 1000 Fifth Avenue TOM DRAPER NEW YORK March 9 1977 The writer is secretary Neighborhood Association to preserve Fifth Avenue Housues inc A Dollar for CUNY To the Editor A great many successful teachers lawyers doctors accountants and professional people in all fields of endeavor were provided with solid foundations on which to build their careers at the City University of New York A great many current andI hope future students similarly will be aided by this most valuable institution of learning The thought has occurred to me that if each alumnus and each student of CUNY would send an annual thank you note to the university in the form of a onedollar bill it is just possible that CUNY would not be forced to go begging for the funds it so desperately needs to continue its work in a manner complementary to the dignity it has so justly earned THERESA MFLORIO Brooklyn March 8 1977 To the Editor Your March 2 news report Bishops in Nicaragua Say Troops Kill Civilians in Fighting Leftists contains information which apart from being inexact and distorted grievously offends the reputation of my country and its principal figures It is widely known in international circles that since the coming to power of Fidel Castros Communist regime Nicaragua has been the target of a series of direct aggressions in the form of invasions Men have been armed and trained in Cuba for the purpose of trying to overthrow the constitutional government and seriously damage the nations economy and progress Acts of terrorism and disturbances of the public order have been carried out so as to provoke a reaction from the authorities which would then prompt charges of humanrights violations Your correspondent has recognized that the socalled FSLN is a group of Marxists who have the support of Cuba and who hope to install a Communist regime in Nicaragua These same terrorists after failing to win the support of the peasantry carried out over 61 summary executions of jueces de mesta similar to police magistrates and systematically stormed and pillaged villages in their attempt to retaliate against those villagers whom they suspected of reporting their whereabouts and activities to the authorities As a member of the top council of the FSLN Toms Borge Martinez convicted and selfconfessed murderer and terrorist acknowledged these acts and deaths and accepted collective responsibility for them There is absolutely no truth to the allegation that the Nicaraguan air force has engaged in aerial bombardments of villages and much less have there been air operations by any foreign country as some calumnious reports have stated Nicaragua enjoys full religious freedom We respect the law and human rights and those terrorists who have been captured have been submitted to an impartial and public trial in conformity with these laws The pastoral letter issued by the bishops and referred to in your report above all else condemns violence and calls for respect of law and order ROGER BERMUDEZ B Presidential Press Secretary Government of Nicaraguna Managua Nicaragua March 10 1977 From the Editor The Times information was fully attributed to Nicaraguan Roman Catholic bishops and to documents prepared by church authorities The article prominently noted the denial of the allegations by a spokesman for President Somoza who said that many of the churchs charges were false and that others were exaggerated To the Editor Although I am troubled by the specifics of the Most Reverend Bernardins propositiona constitutional amendment as a solution to the abortion issue [OpEd Feb 26]that is not why I write I am even more troubled by the broader social implications which reside within the philosophical matrix which Archbishop Bernardin has necessarily assumed in order to reach his specific remedy for the abortion issue He would invoke the mechanism of a constitutional amendment to buttress a specific point of viewa view by no means unanimously held in our pluralistic society In fact the polarization here is not between a farout minority and a numerically significant majority It is between two groups not significantly disparate either in number or social composition The polarization exists because we are dealing with a specific issue whether and to what extent a fetus has certain rights which cannot be objectively resolved in either direction This is so because neither the necessary facts nor the relevant ethical value criteria can he objectively defined Thus we have an issue which is really rooted in the realm of theology ethics and metaphysics This does not mean that all issues so rooted cannot be resolved with consensus Essentially all theological and ethical systems  whether they reside in complex or in primitive societywould have little difficulty in accepting the Sixth Commandment as it applies to humans who are alive outside the womb All theological and ethical systems clearly do not agree upon how to resolve the issue of fetal life The constitutional amendment as a solution introduces a serious complication The act of abortion is initiated by one person a woman and that act will physically Impinge upon one person onlythe same woman Traditionally the Constitution and our laws have protected individuals from society or vice versa They have not been concerned with limiting the scope of individual action where others are not affected And now we come to the bottom line With respect to the broader issue we must ask if it is proper under any circumstance that the Constitution be used to impose a constraint upon an individuals freedom of choice particularly when the justification for that constraint cannot be arrived at by any objective procedure With respect to the narrower abortion issue we must ask if the Constitution is the proper medium wherein an Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Church or anyone else may tell any dissenting woman that his theological and ethical and metaphysical constructs are correct and that hers are wrong

and committed for production The White House in making the document available said that it was prepared by a limited number of staff members working with an incomplete collection of campaign statements The White House went on As a result compilation cannot be viewed as exhaustive or in some cases completely accurate The document can be viewed as a rough approximation of some commitments made during the campaign Mr Carter the White House said had not approved the compendium for accuracy so it would not be correct to consider it as a statement by the President of his campaign promises The compilation is properly viewed only as a historical document that had been put together as an internal working guide A Memorandum to Mr Carter accompanying the document said it had been compiled only from written materials available to the issues staff It stated The strength of the various promises naturally varies Some promises indicate only that you will consider taking a certain action others indicate that you support a certain action and others indicate that you will definitely initiate or take certain action The compilation the memorandum said may not completely represent the extent of Mr Carters commitment and in many instances the full extent of his speech or statement must be reviewed to determine the exact strength of the promise In the listing below the citations of

LEGAL MANUAL LISTS RIGHTS OF THE YOUNG,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/20/archives/legal-manual-lists-rights-of-the-young-civil-liberties-lawyer.html,The American Civil Liberties Union has issued a handbook that provides an uptodate directory of laws and court actions dealing with young people The 251page manual The Rights of Young People by Alan N Sussman a Kingston NY lawyer says the Supreme Court has declared that the Bill of Rights was not meant for adults alone In doing so Mr Sussman says the court opened the way for claims for a variety of equal rights for young persons as well as such special rights of children such as that to be free from neglect and abuse In 1973 Mr Sussman writes the United States Supreme Court overturned a Texas law that stated that there was no parental duty to support illegitimate children even though there was a duty to support legitimate children The new handbook is the 15th in a series by the civil liberties organization dealing with different groups It was published last Wednesday as an Avon Books paperback at 150 a copy Mr Sussman is editor of the monthly Childrens Rights Report published by the A C L U Foundation He was formerly an attorney for the New York City Legal Aid Society and an ombudsman for children in institutions under the New York State Division for Youth Rights of Parents Parents generally have such rights he reports as naming their child exercising custody over him receiving his earnings disciplining him without excessive force vetoing his desire to marry or to get a drivers license and determining religious training Parents also generally have the right Mr Sussman goes on to determine his overall style of life which may even include exercising a reasonable degree of control over the friends he keeps the food he eats the entertainment he chooses and the style of his clothes and hair The nationwide surveys show that 18 is the age at which most states hold a child has reached adulthood in the eyes of the law Colorado Mississippi and Pennsylvania still adhere to age 21 and Alabama Nebraska and Wyoming set the age at 19 Mr Sussman reports Many states he writes make parents liable for the willful misconduct of their children but New York in a 1970 law limited parent liability in such cases to 500 New York and some others allow orders to be issued for children to pay restitution for damages or to work to restore property they damage New York law permits children aged 14 to 16 to work after school hours and during vacations and those over 16 outside of school to work full time The states laws contain such quirks as permitting 12yearolds to sell and deliver newspapers but requiring that children be 14 before selling newspapers on streets Various Laws on Working Restrictions in New Yorks laws include barring persons under 21 from working in tunnels and mines or using explosives those under 18 from selling or handling alcoholic beverages and those under 16 from painting or exterior cleaning jobs Although New Yorks minimum wage is 230 an hour Mr Sussman says one law lets employers apply for special permits to pay 30 cents less for certain employees under 18 New York and Idaho prohibit a parent from claiming a childs earnings unless the parent makes a written claim within 30 days after a job starts The wideranging new handbook also reports the following The United States Supreme Court is to rule soon on an Oklahoma law that lets young women buy beer at 18 but that requires young men to be 21 The Supreme Court has ruled that states may not require consent by a girls parents as a condition for abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy but has left open the possibility for states to require some parental consultation Mr Sussman says parents probably cannot legally force a daughter to have an abortion if she refuses Children sent to any institution by court action have a right to treatment as the cornerstone of the entire juvenile justice system and this means affirmative and positive programs to help rehabilitate and counsel them and to meet their needs Adopted children in Connecticut and four other states Alabama Kansas South Dakota and Virginia have a legal right to discover identity of natural parents by inspecting an original birth certificate but only when they reach adulthood In other states original birth certificates are sealed and can only be opened by a court order for good cause such as a showing of fraud However they cannot normally be opened because a child wants to see his records Some communities the handbook says have curfew laws such as San Franciscos ban against children under 18 loitering in a public place between 11 PM and 6 AM The books also notes that Mississippi is the only state that does not have a compulsory education law and that New York State requires schooling until the age of 16 17 in New York City unless at 15 a student cannot profit from further education and is working full time
The World,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/20/archives/the-world-in-summary-pakistan-voters-have-elected-only-trouble-why.html,In Summary Pakistan Voters Have Elected Only Trouble A political stalemate has developed in Pakistan over the oppositions refusal to accept the result of this months elections which they charge were rigged Even some officials of the regime admit there were malpractices in the ballot counting and as a result the democracy that the Prime Minister Zulfikar All Bhutto had said was symbolized by the vote appears in jeopardy Evidently embarrassed by the political uproar over the charges against his regime and concerned about the potential for violence Mr Bhutto at first offered political concessions but then ordered the arrest of the leaders of the main opposition group the Pakistan National Alliance including former Air Marshal Asghar Khan the most popular opposition figure Troops were used to restore order after mobs Mr Bhuttos strategy was to persuade some of the opposition parties to go along with his plan to conduct reviews of the national election results and then to repeal the balloting for the countrys four provincial assemblies So far however the opposition remains united in demanding that Mr Bhutto resign and that all the elections be repeated The result is political uncertainty which the Government fears if it continues too long could lead the army to return to the dominant role it last occupied in Pakistan in 1971 when Mr Bhutto came to power The election fiasco has caused many thoughtful Pakistanis to question whether democracy is at all adaptable to an underdeveloped country where poverty and illiteracy are pervasive Perhaps some Pakistanis say hopefully India where an election was also held last week will provide a more positive example of democracy in action The results will not be known until tomorrow In India too the incumbent Prime Minister Mrs Indira Gandhi is facing an unexpectedly strong challenge from an aggressive opposition that is newly united Mrs Gandhis Congress Party has had a monopoly on power since independence was gained from Britain 30 years ago but it has never won more than 50 percent of the popular vote in a national election This has always led theorists to the conclusion that if the opposition could ever pull together it could win This year the opposition Janata Party does appear to have united The issue on which the previously divergent factions have joined is the harsh emergency rule of the last 19 months and the role of the Prime Ministerand to a lesser extent that of her son Sanjay in it Why They March in Italy Students have rioted again In Italy a country where anything from abortion reform to the acts of foreign governments to an opening night performance at La Scala can bring angry youth into the streets The killing of a student in Bologna was the catalyst for last weeks violence but as in previous riots there is an underlying causefrustration produced by overcrowding and poor instruction at Italian universities and the growing number of graduates who are unable to find jobs Despite promises of reform after the student unrest of 1968 successive Italian governments confronting nationwide economic decline and political crises have left the university structures essentially unchanged Thus overcrowded lecture halls and education by exam are still the rule in most institutions The only government reformopening enrollment to all qualified students in 1973 to give poorer youths access to higher eduationmerely exacerbated the situation the University of Rome built to educate 40000 students now has an enrollment of 150000 More than 70000 new graduates will be looking for jobs in Italy this year Only 30 percent will find them Amendment on Chrome Is Over The Carter Administration has succeeded in its campaign for Congressional repeal of the Byrd amendment a measure that since 1971 has allowed the United States to import Rhodesian chrome in violation of United Nations sanctions While last weeks vote should increase Washingtons standing among the black African nations sup porting black majority rule for Rhodesia in the absence of a broader new United States diplomatic initiative its effect on the white minority regime in Salisbury may be limited The Government of Ian D Smith the Rhodesian Prime Minister has 11 years of experience in eluding trade sanctions often diverting exports to third parties who then resell the commodities to countries nominally ob serving sanctions China North Korea and the Soviet Union have apparently bought Rhodesian chrome through such intermediaries with the Russiansthe United States major supplier of chrome even during the Byrd amendment periodon occasion exporting the ore to American companies The Rhodesians acknowledge that they may have to cut the price of their ore already discounted from world market levels by 40 to 50 percent But with the price sufficiently low they believe from past experience there will always be someone who will buy For the United States where industry until recently had lobbied against tampering with the Byrd amendment a factor in the repeal was the recent decline in the countrys imports of Rhodesian orefrom 11 percent in 1975 to less than 3 percent last year Among the reasons for the decline were technological advances that permit the use of lower grade nonRhodesian chrome and a consequent diversification of suppliers large stockpiles and the depressed status of the major United States market for chrome the stainless steel industry Frances Center Isnt Holding The governing centerright of France weakened by a growing leadership contest between President Valery Giscard dEstaing and Jacques Chirac the former Prime Minister has lost a number of contests to leftists in municipal elections While the results confirm that the CommunistSocialist alliance can often beat the center and right at the local level they do not necessarily imply a leftist victory in nationwide parliamentary elections clue within a year In last weeks voting the leftists who already had controlled the governments of 130 of Frances large cities took 33 more The centerright added only 3 to the 90 cities they had held But while a Communist or Socialist mayor is obviously plausible to many French voters they might be more hesitant about supporting a national government of the left Municipal election results also cannot be translated into a nationwide trend because of the large number of abstentions in such voting about 30 percent last week more than usual in parliamentary elections In addition French parliamentary districts are to some extent gerrymandered so that in a national election the left would need 54 or 55 percent of the total votes cast nationwide to win a bare majority in Parliament Still the leftist challenge is taken seriously by the centerright Mr Chirac quit Mr Giscard dEstaings Cabinet last year partly because he favored a more direct attack on the left The former Prime Minister who faces a runoff election today for the Paris mayoralty controls the largest bloc in the Governments parliamentary majority and has left open the possibility of trying to force early national elections Mr Chiracs apparent thinking is that it is better to face the leftists now because they might grow even stronger Even if the leftists win according to this strategy they would be unable to resolve Frances economic problems10 percent annual inflation and a million unemployedand Mr Chiracs newly revived Gaullist party would win in ensuing elections Soldiers Coming Home Vietnam has delivered to a United States Presidential commission the bodies of 12 American airmen killed in the Indochina war a somber act with political meaning it is likely to help provide a foundation for normal relations between Washington and Hanoi The Administration of Gerald Ford took the position that negotiations on normal relations could not occur until Hanoi complied with Washingtons demands for a fuller accounting of the fate of 2400 American servicemen still officially missing after the war President Carter however has taken a more conciliatory attitude and sent the special commission headed by Leonard Woodcock president of the United Auto Workers to Hanoi last week The return of the bodies and the friendly reception given the delegation by Prime Minister Pham Van Dong and other Vietnamese officials has raised the serious possibility both sides have begun to put the longstanding bitterness of war behind them Mr Carters status as a newly elected President has helped give him the freedom to maneuver where President Ford seeking support from conservative Republicans could not Mr Carter has also been helped by a Congressional report that suggested that Hanoi never was in a position to answer previous demands about the missing servicemen According to the report many of those missing were lost in such places as the open sea unknown to the Vietnamese Thomas Butson and Barbara Slavin
The trouble at Sarah Lawrence,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/20/archives/the-trouble-at-sarah-lawrence-sarah-lawrence.html,On the fall night in 1954 when I arrived Sarah Lawrence College threw my Bermuda shorts and gold circle pin into the wastebasket and changed into my leotard and jeans my mother called She was crying She had been to a cocktail party and met a wellknown columnist who told her there were no virgins on the Sarah Lawrence campus How times have changed Recently the development office received a letter from an alumna in San Francisco who was distressed by the rumor that the campus is now 50 percent homosexual I have recently been back to my old college talking to the administration faculty and students and there is no doubt in my mind that the 50 percent figure is ridiculous Nor I feel is there anything more than loose talk to the estimate floating about the campus that 30 percent of the women students are lesbiaris Charles DeCarlo the college president believes that 5 to 10 percent would be more accurateabout the same as current estimates of the proportion of homosexuals male and female in the population at large What has happened he says is that this small group has magnified the issue on the campus by taking center stage Yet so visible and vocal are the adherents of lesbianismor bisexuality as they prefer to call at Sarah Lawrence today that the issue has be come a cause celebre among teachers and students alike It has created confusions tensions and conflicts beyond anything in the schools recent experience It is scaring off applicants and there is a danger that word of mouth about it among alumnae and others in the educational and business communities may affect the colleges ability to raise the funds it needs to maintain its high academic standards The weeks I have just spent at the college however convince me that the emergence of homosexuality into the full light of day as a professedly viable alternative for young women and men not the essence but the byproduct of the problem at Sarah Lawrence The root problemanguishing precisely because there is much that is right on both sides of the issueis a collision between the womens movement on campus in which the lesbians form a small minority and the administrations efforts to proceed from token to full coeducation In part the conflict traces back to when the college began admitting male students in the late 1960s The mennow close to 20 percent of the student enrollment of 635came to dominate the classrooms and lake over positions of authority A feminist backlash fostered by some members of the faculty not only reclaimed the power lost to the men but subjected the campus to a far more strongly feminist atmosphere than had existed before the men arrived All the fiercer therefore the resistance to any change in the character of the college that would necessarily reduce the feminists influence and role And all the more militant the solidarity with anythingincluding lesbianism that champions the right of women to explore their natures preferences and potentials in their own way More generally the tensions at Sarah Lawrence arc an outgrowth of the reassessment of traditional male and female roles through which American society is passing College campuses are often barometers of what is going on less obviously the whole country Other womens collegesincluding those like Vassar Bennington and Connecticut College that have also taken the plunge into coeducationhave experienced similar strains may he that the trouble at Sarah Lawrence is more acute because its students have always thought themselves as avantgarde game for more extreme individualism and greater risk of pain The crisis of identity at Sarah Lawrence today however is of a kind that is particularly difficult for young people in their most Vulnerable years to cope with The question is what the college can do to work its way out of the predicament that threatens its reputation stability and morale For the average student at Sarah Lawrencebright privileged with a view of life shaped by progressive political outlook and exposure to the liberal artsthe administrations decision in 1968 to admit seven males on a trial basis was a welcome step The principles on which the womens colleges had been founded were giving way nationally to a preference for the benefits of coeducation and most of the girls at Sarah Lawrence looked forward to a better social environment for themselves as the change took hold It did not work out that way As male schools in the Northeast began to go coeducational the men from Yale Princeton and Dartmouth cut down on their weekend treks to Sarah Lawrence and such group socializing with boys as mixers and weekend excursions began to lose their popularity The Sarah Lawrence campus which used to be empty on weekends began to be filled with girls with no place to go A general sense of loneliness and isolation set in In theory there was all the variety and excitement of New York half an hours train ride away But New York to many of the girls meant their parents homes a place they did not associate with weekend fun and to others without friends in tht city New York was an emotional Sahara As for the boys at Sarah Lawrence there were still too few of them for easy relationships A freshman girl from Englewood NJ told me This place really freaks me out I act so peculiar around guys like I was in the eighth grade or something and had never talked to one before Theres so much competition you really have to do something to stand out Another girl said Everyone around knows if you see an interesting guy on campus hes either got a girl on his arm or a purse on his shoulder A somewhat older female student said over a cup of coffee at the Pub the student coffee house God its so embarrassing I talked to a guy in front of me in line at the bookstore the other day and I realized he thought I was trying to pick him up He thought I was being too aggressive I apologized to him Its awful that you cant act naturally and be friendly in a human way In a Greek history and literature class when the professor asked What is fate a boy one of four in the class of 18 stopped twirling the locks of his matted hair and said Isnt it those women buzz Most girls at Sarah Lawrence shrink from that kind of buzzing And although some of the men who tend to be nonconformists glory in the abundance of available women many of them give every sign of being somewhat overwhelmed by the concentration of competent expressive females and their implicit sexual and emotional demands There is a kind of vicious cycle at work With so many girls to choose from it becomes harder for young men who may be slower to mature anyway to form satisfying relationships which leads to further feminine recoil and the girls who corn pete for the few available men feel bad about themselves if they fail as most of them must fail given the pre It is easy to say that all this has little to do with the principal reason for going to collegereceiving a higher educationbut the fact is that in this country going to college has traditionally been linked with participating in a social milieu that can shape future career and marriage In earlier days the doctrine of in loco parentis under which the college ad ministration acted as surrogate parent was so allembracing that in some colleges in President DeCarlos words it meant management of everything from manner to matchmaking The retreat from the parental role forced on colleges by student pressure in the 1960s leaves the students responsible for creating their own social communities and making their own decisions about such matters as drugs and sex and work and treating 17 and 18yearolds as grownups in the European tradition may be a good thing But it does mean that after 5 oclock the close relationship between students and faculty comes to a sudden stop and the students are left on their own At Sarah Lawrence as the crisis developed the withdrawal of adult guidance and social arrangements made the confusions all the harder to In this supercharged atmosphere the feminist reaction to dominating males exploded with irresistible force There was no other issue to stand in its way The civilrights movement was moribund the antiwar cause a distant memory religious revival passe At last there was something to draw young women together in an experience of shared fulfillment affecting not only their personal lives but their need for an outlet for their youthful idealism A womens studies program funded in 1973 encouraged its women students to discover their bodies to express their sexual feelings openly and to form bonds of mutual support as they reexamined all aspects of womens natures social roles and relationships to men With Marx Jesus and social justice receding as saviors of mankind all hopes for a new world were placed The lesbian faction of this womens movement makes its appeal on two planes The first is biological Lonely and loveless students who cannot find heterosexual partners for the love dramas that form the closing phase of adolescence are forced by the proud and open talk of the bisexual alternative to question and justify their own sexual orientation The second plane is political The lesbian choice is presented as an expression of radical political and social thought and often it is difficult for the young student to reject these claims without seeming to be a reactionary coward Indelicate as they may be graffiti on powderroom walls can be sociologically revealing One wall had this to say I am a homosexual virgin who needs a 9 badly Dont worry itll happen soon enough Right on Thanks for the support Anytime Room What makes one gay Its kind of hard being gay Out of fad or actuality The administrations response to this situation is an uneasy one With the end of the schools parental role says DeCarlo the students sexual activities are not the schools concern The students are old enough to lead their own lives and he says in all such matters it is difficult to tell from their talk how much is real and how much is braggadocio Yet he admits to being appalled by some of the posturing that goes on What once might have been a youthful fantasy of brief experimentation with homosexual feelings and which would have been integrated in a normal growth toward adulthood is now objectified made public and related to political and quasiintellectual movements The director of admissions Sandra Feig worries that young students often do make sexual choices in accordance with ly fashionable rather than in harmony with their emotional needs The declared lesbians on campus emphasize that they dont try to pressure anyone to become homosexual or bisexual But the process may be more subtle than that There is probably very little active proselytizing and certainly no coercion by homosexuals at Sarah Lawrence or any other college At the same time the very existence of a cohesive open homosexual group and its vocal political philosophy presents each student with the need to take some attitude toward it in a sense to make an active choice that never entered most peoples heads in more covert days At a time of life when sexual feelings run high and in a community with little opportunity to meet with the opposite sex there comes to be a kind of pull toward homosexual ex Whatever the strength of this pull there is plentiful evidence of distressing divisions on the subject among the women students Several freshmen told me of having been frightened during orientation week when they were greeted by two young women with shaved heads who walked arm in arm Some girls have probably turned to sexualized female friendships for most the taboos against such experimentation have clearly remained in force Yet given the feminist mandate for the right of women to make their choices few would dude  or at least state openlythat such experimentation is wrong In a recent selfrating test only 6 percent of the female freshmen thought homosexual relations at the college should be prohibitedcompared with 46 percent of students nationwide I would suspect that many girls who feel threatened and upset by the open homosexual behavior accepted by the Sarah Lawrence community are at the same time ashamed of their reaction A freshman from the Middle West told me Its really weird here Girls check you out I dont know where to look It makes me feel so creepy My roommate and went to this party and girls were making out together on the couch There were only five boys there and they were all taken This girl asked me to dance I didnt want to say no but afterward I went back to room and cried A similar effect is noticeable among the young men Many of them had already been somewhat intimidated by the feminist backlash You have to be careful not to say anything that seems chauvinist or egocentric a sophomore told me Another a young poet complained of the difficulties of being a male poet on a campus where Ann Sexton and Sylvia Plath are goddesses Exposed to the same pressures as the females to question their own sexual identities some males try to escape from the attendant anxieties and confusions by acting like studs Others spout feminist jargon the way a converted bourgeois spouted Marxism in the 1930s Said one young man I like being at a womans school understanding a womans perspective I was in love with a gay woman and she and this place have really helped me to see how my culture had prejudiced me against women My gay friend learned to trust me even It would be a mistake of course to exaggerate the scale and importance of these emotional dislocations There are many students of both sexes who dont feel overwhelmed at all One very outgoing young girl said Anybody whos lonely here just isnt trying All my friends are boys Thats the way its been all my life Moreover as DeCarlo says Loneliness and dissatisfaction with the social situation are the common complaints on college campuses today  springing to some extent from the general character of American life [and] the reaction to it of bright young people Also it is a part of growing up in some sense to solve this problem is to begin building a solid framework for the mature life One New York psychoanalyst who has been treating Sarah Lawrence students for 20 years contends that they are not much different from young people anywhere except that the psychic pain of their endofadolescence turmoil is more It should also be emphasized that the level of academic work at Sarah Lawrence appears to he extraordinarily high The theater and dance classes are deeply involving and productive Students in these departments seem dedicated to what they are learning and how they are learning it The science department amazed me with its graduate statistics Twentyout of last years 25 medical  school applicants were accepted at topranking schools on the medical boards they scored in the 98th percentile of all students nationally in verbal ability In 1957 when I graduated the science department had half a dozen students and barely a bunsen burner Todays labs are crowded and well equipped Law schools and anthropology and psychology graduate departments have found Sarah Lawrence students to be highscoring well prepared educated and motivated These students have won dozens of fellowships for graduate study The high academic standards provide many of the cope with loneliness and social void the administration it seems to me should take the initiative in forming new social structures It could try to make some formal connections with schools with more men than women It could encourage young faculty families to live on the campus Older faculty could dine with students to help calm the turbulent atmosphere Giving up being a substitute parent need not amount to abdicating all responsibility As for the lesbian issue it might be possible without reversing the sexual revolution or infringing on anyones civil rights to suggest an effort to control the visibility of homosexual activity so that the campus can again attract some of the students who are now frightened off There is an important difference between discretion and repression A little hypocrisy here might be in the service of institutional survival These admittedly are palliatives The underlying problem is that Sarah Lawrence flounders halfway between being a girls school and a coeducational institution A feminist movement that could accommodate itself more naturally to either educational philosophy takes on embattled and distorted forms Bow this problem will be solved however is difficult to predict A real deadlock exists The feministcontrolled Student Senate reflecting the separatist phase in which the womens movement now finds itself nationally voted last spring for a return to the schools clear mission and identity as a singlesex college Within the womens studies program there is strong feeling that DeCarlo should be replaced by a female president and that there should be an infusion of feminism into all courses and fields of study DeCarlo on the other hand would like to turn Sarah Lawrence into fully coeducational college with a more neutral name and to reduce the feminist I came away from my visit to Sarah Lawrence feeling that a majority of the students want true coeducation on a 5050 basis and that the homosexual issue will tend to fade when new and currently unpredictable social issues arise For one thing it is probably inevitable that young people with an elite heritage of questioning everything would be in the forefront in questioning the rigidities of sexual roles For another homosexuality on the part of older students with an outlet for their energies and commitments easier and more satisfying social possibilities will just have to wait One transfer student told me Im getting the best education in the world Here everybody talks and thinks about whats going on in their classes At Stony Brook where I was nobody talked or thought even in class Now Im just working and later after I graduate Ill resolve my social problems have lots of friends on this campus who are bisexual but thats just not my solution so Ill wait Another woman student said I was so upset after my freshman year here I transferred to a Midwestern university But I came back The education here is finally worth anything This sense of wider intellectual opportunities at Sarah Lawrence is shared by many of the young men who feel they otherwise would have been limited to more banal and routine institutions A charming premed student said When I was at Willamette College out West everyone talked about things money or sports Here everyone tells you how they feel whats inside Its heavy but exciting Sarah Lawrence has been a great place for me Despite the troubled atmosphere the dropout rate at Sarah Lawrence is 15 percentabout Still there is no minimizing the potential effect of the trouble on the schools future Even though DeCarlo has brought the tuition to within 200 of competitors among the Ivy League schools the applicant pool has been drying up Sarah Lawrence which in 1957 turned down three out of every four applicants now has an acceptance rate of 85 percent Some of this of course is traceable to the drop in applications experienced by all womens colleges as coeducation became the thing in the late 1960s but a good part is doubtless attributable to the reports of lonely campus life and a high degree of homosexuality Visiting highschool seniors as well as parents I have spoken to have been upset to see women necking openly Other womens colleges have been able to remain considerably more selective because their applicant pools have remained larger Vassar Bennington and Connecticut College report acceptance figures of 50 percent 50 percent and 48 percent respectively Wellesley which did not go coed has a 49 percent rate If males were excluded from Sarah Lawrence the admissions office told me there would be a financial crisis because of a lack of women waiting to fill the vacancies that would What then Is to be done To help women students campus minonties is nothing new anywhere Harold Taylor who was president of Sarah Lawrence in the 1950s remembers a scandal in which the leader of a homosexual group was expelled Those were the days when none of us understood the workings of our bodies and the social meaning of our fenutleness and when all sexual activity was devious and underground I well remember the shock I felt when a friend on campus nearly bled to death from an illegal abortion For all Its excesses and disturbances I prefer the openness and selfof todays However I do believe that the womens movement working in tandem with the sexual revolution has placed a severe burden on young women students by making the choice of sexual identity a feminist requirement in a world as free and open as ours It begins to be a situation filled with deep inner terrors in which psyches spin and whirl finding no limits to provide definition and afford unity and rest As Dr Arnold Cooper professor of psychiatry at Cornell University Medical College puts it An openly active homosexual environment is a relatively new phenomenon in the world of adolescence There is some reason to be concerned that such an environment will make more difficult the course of sexual development for certain particularly vulnerable young people Few intelligent persons would today infringe upon the right of the homosexual to follow his or her own course with a consenting adult Equally however most agree that it is no advantage to be homosexual in this world whether it is called illness or not and those who may not wish to be homosexual should be afforded a quiet unpressured opportunity to find themselves Nothing is going to make the end of adolescence easy or graceful for any group on any campus But the malefemale ratio at Sarah Lawrence today is unworkable Just as there can be no return to the hypocritical codes of the past so the expulsion of the males already on campus seems a feminist distemper In spite of the difficulty of recruiting males and at the cost of some dampening of feminist zeal Sarah Lawrence must go forward to a more normal coeducational environment so that everyone can have at least a decent crack at having a broken heart In a less an Many of the men give every sign of being overwhelmed by the concentration of competent expressive females and their implicit sexual and emotional demands Anne Roiphe is a journalist and the author Torch Song and other novels In a time of confusion over sexual identity a womens college pays the penalty of being avantgarde
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/21/archives/letters-on-the-annenberg-offer-to-the-museum-to-talk-to-the.html,To the Editor The Times editorial [March 17] regarding Walter Annenbergs extraordinarily generous offer of 40 million to the Metropolitan Museum to complete its building program and to establish and operate for a tenyear period a Fine Arts Center contains serious factual errors which if corrected largely eliminate the troublesome issues referred to All of these were addressed fully at a public hearing attended by the press before the Manhattan Borough Board on March 14 First as to the amount of space within the proposed Southwest Wing to be occupied by the Fine Arts Center the proportion is 52 percent not 75 percent as the editorial stated and if one includes the Garden Court also to be funded by this gift the center constitutes only one third of the total space The second issue as to who would support the center after the initial tenyear period simply doesnt exist At that time either the Annenberg School would continue its support for a further period or the center as such would cease to function and the space revert to the museum for such other use as it desired Further the editorial makes the extraordinary statement that under Mr Hoving the Met has already moved beyond its traditional function of exhibiting original works of art Into the area of education and asks how far this movement should go Among the major purposes set forth in the museums charter is encouraging and dedeveloping the study or the fine arts  advancing the general knowledge of kindred subjects and    furnishing popular instruction In fact education on all levels has been an active function of the Metropolitan since the turn of the century and the museum has made use of film and related visual materials for over forty years Finally and most importantly the editorial repeats as fact the totally unsupported statement of a few misinformed individuals that Mr Annenbergs offer represents  a trade by which he or the Annenberg School of Communication g would get some undisclosed benefits in return Let me make it unequivocally clear that no Irade of any sort was ever involved The museum has never been asked to agree to anything in return except to make available office and public space in the new wing needed for this joint educational undertaking Mr Annenbergs concept for a Fine Arts Center at the Metropolitan is an idea whose time has come It deserves more accurate and deliberate consideration than it has received President The Metropolitan Museum of Art New York March 18 1977 DOUGLAS DILLOI To Talk to the President To the Editor By all reports the recent TalktothePresident program was a great success and was highly acclaimed by everybody One hopes this excellent idea will be repeated from time to time Millions Pat Warner of people including myself were disappointed not to be able to get their questions to the President Perhaps it would be a good idea in the future to have interested parties write in their names telephone numbers and any other information required to verify their identity There could then be some sort of lottery or drawing by which the parties could be selected It seems to me that such a procedure would cause fewer disappointments and save many telephone calls The details of such a procedure of course would have to be worked out by the experts I do not think that this would affect in any way the spontaneity of the project as the lottery could preselect more individuals than would actually be called but it would certainly narrow the field Jackson Heights NY March 11 1977 K ROBERT WILHEIM Concorde Only by Test at the Locale    To the Editor As the Federal EPAs former deputy assistant administrator for noise control and a consultant in environmental matters I commend The Times for the March 9 editorial The Battle of Concorde Your support for a test at JFK is rational and well stated Recent court decisions in California have given judicial agreement to position that some knowledgeable individuals have long held as to the difference between realworld conditions and those hypothesized by mathematicalprediction models of noise effects That finding held that location of persons within a predicted noiseeffect zone was not the determining factor as to existence of injury or harmful conditions but rather that proof of actual impact was Thus some individuals living in predicted impact zones were denied damages and some outside such contours were granted damages Only by a test at the locale in question in this case JFK can the reality be determined Since there continue to be disputes between the FAA and the EPA arising out of the complex and openended arrangements in the Noise Control Act of 1972 and because of the extreme nature of views on both sides of this question The Times proposal for a common approach to the test is excellent This is what was done on the first demonstration flight of the Concorde from Dallas to Dulles and on to Paris several years ago It takes some careful planning and leadership Nonetheless it has been proven that FAA EPA Sierra Club Natural Resources Defense Council airlines etc can get together and work on such deal I hope the initiative proposed by The Times is favorably acted uponand soon z New York March 9 1977 ALVIN F MEYER JI Crime These Are Times for Public Rage To the Editor As a 22yearold whose parents are survivors of the Holocaust the Jewish experience during World War II the camps the deaths all of it have been my heritage and I have always been deeply aware of the suffering of the millions of people in the world at that time The thing that has always puzzled me however has simply been How could it all have happened I realize that conditions of war suspension of any authority or civilized rules created a climate where savagery was legitimate but I have never been fully able to comprehend how or why human beings could actually commit such horrendous crimes against other human beings Inherited antiSemitism notions of Aryan supremacy anger at the Versailles Treaty are all only glib explanations for the motives but these are not the factors that can really push a person beyond the brink and make him capable of destroying another On Friday March 11 I learned the reason A 20yearold woman nine months pregnant was raped and thrown into a burning furnace Suddenly it was the Holocaust againand worse No conditions of war exist no motive can even be guessed at A mother and an unborn childthe fulfillment of the dreams of parents and the expectations of the human racethe very symbol of its continuity and struggle for survival Society is silent The public has simply become indifferent there are just so many horror stories and shocks that can be absorbed Just recently over 150 people were held hostage with their lives in the control of others and we were silent An 80yearold woman dies after being beaten and thrown downstairs by a 12yearold boy and we are all quiet The immediate relatives suffer and they mourn but what we do not realize is that these are occasions for public mourning These are times for public rage for angry demonstrations and for a public condemnation of such magnitude that it will bring about change I refuse to accept that we are all too brutalized to care about the destruction of others and to fight against the total demolition of any value or concern for human life refuse to believe that we are no longer capable of caring Where is the rage we had at Vietnam Where are the people who fought for unions for civil rights who built this nation Hasnt the time come for every single person to shout EnoughIt is simply enough I am haunted by the memory of Rachel Brecher but the specter of public that does not give a damn is even more haunting and frightening It is in fact the explanation and the reason for any holocaust of any kind at any time Brooklyn March 15 1977 SHELLEY BERGEF To the Editor Poor Mr Annenberg So generous and disinterested He offers New Yorkers an extension of the same wonderful policy that turned tlitt Metropolitan Museum into a circus and supermarket and some of us protest We who love the museum dont want this socalled education center We wonder about beautiful things languishing in the storerooms like the Bishop collection of jades which has not been on view for many years We note that the mausoleum known as the Lehman pavilion and other flashy acquisitions brought crowds but did not prevent the curtailment of museum hours or the increase in suggested contribution from zero to 250 We would like to limit the number of gimcracks for sale we think that more may not always be more AnnenbergHoving Inc say all this is pro bono publico We the public have a different view of what is good Hail to City Councilman Carter Burden Councilwoman Carol Greitzer and Council President Paul ODwyer for opposing the Metropolitan supermarket May all city officials do likewise Mr Annenberg thinks he is threatening us with his suggesion of transferring  his center to another city This is not a threat it is a promise which he ought to keep New York March 15 1977 ANNALEE GOLD To the Editor Uninformed or misinformed I may be but pleased I am that the Metropolitan Museum of Art will not be turned into some sort of electronic kitsch factory Never did I think that I would end up thanking Walter Annenberg or agreeing with Carter Burden but now I do An informed thank you Mr Annenberg for keeping your forty millions of dollars to yourself New York March 16 1977 DAVID 0 STRICKLAND Of Ballots and Morality To the Editor Mr Dujacks March 14 letter regarding a constitutional amendment against abortion suggests the view that unless there is unanimity on an ethical issue it is not a proper topic for such amendment Would he say that about an amendment proposed against all capital punishment About the 13th Amendment against slavery which Mississippi rejected Or about the 21st Amendment which repealed the 18th Amendment The 19th  Amendment giving women their vote was rejected by Georgia South Carolina Delaware Mississippi Louisiana and Virginia I would hold that all these were moral as well as political issues If the advocates of abortion on demand as Mr Dujack appears to be are really the majority why are they unwilling to have their position put to the ballottest That is the democratic and constitutional method Msgr Bayside NY March 14 1977 FRANCIS B DONNELLY Living Underground To the Editor From the evidence of Professor Rainwaters achievements he has obviously made a remarkable contribution to the pool of human knowledge However his statement letter March 14 on the benefits of work and life underground leave me shaken lest the kind of thinking he exhibits become a reality His logic fails to take into account the tradeoffs in lifes affairs We may save energy but lose our naturebound souls It seems the world of the physicist is to envision humans as robots to be tolerated at least costfor we are to go to school and work and I suppose eat lunch have an evening cocktail and dinner entertain ment and so to bed all underground and be blessed by saving energy The sun trees flowers the cloudfleckedsky the gentle rain can be dispensed with This is not far from deciding that poets are useless as nonproductive energy users and so are philosophers and artists The price is far too high for the loss is more than the absence of an interaction with nature it is a loss of freedom imprisoning the spirit If this be the future I am glad my remaining years will not see it Prof Hofstra University Hempstead March 15 1977 FREDERICK A WHITEHOUSE

Feminists Troop to an Old Battleground For Victory Toast on NOW's 10th Year,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/25/archives/feminists-troop-to-an-old-battleground-for-victory-toast-on-nows.html,The New York chapter of the National Organization for Women will celebrate its 10th anniversary tonight in a bar that once refused a drink to feminist named Betty Friedan It was known as the Mens Bar of the Biltmore Hotel in those days but then the courts found the title discriminatory so now its the plain old Biltmore Bar And among those expected to be bending elbows there tonight in the woodpaneled room hung with sporting scenes and faded nudes are Betty Friedan Gloria Steinem Bella Abzug and Karen DeCrow among others Theyll be singing Bread and Roses they say and all the songs of sisterhood There may even be a cheer for the Biltmore Certainly the planners of the party spoke well of the hotel the other day Theyre giving us the bar and baking us a birthday cake for 600 said Victoria Pellegrino public relations chairman This is really nice of the Biltmore because remember we fought them for years At the same time NOWNY was fighting on other fronts too Targets in its ongoing battle for sex equality have ranged from advertising agencies to Wall Street brokerage houses Tactics have varied from class action lawsuits to sitins to socalled zap actions One bank was said to have been zapped for exmple when members opened 3 accounts then closed them en masse to protest the lack of a woman vice president All of this would not lead one to suspect that businesses that have been past targets of the chapter would celebrate its anniversary But the dinner guest list shows that at least one target in an ongoing court case WABCTV has a 200 table reserved in its name Early Picketing Recalled Chalking it up to raised corporate consciousness Carole De Saram former chapter president laughed and said Well theyre learning that its good business to do business with feminists It wasnt always so Jacqueline Ceballos recalls picketing for equalemployment opportunities in front of midtown offices and getting a decidedly different reception They spit on us in those days said Mrs Ceballos an early chapter president who went on to start a public relations business They yelled Go home and cook for your children and care for your children  Still the feminists marched And despite an early stormy period marked by such controversies as the gaystraight splitthe chapter grew from 75 members to todays 1000 It sent out shoots to Brooklyn the Bronx Staten Island and the surrounding suburbs And because NOWNY was headquartered in Manhattan heart of the publishing advertising communications and brokerage businesses these areas became a prime concern But what was most distinctive about NOWNY according to Betty Friedan its most famous founder was enormous imagination and verveNew York verve They had some wonderful stunts she said with a throaty laugh To dramatize the Aug 26 march down Fifth Avenue I remember they took over the Statue of Liberty and put big pink banner on the statue It said Women of the World Unite  That was back in 1970 a time when stunts were needed if the womens movement was to be noticed And NOW made news at other landmarks around town To name a few 41The Plaza In a 1969 challenge to what was then a menonly policy at the Oak Room members sneaked through the bar and seized a table only to have a waiter pull it out from under them But we just sat there a veteran of this campaign recalled and the men around us fed us bread and butter and finally the Plaza changed its policy Madison Avenue After picketing against such ad campaigns as Hi Im CherylFly Me a NOW committee headed by Midge Kovacs went on to create a public service campaign about womens rights It received the endorsement of the Advertising Council in 1970 Lines such as Hire Him Hes Got Great Legs passed into the language of feminism and the ads ran in 50 states Wall Street NOW members posing as Long Island garden club members to gain entry into the American Stock Exchange gallery succeeded in stopping the ticker for seven minutes in 1971 By waving a 25foot high Woman Power

Patricks Cathedral where a woman in a coffin symbolized the call for the right to abortion Central Park where they took part in a Wo mens Walk Against Rape and FAO Schwarz where they protested childcare funding cuts with the theme Kids Need More Than Toys As NOWNY enters its second decade there is talk that zap actions and even court actions on behalf of individual women subjected to sex bias may not be as necessary Meanwhile new issues such as rape and wifebeatingcrimes only whis pered about in the early days of the chapterhave become priorities Years ago said Mrs De Sarem the last thing youd tell anyone was that your husband beat you or that you were raped Even in our chapter going on the rape committee was an admission you were raped No one said it it was just a feeling Now people go on television and talk about being raped This is positive stuff NOW demonstrators at Statue of Libert y in 1970 and the sign at what used to be the   s Bar at the Biltmore TiGrace Atkinson

A Special Number For Women Only,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/27/archives/new-jersey-weekly-a-special-number-for-women-only-glassboro-hotline.html,MANY women dont avail themselves of the opportunities for which they are eligible said Patricia Q Sheehan Commissioner of the states Department of Community Affairs For women in remote areas there is a need to find services that are close by In urban centers people are often forgotten or overlooked You cant get services you need if you dont know whom to call Today there is someone to call24 hours a day seven days a weekbecause the Department of Community Affairs has available a tollfree hotline 8003228092 The phone is answered by one of 40 volunteers from Together Inc a nonprofit organization based on the Glassboro State College campus The volunteers are equipped with stacks of reference material to help women in need of information or referrals embracing a variety of subjects The group doesnt pretend to solve the problem Commissioner Sheehan said But hopefully it will direct people to the right service or agency A second purpose of the hotline is to gather data on womens needs that are not being met with present resources If 700 women call about the same problem and we have nowhere to send them well know we are lacking in that area and will consider this in planning our future the Commissioner said Glassboro State College is administering the 18978 grant that the Division on Women allotted for the hotline The volunteers students and middleaged women who live in the community are trained by Together Inc Using a central log book the volunteers enter the time and date of each call the type of problem the estimated age of the caller if possible and the source to which they referred the caller Since the line was installed more than 1200 calls have been logged according to Paul Taylor director of the hotline service They have been mostly about employment education and careers Together Inc has plenty of past experience with hotlines Its own begun in 1970 and funded by the Department of Health Education and Welfare initially attracted callers asking for drug rape and abortion counseling rather than referrals But then we began to see that drug problems for instance were often a symptom of other problems Mr Taylor recalled We added the referral service and began assembling information on where people could go for birthcontrol clinics venereal disease treatment and to have an abortion The new hotline is not meant to be a counseling service however if a caller seems frustrated and just wants to rap volunteers are trained to listen for awhile and then explain that the line is for referrals They then suggest that the person call the local counseling Glassboro Hotline Is a Referral Service hotline Referral calls are limited to three minutes if possible Since we started weve had calls about everything Mr Taylor said There have been medical and legal problems tenant and welfare referrals how to get food stamps A lot are from women who want to go back to school We might refer them to the local womens center or local college where they can get careertesting and placement Women calling with career questions might be referred to Working Woman an employmentcounseling service or VEST Volunteer Employment Service Team Most people dont know that there is now a womans specialist in each of the 32 state employment offices Mr Taylor said These counselors are attuned to the special needs of women and informed about positions of interest to women Together Inc volunteers have all this information literally at their fingertips On shelves behind the desks in the hotline phone room are sheafs of directories manuals and books that are constantly being updated This is a tremendous task Mr Taylor notes because organizations are always moving or closing and new ones are opening up Volunteers usually working in pairs are assigned threehour shifts except for the midnight to 9 AM trick We had trouble filling that one at first Mr Taylor said So we asked each volunteer to take it once a month Usually you can sleep from about 2 to 7 in the morning anyway The organization runs intensive training programs several times a year These include nightly twohour sessions the first week and a twoweek internship of six hours a week Volunteers who range in age from 18 to 65 and are mostly women work six hours a week answering hotline calls We are in need of volunteers Mr Taylor said For the first time we are admitting people under 18 At the end of this year the Division on Women will receive a formal report from Together Inc including a list of problems that the hotline was unable to answer So far volunteers have had all the answers Sometimes someone calls asking for something that just isnt possible Mr Taylor said A woman called one day to say that she had been treated unfairly by a legal services group I referred her to the Public Advocates office but she was convinced that everyone including the Governor and the states Attorney General were in conspiracy against her So technically there was no referral  There is a need to find services that are close by
ABORTION FOES URGED TO JOIN NEW CAUSES,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/28/archives/long-island-weekly-abortion-foes-urged-to-join-new-causes-hyland.html,EAST BRUNSWICK March 26State Attorney General William F Hyland told an antiabortion group today that it should widen its concern to include larger social and environmental issues that affect the quality of life Mr Hyland who spoke at the fifth annual New Jersey Right to Life Committee dinner here told the group that participation in qualityoflife issues such as crime capital punishment and air and water pollution would not dilute the traditional work of the movement which has focused primarily on the abolition of laws permitting abortion More than 450 people attended the allday convention that was called to seek legislative and judicial change in laws affecting abortion In addition to workshops on abortion the group also conducted seminars concerning other areas such as the legal definition of death and euthanasia and medical ethics We are not a oneissue group said Kay Krug of Old Bridge the president of the committee I think todays program shows that Guidelines Are Offered Mr Hyland at a news conference before his speech detailed a number of ways the state could do more to insure that private physicians were following legal restrictions in performing abortions Right now the state does not have a system to check on whether doctors in private offices are complying with guidelines laid down by the United States Supreme Court he said Hospitals and clinics are required to make reports on abortions they perform but physicians are not Mr Hyland said that his office was talking to State Health Department officials to have enacted new regulations for private physicians A reporting system would allow state investigators to make spot checks on private doctors as is now done with hospitals and clinics According to the 1973 Supreme Court ruling on abortions states may not regulate abortions in the first three months of pregnancy In the second sixmonth period the states may determine the circumstances of the abortion but after the sixth month of pregnancy no abortion is legal in New Jersey unless it is performed to save the life of the mother Mr Hyland said more than 30000 abortions were performed in the state last year and statistics showed a 20 percent increase over 1975 The New Jersey Right to Life Committee was formed in 1970 in response to proabortionists attempts to have the state laws which then forbade abortions changed Since the 1973 Supreme Court decision the group has been involved in public and legislative appeals to have the ruling modified or changed through a constitutional amendment We want to have a constitutional convention on the abortion issue said Christopher Smith the 24yearold executive director of the group We are also contacting our Senators and Congressmen to have them cast an antiabortion prolife amendment We want the people to decide Mr Smith said one of the greatest problems faced by his organization was the public perception that the Right to Life Movement was organized and directed by the Roman Catholic Church The cleverest argument used by proabortionists to defuse the issue is to claim that the antiabortion movement is a Catholic movement Although many Catholics and Catholic organizations are in the vanguard we are not a Catholic movement and never will be Mr Smith said This is not a religious issue it is a human rights issue Mr Smith said pointing out that the national director of the Right to Life organization was a Protestant minister Our fight is for the rights of babies to exist Mr Smith said
"Disease Control Center, Under Fire, Retains Much of Its Reputation for Excellence",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/28/archives/disease-control-center-under-fire-retains-much-of-its-reputation.html,WASHINGTON March 27The Center for Disease Control widely blamed for mishandling the swine flu vaccination program has been highly regarded by public health experts here and abroad But there are clouds now on its horizon The darkest of them appears to be the perception of Joseph A Califano Jr Secretary of Health Education and Welfare that this key Federal health agency has slipped somewhat in its reputation for excellence The slippage he said repeatedly came to his attention in conversations with doctors and public health leaders all over the country when he first took office In recruiting for the health posts in his department Mr Califano said he and his staff talked to hundreds of knowledgeable professionals We got repeated comments that CDC was not what it once had been and not where it ought to be today he said While the Secretary did not specifically blame the centers leadership his remarks were in answer to a question on his decision to replace the centers current director Dr David J Sencer Link to Flu Program Suspected That decision which jolted some public health officials was disclosed at the time of a meeting on the halted flu vaccination campaign The timing fueled speculation that Dr Sencer was a casualty of that muchbuffeted program Some officials also are apprehensive that it may be an attempt to politicize the center Mr Califano has denied this He described Dr Sencer as a fine public servant but added that 11 years was enough for anyone holding such a job Mr Califano said the center was not up to past standards in training manpower and was not dealing adequately with the immunization of children in the urban slums The outcome of the swine flu program he said seriously and severely hurt efforts to immunize children against other diseases Mr Califano also emphasized however that be believed there was a great deal of professional competence in the centers staff and said that its new director might come from within its ranks Dr Sencer is continuing as director until a replacement is chosen Public criticism and close attention are somewhat new to the center which has always been relatively inconspicuous to the public with a reputation for excellence among specialists The troubled swine flu program and the prolonged mystery of the fatal legionnaires disease in Pennsylvania last year made such inconspicuousness impossible at least for the time being Benefits From Failure Some public health experts are convinced that there have been good as well as bad results from the 1976 flu immunization program while others believe the end result was public distrust of all immunization programs Six months after the legionnaires disease episode scientists at the center found bacteria that were closely associated with the mysterious cases of pneumonia and were probably their cause Furthermore the still unnamed bacteria have been linked to two other previously unexplained pneumonia outbreaks and this accomplishment may open a new horizon for the understanding of pneumonia Nevertheless the center has been criticized for its methods and some medical observers have doubted that the bacteria were the cause Medical scientists and public health experts have recently indicated that respect remained high for the professional competence of the center staff and that considerable loyalty existed among those who had been connected with it Critics have been by no means unanimous on their diagnoses and most criticisms have been mixed with praise One specialist for example said the center was extraordinarily good in coping with infectious diseases but had spread itself too thin by taking on other obligations Another said that the center should have resisted efforts to focus the swine flu program on the entire population because this was an impossibly large goal Criticism Mixed with Praise Dr Sidney Wolfe of the Health Research Group here part of the Ralph Nader organization has been an outspoken critic of the swine flu program and Dr Sencers management of it But he said the center had excellent personnel and a tremendous organization He added that he thought the staff was not fully realizing its potential and was giving too little attention to some of its important obligations beyond infectious disease Dr George E Pickett president of the American Public Health Association said he believed the effectiveness of the center and the rest of the Public Health Service of which it is a part had been blunted Dr Pickett who Is also public health and welfare director of San Mateo Calif said that there had been a tendency in Federal health affairs in recent years to substitute managerial trickery for solid public health professionalism and that this attitude in Washington had harmed the center and other agencies The center with headquarters in a suburb of Atlanta was formed to work on malaria control in combat areas during World War II After the war its concerns spread to all communicable diseases Tests and Reference Libraries The center staff developed a reputation for quickly solving the puzzles of disease outbreaks it investigated A corps of young doctors called the Epidemic Intelligence Service was founded to do this work Once they traced an outbreak of hepatitis in a Michigan city to the glaze on some doughnuts in a local bakery It helped track down the cause of a sevenstate outbreak of typhoid fever finding in mashed potatoes in a New York City restaurant And an epidemic of digestive tract infections in California was traced to a city well in Riverside The centers expert technicians do more than half a million laboratory diagnostic tests a year The center also serves as an international reference laboratory for 17 different infectious diseases including influenza and rabies The technicians maintain stocks of and sometimes make antitoxins against rare but deadly types of illness They maintain a 24hour consulting service for doctors faced with seemingly mysterious diseases Today the center also has responsibilities for occupational health and safety the proficiency of clinical laboratories in the United States campaigns against venereal disease the public education effort concerning cigarette smoking and a nationwide program to study the effectiveness of efforts to cope with the estimated 112 million infections a year that arise among patients in a hospital for other reasons They are involved In surveillance of abortions nationwide and as part of an effort to cope with teenage abortion are starting to develop the first Federal involvement in a sex education effort Some experts believe the center is spread far too thin but opinion differs as to whether the centers leaders have had the obligations thrust upon them by Congress and the Department of Health Education and Welfare or whether they have sought and welcomed new additions to their empire During a recent interview Dr Sencer declined to discuss his own situation On the center however he said new obligations were added over the years with no commensurate increase in appropriations and with a decline in personnel Not counting the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health made part of the center in 1973 he said the annual appropriations for the center have gone from about 76 million 10 years ago to 119 million last year and manpower has dropped in that time from 2670 to 2378 Comments from Health Officers The professionals who have probably had the most contact with the center are the state and local health officers and scientists involved in various public health efforts Questions put to a sampling of them from coast to coast disclosed a common ground of respect for the dedication and competence of the centers scientists Dr Eugene Fowinkle Tennessee com missioner of health said that the center exhibited more energy and willingness to react to an emergency than any other Government agency with which he had dealt The Massachusetts Commissioner o Public Health Dr Jonathan Fielding said he considered the professional caliber o the center personnel excellent and undiminished but added that the events o the last year tarnished the centers reputation Dr Donald A Henderson dean of the Johns Hopkins Universitys School of Hy giene and Public Health said news o the decision to replace Dr Sencer had resulted in a flood of letters cables and other communications to him from health officers abroad asking what was happening and expressing concern for the center Until recently Dr Henderson headec the World Health Organizations effort against smallpox that has almost eliminated that disease He had previously been an officer of the center where much of the smallpox eradication strategy was worked out Dr Henderson called the center one of the most respected public health institutions in the world and said that it served as a model for similar or ganizations abroad Concerned on Excellence Dr Leonard Bachman Pennsylvania Secretary of Health said he could understand that the new Administration might wish to have a new director of the center for reasons of policy but he said Dr Sencer was without question a highly competent professional Indeed the professional competence of the center and of Dr Sencer in particular do not seem to be an issue in the public health field Thd concern among specialists is that the level of competence must be maintained In his column last week in an American Public Health Association publication Dr Pickett noted that Dr Sencer had re ceived the associations award for excelence last year Let us hope that new appointees will be equally praiseworthy he concluded
Califano Style Encounters No‐Frills Milieu,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/30/archives/califano-style-encounters-nofrills-milieu.html,WASHINGTON March 29  Back during his middleclass Brooklyn boyhood Joseph Anthony Califano Jr probably never dreamed that some day he would have his own cook on the public payroll or otherwise But then he probably also never thought that some day he would take in more than half a million dollars as a lawyer in a single year or that he would be an intimate of Presidents or that he would administer a Federal bureaucracy with an annual budget of 1622 billionor that that cook would turn out to be so much trouble When President Carter named Mr Califano Secretary of Health Education and Welfare there was some carping from the left that the nominee was hard on abortion and from the right that he was soft on spending but for the most part opinion was that the appointment was sound A magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School a success in several law firms President Johnsons righthand man for domestic affairs Mr Califano was an achiever and streamliner after Mr Carters own heart So the nominationwas approved and things went along fairly smoothly until last week when it came to light that Mr Califano had hired one Wiley Barnes a retiree drawing a pension from the Marine Corps to a 12763ayear post as the Secretarys cook Mr Califano handled a barrage of press questions on the matter with some wit saying he planned to keep the cook but rewrite the job description one that made no mention of culinary duties There was also a lesser embroilment involving a former Secret Service man hired for 43923 a year as a bodyguard but that subsided somewhat when Mr Califano said the man was instead a chief administrative officer whose duties included among other things building security at the department Many Washingtonians were merely amused by the irony of the situationa member of the nononsense frillsnipping justfolks Carter Administration hiring a cook In previous Administrations the perquisite would likely have gone unnoticed Others hotly defended the Secretary Its totally common around the Government for department to have cooks said Eileen Shanahan the chief spokesman for H E W This is what makes me so mad about the story Its not untrue but its unfair In the Pentagon its been a scandal for years the official said Theres several private dining rooms according to rank In Treasury they have a staff of about six The spokesman also denied that the new cook in any way represented insularity or autocracy on Mr Califanos part Anybody can speak up and tell him hes wrong about something and everybody does Hes surrounded himself with a bunch of nomen and nowomen Discussion of policy in his office is very open she said Hell sayHeres what I want to do Anybody who disagrees shoot at it Nor said the official is Mr Califano some kind of sybaritic high liver with a taste for hummingbird tongues on toast Theres nothing pretentious about him she said He has two beatupold cars a 1971 Ford station wagon and a 1969 Mustang When we turned the building temperature to 65  he brought in this raunchy old blue sweater He still wears it There were those however who thought the cook neither a laughing matter nor a trivial one Joes problem like many others who stay in Washington is that the norm is inflated said William D Moyers of CBS formerly a colleague of Mr Califanos in the Johnson White House You get the impression that its a chummy cozy gentlemans world out beyond the Potomac and you forget how the vast majority of people in the country cope every day with clogged freeways and clogged drains late trains spiraling food costs and the decline of the quality of things For most of us the price of everything rises and the quality declines but not for the protected upper class of Washington Mr Moyers said They live on a very small island of immunity from the headaches frustrations and failures that make up the common life of everyone else and they fail to see the impact on other people of what they do A cook to a Cabinet Secretary is a convenience that saves time To everyone else its a bitter reminder of the perquisites of power which serve further to increase the distance between the public servant and the public Certainly Mr Califano has enjoyed access to privilege during much of his adult life Born on the fringes of the BedfordStuyvesant section of Brooklyn in 1931 he was the son of a schoolteacher of Irish descent and a middlelevel IBM executive whose own father an Italian immigrant had run a specialty fruit store in Brooklyn While the Califanos were not rich they were not poor either and they were able to send their son to prep school Holy Cross and Harvard Mr Califanos military duty consisted of three years in Washington as a naval officer After that he joined a New York law firm once run by Thomas E Dewey but he found the work so tedious that in 1961 he wrote a letter to Cyrus R Vance then the Pentagons general counsel asking for a job He got it and in due course became the Armys chief lawyer and after that an aide to then Defense Secretary Robert S McNamara That was of course the Pentagon where they have those private dining rooms His work at the Pentagon on the initial plannipg of the supersonic transport caught President Johnsons attention and in 1965 Mr Califano went to the White House as a special assistant He workedand still works12 hours a day six days a week running two shifts of secretaries in the process He was the architect and ramrod of many of the Great Society programs and in that role he established a reputation for intelligence diligence and toughness From 1969 until earlier this year Mr Califano practiced law in Washington first with the firm of Arnold  Porter and later with Williams Connolly  Califano Publication of his financial data as required by President Carter of his Cabinet nominees showed that last year he earned more than 555000 from his law practice Wealthy lawyers like Administration insiders are not without privilege in Washington For example tickets to Washington Redskins football games are

Hall with Berliozs Requiem performed in the same grand manner of its first performance In 1837 at the church of the Invalides in Paris it was presented in its horrifying grandeur as Berlioz wished it by hundreds of voices and an enormous orchestra with four brass bands stationed at the corners of the church representing the calls of the Last Judgment At Avery Fisher the work which Berlioz regarded as the one he would want preserved above all others will be performed by the combined choirs choruses and glee clubs of Amherst Mt Holyoke Smith and Union colleges and the University of Massachusetts

Man on the Street Back in the 1890s when art photographers were turning out fuzzy manipulated prints resembling 19thcentury paintings Eugene Atget was combing the streets of Paris with an oldfashioned

who upon Atgets death in 1927 tracked down the majority of his plates and prints in order to preserve and reprint them An exhibit opening Tuesday at Helios Gallery consists of approximately 50 Atget

His Name and the Governorship Are Once More Linked,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/03/archives/his-name-and-the-governorship-are-once-more-linked-several.html,ALBANYPerry B Duryea Jr has looked at power from both sides now Once he was Speaker of the New York State Assembly and if he could not make Gov Nelson Rockefeller back down he could sometimes beat him down He was widely heralded as the next Republican gubernatorial nominee Then in 1973 he was indicted on an election law charge he later lost the Speakership and had to fight to keep the seat he has held since 1960 Well he says philosophically no one ever promised him a rose garden But Perry Duryea is a survivor Several investigations later he is legally clear while he bides his time as minority leader of the Assembly And he is once again widely heralded as the next Republican gubernatorial nominee although the State Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson may also run I never considered throwing it in and saying thats enough says Mr Duryea I never thought that political life was supposed to be easy Little in life is simple especially politics with all its crosscurrents reactions and personalities Mr Duryeas troubles began with his indictment on a misdemeanor charge of conspiracy to drain oft Democratic votes in an Assembly race by secretly supporting a Liberal candidate The charge was dropped less than two months later but only after Mr Duryeas gubernatorial aspirations had been torpedoed Many of his supporters suspected Mr Rockefeller through Attorney General Louis J Lefkowitz was behind the indictment The thenGovernor was supporting Lieut Gov Malcolm Wilson as his successor Ive never said that Mr Duryea says He dismisses a common notion that he does not get along with Mr Rockefeller who despite his announcement of retirement from active politics remains a force to be reckoned with in the states Republican Party I had six full and demanding years as Speaker Mr Duryea says And you have to remember that we had nothing like the majority the Democrats have now We had a spread of two to three votes But we never took up on an issue that we lost We batted 1000 I never lost a Rockefeller program bill on the floor If I had had this great falling out with him I am supposed to have had would I have broken my back for him for six years We are both strongminded men Its the only way I would want to work in the system Its supposed to be tripartite People who know Mr Duryea well both supporters and opponents insist that frequently heard labels such as arro gant and cold do not apply Albert H Blumenthal a Democrat and former Assembly majority leader says Person to person especially man to man Perry is a far different human being than he is as a public personality While no one is ever going to accuse Mr Duryea of galloping good ol boyism he can be charming On occasion he and Mr Blumenthal after sparring heatedly on the Assembly floor would repair to Mr Duryeas office for a small libation He is a very tough political competitor both in infighting and outfighting says Mr Blumenthal He neither asks for nor gives  But there is another Perry Duryea one those who see him only in action might not suspect He is a man of compassion He reaches out Mr Duryea is a successful businessman He inherited a lobster business in Montauk LL that he has built into a fairly large seafood enterprise now run mainly by his son Perry 3d Mr Duryea is considered a conservative by many but his legislative record is something of a mixed bag He has worked hard for environmental measures a longtime concern of his though he has been seldom out in front on such issues He wound up casting the tiebreaking vote to legalize abortion a move that wasnt smart at the time Albert Roberts head of the minority staff of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee says I guess the toughest thing I ever went through with him was in 1971 when I brought him the figures showing that state spending was just going out of control He wanted evidence he wanted the names of the economists the charts the documents But once he made up his mind that was it We cut threequarters of a billion dollars out of Rockefellers budget that year It cost 16000 jobs It also earned Mr Duryea a reputation as being anticity and antipoor and indeed he says that fiscal conservatism would be a major campaign theme if he decides to run for Governor As to his future Mr Duryea is taking a familiar close hard look at the 1978 gubernatorial race His standard line is that Republicans must concentrate on rebuilding the party before they fall to squabbling over who should get the nomination Recently he made unhappy headlines again when Newsday disclosed that the Suffolk County District Attorneys office was looking into a Bahamian land deal in which he is an investor A Duryea spokesman calls it the annual Newsday Duryealand story Two years ago it was the Montauk property Last year it was the property in North Caroiins This year it is the Bahamas According to Mr Duryeas attorney Charles Webb the only question raised was why Mr Duryeas partnership formed in 1971 had not filed a certificate of partnership in the United States until 1976 Mr Webb said it was because the partnership did no business in this country until last year Whether the headlines are enough to hurt Mr Duryea next year is open to speculation He only needs to know that he has a chance he doesnt need to be the favorite before he goes an admirer says And in fact Mr Duryea is not likely to be the favorite under any circumstances That welcome role should be filled by Hugh Carey
BABCOCK IS FIGHTING UNITED TECHNOLOGIES ON PLAN FOR TENDER,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/05/archives/babcock-is-fighting-united-technologies-on-plan-for-tender-asks-us.html,The struggle for control of the Babcock  Wilcox Company turned into open warfare yesterday Babcock declared in the morning that it would fight a proposed tender offer by the United Technologies Corporation and asked a Federal court in Akron Ohio for an injunction to halt Uniteds acquisition moves United announced late in the afternoon that it intended to offer to buy any and all of Babcocks common stock at 42 a share which would cost about 512 million The price of 42 a share is so grossly inadequate that it was never intended to be taken seriously said George G Zipf Babcocks chairman in a letter to Uniteds directors Rather it seems to us that the timing of your offer is related to the imminent development of a national energy policy We cannot avoid suspicion of anticipatory piracy Babcock is a major producer of nuclear and coal generating equipment and is in related businesses such as industrial tubing Sales last year were 17 billion and net income was 531 million or 437 a share There are 12 million common shares outstanding and 30000 stockholders Diversified Aerospace Maker United Technologies is a diversified aerospace manufacturer with 52 billion in sales last year and a net of 1634 million or 511 a share Mr Zipf in his attack on United used the energy crisis and the public interest as reasons for opposing the takeover attempt saying in his letter This period of energy resources peril makes this a peculiarly inappropriate time to consider linking two of the largest American enterprises competing in the energy equipment field The abortion of that competition would be hostile to the public interest and presents an unacceptable risk of violation of the antitrust laws of the United States The energy situation in the United States is so serious and the interweaving of technology public policy economics and environmental interests necessary to cope with this crisis is so delicate that this is no place for corporate buccaneering The Babcock chairman also asked United to consider whether your venture will not contribute another blow to democratic capitalism and the system of independent enterprise And his letter also warned that if any business is lost because of the confusion uncertainty and fear that you have precipitated you will be accountable Intention Filed with SEC United answered with an 84word statement saying that it had filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission its notice of intention for the tender offer and that it was publishing the offer and would file it with the State of Ohio under its tender offer law Babcock has plants in Ohio and following the Ohio law means some delay in the actual offer possibly 20 to 60 days The struggle for Babcock came into the open March 29 when United publicly announced its planned offer and asked Babcock directors to cooperate Babcock was cool but did not formally reject it until yesterday United is used to such turndowns having been rejected by the Otis Elevator Company in 1975 yet winning the company through a tender offer In its Federal suit Babcock said acquisition by United would or could curb competition in electric power generation and marine propulsion systems and even injure the security of the United States because it would mean more concentration of defense contractors In addition Babcock said the Atomic Energy Act forbids the transfer of control of nuclear licenses which it has without permission of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission which United does not have A Babcock spokesman said this nuclear license problem could be important in any takeover fight In addition the hearings of the Federal nuclear regulatory agencies are not noted for their brevity and the spokesman added that for any arbitraguermarket professionals who might buy Babcock stock and tender it for quick gainworking on borrowed money it could mean trouble Some analyst saw this as an indication that Babcock would like to frighten off traders who would buy the stock to turn it in for a quick tender offer profit The suit also complained about Uniteds yet unfinished review of political or foreign payments and failure to detail fully the financing plan for the offer On the antitrust issue Harry J Gray Uniteds chairman has said We do not believe that there are any antitrust problems that would preclude consummation of the offer Because of its size alone either the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission will examine the proposed acquisition A Justice Department spokesman said that your friendly Government is going to look at it but it hasnt been decided if its going to be the FTC or us One possible technique of a company resisting what it considers a hostile takeover is to offer itself to a company considered more friendly However the Babcock spokesman said flatly when asked if such a friendly partner was being sought The company is not for sale Babcocks shares which closed at 34 on the New York Stock Exchange on March 28 closed at 38 on the Big Board yesterday down

GOVERNOR IS SILENT ON DEATH PENALTY,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/05/archives/governor-is-silent-on-death-penalty-carey-will-not-say-if-he-would.html,ALBANY April 4Governor Carey who opposes capital punishment as matter of conscience declined today to say whether he would veto legislation to reinstate the death penalty in New York State if it is enacted At his weekly news conference the Governor was asked whether in view of his personal convictions he could sign any bill that restored the death penalty Ill wait to see what kind of law emerges he said adding that a new capitalpunishment law would have meet requirements of the State Supreme Court which last fall declared unconstitutional the states 1974 law prescribing the death penalty for persons convicted of killing lawenforcement officers In another matter involving personal beliefs Mr Carey reminded his questioner that he had vetoed a bill that would have restricted access to legal abortions in the state in certain cases This bill had been strongly advocated by many Roman Catholics Comments on Concorde At the news conference the Governor reiterated his opposition to permitting the BritishFrench Concorde supersonic aircraft to land at Kennedy International Airport in Queens unless new evidence showed it fell within the permissible noise level Im not unmindful of diplomatic considerations he said but the environmental security of people living around the airport comes first Acknowledging that some Americanmade airliners now exceed the noise limit but are allowed to land at airports in New York the Governor said the planes were being refitted with noise suppressors The Concorde or any other new aircraft must meet the most stringent standards he said
Single Teen‐Agers Found Using Better Contraceptives,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/08/archives/long-island-opinion-single-teenagers-found-using-better.html,More unmarried American teenagers are sexually active now than in 1971 but they are relying more heartily on effective contraceptive practices according to the results of a national survey released yesterday According to the report published in the MarchApril issue of Family Planning Perspectives a journal of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America there was a 30 percent increase from 1971 to last year in the proportion of unmarried teenagers who were sexually experienced The survey was conducted a year ago among a national sample of more than 1 900 nevermarried women 15 through 19 years old who lived in the continental United States The findings were compared with those of a similar survey done five years earlier by the same researchers Dr Melvin Zelnik and Dr John F Kantner professors of population dynamics at Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health The researchers included special questions in the second survey to check on the honesty of the respondents answers Thirtyfive percent of unmarried teenagers interviewed last year said they had had sexual intercourse at least once as against 27 percent in 1971 But since the number of teenyears in the population also increased since the first survey the estimated total number of sexually experienced teenagers increased by 47 percent from 2 187 000 to 3 225 000 1970 At the same time however increased reliance on abortion and greater use of effective contraception have resulted in a significant decline in the proportion of sexually active teenagers who have illegitimate births from about 89 per 1000 in 1971 to 69 per 1 000 in 1976 according to Planned Parenthood officials Only 45 percent of teenagers used any method [of contraception the last time they had] intercourse in 1971 and just 16 percent used the pill and IUD Dr Zelnik and Dr Kantner reported In 1976 on the other hand 63 percent used a method at last intercourse and onethird used the pill and IUD This represents a doubling in the proportion who used the pill or IUD intrauterine device the last time they had intercourse This is greater than pill and IUD use in 1973 among married women of reproductive age Dr Zelnik and Dr Kantner said The pill was found to be especially popular among black teenagers last used by six in 10 of those who had ever used contraception Altogether the number of unmarried teenagers who used the pill or IUD tripled from about 348 000 in 1971 to 11 million last year Fortyfive percent obtained their pill prescriptions from family planning clinics in part through Federal support provided by the Family Planning Services and Population Research Act of 1970 At the same time the survey showed there was a substantial decline in teenage use of lessreliable contraceptive methodsthe condom douche and withdrawalwhich had been most prominent in 1971 In addition to relying on more effective methods teenage contraceptive use in 1976 was more consistent the researchers found However the survey showed that even in 1976 few teenagers had begun their use of contraception at the time that they first had sexual intercourse and for significant proportion birth control was not used until after an unwanted pregnancy occurred The survey also disclosed that there had been little improvement in knowledge about the risk of conception since 1971 In that year 38 percent of the women surveyed knew when in the menstrual cycle the risk of conception was greatest by last year the percentage of women with this knowledge had increased to only 41 Women who had had sex education in school were only slightly better informed than average indicating that the transfer of knowledge [about sexuality] in formal settings may be likened to carrying water in a basket the researchers said
A Day in the Life of the Pope,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/10/archives/a-day-in-the-life-of-the-pope-pope-paul-vi.html,ROME The first rays of a rising sun reach across the city passing above the stilldark Tiber to touch the high cross atop St Peters Basilica As the sun climbs higher its light moves onto the vaulted dome of the greatest church in Christendom Finally It reaches the top windows of the Apostolic Palace which stands like an indomitable old duchess above the Bernini columns embracing St Peters Sauare Behind shuttered windows at the top corner Pope Paul VI lies awake in bed listening to the bells of St Peters For three centuries the six immense bells have rung to the glory of new saints and tolled for the death of old popes Now they merely tell the morning hour 630 No one enters the Popes bedroom He doesnt even like people knocking on his door to say good morning Yet one can imagine him there on this particular dayactually a composite portrait drawn from dozens of interviews with those closest to the Popealready awake even though they have closed St Peters Square to traffic and each night turn off the fountains to help him get a good nights rest In his simple threequarter bed he is only a little old man wearing a white nightshirt Nothing suggests that this man born Giovanni Battista Montini is the spiritual leader of more than 700 million members of the Roman Catholic Church the bearer of awesome responsibilities titles and offices Vicar of Jesus Christ Successor of the Prince of Apostles Bishop of Rome Patriarch of the West Primate of Italy Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province Sovereign of Vatican City States Gloriously Reigning Another title not often used is Servant of the Servants of God At 79 his face has pulled close to its skull His hair is gray his straight lips cold His hands long and thin are strangely white on the sheets their veins high and blue Yet in the middle of that white winter of age there is something intensely alive soft and gentlehis eyes Age has not dimmed their graygreen depth nor their habit of turning inward as though tracing the flight of thought It is a revealing habit for he is fundamentally a private man who confesses that study and university work respond best to my temperament And he did not feel himself especially qualified to rule He was found on the eve of his election face buried in his hands asking with anguish How can I do it But by now it is clear that history will view him kindly Succeeding Pope John XXIII he became in many ways the first truly modern pope abandoning many of the traditional trappings of the office for those of simpler style traveling around the world on jet planes enacting the liturgical reforms of Vatican Council II which give the laity greater participation in the mass and permit it to be said in the vernacular Though coming in spirit as father and son Paul and John were separated by a century In more timeless ways however Paul may never match Johns achievement For John the peasants son was led by his heart and he became the father of all people whatever their faith Paul son of the upper class is led by his mind and so for all his globetrotting he enters fewer homes At the moment of coronation John accepted the traditional heavy seventiered tiara with two blinks then looked straight ahead like Abraham seeking his God When a lighter tiara of more modern design descended on Paul his eyes closed as though seeking a vision of God within It is not that he is without sentiment Sometimes he will let it show in public as when he gave a kiss of peace to the late Greek Patriarch Athenagoras I on the Mount of Olives But mostly he prefers to express it in private as when during his 1964 visit to the Holy Land he prostrated himself before a hole in Jerusalem rock believed to have held the Cross Deeply moved he plunged his left arm into the hole Then rising his face soft with emotion he turned to the small group of Greek Orthodox monks who had accompanied him and in tears embraced Perhaps it is just that the first of the modern popes shares the dilemma of modern man He seeks solitude and silence yet longs for the embrace of a brother He draws strength from meeting massed pilgrims yet suffers in failures of dialogue with bishops and cardinals He accepts the burden of his office yet finds its weight and isolation agonizing Outside the bells begin to toll the third quarter and the Pope sits up On a bedside table are his watch a rosary an old Bible and other books he may be reading a carafe of water and two vials of pills One is for insomnia the other for arthritic pain in his right knee which has been growing worse lately There is a telephone rarely used A recent call came from his brother Ludovico during Pauls bout with influenza There is also a threebutton buzzer system with which to summon his secretary his valet or Sister Giacomina a devoted nurse who is one of the five nuns living on the same floor taking care of the papal household The bedroom redecorated to Pauls understated taste has a pleasant civilized airtawnytextured walls with matching sofa chairs A few pictures he treasures including a painting of the Virgin hang on the walls as does a wooden crucifix which he can see from his bed Beneath it stands a priedieu Four popes including Pope John died in this room As he stands up he feels the pain in his knee It is usually worst in the morning As the day wears on it gets better In the bath he washes then shaves with an electric razor Dressed for mass in the violet chasuble of Lent he finds his two personal secretaries Don Pasquale Macchi and the Rev John Magee waiting for him in the corridor Father Magee 42 an Irishman from the Missionaries of St Patrick is a relative newcomer to the Papal establishment Don Macchi 54 has been with Paul since the days before his election as Pope when he was known as Archbishop Montini of Milan Macchi is a cultivated seminary professor with a doctoral thesis on French novelist Georges Bernanos and the problem of evil Together they enter the private chapel lit from above and the sides by light streaming through glass mosaics of religious scenes A wooden crucifix hangs above the altar On Sundays and holidays the Pope and his secretaries are joined by the household nuns and the valetchauffeur Franco Ghezzi who is married and lives in a separate Vatican apartment It is shortly after 700 when Paul bends low to kiss the altar and begin the service in Latin O Lord I raise to You my prayer  After mass the Pope and his aides turn to their breviaries Sitting or kneeling they go through the Matins Lauds and Prime of their daily office It is after 830 when they return to their rooms strengthened by prayer and ready for the day The Pope wearing a simple white soutane leaves his room for breakfast at 9 oclock The table is set with fruit homemade bread cheese and butter brought daily from the papal residence at Castel Gandolfo Father Magee is waiting and says Don Macchi will be coming in a moment The room is white with a sideboard containing liqueurs cut crystal glasses special plates linens and some medicines There is also a television set In the morning the sun comes in the side window Paul sits down at the head of the table For a moment he pauses head bowed in silent prayer Then with Father Magee sitting farther down the table he begins to scan the morning press There are French papers Le Monde Figaro and Englishlanguage papers The International Herald Tribune The Rome Daily American The Italian papers include Communist publications Having spent 30 years in the Roman Curia the complex of committees and courts that administer the church Paul knows how a pope can be isolated by a bureaucratic staff He saw it happen to Pius XII whom he loved and admired He considers the papers a lifeline to the outside Now in one of them he sees an article headed Pope Should Resign to Save the Churchand recognizes it as a reprint from an editorial in Church Times a publication of the Church of England One of the prayers which many will offer for the Holy Father during this year is that he will crown his services by resigning his abdication from a throne which he clearly does not enjoy would favorably sway historys verdict on him  the next pope should be less authoritarian  he should state the consensus of his fellowbishops So it goes on He knows all the arguments quite well They have been spelled out in many ways by radical theologians and critics of his regime The church now numbers more than half a billion people the burden of ruling it has increased until it is near the limit of one mans endurance Much of the increase is the result of steps Paul himself has taken during his 14year reign He took control of the Curia away from Roman theologians and cardinals whose independent management of various congregations often approached autonomyin a move designed to internationalize the ruling body and give it more vigor But the result was to bring the Curia more directly under his own control thereby increasing his labors He traveled widely and he succeeded so well in his travels that no future successor to St Peter can hope to spend all his time in Rome He sought to increase the diplomatic role of the Vatican trebling Holy See envoys to international bodies and so on The burden could be lightened the office made more efficient if Paul were to modify his style of autocratic oneman rule and work in a collegial team with his fellow bishops The Anglican Church Times was only echoing the opinion of a growing body of Catholic churchmen who believe the Pope has not sufficiently implemented the call of Vatican Council II for less rule from Rome and a greater voice for bishops priests and laymen in the running of the church In Europe these liberals look for leadership to Belgiums Cardinal Leo Suenens In America they seek it from Detroits Cardinal John Dearden Pauls creation of the Synod of Bishops with its limited consultative powers hardly satisfied the liberals or quieted the debate over power in the church which has grown more tense and in some areas acrimonious as time has passed But Paul feels that giving up more of his authority would endanger his office and lead to a much deeper division in the church He alone must answer to God and history he feels and he will not budge further from his concept of the church as he stated it in his first encyclical Ecclesiam Suam His Church In that blueprint of his reign he said Without the supreme efficacious and decisive pastoral office of Peter the unity of the Church of Christ would utterly collapse So Paul faces a serious dilemma As the load of work increases his capacity diminishes with age and the creeping arthritis that may curtail his future movements In September he will be 80 an age he has decreed would har him or any cardinal from entering a conclave to elect a new pope Many in the church he knows too well would like him to celebrate that birthday by vacating his throne and permitting a younger man to take over Now Don Macchi enters the dining room In passing he sees Paul reading the article and nods as though he has also read it Then he sits down and waits for the Pope to say something A dark handsome professor when he joined Archbishop Montini 23 years ago Macchi is now gray with the scowl of a distraught teacher When accompanying the Pope he is even more tenseno doubt with reason His physical courage and fast reflexes saved Paul when a psychopath tried to kill him in the Philippines At this moment after reading the newspaper Don Macchi knew what Paul would He had heard it before The Lord created this I certainly didnt Its not easy to bear such a weight But Jesus said to Peter You will be my disciple and upon you I will build my Church I will build  you know what that means Its the whole weight of the church Yes itd be easy to say I dont want it Cant they understand this Cant they give a little help or show a little care Tossing aside the paper he leaves the room Don Macchi finishes his breakfast and at 930 joins Paul in his private study next to the bedroom Together they go over the schedule one more grueling day with Curia officials diplomats visiting bishops and on top of it all a general audience of 7500 people with private audiences afterward At 10 Paul takes the elevator down one flight to his official office on the second floor Called his private library it is actually a library for audiences It is a spacious room with three windows onto St Peters Square Paul emptied it of its gilt furniture flowery rugs and busts of dead popes bringing in Renaissance paintings wooden statues of saints and creamy velours He sits down at a 16thcentury desk with a leather writing pad a goldtopped roll blotter a rare gold clock a scissors with letter openerall so neat one knows this is not his real working desk Behind him is a shelf with a white telephone and reference books a Latin Bible and index a volume of Vatican 11 documents his encyclical Ecclesiam Suam a directory of missions a code of canon law and the Vatican yearbook bound in white leather especially for him The first visitor is Cardinal Villot the Vaticans Secretary of State Almost every morning he meets the Pope to go over church affairs Generally he arrives with a bundle of documents prepared by his staff Paul a 30year veteran of the Vaticans Secretariat of State knows every filing case The French Cardinal is courteous even friendlyyet reserved He feels himself an outsider in the Roman Curia When he warned that a referendum on divorce would be a disaster for the church as it was he was told he did not understand Italians A man of dignity and principle he has nearly resigned several times as a result of finding his diplomacy suddenly torpedoed by Curia officials who have the Popes ear It is said in Rome that the Pope has paired Villot off against Archbishop Giovanni Benelli Under Secretary of State for Ordinary Affairs to control better that vital secretariat The two men complement each other in laborand personality Villot an enduring blend of clerical traditionalism and French urbanity moves with caution works hard rocks no boats Benelli a shrewd harddriving Tuscan is the Popes troubleshooter for internal affairs Sometimes they seem external as when he reviews a proposal of Father General Pedro Arrupe head of the Jesuit order against the opposing concept of another Jesuit Paolo Dezza who every Saturday afternoon takes confession from the Pope As usual the morning talk with Villot circles the globe It includes a US visa refusal for the Archbishop of Hanoi who had been invited to discuss the reconstruction of Vietnam and religious freedom there the murder of the last white priest in Angola a fund to help families of seven missionaries killed in Rhodesia Benelli was raising money for it the Polish Governments sly circulation of three sermons of Cardinal Wyszynski edited with a Marxist slant a steppedup program of South African bishops to combat racism including an explosive proposal to assign black priests to white parishes So it goes around the world the problems never ending Cardinal Baggio from the Congregation of Bishops a Curia committee is next with news of Marcel Lefebvre the rebel French Archbishop suspended by Pope Paul after he disregarded Vatican orders by ordaining last June 24 13 priests and 13 subdeacons before 4000 European followers Lefebvres ultratraditionalist Society of St Pius X claims the new mass promulgated by Pope Paul in 1969 is a bastard rite and a symbol of Vatican Council reforms they despise as modern and destructive of church tradition and unity So they celebrate mass according to the fourcenturyold Tridentine rite now superseded and banned by Rome Lefebvre has many loyal followers in Europe In the United States the Rev Clarence Kelly superior of the societys American district claims that society priests currently celebrate the banned Tridentine mass for 5000 American Catholics Paul has met with Lefebvre and also has written a stern letter appealing to him to desistto no avail Some observers fear the rift could lead to schism within the church especially if Lefebvre begins to consecrate bishops Yet this morning Cardinal Reggio has news indicating otherwise Fed up with Lefebvres rightwing politics and rambling zaniness 20 young men have fled his seminary at Econe Switzerland and come to Rome They report growing disaffection among other followers So perhaps Lefebvres bandwagon of assorted hitchhikers will fall apart by itself Cardinal Poletti Vicar of Rome enters next They discuss an Italian bill to legalize abortion it easily passed the Chamber of Deputies but the Senate had only an 11vote margin More than half of these senators will consider basic amendments So the bill might go back to the Chamber to be further delayed until support for it wanes In fact Poletti explains to the Pope that is already happening Italians are beginning to realize that once you open the door to abortion youll get euthanasia he says The Pope is sad his voice low Love cannot be separated from tha fruit of love It reaches toward fecundity renewal  a sacrifice for life If you dissociate the act from its end you inevitably subtract from human happiness We cant align moral law with what is normally done And in the end all those who revere nature human happinessall the believers and unbelieversdeep in their hearts theyll thank us for having the vision and courage not to lower the ideal After that Paul leaves his office to walk through a series of eight antechambers where small groups are waiting With Monsignor Martin Prefect of the Papal Household he pauses to speak to separate visitors or groups He extends his hand and since there is a chance to kiss his bishops ring this type of audience is called a baciamano or hand kiss In the last room there are five American priests who like excited schoolboys tell the Pope that he was right to delimit women from the priesthood After all they say Jesus was a man so His representatives on earth simply have to have a natural resemblance to him Actually the American Episcopalians they report are all excited about their churchs allowing women to be priests A parish in Denver actually quit the church They just walked out Holy Father And theres at least 50 parishes who are going to follow them Pope Paul listens patiently smiling politely until this emotional outpouring is broken off by Monsignor Martin who says the Holy Father is due at his weekly audience With Don Macchi he goes out a side door and down a corridor to the elevator which drops him to the Sixtus V Courtyard There Franco Ghezzi is waiting with the Mercedes door open and motor running They make it around the rear of the basilica to the audience hall in one minute flat The Pope quickly climbs unto a portable throne is lifted aloft and is borne into the ball Applause from 7500 pilgrims and tourists begins like sudden rain then grows into a thunder of cheers and shouts Paul prefers to walk but the lofty throne chair allows everyone to see him thus its name sedia gestatoria Flashbulbs light the way flags and handkerchiefs wave babies are held up before him for special blessing His arms open as though seeking to embrace everyone then close to make the sign of the cross His eyes dart from one group to the next Occasionally before children he breaks into free and easy laughter He appears to draw great strength from the crowds response Finally on the stage beneath the highsweeping herringbone ceiling of the audience hall a masterpiece of the Italian architect Pier Luigi Nervi he sits on a thronea small figure in white before a rich Raphael tapestrywhile four Swiss Guards with helmets plumes and halberds stand close by as sentinels A microphone is brought and in his highpitched androgynous voice the Pope begins his weekly homily Dear sons and daughters He tells them of the wonder of prayer the power of faith the mystery of undying love He returns to lunch at 140 delayed today by several semiprivate encounters in the audience hall Seated at the table with his secretaries served by Ghezzinow wearing a white jacket with golden buttonshe tries to concentrate on the television news His thoughts however drift back to the audience hall He has been seen by thousands touched by hundreds and spoken to by scores But a few seem to stand out There was that boy last weekthe blind one smiling and opening his arms as though he wanted to be lifted up out of darkness into Gods light He had embraced the child kissing him saying Courage Be brave But the boy had shaken his head as though he could no longer be brave So he had said I will pray for you will you pray for me The boy had frowned How can I pray for you the Pope And he had told him Youre nay son cant you pray for your father As he left the boy had smiledbut it was such a sad smile After lunch Paul takes an hours napan old habit allowing a fresh start to the second half of a 19hour day Once again he begins it in prayer  returning to the chapel for None and Vespers from his breviary Then after a cup of strong espresso he goes to his private study It is a welllit room with a window onto the square where he appears on Sundays Two photographsof his father and motherface his desk plus three small Byzantine pictures There are a bust of Pope John a sofa chair two bookcases a seldomused electric typewriter and two speakers for a hifi set Outside his office there is a stairway leading up to a megazine floor and his personal library of 30000 volumes It is close to 5 and he has three hours to go through papers left by Cardinal Villot to ponder slowly such delicate matters as the naming of bishops the moving of diplomats and most important the reading of drafts of major documents and speeches altering them to fit his temper and thought He prefers to be left alone at this time but usually the afternoon is interrupted by Archbishops Benelli or Agostino Casaroli Secretary for Public Affairs Today its Casaroli whose quick mind and subtle diplomacy have led some to call him the Catholic Kissinger Among other matters they discuss a proposed revision of the concordat between the Holy See and Italy The Pope is grieved by three major provisions Catholicism will no longer be defined as Italys state religion marriage will no longer be recognized as a sacrament by civil authorities and Catholic religious instruction will no longer be compulsory in state schools It is one more signclose to home where it hurts the mostthat the world is becoming increasingly secularized Everywhere laymen are losing their faith priests leaving the church In the United States alone the seminaries are half empty onethird of the priests want to get married and 89 percent of Catholic married couples are using forbidden forms of contraception Pornography scandal and corruption increase at an alarming rate The talk shifts to Jimmy Carters scheduled trip to Geneva for Middle East peace talks If possible the President will come to Rome VicePresident Mondale a recent visitor had said Carter wants to keep the Pope informed because the Holy See can help in various ways They will discuss it further when Carter arrives Paul is pleased He believes Carter will probably be a great President A man reborn in the Christian faith who bears it with such dignity is an honor for God Paul had admired President Ford especially the way he took over after Nixon But a majorand undisclosedreason he could not attend the Eucharistic Congress in Philadelphia as had been expected was the chance of his being photographed with a US President running for reelection At 830 the Pope and his secretary descend for dinner Ghezzi in his white jacket brings in the evening mealsoup pasta is generally served at midday vegetables salad veal casserole There is also a 1967 Chiantia gift from a Tuscan banker The menus  not unlike those of middleclass Italians vary with the season Each new fruit or vegetable is eagerly rushed by the nuns to the Holy Fathers table Tonight there is something new wild asparagus alla parmigiana Everyone likes it Don Pasquale says its wonderful Father Magee raises his wine glass to all asparagus wild or otherwise The Pope smiles and says Miracles occur even in our kitchen These words relayed to the nuns by Ghezzi make them deliriously happy Television news this evening carries scenes of rioting in Rome and Bologna then shifts to a story about a caucus of women in the feminist movement One of them pleasantlooking yet nervously flipping her hair back and forth declares the decision that you have to have male sex organs to be a priest doesnt make any sense since they also say that priests cant use them It simply shows she says that they dont accept women as equal Theyre scared women will end up acting like the original Eve The set is turned off and the Pope and his companions sit in silence Ghezzi brings in some yin santo and everyone takes a small glass Don Macchi suggests that the woman doesnt know how the Holy Father really feels and the Pope nods He has tried to make his position clear in many talks private and public He feels the same way now Christ chose His apostles only from men The church has imitated Christ in choosing only men We cannot change our Lords actions or His call to women to follow Christ as beloved disciples and coworkers  Its not that women are inferior to men I know that some feminist groups suspect we want to confine women to austere limited tasks within the family blocking their talents in other fields  yet they are overreacting against the woman in the home Is it realistic is it wise to fall from one excess to another Going their way you risk masculinizing or depersonalizing women All mothers are in a way one mother To mine I owe a sense of recollection of inner life of pondered prayer She gave me the example of the completely dedicated life In my father this was translated into action and in my mother into silence We all live from what woman has taught us of Shortly after this Paul rises to return to his study Its the hour of classical music inner reflection of letters to old friends the family notes in his diaryand perhaps a phone call to someone who is ill or in need of a few words The secretary who operates the hifi for the Holy Father wonders if hed like to hear Jesus Christ Superstar No Paul doesnt want it now The song of Mary Magdalene I Dont Know How to Love Him has an inspired beauty but tonight he would prefer some Mozart no better some Chopin preludes Now in the study seated at his desk and seeing the faces of his parents and some other loved members of the family he can repair his own self All day he has given himself to the church to the world Now he can turn to his inner priesthood become a pastor of his own soul try to make it equal to the universe to a total concept of God There isnt much time left He is nearing the end zone As one advances in time climbing upward the horizon becomes more vast Time is more dense intense more collected Everything seems to rush forward upward toward a mysterious moment Much later he comes upon a letter from a parish in a furor area of Rome What a strabge beginning Dear New Father and Holy Father Don Vitlorino says I can begin that way and hes writing this for me Im the blind boy you asked to pray for you because you are my father now I dont know where my real father is I never knew but I know who he is now after what happened When you put your hand on my brow I thought its my eyes if he touches my eyes maybe a miracle will happen Then you kissed me and at first I thought maybe it was someone else until you said Coraggio my son  Suddenly I felt warm where you had touched me and when you said we would pray like father and son I knew a miracle had happened I still was blind in my eyes but I had found a father someone to hold me So I feel less alone at night Yes Father sweet Father of mine I am praying for you now and I am happy knowing you are praying for me Goodbye  goodnight May God come to you in your dreams as you come to me in mine Your devoted son Nando It is after 130 when Paul rises from his desk His face is drawn tired He walks clown the corridor toward the chapel Entering he kneels to say his last prayers of the day From St Peters Square you can see a little patch of light against the dark sky Then suddenly it is gone

Churches in a Time of Challenge,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/10/archives/connecticut-weekly-churches-in-a-time-of-challenge-churches-find.html,THIS EASTER weekend in Connecticut more than two million Christianstwo out of every three citizens of the statewill flock to 2000 houses of worship to proclaim their belief in Christs resurrection Although the figure is considerably higher than the national average of 40 percent of Americans attending churches or synagogues in a typical week the great surge of worship that attends this profoundly holy day takes place this year against a background of problems and questions that confront organized religion in the state In Connecticut where approximately 100 different Christian denominations reflect a diversity whose origins may be traced to the states earliest colonists organized religiondespite its good resolvesis faced by criticism of its performance and among others by social educational and financial challenges Challenge though is being met by response Most prominently there the newly formed Christian Conference of Connecticut established by the three Roman Catholic Dioceses the Connecticut Diocese of the Episcopal Church and the seven major Protestant Church bodies We view the formation of the Christian Conference of Connecticut as a turning point in the history of cooperation between Christian churches on a statewide basis said Dr Nathanael ecumenical organization Never before said Dr Guptill minister of the Connecticut Conference of the United Church of Christ Protestant denomination with 120000 adult members has there been a vehicle to bring together the chief executives of so many of our Christian churches in Connecticut Within the state there are according to the Connecticut Catholic Directory 1354508 Roman Catholics or nearly 45 percent of the total population The United Methodist Church records 53000 members in the state Among the participants in the newly formed Christian Conference of Connecticut there are the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church the American Baptist Churches of Connecticut 42000 members the Episcopal Church 107000 members the Lutheran Church in America 75000 members the Salvation Army and the United Presbyterian Church in the USA What are some of the questions problems and challenges that face these churches Not only do they involve the future in general but they also consist of such specific question as the following Are the churches performing their missionto respond to the needs of all people who are spiritually and physically oppressed Are they reaching out sufficiently to the young What about the role of women in the church Abortion Birth control The problems of those on welfare and fixed incomes Where are the priests and ministers of tomorrow to come from What is to be done about religious education How are minorities to identify with the major church denominations What about the financial problems of maintaining huge houses of worship Many of these churches and cathedrals are monuments to the philanthropic generosity of early industrialists Now with maintenance costs tremendously increased their upkeep has become burdensome In one church remarkable for the beautiful stainedglass windows donated by early benefactors the required insurance coverage for the building exceeds 2 million and calls for an annual premium of several thousand dollars The congregation numbers 1000 At another church with a school and gymnasium fuel costs have already tripled in five years Amid concern over genuine issues there is optimism There are positive trends that indicate religious renewal of the sort that has been traditional in Christianity and Judaism during periods of the deepest despair In personal religious activity there are varied informal worship activities There is identification with the total community and cooperation and concern shared by clergy and laity For example in Operation Fuel statewide collection of private agencies including churches organized labor insurance companies and industry addressed itself to helping the working poor the recently unemployed and the elderly living on fixed income by providing fuel during the harsh winter just past Ably directed by the Chancellor of the Archdiocese of Hartford the Rev Thomas J Lynch the effort resulted in the collection of some 170000 of which 80000 came from churches throughout Connecticut In the realm of collective organizational cooperation the new state ecumenical organization unlike any other in the nation is not the lone example There are also several metropolitan ecumenical organizations that bring together cooperating local congregations the Capital Region Conference of Churches in Hartford the New Britain area Conference of Churches and the Council of Churches of Greater Bridgeport In New Britain the two congregations that form the South CongregationFirst Baptist Church have retained their separate identities They have separate bylaws and their own incorporations Yet they worship together both congregations at one worship service All organizational and programmatic endeavors are cooperative Their social action committee consists of 18 members 12 of them from the Congregational congregation Personal commitment to faith remains essential If religious faith is to continue to have a positive impact on contemporary life it will be directly proportionate to this personal commitment At the same time attention must be given to specific and concrete political and social events that involve the church and people with spiritual commitments the continuing growth of the gap between rich and the poor changes in the structures of work and leisure the development of subtle techniques of social control and pressures to apply them to previously private realms of life regionalization of government programs diversified forms of worship educational programs enabling comprehension articulation and application of personal faith continued support of cooperative church ventures technological advances demanding moral decisions and the very invention of futurist planning itself and the type of rationality it implies The Christian church in Connecticut is facing its challenges without dismay There is a great hunger in people for something that enables them to face and surmount the problems of life said the Rev Dr Orlando Tibbetts Executive Minister of the American Baptist Churches of Connecticut The Churchis the guardian of the answer its most glcrious hours are ahead
Ecumenism: Just Lip Service?,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/10/archives/new-jersey-weekly-ecumenism-just-lip-service-ecumenism-just-lip.html,DESPITE decades of effort and substantial progress in reducing tensions between religious groups serious barriers and significant differences still plague interfaith understanding among New Jerseys Roman Catholics Protestants and Jews This is the conclusion of a recent study of the attitudes of New Jerseys clergy The states religious leaders agree almost unanimously that they have gained new appreciation from other religious traditions but they show little evidence of actually acting upon this interfaith understanding They also contend that the laity is much less knowledgeable and sympathetic to other religious faiths than the clergy Im encouraged by the clergys sense of progress said Dr James R Kelly a professor of sociology at Fordham University and director of the project which was sponsored by the National Conference of Christians and Jews and the Ecumenical Studies Institute of Scion Hall University But Im also discouraged by the lack of behavioral change Dr Kelly added Its clear that ecumenical understanding is pretty atmospheric The Rev Paul L Stagg general secretary of the New Jersey Council of Churches agrees Who could be againsta holy word like ecumenism he asked Its like motherhood The clergy may be kind and understanding but they really are not very interested in doing things together John M Mulder is Assistant Professor of American Church History at Princeton Theological Seminary and assistant editor of Theology Today The study was conducted by sampling New Jerseys Roman Catholic Jewish and Protestan clergy through lists provided by organizations of the three major faiths Responses were obtained from 415 religious leaders more than 50 percent of the sample Ministers priests and rabbis report that they have increased in their knowledge and appreciation of other faiths and they say they have an adequate understanding of different traditions Catholics and Protestants also believe that they have far more in common than members of each group realize However the study found virtually no relationship between professed ecumenical interest and membership in an interfaith organization and more than 60 percent of each religious group acknowledged that they had read only one or two books about another religious tradition in the last three years Even the level of leading about ones own faith was very low with the ception of rabbis Protestant members of the clergy were once considered members of a learned profession but a third acknowledge that they have read fewer than three books about Protestantism in the last three years Similarly nearly onequarter of the Catholic priests report virtually no reading of books in their own tradition Theres not much reading going onperiod Mr Stagg said Im not sure whether traditions mean much today Clergy are caught up in pragmatic decisions and getting things done in their congregations New Jerseys clergy also sees evidence of widespread disinterest and misunderstanding among the laity and the members of the clergy say that this lack of lay appreciation includes not only other religious faiths but also their own Differences between Christians and Jews are also viewed as much clearer and much more serious than those between Christians For example the Christian clergy overwhelmingly agrees that its members would have no difficulty in voting for a qualified Jewish Presidential candidate but a majority of the Christian clergy and nearly all the rabbis agree that most Christian lay people wouldnt vote for such a candidate In addition 71 percent of the Catholic priests and 57 percent of the Protestant ministers felt that Jews will brand anyone who speaks against Israel as an antiSemite Fortyseven percent of the rabbis disagreed Rabbis also reported that intermarriage between Christians and Jews attempts at converting Jews to Christianity and the use of religious symbols in public places were divisive religious issues but Catholics and Protestants did not see these as significant Instead the Christian clergy saw abortion and aid to parochial schools as the most significant disruptive issues Priests and ministers acknowledged that marriage between Catholics and Protestants was no longer a source of irritation between the two Christian raditions I hate to use the term but I think we have to realize that there is a lot of latent antiSemitism said Mr Stagg a Baptist minister The historic link between the Christian faith and Judaism is not seen as very strong We as Protestants have lost our Jewishness Dr Kelly noted that Christian clergy really dont understand the sense of the land as survival in Israel and Jidairm and Jack L Marrero vice president for national program development of the National Conference of Christians and Jews believes that Christians dont understand the intensity of Jewish feeling about Israel This is a very revealing finding Paul Volker of the Council of Churches doubts that the differences between the clergy and laity on such issues are real Actually he says I think that these are probably the clergys own attitudes and this is demonstrated by their lack of concern and involvement Dr John Radano director of the Ecumenical Studies Institute at Seton Hall thinks that this may be the clergy transferring their own weaknesses to the laity The study also demonstrated that there were basic differences between the clergy on questtons of morality and public policy Only 21 percent of the Catholic priests said they would support abortion in some circumstances and 71 percent categorically opposed it In contrast only 4 percent of the Protestant ministers and 2 percent of the rabbis opposed all abortions While only about 40 percent of the Protestants and Jews support the 1973 Supreme Court decision on abortion most would acknowledge the necessity of abortion under some conditions A similar pattern was demonstrated in attitudes toward the Supreme Court decisions on church and state Sixtytwo percent of the rabbis agree strongly that the Courts decisions had been fair but only 32 percent of the Protestant ministers reached the same conclusion and 28 percent agree slightly with the fairness of the Court Catholics apparently influenced by the issues of parochial schools and abortion overwhelmingly disagree Sixtythree percent of the Catholic priests do not find the churchstate decisions fair The study also shows that New Jerseys clergy sees issues of general morality rather than specific problems as important Only two topics demonstrated broad concern unemployment and a decline in public morality Loss of religious belief and corruption in government also prompted considerable dissatisfaction Compared with a few years ago race relations and war were not rated as particularly pressing problems and the clergy showed little interest in womens rights or the role of women in the church They seriously underestimated the outcry about women Dr Kelly said Mr Marrero warned that this is an issue that isnt going to go away and people will have to face up to it Despite the sobering findings of the study Dr Kelly also discovered that at least in theory many religious leaders accepted the principle of religious toleration and even possible union between the various Christian churches Catholic priests are the most optimistic and 65 percent of them expect an eventual union between Catholics and Protestants Only 12 percent of the Protestants considered this a possibility and less than a majority envisioned even an institutional union of all Protestants Jews were more pessimistic and only 9 percent of the rabbis saw CatholicProtestant unity as possible And yet with the exception of the Baptists Protestants and Catholics indicated that they would be pleased by the creation of one Christian church Acknowledging that Catholics were somewhat dreamy ecumenists and that Protestants were weary with ecumenical dreams Dr Kelly was encouraged by the studys results Theres more realism now he said People are refusing to say that ecumenical understanding is utopian Dr Kelly also noted that the study found no relationship between a relativistic attitude toward religious ideas and support for interfaith understanding Ideally he says ecumenism can be a means of deepening ones own faith and identity We have to realize there is a lot of latent antiSemitism Mr Marrero of the National Conference of Christians and Jews was heartened by the study but he insisted We still have a long way to go in implementing the First Amendment People dont understand that religious freedom is directly connected with freedom of speech and freedom of the press Dr Kelly and religious leaders of interfaith organizations agree that the churches face a serious educational problem in reducing tensions and misunderstandings between religious groups both the clergy and lay people The New Jersey chapter of the National Conference of Christians and Jews is currently sponsoring a series of seminars throughout the state to stimulate interest but few similar efforts are being made by Christian groups  We are going through a period of openness to other religious faiths said Radano of Seton Hall but we need follow up with a program of serious ecumenical education The ecumenical movernent has made some impact in changing attitudes and we need to follow through with action Sir Volker maintains that theres always going to be a permanent tension in American life between religious freedom and individual conscience but we must have more dialogue and interfaith activities Dr Kelly was not surprised by the persistence of religious misunderstanding and stereotypes disclosed in the study but he remains optimistic Ecumenism is absolutely essential he said You cant expect religious groups to be in conflict and help the world at the same time

United States Supreme Court ruling that required public officials to prove malicious intent on the part of the publication in order to win a libel judgment The suit stemmed from an article in the newspaper concerning a July 6 1973 meeting of the Board of Aldermen at which Lerel Stewart another Alderman objected to a proposed ordinance to require certain equipment at clinics that perform abortions Mrs Stewart said that she had had two abortions and did not believe such equipment should be required After the meeting Mrs Stewart said that she had misspoken and that she actually had had

Women Gamblers Are Starting to Seek Help for Their Long‐Hidden Problem,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/16/archives/women-gamblers-are-starting-to-seek-help-for-their-longhidden.html,When Betty B was a child her father would take her to poker games The men would have her cut the cards for luck and give her coins She learned to play by watching By the time she was a teenager she was gambling with her lunch money Now some 40 years later she said she has gone through an estimated 500000 including 92000 she inherited from her first husband and 52000 taken from joint savings accounts with her present husband Women compulsive gamblers today probably are in the same place women alcoholics were a decade ago their problems hidden from public view by their families and just beginning to seek help according to Dr Robert Custer a psychiatrist who has worked with more than 200 male gamblers through the Veterans Administration and with 10 women who were not veterans So much more is expected in our society [of a woman] in terms of preserving and saving he said The male is expected to be riskier and take chances I think all it does is delay treatment The woman whose gambling becomes compulsive will end up where most men do he said but the development appears to differ somewhat He said women usually learned gambling from a male companion or a husband whereas men usually learned at an earlier lige from their peers They start later said Dr Custer of women They are also good gainHers They conic along slowly and dont become reckless as fast He said a compulsive gambler was someone who had a psychological need to gamble who in the later stages was usually enmeshed in a desperate exhausting tangle of lies and debts and was frequently relieved to be found out Women compulsive gamblers like their male counterparts come from all walks of life he said All of the women he treated he said were housewives and seemed to have been suffering from a mild depression when they began gambling for excitement Dr Custer said he was amazed at the way housewives used their household money as leverage to bet up to 500 a week He said they were adept at juggling bills from charge cards and finance companies and were frequently in debt to relatives Need to Be Organized Gradually he said the familys activities tended to center around the womans need for easy access to gambling There might be fewer social activities She had to be highly organized to allow time to place bets find out results and keep bills from her husband Children he said almost always knew the mother was gambling but husbands were usually surprised In a sense the husband might be happy that the wife was occupied and not bored and not wanting to be taken out said Dr Custer But the children knew it They knew they didnt have her undivided attention Dr Maureen Kallick project director at the Survey Research Center Institute for Social Research at the Univer sity of Michigan said a study by the center estimated that in 1974 there were 687500 men compulsive gamblers and 312500 women Betty B was in gamblers terms tapped out in debt to everyone she knew when she went to Gamblers Anonymous a selfhelp group patterned after Alcoholics Anonymous Nationwide the group has about 6500 members about 5 percent of them women The night she went to a local Brooklyn chapter she was the orly woman there and she vowed that if she was helped she would help others Today there are several women in the chapter which meets at the Gravesend Reform Church Informally the women have become known as Bettys Belles They are former card players horse players and even one compulsive bingo player who was spending about 40 a day to play twice a day seven days a week I loved it explained Betty B I felt more comfortable when I sat down at a card game I loved the bigshot role I loved the attention They had my coffee there and my brand of cigarettes It was love People catering to me I loved the attention Betty B the youngest of eight children quit school in the ninth grade to care for her invalid mother When her mother died her father remarried Betty went to live with an older married sister then left She lived in 30 states mostly working as a waitress In Nevada she said I really got hooked In San Francisco she married the ownerof the restaurant and bar where she worked He was 25 years older than she and had a heart condition When he was in the hospital she gambled easily when he was out she had the bartender steal for her One day her husband was playing poker and she wanted to join the game He said no She brushed the cards off the table He grabbed her arm then his chest She thought he was faking Die she said He did Four months later she said she had gambled away the 92000 he left her in stocks insurance and the business She had not seen her family in 13 years A policeman she knew suggested she call home IThey sent her money to come home She gambled with it They sent more Again she gambled it away They sent a ticket She came home She lived with her sister and brotherinlaw on Long Island and started playing cards with wealthy suburban women Before long she was using her sisters checking account She also would tell each of her four brothers she needed 500 and swore each to secrecy She said they thought she needed the money for an abortion Family Felt Responsible They always felt that because I was homeless they were responsible she said They blamed themselves for my life In 1962 she married a Brooklyn man who works in the shipping industry Her family did not tell him about her gambling She began using his savings accounts and hiding the bank statements Once she went on a fiveday gam bling marathon He got the statements but thought she had been kidnapped The savings were gone and she owed the owner of one club 6500 She came home repentant She said he thought it was the first time this had happened to her that the devil had gotten into her For 18 months she gambled only socially Her husband started to save again Then one day the telephone rang Betty this game is going on a beautiful game she recalled a friend saying My heart started to throb I grabbed that bankbook Another 5Day Spree She was off on another fiveday spree When she was losing she would leave a game making everyone promise to save her seat take a cab borrow money and come back She borrowed from club owners shylocks friends At one point she had won 12000 but she ended up losing 20000 A woman in the game suggested they go to her apartment to freshen up Betty B looked at that womans home The furniture was shabby plaster was falling I saw an apartment I never dreamed could exist she said I looked around and I thought Is this my life I knew right then there was no place to turn I had to take my life She planned to check into a hotel and jump out a window But she wanted to hear her husbands voice one more time Where are you honey he asked Why didnt you help me she screamed Im sick You knew I was sick He told her to come home that he would help her She came home and the next night they went to Gamblers Anonymous This is how my life started she said and its been a wonderful life for 20 months Gamblers Anonymous has a network of telephone numbers that members can call if they feel the urge to gamble About a month after she joined they held a pressure group for her Members came to her home went over her debts and helped Betty B and her husband work out a settlement She negotiated agreements with some of her creditors Today her debts are down to 4000 Her husband in his 50s had planned to retire early They were going to buy a condominium This is out of the question now but she said that for the first time in her life I found a peace of mind I never had
BIRTH CONTROL DRIVE EXTENDED IN BRAZIL,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/17/archives/birth-control-drive-extended-in-brazil-local-women-in-northeast.html,RECIFE Brazil April 12Brazils private familyplanning organization is extending birthcontrol methods into impoverished rural areas of this populous northeast region through a community program based on local women as promoters With free distribution of contraceptive pills reaching thousands of women in the states of Pernambuco Paraiba Rio Grande do Norte and Alagoas many traditional attitudes on family size sexual customs and relations between men and women are being challenged This program encounters all the taboos of the prevalent machismo which expresses itself in men who want their women to have large families as a demonstration of fidelity said Katalin Gabriela Maria Cser a social worker from Rio de Janeiro in charge of training women volunteers as local educators and distributors In this region the poorest of Brazil where up to two of every 10 children die by the age of four because of endemic disease and malnutrition the promoters of family planning have foUnd many allies among state and local officials as well as village volunteers One of these officials is Dr Pedro Veloso Costa secretary of public health of Pernambuco who signed an agreement extending to all 1064 municipalities in the state the birthcontrol program of BENFAM the Brazilian familyplanning organization affiliated with the International Planned Parenthood Federation Nobody can continue having the numerous families of 10 to 15 children that we used to have in the northeast said Dr Veloso Costa who is a retired rear admiral as well as a physician It is in the interest of the parents the children and the community that the population explosion be controlled The Brazilian Government under President Ernesto Geisel has an ambiguous policy on family planning and population growth which is a politically sensitive issue in this country of 110 million people that has a huge undeveloped interior The Government does not oppose the right of those persons who want family planning to do so but it does not sponsor birth control said Planning Minister Joo Paulo Reis Veloso in Brasilia The lack of a federal familyplanning program is attributed to political opposition from the Roman Catholic hierarchy and to the view of some nationalists that Brazil should rapidly increase its population to occupy empty areas for security reasons Dr Wilson Rodriguez the executive secretary of BENFAM applies a different criterion to the problem of uncontrolled family size among the poorest half of the population The organization with headquarters in Rio de Janeiro has emphazised since 1966 the public health consequences of an estimated 500000 abortions by women each year and the crippling effect on children of malnutrition and disease in urban slums and backward rural areas Eventually the Government will have to assume responsibility said Dr Rodriguez a professor of obstetrics whose small staff works in an old colonial house What BENFAM is doing is intended to make family planning politically acceptable In Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte the gain in political acceptance is evident in the support given the organizations work by nearly all the mayors One of these mayors Manuel Irineu da Rocha of the municipality of Joaquim Nabuco personally drove two women volunteers from his town to a threeday training session here for 15 women who will distribute pills and provide education in their communities When they come back I will send out the towns loudspeaker car all over the back roads and tell the people that family planning has begun in Joaquim Nabuco the mayor said The volunteers were a high school student Joanette Ferreiros and Josefa de Menezes a schoolteacher who has two children My last child was by caesarean and I dont want any more Mrs Menezes said My husband who is a truckdriver agrees Another volunteer is Ana Marla Teixeira de Brito a school supervisor She said that she had borne nine children during her marriage six of whom are alive and three that went away Such a rate of infant mortality is commonplace in northeastern families Dr Marco Pereira who is the medical adviser to BENFAM in Pernambuco is one of 12 brothers and sisters His mother bore 21 children His wife Denise Barboza a lawyer who directs the organizations office for Pernambuco said that the community program is aimed at the poor rural women who lack sufficient information and money to purchase contraceptive pills which sell in pharmacies for about 1 for a months supply One reason there are so many unwanted children is that the women dont know about contraception but there is also a basic need for educating the men said Mrs Barboza who has three very wellplanned children Pills should not have to be taken secretly by the women BENFAM agreements with about 450 municipalities in Brazil provide contraceptive pills to public health centers and pay for the training of the volunteers who are mainly teachers and midwives registered with the public health authorities The number of women reached by the program is estimated to be around 250000 a month This is a small fraction of Brazilian women in childbearing age estimated at 30 million But a far greater number of women in the urban working class as well as the middle class are regulating childbirth on their own The sales of contraceptive pills produced by pharmaceutical companies are estimated at more than 6 million a year Intrauterine loops are not currently authorized as imports and are not licensed for local use All State Communities Included Church Opposition Cited Mayor Is Committed Educating the Men
Between Guilt and Gratification:,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/17/archives/between-guilt-and-gratification-abortion-doctors-reveal-their.html,Enter a typical New York abortion clinic and you will see a sight never witnessed beforewaiting rooms filled with hundreds of young women all of whom will ter minate their pregnancies that day Most of them sit silent and alone A few talk quietly with a male companion perhaps the father of the soontobeaborted fetus Almost no one bothers to look through the magazines on the table No one stares inquisitively at her neighbors It is a wretched time of waiting when even the woman who is absolutely certain she does not want her child is emotionally torn But for these women the wait is short and the abortion itself at least when the fetus is less than three months old takes only a few minutes After several hours rest and a checkup the women can leave But what about the doctors After only 10 minutes each doctor goes on to the next abortion He may perform hundreds each month thousands each year As I pass through the waiting room it occurs to me that while no accomplice to the deed can experience anything like the particular quality of pain of the woman electing to terminate her pregnancy it is undoubtedly the doctor who bears the brunt of quantity How does he feel Letters and articles in medical journals reveal that there may be a new abortiontrauma in the land  not where one expects it in the psyche of the pregnant woman but in the psyche of the doctor who performs this legal and muchdesired operation Little has been heard about the feelings of those who perform abortions Doctors as a rule are not free with such information They did however respond to an article in the New England Journal of Medicine a while back by a doctor who resigned his job as head of a nonprofit abortion clinic in New York after a year and a half and 60000 successful abortions I am deeply troubled Dr Bernard N Nathanson wrote by my own increasing certainty that I had in fact presided over 60000 deaths With this quote in mind I recently went to several gynecologists and obstetricians who have also performed abortions in great numbers to ask them about their feelings I found the doctors reactions to performing abortions varied widely At one extreme there was guilt and despair the doctors admitted to heavy drinking and complained of nightmares which they ascribed to the nature of the work the sheer monotony of it and the pressure of performing great numbers of abortions One doctor had a fantasy in the midst of every abortion He imagined that the fetus was resisting its own aborting hanging onto the walls of the uterus with its tiny fingernails fighting to stay inside The doctor said he suffered the fantasy in silence worked steadily from procedure to procedure completed the operation and then went on to the next patientand the same fantasy At the other extreme are doctors who derive great gratification from their work They recall with horror the era before abortions were legal They feel they are saving womens lives both emotionally and physically Lives that would have been lost before this decade As one doctor put it There are women who after two children are begging please he pressed his palms together in prayerlet me live a life now Apparently feeling guiltless these doctors are positive about what they do For them much of the idealism associated with delivering babies has gone into their fetusaborting skills Firsttrimester abortions are generally done in outpatient clinics by means of aspiration or suction technique In the later weeks saline solution is substituted for the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus in a hospital procedure known in medical jargon as salting out When I questioned the head of a public clinic about these secondtrimester abortions he shrugged enigmatically He does not perform them Although he has long been associated with family planning and proabortion efforts he like Melvilles Bartleby prefers not to Nevertheless of all the heads of clinics I interviewed not one wanted for a moment to return to the butcheries they had witnessed in prelegalized abortion days The choice the doctors said repeatedly was not between abortion and no abortion but between legal and illegal abortions And that in their view is no choice at all Dr Howard I Diamond associate attending physician at Beth Israel Medical Center and assistant professor at New York University Medical School invited me to the Paricmed Clinic in the East 30s where he was about to perform an abortion for a private patient He wanted me to see for myself that theres nothing to it Generally evenvoiced and in control Dr Diamond showed signs of losing his temper I asked how he responded to doctors who express painful feelings about abortion and he replied with heat What about people starving in the South What about all the deaths in Vietnam Where were the righttolifers then Dont tell me theyve got reverence for life they dont give a damn Not righttolifers I protested Doctors who believe in abortion The impact of the whole thing upsets them The exchange of letters in medical journals   Why should they feel that way he asked His manner returned to its normal casualness Before going into medicine he had wanted a career on the stage and there was still something of the cool performer about him Culturalits all cultural Like eat ing snake meat If you tell yourself its disgusting youll get sick He astonished me with his refusal to acknowledge a tremor when others have testified to anguish In preabortion days Dr Diamond was every primiparas dream He took no vacations lest one of his patients go unexpectedly into labor When as his patient I last saw him 14 years ago a successful obstetrics practice had put deep rings under his eyes and notimetoeatcoffee cakechubbiness on his frame Now that I am no longer his patient Dr Diamond talks to me freely about his unhappy past lifethe fact he had had cancer a mother who died when he was seven years old a father who never demonstrated affection and knew nothing but work The advent of the abortion law coincided with a break in the unhappy pattern of his life His father died freeing me from an unremitting work ethos And his cancer re sponded to treatment and was arrested These days he is lean stylishly tailored and has joined in practice with a partner He has also taken his first vacation Dr Diamond is now obsessed with the idea of human happiness Abortion is a way of making people happy No conditions ought to be imposed on that I quoted from Dr Nathansons statement and then asked Did you ever feel anything at all like that If I feel anything I feel gratified the doctor explained Abortion is much more important than the life of a child that doesnt exist When I saw how simple a procedure it was I thought what a crime that women have suffered and gone down in shame A fetus is nothing The talk about abortion doesnt touch on the reality of what goes on out there It doesnt touch on the 16yearold whose mother took away her birth control pills because she did poorly on her examinations does it What about the fighting back of the fetus thats been observed when the needle that injects saline solution pierces it by mistake I asked Neurological reaction You wont get me to say Im sorry for the fetus I feel sorry for a starving cat I feel terrihle about a mistreated child An unloved childthats sad If you lose a baby you wantthats sad A fetus that nobody wantsthats not sad What about those who feel we are losing our commitment to human seed I dont feel a damn thing about seed exclaimed Dr DiamondMaybe if youre a male chauvinist seed is important more important than the life of the mother Not to me I dont get mystical about seed Only about whats human What is human Consciousness Pain Desire When a baby loves its mother When it smiles He smiledtoo While Dr Diamond got ready for his patient I reflected on certain details of abortion legislation that have made all this possible The continued efforts of righttolifers to cancel out proabortion legislation by means of a constitutional amendment make it hard to remember that the abortion fight was supposed to have ended with the Supreme Court ruling in January 1973 Abortion was a matter to be decided between a woman and her doctor only in the last trimester of pregnancy after 24 weeks could the law intervene designating the fetus as viable able to live outside the mothers body In the four years since abortions have become legal on a national scale they have bean performed at the rate of about one million a year From 1970 until 1973 slates like New York and California which already had legalized abortion were carrying the burden for the whole country The scene then as one nurse described it to me was just wild The doctors office turned into an overnight clinic Women flew in from all parts of the countryeven the world Now that the rest of the country has abotionfacilities New York has settled down to a steady business of thriving clinics both public and such Parkmed On the way to the procedure room Dr Diamond recalled two occasions when he had to impose conditions The first was in the case of a woman who was an Orthodox Jew She had given birth to 10 children and was now pregnant with the 1 1 th She hoped to obtain a medical reason for abort ion which she could present to her rabbi I told her I wouldnt give her a medical reason She was healthy I also told her shed he crazy to have another child I said Id he happy to do the abortion but I wanted her to do it honestly for the right reason She wouldnt do that He paused So now she has 11 And the other time That was when a doctor I knew said his wife had gotten pregnant at the wrong time They planned to con ceive a child but not until three months later So they wanted this one out and theyd start again when it was convenient I said Youre crazy Forget it And did they Probably not They probably went to someone else Doctors call those clinics whose only surgical procedure is pregnancy  termination abortion mills a phrase that conveys the medical professions old contempt for illegal abortionists But there is nothing milllike about Parkmed Bright clean pleasant with music in the recovery room sunlight in the lounge where small groups of patients are instructed in postabortion care it seems lightyears away from the pre1970 abortion experience back alleys filth pain mutilation death Dr Milton Danon chief of Parkmed hurried over to withdraw Dr Diamonds breezy invitation to me to see for myself Im sorry Too dangerous You might faint and hit your head Even people being trained sometimes pass out Why was that I wondered looking about the room Could it he the sight of the familiar table with its leg irons Someone was on the table her sheet  covered legs already raised into the vulnerable gynecological V The woman had been wondering out loud about the sex of her fetus Now she was silent and trembling The nurse soothed her It will soon be over Or was it the suction machine Knobs tubes long trailing hoses Or the twin glass bottles like water cool ers to be filled with fetal matter I was not sorry to leave I suppose Dr Diamond called after mein his offhand way you ought to talk to Billy He talks about that kind of stuff Billy turned out to be Dr William Rashbaum chief of Family Planning Services at Beth Israel Medical Center and a member of the faculty of Albert Einstein College of Medicine He has performed thousands of abortions mostly for patients in public clinics but for private patients as well And he was indeed willing to talk about that kind of stuff The fantasy of the fetus hanging onto the walls of the uterus with tiny fingernails was his Dr Rashbaum is a short man with a piercing blue stare He has a dramatic way of lowering his imposinglooking head while simultaneously raising his eyes Around Dr Rashbaums neck was a delicate macrame band on which was strung a scrimshaw whistle I admired it He told me with evident satisfaction that he had made it himself Youre talking to an exmalechauvinist pig and it cost me one painful divorce to learn my lesson By the way are you Miss or Mrs or do you prefer Ms Im not one of those doctors who says Im Dr Soandso youre Judy Dr Rashbaum told me he had remarried his wife is a psychologist Each of them has children by a previous marriage When he suggested to his present wife that they have a child together she said she was willing If youll give birth to it They never had the child He further established his credentials as a profeminist abortionist or in the preferred language of doctors specialist in pregnancy termination by recalling the terrible time before July 1970the horrible cases I saw that we all saw then I asked if he would comment on Dr Nathansons presiding over 60000 deaths quote He answered that he did not value the sanctity of the fetus Ive seen too many troubled unwanted children Nor did he still have his fetus fantasy though he said it took a long time to go away How did you manage while you had it Learned to live with it Like people concentration camps Do you really mean that analogy I think its aptdestruction of life Look a passion that seemed just under the surface eruptedIm a person Im entitled to my feelings And my feelings are who gave me or anybody the right to terminate a pregnancy Im entitled to that feeling but I also have no right to communicate it to the patient who desperately needs that abortion I dont get paid for my feelings I get paid for my skills What I also feel is that my contribution to society through abortion is greater than it was when I was doing only obstetrics when I was delivering unwanted children along with the wanted and the woman quote he says with heavy sarcasm learned to love the child Ill be frank I began to do abortions in larger numbers at the time of my divorce when I needed money But I also believe in the womans right to control her biological destiny I spent a lot of years learning to deliver babies Sure it sometimes hurts to end life instead of bringing it into the world But Im very good at this stuff too Those 24week fetuses are mostly in the bellies of teenagerstheyre children themselvesAnd their pathos far outweighs anybodys thoughts about the fetus When I deliver a baby now I know its because a woman wants it That means a lot to me Having used the quotation about 60000 deaths with each doctor thus far I finally went to see its author Dr Bernard Nathanson tall and gruffly handsome is something of a Renaissance mana scientist who is also a poet He once taught a course in James Joyce at a university and he considers himself a follower of the 18thcentury Italian philosopher Vico who wrote about cyclical development and the collapse of civilizations Dr Nathanson now associate attending obstetrician gynecologist at New York Hospital and senior obstetriciangynecologist at St Lukes Hospital sat behind a polished desk in his East Side office sunk his cheek into his palm and looked glumly at me as if things had already gone far beyond this foolish stage of question and answer But instead of asking a question I described a little scene I had witnessed In the waiting room of one of the abortion clinics Among the hundreds of women waiting to be aborted there was a young man with long yellow hair pulled back into a pony tail On his knees he balanced a small loom and he was peacefully passing a ball of while wool hack and forth among the strands Dr Nathansons response was large First he tilted back and laughed Next he leaned forward and shook his head Then he said with a mixture of something like bitterness and awe They want it all Hes hack to handweaving while his girlfriend or wife is inside with the most sophisticated kind of suctioning machine Do you suppose he thinks about that Until last year Dr Nathanson had been head of obstetrics at St Lukes Hospital He had also been the administrator of the clinic to whom attending doctors reported their nightmares their dreams of blood Since that time he has refused to practice in massabortion clinics though he does perform abortions for his private patients Of course women have to have abortions I was one of the militants who demanded repeal of the abortion laws But I am fearful about what will happen to the moral tension of lifeto peopleas a result of all this utilitarianism A species of human life is being taken and almost no one except the extremists the ones opposed to abortion are paying any attention There is evidence of heart function in embryos as early as six weeks Recordings of brain activity at eight weeks The fetus hears and changes movement in response to sound Its possible the fetus has an order of consciousness that we dont know yet We need humility I have profound respect for what we dont know Whats to be done then There are two rights The right of the mother and the right of the fetus We must develop technology that will allow us to abort the fetus without killing it We need lifesupport systems that will keep the aborted fetus developingyes at 10 weeks at eightuntil its ready to be born and can be adopted by one of those desperate couples for whom there are now no babies available I felt stunned at the sugeestion It was too great a leap for me Do we want all those fetuses even if they can somehow be kept from brain damage growing up in what seems like a nightmare nursery full of abortions Terribly difficult existential problems said Dr Na thanson How many people are worrying about it Some body has to think about these things One day America will wake up to the idea that the family is gone That there is no stability There is only divorce contraception and abortion You know what will happen then Panic in the streets As I leave Dr Nathansons office I find myself wondering why doctors dont devote more time to finding safer contraceptives though of course doctors have no control over couples who forget to use them or who scorn them outright for the sake of sexual challenge entrapment or potencybragging The fact is Abortions are with us Some doctors restrict themselves solely to the practice of abortion for reasons of money andor convenience Those who do so incur the contempt of their colleagues who feel that years of classical training in obstetrics and gynecology are reduced to a monotonous technicians job However the doctors who consented to be quoted here are idealistic and proudly professional men still devoting themselves to private obgyn practice The moral dilemma about abortion may be with us alwaysand with it the traumas and guilt But these responses must always be weighed against the great victory of legalized abortion that saves women from septicemia and death

Reflections on My Seven Years Of Being at Swords',https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/17/archives/reflections-on-my-seven-years-of-being-at-swords-points-reflections.html,In Avatars of the Tortoise Jorge Luis Borges said sadly There is a concept which corrupts and upsets all others I refer not to Evil whose limited realm is that of ethics I refer to the infinite I once longed to compile its mobile history The numerous Hydra the swamp monster which amounts to a prefiguration or emblem of geometric progressions would lend convenient horror to its portico it would be crowned by the sordid nightmares of Kafka Five or seven years of metaphysical theological and mathematical apprenticeship would allow me perhaps to plan decorously such a book It is useless to add that life forbids me that hope and even that adverb For seven years I have been trying to compile a mobile history of the only American infinite which is television In seven years I havent got past the swamp monster Think of it every night convenient horror A grown man spends seven years tethered to a piece of noisy furniture distinguishing between Hawaii fiveO and Delvecchio discriminating among Good Times Happy Days and The Partridge Family wondering whether Raymond Burr ever goes to the bathroom pining for Blythe Danner I lasted as long as Mary Tyler Moore and thats it If shes going Im not sticking around Let the gnomes of academe busy their decorous selves with monographs on the Golden Age of Situation Comedy Let theoreticians of the carchase drink frictionproofing and break out in rivets Im taking my sordid nightmares elsewhere Dave Scherman at Life magazine in 1970 dreamed up the idea of paying me to watch television Since TV was killing off Lifes advertising he may have wanted a kamikaze If so I failed in my mission The swamp monsterFred Silvermanwas bigger than both of us Or both mes For two years I signed my own name to those columns Then The New York Times which owned me and Life magazine which borrowed me came to a kind of Vladivostok agreement and I was henceforth Cyclops when sermonizing about television for the next four years Half the readers who bothered to comment on this changing of the nym congratulated Life for dumping me in favor of Cyclops the other four denounced Cyclops demanding my immediate return So much for a distinctive prose style Either way a certain schizophrenia was involved that had nothing to do with bylines On the one hand to review TV programs is much of the time to experience the self as nugatory You might as well be a weatherman reporting a day late a lowpressure Weltschmerz moved last night across the Waltons unbunching at least one Brady and leaving thousands of Efrem Zimbalists without an excuse meanwhile drought continues in the midKojak But everybody has already been weathered How can you be taken seriously if you are powerless to alter events or cloud mens minds By the time your comment appears in print the object of it will have vanished Or if it persists in a series millions of other people will have seen it too and made up their own minds If your reviews are read at all it is by those who seek a confirmation either of their own gut reaction to a new program or of their suspicion that you are a jerk You can no more review television according to agreedupon criteria than you can review old girlfriendsor compile a mobile history of the infinite The lout on the next barstool considers himself just as much an expert Get an honest job says your mother weave baskets find God sell Wacky Packs eat your Marcusian Rice Krispies On the other hand being paid to watch television means you dont have to apologize for doing what all your friends do secretly and feel guilty about It is a way of spending time with your children without having to read Babar aloud for the 157th repeat or running a staple through your thumb Your powerlessness itself is liberating you can say what you want about the play and the actors it wont close and they wont be fired on your account And since television is an infinite since it is about everythingpolitics sex sports comedy theater the ordinary routine of buses and historyyou can review everything Vertigo of possibility Moreover even if you are not taken seriously television ought to be Concluding his monumental threevolume history of broadcasting Erik Barnouw remarked Five hours a day 60 hours a weekfor millions television was merging with the environment Psychically it was the environment What did all this mean In fact its now up to six hours and eight minutes a day Thats how long the average set is on in the American home Ninetyseven percent of American homes have at least one set The average 16yearold has clocked more time watching television than he has spent in school TV Guide outsells every other magazine on the nations newsstands Thats more serious than venereal disease  It seemed to me that television which grew up to be what it is today by accident without longrange planning had done something in the process also by accident to the nation Just as our car culture our restless motoring required drivein restaurants and fastfood franchises filling stations of the stomach so our developing TV culture required fastfood distraction junk entertainment psychic beef patties The livingroom was converted into a kind of car the TV screen was its windshield every home was mobile everybody was in the drivers seat and we all saw the same sights simultaneously If this was trueif having always been tourists in our own country now we didnt even have to leave the house to be alienatedit seemed worth writing about maybe by taking an anthropological approach Besides I was a fan Like everybody else I had my favorite programs I liked watching television I still like watching television What I dont like is having to think about what Im watching Life as it staggered toward its expensive grave had a onemonth leadtime This meant I had to deliver my copy every week at least a month before readers of the magazine would see it Most network TV programs arent ready to be previewed a month before their broadcast date This meant I had to concentrate on the writing and acting and direction of the continuing series on the style and personality or the news and sports coverage intead of groaning on about the aberrant special so special that no one remembers it a month later in our busy tour  Which was fine by me Television criticism I thought dwells too much on the singular and the perishable As a popanthropologist I was drawn to the continuum the gel the security blanket that hums the Muzak for the eyes the convenience program around which the American people week after week organize our dinner hours and our social lives Repetition as in the commercials is what counts If municipal engineers are obligedand they are to design sewage systems capable of accommodating the periodic overload on the reservoir from all the toiletflushing that goes on during commercial breaks every evening in primetime just think of the level of our libidinal pools our flushes of anger and remorse the gurgle in dreams Yes it might have been the golden age of situation comedy At MTM and Tandem the Mary Tyler Moore and Norman Lear organizations respectively they let the writers out of their cages Abortion infidelity homosexuality impotence and death came to television And for a season or so my columns wrote themselves But how many times can you get away with approving in print of Mary Tyler Moore MASH The Carol Burnett Show Sanford and Son and Sesame Street How many columns can you write about your ambivalent feelings on contemplating Barbara Walters or All in the Family Once you have warned the American people against Kung Fu Merv Griffin Tom Snyder and Joe Garagiola is there really any point in repeating yourself As they recycle the actors in one vehicle after another are you just recycling your opinions You resort to the standards Every year there will be two football columns one at the beginning of the season and the other at Super Bowl time a baseball column a basketball column a column on the Emmy Awards and the Oscars a column on reruns a column on violence a column on Johnny Carson and on childrens programs Election and Olympic years are nice impeachment proceedings help and somewhere theres always a war A column on commercials a column on trends the obligatory Was This the Worst Season Ever column maybe something about cable technology the fairness doctrine whatever happened to live TV disaster coverage   Nobody ever told me I was going to have to think I have written about the crybaby style on TV in the 1950s from Richard Nixon to Jack Paar to Charles Van Doren and I have written about the media brat style on TV in the 1960s on to the 1970s from Muhammad All to Abbie Hoffman to Mark Spitz to Mason Reese to Jimmy Connors What was I saying and why was I saying it I have written that network television covers the news better than most newspapers in this country If this is so and we consider how poorly television covered Vietnam and Watergate In their important early stages what does it say about journalism about our information environment Who knows I have written of the situation comedy as a socializing agency taking up where the family and the public school system failed If this is so if we are being advised on one hand that its all right for career girls to think about sex then on the other hand the continuing inability of the American father on sitcoms to lace up the shoes of his own mind without falling off his rocker must be of some cultural significance But what  I have written of Johnny Carson as a legitimizing agency taking up where Ed Sullivan left off defining the permissible in humor and music conferring status If this is so if this crystallized cynicism this toad with the jewel in his brow sitting on our nights as though they were lilypads croaking adlib is our authenticator of celebrity what does that tell us about ourselves I dont know I have written like everybody else of televisions having taken over from the government as the agency to which we petition for redress of grievances and of televisions having taken over from organized religion as our agency of celebration worship mourning If this is soif television is both our court and our ceremony if watching the political conventions the Super Bowl the moonlandings the Academy Awards the Kennedy and King funeral corteges a President resigning Billie Jean King thrashing Bobby Rigga is the way we participate with ourselves as a nation the glue that holds the mobile homes togetherare we live or on tape I have blabbed these blabs in Life until it folded in Newsweek until The New York Times picked up my option and in this section of the newspaper where they put out the eye of the fouryearold Cyclops one Sunday morning and gave me back my name And seem somehow to have missed the point Or the point has shunned me If dont stop now next week I will be writing about the trend in miniseries The miniseries may liberate television from its padded cell of formulas alarm clocks punchlines Real people will be allowed to grow experience love and disappointment die in a miniseries in primetime not just dure ing the sudsy serials of our blank and shining day Does this matter That of course is the trouble with concentrating on the writing acting and direction of the continuing and formularidden series of going on at length about the style and personality of the news and sports An essence eludes us To write about style is to try to get by on style theirs and mine Why are we in this room What do we take away How do I go about anthropologizing myself Anterior to the monster somewhere is the swamp a sea were swimming in Like fish we find it difficult to ask questions about the nature of wetness We dont even notice that were wet  Something is going on in the livingroom Television assures us that the way people behave on television is the way we are It assures us that the politics we see on television are the real politics It tells us we are not alone and tomorrow at work we will tell one another that this is true because we all saw it last night at the same time on television and what we saw is what we know I am all wet I want to watch myself watching To do so it seems a good idea to stop writing about what I seewhich doesnt change enough to make it of compelling interestand think about the way we see Maybe Cyclops was the monster 
A Priest Is Stirring the Melting Pot To Revitalize Ethnic Neighborhoods,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/20/archives/a-priest-is-stirring-the-melting-pot-to-revitalize-ethnic.html,WASHINGTON April 19  When Msgr Geno Baroni was growing up in western Pennsylvania his teachers urged him to blend into the American melting pot and forget the language of his Italian immigrant parents He has since tried valiantly and vainly to learn it even taking a lastditch fling at Berlitz but to this day he can scarcely say good morning in Italian Monsignor Baromis block against his ancestral tongue symnottc of the heritage so many ethnic Americans have lost to assimilation is tinged with irony For he has emerged as pernaps the leading champion of the revitalization of the Italian Polish Irish and other ethnic neighborhoods that once so enlivened American cities Learning About Bureaucracy The activist priest has finally been embraced by the Federal Government whose policies he has long denounced as destructive of those neighborhoods He is scheduled to be sworn in tomorrow as Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for Neighborhoods Nongovernmental Organizations and Consumer Protection The ponderous title fits the gregarious amply proportioned priest about es well as a business suit He has been blithely breezing through the halls of Government in blissful ignorance of such hard facts of bureaucratic life as the presidents Office of Management and Budget Its like a secret place like the Vatican curia he said of the powerful budget office I dont know the address I dont know who runs it but they always say no Known as Pesky Gadfly If Monsignor Baroni fails to get his plans pas the managers budgeters lawyers and other naysayers in Government it will not be for lack of social conviction or enthusiasm or for that matter lack of such essential Washington commodities as political savvy and flair for publicity A Congressional aide who has watched the 46yearold priest promote legislation against mortgae redlining and other concerns calls him a problem solver who can push minor conflicts aside to find a community of interests among competing groups On the

Activist Priest in H. U. D. Post Seeks To Revitalize Ethnic Neighborhoods,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/20/archives/activist-priest-in-hud-post-seeks-to-revitalize-ethnic.html,WASHINGTON April 19  When Msgr Geno Baroni was growing up in western Pennsylvania his teachers urged him to blend into the American melting pot and forget the language of his Italian immigrant parents He has since tried valiantly and vainly to learn it even taking a lastditch fling at Berlitz but to this day he can scarcely say good morning in Italian Monsignor Batomits block against his ancestral tongue symbolic of the heritage so many ethnic Americans have lost to assimilation is tinged with irony For he has emerged as perhaps the leading champion of the revitalization of the Italian Polish Irish and other ethnic neighborhoods that once so enlivened American cities Learning About Bureaucracy The activist priest has finally been embraced by the Federal Government whose policies he has long denounced as destructive of those neighborhoods He is scheduled to be sworn in tomorrow as Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for Neighborhoods Nongovernmental Organizations and Consumer Protection The ponderous title fits the gregarious amply proportioned priest about as well as a business suit He has been blithely breezing through the halls of Government in blissful ignorance of such hard facts of bureaucratic life as the presidents Office of Management and Budget Its like a secret place like the Vatican curia he said of the powerful budget office I dont know the address I dont know who runs it but they always say no Known as Pesky Gadfly If Monsignor Baroni fails to get his plans past the managers budgeters lawyers and other naysayers in Government it will not be for lack of social conviction or enthusiasm or for that matter lack of such essential Washington commodities as political savvy and flair for publicity A Congressional aide who has watched the 46yearold priest promote legislation against mortgage redlining and other concerns calls him a problem solver who can push minor conflicts aside to find a community of interests among competing groups On the outside for years

Marriage Counseling for Unwed Couples,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/24/archives/marriage-counseling-for-unwed-couples.html,They started living together because she didnt want to live alone in New York they were spending all their time together anyway and it seemed crazy to pay two rents You know how it is she said Its so disorienting waking up across town from your clothes and your mail It would he so much more convenient to live together It makes more sense A year and a half later still unmarried they are now enrolled in marriage counseling They were having problems fighting a lot sniping at each other for no good reason Rather than break up they decided to get professional help in working on their relationship  Another cohabiting couple finds that going to a counselor shocks their friends If your problems are serious enough to require therapy they ask why dont you just split upw The womans answer I couldnt bear to go through a divorce married or not  Who could have imagined in the 1960s when living together was seen as a free and easy arrangement that in the 1970s cohabitation would prove to be as risky as marriage As the unwed couples in counseling have come to realize you dont have to be married to suffer Since the beginning of the 1970s more and more couples who live together are troubled enough about their relationships to turn to marriage and family therapists for help Counselors interviewed in New York City and throughout California estimate these couples now make up 10 percent of their caseloads And all around the country said a researcher at the New Yorkbased Family Service Association of America theres been a gradual increase in the number Its definitely a phenomenon  The cohabiting couples who ale going for counseling are educated middleclass men and women who probably would have been married 10 years ago and tend to live as though married now Theyre not hippies not beatniks A few of them in fact are old enough to he grandparents Most however are in their 20s and 30s They live to gether because thats what you do during the increas ingly generous span of time between dating and mar riage Some are seeking a premarital checkup to be sure theyre right for each other Others cant decide whether to get married or break upa puzzling question it sounds a hit like the choice between going to Russia or going to sleep but the counselors explain theres ar inevitable pull toward a more stable predictable marriage like commitment Relationships they say have a life of their own and if they dont go forward they die Once the subject of marriage is brought up theres no going back Other couples who are living together have no intention of getting married Theyre just not getting along as well as they used to or the relationships balance is suddenly upset by one partners wanting more or less distance And come simply want to ease the pain of breaking up What is surprising even to the counselors is the number of older couples who are living together and suffering from marriagephobia a syndrome marked by skepticism bitterness and simple ordinary fear Every therapist has a gunshy male in the files a man whos been divorced one or more times living with a woman who is urging him to try marriage just once more She may want to have a baby for many the only rationally acceptable reason to get married now or she may already be accidentally pregnant and the issue is marriage versus abortion There are a lot of crippled wounded men said Dr Donald A Bloch director of New Yorks Nathan W Ackerman Institute who dont see how they con tributed to the first divorce and all they know is marriage is a situation where they can get killed financially and psychologically The basic problems of cohabiting couples seem to be much like those of married couples They just cant talk to each other one therapist said Another wrapped up the basic issue as fear of abandonment and fear of closeness  Alma Sobel a counselor at Ackerman tells the fable of two porcupines on a freezing night They want to huddle together for warmth but when they do they prick each other Moving apart theyre cold Eventually they work out the optimal distance for warmth without intrusiveness And that struggle is the common denominator for all couples who are living together married or not After the early glorious honeymoon stage they start pinching each other for space But why arent the livingtogether separating after the first crisis They dont feel they have more options or more freedom than the married said Dr Simon Budman a Boston clinical psychologist because the attachment is the important thing not marriage And they form marriages  The form includes setting up households only a mother would recognize as not quite orthodox The couples in counseling are hardly shacking  up  theyve signed twoyear leases committed themselves to builtin bookcases and ordered expensive sofas They even sound married Hed go to work come home watch TV and go to sleep a 21yearold woman complained The differences between living together and being married are far more subtle than the similarities The essential distinction Sanford N Sherman executive director of Jewish Family Service explained is that unmarried couples are less securely anchored Theres more tentativeness about the capacity of the other to endure hostility or a rocky period A woman about to start couple therapy is tired of living with that insecurity Living together requires more effort than people think says Pat 30 There is nothing to stop you from walking out the door Even small problems seem destructive I keep thinking Oh that wouldnt bother me if we were married  Irritations would ride out their natural course wed he tolerant  Ive had that security Joel her partner replies and I know its a lie Its a false security He was  at 25 after a threeyear marriage Now 30 he describes himself as cynicized  When I talk to people who are married Pat said I sometimes want to ask them how they ever got the courage to do it How can you swear youll love someone forever And I have a fear of getting more intimate giving up my self being trapped in the role of little wife Ive seen it happen friends get married andzapthe woman is playing house But when I see happily married couples I think I want that that nonconfusion that clarity trust walking into eternity together  Joel shakes his head Thats a fairy tale For hint the appeal of marriage is simply that it is a further commitment  They have run through this debate before The last time the conclusion was to go into counseling I was not pressing for commitment Pat says but I just turned 30the 30s crunchand I was feeling the need to get my life a little more organized particularly where children are concerned Joel said we couldnt get married because we had too many problems So I called his bluff I said Okay lets work on our problems Lets go for couple therapy Their problems are kaleidoscopic Joel moved into Pats tiny apartment a year ago just as he was finishing a PhD in chemistry and beginning to search for a job Pats career is chaotic Shes an ambitious actress unemployed at the moment but Joel admits hes afraid shell become toosuccessful4 dont want to have to bask in her limelight Pat complains that he wont help around the house that he was raised to read newspapers while the dinner dishes are being washed Inlaws are another irritant Pats parents are violently disapproving of my livinginsinthats how my mother phrases it Joels parents are more benign but not thrilled The pressure doesnt fuel the impetus to marry Pat says but it adds stresses and strains So do friends Eyerybody keeps saying If you love each other enough to live together why dont you get married Or theyd say that one or both of us is copping out avoiding commitment Maybe thats true They both had complaints about sex and screaming rages about children A false pregnancy scare in fact was the trigger for going into therapy Pat wanted to have the child Joel protested not for another five years admitting Ive been saying not for another five years since I was 23 years old  Pat figured it was time to straighten things out between them At first Joel was less than enthusiastic about counseling Unless hit over the head he says I will not sit hack and analyze my life Pat hit him over the head I told him that if we split up well Just be carrying the same problems into the next relationship Ive been in individual therapy and I know people can change I know you can make your life better And she continues pounding a sofa cushion with her fist Im not going to put up with being discarded because Joel wont look at his life Together they researched agencies and finally applied to the Institutes of Religion and Health in New York We knew the fees would be low there [agency rates are usually on a sliding scale from nothing to 50 per session] and we liked the idea of a pastoral counselor We wanted an arbitrator nut a psychiatrist  They were due for their first session the next day A month later Pat reported All the heats been taken off Counseling has relieved so many anxieties and I dont know why I think we both expected the expert to make it all better but he keeps throwing it hack at us He keeps asking us How are you two going to solve this probleml He tells us to talk to each other not to him The process sounds like basic training in listening The counselor will interrupt us to ask Joel how he felt about what I Just said and then check with me to see if Joel was reading me correctly After a joint 45minute session he sees each of us alone for 22 minutes each to talk about what just happened or about ourselves  The approach is focused and pragmatic The question is are we a you and a me or are ski an us And what compromises are we willing to make us The most dramatic effect of counseling on Pat is her changed attitude toward marriage I was raised with the idea a woman was no good unless she was married once For the fist time I can truly say I dont see any reason to get married unless we have a child And even then I was assuming that all our problems stemmed from  and marriage would resolve that But its obvious that our problems are all power playswe each want to have our own way That would be the case married or not As the married may hope that having a child or going on a vacation together will solve their problems a counselor said the livingtogether may imagine that marriage will be a cure Whats important Pat said is not the progress towards marriage but the relationship itself making it the best the most comfortable it can be Joels reaction to counseling was more analytical I think we both feel more secure Its comforting Were able to discuss volatile issues in a structured formatthe emotional overhead is removed  Living together is more tentative said Dr Bloch of the Ackerman Institute The threat to leave is more potent and serves as a magnifier an intensifier of issues Theres a constant awareness that the whole relationship is at stake Thats not necessarily had Continual examining and evaluating can stir up trouble but it can he useful trouble It may he better for partners not to take each other for granted And if the unmarried partners are more tentative with each other therapy provides some safety for them to be less careful to make wider swings without fear The protection is built into the structure The counseling situation becomes almost like a little marriage That safety is exactly what Shelly 23 hoped for when she suggested therapy for herself and Jim 26 I wanted a neutral battleground where somebody would he around to make sure we left as a couple We were both afraid to bring up angers fears dissatisfactions irrationally assuming the other would walk out Id go directly from thinking Im unhappy to Who gets the cat But why didnt they just break up The physical encumbrancesour possessions the logisticswere almost as important in keeping us together as the commitment Shelly says gesturing toward their furniture in the living room We knew we loved each other Jim explains We had insights into each other To throw It all away without exhausting other means seemed foolish People think breaking up is easy It isnt It may he easier than divorce but its not easy Encouraged by New Yorks Jewish Family Service to join one of its therapy groups for couples Shelly and Jun found themsel the only unmarried pair in the room These was some resentment of us in the beginning Jim remembers The others would recognize that we had the same sort of problemstheyd say the piece of paper doesnt mean anythingbut then they would turn around and say that our problems were relatively inconsequential because we werent married  I see a difference between the married couples and us Shelly says I sense a more trapped feeling in them more desperation Getting out isnt as desirable a solution She can coolly say I dont see that the  for us was  staling together We both feel better and stronger about our relationship because of the group but listening to the others has made me very glad were not married Laving together Jim says might make better marriages if people take it seriously Its a relationship thats easier to fall into than out of We started living together as an experiment We were naive in some respects Neither of us realized the intensity of this situation There was no thinking of what the daytoday living would he like no understanding that it becomes a commitment if its going to work at all So theres a surprise element in living together attachment sneaks up on one or both partners Marriage of course has its own surprises but living togther leases partners vulnerable to a certain ambiguity Lacking a ceremony to define the relationship couples usually move into an apartment together without ever stating their goals Where are we now Is a basic question of the unmarried in counseling For them a therapists office is an official place to articulate the intentions of each partner The ensuing relief can be euphoric Bob and Caroline both in their 30s had been living together for a year and a half when Bob decided he needed space lie began spending a few nights a week at a friends vacant apartment Caroline was stunned Woe they a couple or not Their first counseling session released her from the need to he a mindreader It was an incredible experience she said Just having it all on the table Our therapist said there was Just as good a chance that wed separate as stay together but as we talked and things came out I relaxed I had the sense that however it turned out it would he all right Using their counselor as a negotiator they agreed that Bob would live in their apartment full time and Camline would give him spacetime and room to be alone Another couple in their late 20s signed a twoyear lease with unspoken and very different expectations Susans idea was wed know if we were a couple by the end of the two years Steve however had expected a total commitment from the beginning She had to travel  sionally for her Job He read her absences as a symptom she didnt care as much as lie did She was meticulous about splitting all their expenses down the middle and particular about just what belonged to whom I never said ours she remembered Things were either his or mine By the end of the first year he was ready to give up the relationship She was not After a year of living together I was more committed to him  As a lastditch effort to save the relationship she asked him to go to a family counselor with her The fantasy is that the therapist will make everything all right At the first session the counselor asked Steve if Susan could do anything to make him feel more secure The next session Steve said there wasnt that he was determined to separate We spent the rest of the time discussing logistical things like who would take the apartment and who would get the couch The counseling was something like a divorce and left her wary Im not sure Id ever live together with a man again she says Its not enough of a commitment and its too much of one They separated six months ago and Susan still seems bruised and angry this is not what she had bargained for People live together explains Dr Selma Miller president of the New York Association of Marriage and Family Counselors because theyre aware of the difficulties of marriage and living together is a chance to see if they do have enough in common if they are compatible Its a trial and if it works out okay and if not okay Thats the ideal We never see it Invariably sonicone gets hurt with all the trauma and problems of divorce Theres an irony here according to sonic counselors who see living together as a scheme to escape the pain of divorce a ploy to stop the tide to avoid a larger commitment and so a larger mess People go into these relationships thinking it wont hurt and it does just as much as marriage can hurt said Dr Fred Humphrey president of the American Association of Marriage and Family Counselors In a divorce he points out its not the legal that hurts For the nevermarried however living together is more a postponement than a renunciation of marriage Cohabiting has become a stage of courtship now substituting for going steady or an engagement There is no rush to get married and there are plenty of good reasons such as the climbing divorce rate to take it slowly Shelly a bright and logical woman in her 20s speaks of her desire to get married someday as she might describe a neurotic compulsion I just have this feeling of wanting to get married I have a roseglasses sense of what marriage can be Intellectually Im aware of how rare a happy and fulfilling marriage is but I persist in this desire And I hope to attain the state at which I will sense a surenessI will suddenly knowthis person is for me If the previouslymarried are scarred and bitter the nevermarried are scared and befuddled by fantasies of marriage both as a dream and a nightmare The dream of one woman was Prince Charming would take me away and solve all my problems  Her nightmare Wed grow to hate each other She and her partner started therapy the day after he called off their wedding They lived together for another year and a half all the while in therapy When they finally concluded that marriage would neither add nor subtract from their relationship they set another date and kept it So fartheyve been married only 15 months theyve noticed no magical changes The line between living together and marriage has become perhaps irrevocably smudged The difference is often shrugged off now as just a piece of paper Even that distinction is losing significance The California Supreme Court recently ordered Lee Marvin to pay alimony to the woman he had lived with for six years Couples who live together as though married said the court may he asked to divide their property as though tin orcing when they separate The next trend out of California may be a return to dating as the only safe way to carry on relationships Meanwhile the cohabiting couples in counseling are in Jims words learning the basics getting a grip on the mechanics of relationshipshow to communicate how to fight recognizing whats important and what to compromise on  And theyre being very careful before taking any risks Susan intends to check with a therapist the next time she gets involved with a man to make sure Im not letting myself into another screwy relationship  Alissa and Bob the couple who went from counseling to marriage have a verbal contract If either of them ever feels the need to return to therapy the other must go along And we joke Bob said that if things really are not working out well get divorced and start living together again Some recent studies have found that living together before marriage doesnt lessen the odds for divorce But living together and going to counseling may prevent some marriages from happening and strengthen others Alissa and Bob valued their therapist so much they asked him to officiate at their wedding 
Young Sex Is Topic of Talks,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/24/archives/westchester-weekly-young-sex-is-topic-of-talks-sexuality-and-youth.html,INADEQUATE information on birth control underdeveloped reasoning about sex unwanted pregnancies and unnecessary anxietiesthese problems surrounding teenage sexual activity are felt here in the county as in other areas of the nation As a response to these problems and in the hope of learning more about them a group of health and family planning authorities has called a twoday conferencethe first in the areaon the subject of sexuality and youth The conference to be held Thursday and Friday is financed by the Department of Health Eucation and Welfare and sponsored by Planned Parenthood of Westchester the New York Medical College and Coordinated Human Services of Westchester It is designed to better prepare professionals  social workers physicians nurses teachers and otherswho work with young people to deal with sexual problems of youth seeking advice Professionals from Westchester Putnam Dutchess Orange Ulster Sullivan and Rockland Counties have been invited It is difficult to estimate the problem in Westchester Key officials involved in organizing the conference say that there are apparently no reliable data on the amount of sexual activity among teenalters in this county or region The few available statistics from the State Health Department show that the pregnancy rate among teenagers in Westchester is lower than in the state as a whole Even so the officials say of the 1744 pregnancies among adolescents 19 years of age and under in Westchester in 1975 the latest year for which such figures are available 979 terminated in abortion and 308 in outofwedlock births indicating that the majority of such pregnancies were unwanted Experts in the field say that unwanted pregnancies are just as prevalent among middleclass and wealthy families as among the poor There is a lot of room for improvement they say in the field of sex education since many Westchester youngsters are confused and ignorant about sex A recent national study showed more unmarried American teenagers were sexually active now than in 1971 but that they were also relying more on contraceptives No such study has been made in this area But from the few statistics available and from their experience in dealing with the problems here on a casebycase basis experts familiar with the problems say that much remains to be done At the moment their focus of immediate concern is the professionals Ruth Karp director of Program Services for Planned Parenthood of Westchester said that she suspected there was a need to educate professionals in the area of sex among youth when she saw youngsters coming into our clinics who had nobody to talk to She began some educational programs for nurses doctors social workers and teachers and found they didnt have enough facts to deal with the questions being asked and their own feelings were very confused about adolescents and their sexual activity They didnt understand that youths are sexually active and we dont make them that way I saw this tremendous need Mrs Karp sought and obtained government funds for the conference Dr Mary Lane a physician who is director of Women and Youth Services for the Westchester County Health Department said that most professionals in medicine social work and education have not been taught to deal with sex in themselves even much less in another person and certainly not in a young ster They may have perfect opportunities of helping young people deal with feelings and anxieties and let the opportunities go by because they cant tolerate the discomfort of knowing whats on the young persons mind For example she said a young man may come to a clinic for treatment of a cold and a physician may ask cut and dried questions relating to that complaint but fail to ask relevant questions from which he could learn that this young man is actively engaged in sex relations and perhaps worried his young woman is going to become pregnant He feels guilty yet he doesnt want to use any kind of birth control and cant even talk to the young woman about it The young man leaves the clinic with questions very much Is Subject of Regional Conference on his mind and with nothing having been done about them Dr Lane thinks that the problem is not that young people are sexually active There are reasons for sexual activity in all people including youngsters But the sexual activity can become manifest in alarming statistics and we have to worry about these consequences A pregancy in a 15 or an 11yearold is an absolute tragedy from all sorts of standpointsphysically emotionally and socially Dr Lane said that she thinks that professionals might help young people to deal with their sexuality in constructive ways A youngster might begin to find it possible to think beyond the urgency of the moment and make an actual decision about the use or nonuse of birth control What is happening to a considerable extent these days is that an awful lot of young people are having sex so to speak but not really making decisions They are falling into a pattern natural to their stage of living but with very little thought about it Much feeling conflict uncertainty but very little rational thought  an unplanned pregnancy just does not have to happen The physician said that there was need for more sex counseling Mary Fogarty director of Youth Consultation Service of Westchester said that she has found that unwanted adolescent pregnancies are just as likely to occur among the more affluent and middle class as among the poor and disadvantaged But she said that when a youngster from a wealthier family becomes pregnant an abortion is more likely I think its less culturally acceptable to go through with a pregnancy and to bring a baby home in the middle class she said In some of the more ghetto areas a majority of the babies come home They are not placed in adoption or foster care The poorer the family the more likely that the baby is going to come home Mrs Fogarty believes that sex education be improved She said that people think that teenagers are sophisticated about sex but that there is actually a tremendous amount of ignorance here Its almost as if weve become convinced that every teenager is sexually sophisticated either experientially or intellectually yet I think teenagers still have the same old hangups about sex they ever did and by our attitudes and our expectations we foster sexual activity among youth We see so many kids who are terrified of sex who have had no experience at all at the age of 17 18 and 19 They feel like they are compete failures In our experience she said many kids who are sexually active are not just sexually active for the sake of enjoyment of sex Many just want to be held because theyve had inadequate parenting They just want to be cuddled by somebody Many are say depressed and its almost like taking an upper I guess what Im saying is its not a mature kind of sexuality To me this goes right along with the fact that they are not using contraceptives Its impulsive in many cases  and its the sort of thing they are not ready for at all The conference will deal with other aspects of the problem including the legal aspects of sexrelated health care for minors and adolescent moral development Dr W Cody Wilson professor of behavioral science at Adelphi University Graduate School of Social Work said that studies have shown that there are various levels of moral reasoning employed by adolescents ranging from that based on punishment and obedience to a universal ethical principle It has been found he said that older adclescents tend to use higher levels of reasoning while the young adolescents use the lower levels We also find he said that moral reasoning about sex lags behind the development of moral reasoning in other areas If you talk about political or social issues adolescents show a higher level of moral reasoning and a lower level when they discuss sex Probably he said it has to do with the fact that in our society people are not supposed as adolescents to talk or know much about sex So they dont get much experience Theyre really retarded in the sexual area Were just in the process of trying to relate these levels of moral reasoning to the sexual decision process Mrs Fogarty said that the problems of teenage sex are enormously complicated and the solution is just as complicatd She said that maybe getting to the heart of it will start with community education It has to do not just with kids but with parents and the professionals who are dealing with them Thats why a conference like this is good It makes us all think  Teenagers still have the same old hangups about sex    our attitudes foster sexual activity among them

speak in a different anguish But perhaps we dont want to be understood Perhaps we want merely to be admired or forgiven Then we concoct books that all speak the same anguish It is lumpensincere You will quote George Orwell  The great enemy of clear language is insinceritybut that was back in 1946 We wear sincerity now instead of combat boots it tramps like a defeated army in one ear and out the other across a shallow brainpan confessional gush It may be clear but is it interesting Have our sensations any ah meaningful relationship with English literature There is from Spain a proverb Spanish

it is on a list of the many servomechanisms that gave us back the poets voice as an important dimension of the poetic experience It also gave us the White House transcripts a more characteristic specimen of what the spinning ear hears Deeply moved Mr McLuhan quotes Prince Modupe on his encounter in West Africa with the written word I gradually came to understand that the marks on the pages were trapped words  The ink of the print trapped the thoughts they could no more get away than a doomboo could get out of a pit The same applies to the tape recorder If a tape can be erased well so too can a book be burned Otherwise we are talking about two different kinds of boxes into which we deposit thoughts The difference between the two is that one of them requires or used to a modicum of art Mr McLuhan missed a bet Not only could he have rhapsodized about the tape recorder as a sort of portable confessional a singing booth we can carry on our backs like a knapsack but he might have foreseen the damage it would do to books For the tyranny of linear thinking it would substitute the anarchy of blab the lumpensincere The tape recorder is to the book what the car is to the city

JUSTICES UPSET BAN ON HOUSE SALE SIGNS,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/03/archives/justices-upset-ban-on-house-sale-signs-jersey-plan-to-stem-white.html,WASHINGTON May 2The Supreme Court ruled today 8 to 0 that it is generally unconstitutional for a community to prohibit the posting of for sale and sold signs in front of homes in hopes of stemming the flight of white homeowners and thus maintaining a racially integrated community The Court ruled that such a ban violates the First Amendments free speech guarantee The decision came in a case involving a ban on such signs adopted in 1974 by the Township of Willingboro in southern New Jersey The Courts only black Justice Thur good Marshall wrote the opinion There can be no question about the importance of achieving this goal of stable racially integrated housing he wrote But he added the First Amendment has lately been interpreted by the Court as protecting even purely commercial speech such as that contained in the for sale signs Other Bans Over Nation In banning the signs the villages authorities were acting to prevent its residents from obtaining certain information he said and that information is of vital interest to Willingboro residents since it may hear on one of the most important decisions they have a right to make where to live and raise their families If dissemination of this inforniation can be restricted then every locality in the country can suppress any facts that reflect poorly on the locality so long as a plausible claim can be made that disclosure would cause the recipients of the information to act irrationally  he said The decision reverses a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which had upheld the ordinance Various localities around the country have enacted ordinances regulating limiting or barring altogether the posting of for sale signs in efforts to promote integration One community with a ban is Shaker Heights Ohio The theory is that if for sale signs are dotting a neighborhoods laws the sight could combine with other factors to make a white homeowner think that the community is turning from a white or an integrated community into a black one and that it is thus time to move The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc urged the Court in friendofthecourt brief to permit such ordinances as a way to preserve integrated communities The Courts ruling does not specifically bar communities from all such prohibitions In a footnote it mentions a 1974 decision by a Federal appeals court upholding a prohibition in Gary Ind against for sale signs which the appeals court had upheld in part because of proof in the record that the signs were causing whites to move en masse and blacks to replace them The footnote then says that we express no view as to whether that ruling can survive the recent Supreme Court First Amendment decisions on which the court based todays holding Yet the Courts reasoning and its stress on the importance of permitting dissemination of information about a town seems to suggest that it would be difficult to sustain such a prohibition The ruling continues a recent trend toward expanding the reach of the First Amendment to cover types of speech that not long ago were not thought to be protectedwhat the Court has called commercial speech The Court in 1975 ruled that Virginia could not constitutionally punish a newspaper for printing an advertisement describing availability of abortion services This ruling seemed substantially to weaken the Courts old resistance to protecting commercial speech However last year in a case in which the Court said that states cannot bar advertising of prescription drugs the Court did flatly say that commercial speech is not wholly outside the protection of the First Amendment Todays case in which Justice William H Rehnquist took no part further develops the law set out in those two cases applying to another situation Willingboro had sought to distinguish its situation from the abortion and drug price advertisement cases on the ground that the sign ordinance served a vital interest of promoting integration The Court conceded the importance of the interest but rejected the purported distinction The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of New Jersey in a friendoftheCourt brief urged the Court to rule as it did Willingboro Is a residential township that was developed in a middleincome community by Levitt and Sons beginning in the late 1950s During the 1960s it grew rapidly According to the Court the white population grew by 350 percent and the nonwhite population grew from 60 persons to over 5000 which was 117 percent In the early 1970s the pattern changed somewhat and by 1973 the nonwhite population was 182 percent At trial in the caseafter the ordinance was adopted and realtors challenged itthere was testimony that a major cause in the decline in white population was panic selling Also at the trial there was testimony that in February 1974 a typical month there were 230 for sale signs posted among the 11000 houses in the community The ordinance was adopted after mounting community concern about the selling and after public meetings The opinion said it was not leaving Willingboro defenseless in its effort to integrate housing It can give widespread publicitythrough not for sale signs or other methodsto the number of whites remaining in Willingboro the Court said And it surely can endeavor to create inducements to retain individuals who are considering selling their homes

of speech that not long ago were not thought to be protectedwhat the Court has called commercial speech The Court in 1975 ruled that Virginia could not constitutionally punish a newspaper for printing an advertisement describing availability of abortion services This ruling seemed substantially to weaken the Courts old resistance to protecting commercial speech However last year in a case in which the Court said that states cannot bar advertising of prescription drugs the Court did flatly say that commercial speech is not wholly outside the protection of the First Amendment Todays case in which Justice William H Rehnquist took no part further develops the law set out in those two cases applying to another situation Willingboro had sought to distinguish its situation from the abortion and drug price advertisement cases on the ground that the sign ordinance served a vital interest of promoting integration The Court conceded the importance of the interest but rejected the purported distinction The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of New Jersey in a friendoftheCourt brief urged the Court to rule as it did Willingboro Is a residential township that was developed in a middleincome community by Levitt and Sons beginning in the late 1950s During the 1960s it grew rapidly According to the Court the white population grew by 350 percent and the nonwhite population grew from 60 persons to over 5000 which was 117 percent In the early 1970s the pattern changed somewhat and by 1973 the nonwhite population was 182 percent At trial in the caseafter the ordinance was adopted and realtors challenged itthere was testimony that a major cause in the decline in white population was panic selling Also at the trial there was testimony that in February 1974 a typical month there were 230 for sale signs posted among the 11000 houses in the community The ordinance was adopted after mounting community concern about the selling and after public meetings The opinion said it was not leaving Willingboro defenseless in its effort to integrate housing  It can give widespread publicitythrough not for sale signs or other methodsto the number of whites remaining in Willingboro the Court said And it surely can endeavor to create inducements to retain individuals who are considering selling their homes
FALSE PATIENT DATA REPORTED AT HEARING,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/06/archives/false-patient-data-reported-at-hearing-witnesses-tell-albany.html,Doctors frequently falsify medical records to cover up evidence of negligence or poor judgment both to protect themselves in malpractice suits and to improve the appearance of their professional skills before other doctors a New York State Assembly hearing was told yesterday One hospital official told the legislators that it was common for hospitals to give doctors being sued for malpractice a chance to go over a patients records and change them and that anyone wearing a white coat and carrying a stethescope could have access to patients records in almost any hospital Malpractice lawyers and a handwriting experttestifying before a joint hearing in New York of the committees on health and insurance which are conducting a major investigation of medical practicesaid that alterations of medical records ranged from erasures and substitutions of crucial words to complete rewriting We are going to determine what legislation is in order to stop this sort of activity and protect unfortunate patients Assemblyman Leonard Silverman Democrat of Brooklyn the chairman of the insurance committee said Bernard Turkewitz a malpractice attorney who has represented doctors hospitals and patients in New York estimated that in 10 percent of the cases he had tried medical records had been tampered with He said these were only the obvious cases in which it was possible to compare a copy of the unaltered original record with what the doctor had presented in court as the original He cited a case in which an obstetrician gave a woman in a hospital an overdose over several days of a drug intended to cause an abortion The woman went into coma and suffered brain damage She was then moved to another hospital along with a copy of her original record When the lawsuit began Mr Turkewitz said the first hospital produced a patients record for the trial that indicated that the doctor had monitored the patient while she was receiving the drug thus establishing that he had not been negligent A copy of the record from the second hospital however contained no such information Mr Turkewitz said that because patient records in malpractice cases are kept under the control of hospital officials most of the alterations could not have occurred but with the cooperation of the hospital administration Richard E Shandell another malpractice lawyer told the committees that he agreed with the 10 percent estimate but added that he believed falsification of records was far more common As soon as attorneys request patient records he said hospital administrators call in the doctor in question and go over the record with a finetoothed comb It is my view that in most cases hospital records are being altered on a routine basis Mr Shandell said Hanna F Sulner a professional handwriting expert who said she has testified in about 200 malpractice trials said the obvious cases where two copies of a document can he compared represent only a small fraction of the problem She said she has detected many alterations in which the names of drugs given the patient were changed or in which the recorded symptoms were changed to make a wrong diagnosis appear more understandable Martin Tannen assistant administrator of Mary Immaculate Hospital in Queens told the legislators that it was common practice when a malpractice suit was brought for the hospital to give the doctor a chance to go over the records of the suing patient and make changes Many times doctors make adjustments and additions to charts Its a common practice Mr Tannen said
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/06/archives/letters.html,Energy Reaching for the Sun To the Editor Analysis of the Carter energy policy must begin with his uncoupling of nuclear development from our energy future with the decision not to reprocess spent fuel rods and virtually to halt the plutonium breeder reactor Putting the prospect of nuclear war in proper perspective as being more menacing than an energy crisis the President relegated nuclear energy to no more than an interim option Subsequently the Administration released an energy policy program best described as a crazy quilt of approaches including taxes credits rebates efficiency standards rate structures and conservation directives In terms of what could be done to resolve our energy dilemma the agenda seems watered down except for the solar stimulus package However in light of past performances by the Congress a stronger proposal would stand no chance of passage It must be remembered that 38 years ago President Roosevelt addressed the Congress on the need for a national energy policy to no avail Even now in the face of Impending economic collapse Congress would likely procrastinate if not for public confidence in Presidential leadership The Congress cannot help but notice the rise in Mr Carters popularity for confronting energy headon according to the latest Harris poll The components of the Carter policy could be torn to shreds if each segment were lifted from context just as the scraps of fabric in a crazy quilt are useless by themselves Yet viewed in total the program has enough substance to work while remaining politically expedient On balance the policy may be judged appropriate by the uniform wailing of producers and consumers alike On vision the policy constitutes the dawning of the age of solar energy with a mandate for a thousandfold increase in solar home heating by 1985 a maximum effort by any standard The Age of the Sun is as certain as morning if the Presidents package passes but it will be a long time coming Even with the herculean Carter effort solar energy will provide only one percent of our needs by 1985 But by 2020 our crazy quilt could be lined with the fabric of sunshine supplying 20 to 25 percent of our demand STEPHAN J EYTALIS Assist Prof Environmental Biology Rock Valley College Rockford Ill April 26 1977 Of State Court Reform And a Political Game To the Editor I am appalled by the political game the Republican senators are playing to stall court reform in New York State The entire State Legislature last year after long years of haggling and delays finally passed what amounts to at least the beginning of meaningful court reform for this state Now apparently in an effort to influence the next election of a Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals after the incumbent retires next year the Senate Republicans want to withdraw one of the most significant portions of the threepart reform proposalthat which would provide for appointment rather than election of Court of Appeals judges Under the plan now put forth by the GOPcontrolled Senate which plan would in effect wreck the entire court reform program a public referendum on the amendment to provide for merit selection of Court of Appeals judges would be held up until after another election of a Chief Judge of the court The Republican position is indefensible I urge that concerned citizens write their state senators quickly about the fact that the entire court reform package should be placed before the public for their decision in this falls voting Lets stop playing games with the courts MICHAEL E ZIMMLR Buffalo April 25 1077 The writer is a retired associate judge of the City Court of Buffalo If Lawyers Advertise To the Editor In an April 23 news story fear is expressed that advertising would tend to create a bar composed of lawyers forced to compete against one another on the basis of the size of their advertising budgets rather than on the quality of the services they render There seems to be an implication that in the absence of advertising competition among lawyers actually does take place on the basis of quality of service but I wonder if thats really so I doubt that many people know how to find out who is able to offer the best quality of service in any particular field and it seems to me that at least some appropriate truthful advertising of unusual skills and experience could perform a useful public service THEODORE M EDISON West Orange N J April 27 1977 Fares for Volunteers To the Editor As a certified fossil I have reached mandatory retirement age I am ready to volunteer my services to the city However if only as a matter of prinple I resent having to pay 5 per week in transportation for the privilege I think it only fair that either a the volunteer be reimbursed for such expenditures or b be given transit pass WALTER SILVER Brooklyn May 2 1977 Affirmative Action Questions and Answers To the Editor I was dismayed to read Rabbi Judah Calms April 13 letter denigrating affirmativeaction programs designed to curb longstanding discrimination against Americas disadvantaged minorities Fortunately Rabbi Cahns view of this issue was ably refuted by Howard N Meyer lawyer historian author in the letter immediately following that of the clergyman Rabbi Cahn raises two simple questions for which there are simple answers First he asks When would preferential treatment and quotas no longer be considered necessary Answer When the nations minorities achieve parity with white males in educational and employment opportunities Rabbi Cahns second point is an iffy nonquestion implying that the minorities are incapable of achieving parity I suggest that he take a new look at what has happened in organized baseball in the 30 years since Jackie Robinson crashed the color bar The maintenance of unaided parity in admission of Negro students to institutions of higher learning can he firmly established only on the basis of equality of educational opportunity at every level The alarm that many personsof my generation and younger feel about quotas is understandable because the purpose was to restrict the number of Jews admitted to Ivy League colleges and other bastions of AngloSaxon supremacy The goal of the present affirmativeaction program is to increase educational and employment opportunities for neglected minorities We black students of that earlier period were less disturbed by quotas than our Jewish peers We faced more formidable obstacle The colleges did not deign to impose specific quotas on us Princeton Vassar Notre Dame and all the Southern and border state universities simply excluded us without any testing Harvard Yale Smith Brown Cornell state universi ties in the North and a few others grudgingly admitted a trickle of gifted and relatively affluent Negro students This practice extended far beyond the campus and deep into practically every phase of American lifebusiness as well as cultural industrial sports and housing programs Everywhere we faced the sinister color bar We black Americans know the pain anguish and bitter fruit of racial discrimination Moreover we have drenched this soil and overseas terrain with our sweat and blood in the building and defense of this our native land Yet our pursuit of parity has been thwarted not on any basis of merit but because of persistent denial of equality of opportunity HENRY LEE MOON Long Island City NY April 28 1977 The Supreme Courts Not Unlawful Leak To the Editor I disagree with William Satires views in Equal Justice Under Leak [column April 28] Mr Safire implies that the recent leak about Supreme Court voting on the appeal by Watergate defendants has the same legal significance as a police violation of the Miranda ruling during a criminal investigation Mr Safire suggests that due process is violated in both cases As a result he claims the case against Mitchell Ehrlichman and Haldeman should be dismissed forthwith by the Court The legal significance in these two situations is not the same A police violation of a defendants due process transgresses a specific provision in the Constitution eg improper search and seizure violates the Fourth In order to preserve judicial integrity and deter the police from further engaging in illegal behavior the Supreme Court has held in Mapp v Ohio for example that courts should not condone such constitutional violation A leak about the voting lineup in the Supreme Court on the other hand violates no constitutional provision While it is immoral unethical unconventional and politically unwise it is not unlawful The Constitution vests with the Supreme Court the judicial power But it does not explicitly require or safeguard the secrecy under which the Court deliberates cases Incidentally the leak was not the first in history as Mr Safire asserts As recently as during the Court deliberation of the abortion cases Roe v Wade etc Newsweek reported leak The law is clear on premature publicity however The rule is that unless prejudice is shown and injustice demonstrated pretrial publicity does not necessitate a dismissal of a case Thus Safires call for an immediate dismissal is not justified The column confuses the basic issues and blurs vital differences The views were not well taken L S TAO Assoc Prof Dept of Political Science State University College at Brockport Brockport NY April 28 1977 A Degraded Diploma To the Editor With a sense of wonder and astonishment I read today that our Board of Education proposes to require prospective high school graduates to demonstrate that they can read on at least a ninthgrade level and figure on at least an eighthgrade level in order to qualify for a diploma Why bother This is a barely perceptible improvement over the present requirement that elementary school skills be possessed by high school graduates and vastly more than this drop in the bucket will be needed to restore value to the degraded New York City high school diploma which should indicate as a bare minimum the achievement of 12thgrade skills Many of your readers will I am sure remember the algebra geometry intermediate algebra and higher math the twoyear and threeyear language the fearsome modern history and American history and the fouryear English Regents exams as real measures of the possesion of certain levels of skills and knowledge Why can they not still or again be mandated A return to the former Regents diploma for graduates of a restored academic course might help Alternatively the Board of Education should stop calling the present document a high school diploma and denominate it what truly is a grammarschoolleaving certificate JOSEPH B RUSELL New York April 25

Swiss Voters Asked to Resolve Abortion Dispute,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/06/archives/swiss-voters-asked-to-resolve-abortion-dispute.html,GENEVA May 5The Swiss Parliament agreed today to ask the voters hether expectant mothers should be allowed to have abortions within the first three months of pregnancy The decision on the referendum expected to he held in September came after leaders or the Assembly and Senate admitted that their houses were unable to cope with the issue As a result voters for the first time will receive ballots carrying the notation that Parliament could not agree on how they should vote Division Feared In Switzerland Protestants and Catholics are in close balance and even the initiators of the referendum proposal were fearful that the issue would divide the country in the way that Italy was divided by the vote there on the right to divorce That warning came in 1974 when the sevenman federal Cabinet produced compromise bill that would have eased the current ban on all abortions except those certified by a staterecognized expert as necessary to preserve womans health The Cabinet itself was divided on the bill that it presented to Parliament after two years of reflection Kurt Furgler a Catholic with strong antiabortion convictions asked to he excused from the role of government spokesman for the bill which normally would have been his as minister of justice Referendum Passed The hill satisfied neither the supporters nor the opponents of a liberalization of the abortion ban It was denounced by the Swiss Union for the Decriminalization of Abortions as hypocrisy because all abortions would still require the approval of a statedesignated authority While recognition that a referendum would divide the country the unions president Mrs Simone Hauert said that dissatisfaction with the government bill made it necessary to go ahead with the demand for a nationwide vote The union already had rallied the support of the 50000 voters required to force a referendum on its own propenal that women be free to have an abortion within three months of becoming pregnant Before a referendum is held under the Swiss system the government may offer a substitute proposal fur approval by Parliament and then place it on the ballot next to that of the Telerandums sponsors But after a prolonged and inconclu sive discussion in which the two houses could neither agree on the government bill nor any alternative was decided to drop the matter and leave the issue to the voters
The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/08/archives/the-region-in-summary-among-texans-mr-beame-is-an-oil-man-for-sale.html,The desire of communities in the metropolitan region to protect the environment by prohibiting oil drilling off their shores increasingly is coming in conflict with a desire among some of the same communities to benefit from any jobs created if the drilling does start Last week New York City made it clear that it considers the job potential to have the greater weight Mayor Beame of New York went to Houston with a delegation of city officials businessmen and labor leaders to sell the citys advantages for shore facilities It was the citys first important effort to compete for jobs and the tone was almost pleading We want you we need you the Mayor said at one point The reasons were clear The financially strained city has lost 650000 jobs since 1969 and the unemployment rate is above 10 percent The oil companies said they would consider the citys bid along with others Thousands of onshore jobs might be created if large quantities of oil are found in the Baltimore Canyon Trough an area that covers 876750 acres of the Atlantic 60 miles south of Long Island and 47 to 90 miles east of New Jersey Governor Byrne of New Jersey who had long been cold to the offshore program and demanded numerous safeguards against spillage if it is finally approved nevertheless preceded Mr Beame to Houston He went to Texas last month to make a pitch for onshore facilities after he had learned that the companies were talking to officials in Rhode Island and Massachusetts New Jerseys unemployment rate is 101 percent Nassau County is expected to seek some benefit from the oil although the county along with Suffolk and environmental groups is still in court to prevent the drilling They believe the project might hurt fishing and tourism and recently won at least a delay A Federal judge in February nullified a sale of offshore oil leases by the Federal Government on grounds that Washingtons evaluation of possible environmental consequences was a charade The ruling is under appeal Most observers believe however that the drilling will eventually take place particularly in light of the national emphasis on the energy shortage For Sale Signs May Stay Up The United States Supreme Court has struck down a New Jersey town ordinance prohibiting for sale signs in front of homes The Court acted on the ground that the ordinance was in violation of the First Amendment by restricting the free flow of commercial information But an indirect effect of the decision is that unscrupulous real estate brokers will now have an easier time of blockbusting the exploitation of racial fears to induce panic sales of homes The theory behind the ban is that given prevailing racial fears clusters of for sale and sold notices tend to stampede whites into selling at reduced prices But many fairhousing advocates feel other antiblockbusting measures have been more significant These include prohibitions against specific scare tactics and highpressure solicitation by brokers Last weeks Supreme Court case involved Willingboro NJ a town near Camden with a declining white population Convinced that panic selling was largely responsible for the decline the town adopted a ban on for sale signs in 1974 the ordinance was then challenged in the courts by local real estate operators Although it acknowledged the importance of racially integrated housing the Court ruled 8 to 0 that the town had violated the First Amendment The Court thus extended constitational protections that it has accorded commercial speech in the last two years by invalidating state laws prohibiting advertisements for legal abortions and prescription drugs What was not clear and what worried fairhousing proponents was how far the Court might be willing to take its freedomofspeech concept For example it has not heard a challenge to the Federal Fair Housing Act of 1968 which forbids the racial steering of househunters to certain neighborhoods and advertisements indicating racial preferences Similar laws or administrative actions exist in some states including New York and New Jersey The question is whether under the Courts latest ruling the forbidden actions constitute forms of free speech The impact of the decision may be limited in the metropolitan region few localities have outlawed for sale signs Easing the Marijuana Law New York State which enacted one of the sterner drug laws in the country under its former Governor Nelson A Rockefeller is almost certain to remove criminal sanctions for the possession of small amounts of marijuana The change means that certain offenders will merely be fined for actions that now carry prison sentences More than half a dozen states have decriminalized the drug since 1973 but none in the region until now The New Jersey Assembly voted last February against removing criminal penalties for possession of small amounts and last year Gov Ella T Grasso of Connecticut vetoed a bill that would have reduced not eliminated criminal penalties In New York where 30000 persons were arrested last year on marijuana charges Governor Carey has favored a more lenient law and he is expected to sign the new law It would work this way Possession of less than one and onequarter ounces of marijuana which can yield anywhere from 25 to 125 cigarettes depending on how extravagant the user is would be a violation like a traffic infraction there could be a 100 fine for a first offense 200 for a second and 250 and 15 days in jail for a third Now possession of as little as onequarter of an ounce is punishable by up to seven years in prison Possession of more than one and onequarter ounces under the new law would carry up to a year in prison The free transfer of marijuana which often means the passing of a cigarette between friends would still be a crime as would the sale of the drug The penalties however would be softened Now the sale of any amount carries a possible 15year prison term this penalty would apply only to the sale of more than a pound The free transfer of a single cigarette would be a misdemeanor punishable by a threemonth jail term and a 500 fine it is now treated as though it were a sale This Was Their Quest New York States Public Service Commission in an experiment with a tiny windmill has established that a person may not only generate his own electricity but also sell excess power to his local utility The utility in this case is the Consolidated Edison Company which refused to buy power from residents of a Manhattan building who had formed a cooperative and set up a windmill on their rooftop At bestand it would require a 20mileperhour windthe windmill can produce 2 kilowatts of electricity enough for 20 100watt lightbulbs Even so this helped the cooperative take care of commonuse facilities such as hallway lights and save 18 a month on utility bills On occasion there was an energy surplus worth maybe 50 cents a month which the cooperative wanted Con Edison to buy The utility said no claiming the effects on its 10millionkilowatt system were unknown Unexpected surges of fedback power it said might hurt repairmen or interfere with electrical impulses in the area But last week the commission said the possible risks did not outweigh the benefits of continuing the experiment and it set up special rates for windmill customers For now the ruling affects only Con Edison and in any event the commission will reevaluate the situation in 1980 Meanwhile Con Edison says two more customers are considering windmills

Philosophy,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/08/archives/philosophy-a-discipline-examining-natures-ultimate-reality.html,The following article is the fourth in a series on the state of the academic disciplines The series to be published at intervals in The Week in Review will discuss the outstanding debates and question to which each of the disciplines is addressing itself What is philosophy The only brief answer possible is that it is what philosophers do but then who counts as a philosopher In the loose sense in which philosophy is a part of the general intellectual atmosphere of a society we are all philosophers but insofar as philosophy is an academic discipline philosophers are people who work in departments of philosophy in universities If we try to say what it is that the various kinds of work done in philosophy departments have in common difficulties arise The subjects taught differ so much that some like symbolic logic might be more at home in a mathematics department while others like political philosophy are taught in departments of political science In addition those working in the contemporary European tradition taking the writings of existentialists phenomenologists structuralists or Marxists as their guide will not agree with descriptions of the subject offered by those who accept the approach of mainstream AngloAmerican philosophy In fact there are no real restrictions on how philosophy should be done except for the requirements of and sound argumnt William James regarded philosophy as the study of those residual questions on which people are unable to agree On this account one would expect the discipline to be contracting as scientific techniques establish objectively demonstrable results in more and more areas But there are still philosophical questions which are impregnable to science There will be philosophical issues as long as there are scientists who conduct experiments historians who attempt to explain the past art critics who appraise paintings and ordinary people who wonder about what they ought to be doing with their life Each of these activities gives rise to questions that science cannot answer For instance of each activity we can ask is it objective We might well give different answers to Is science objective and Is art criticism objective In each case though we are asking a question that goes beyond the bounds of the activity we are asking about That is why we cannot ask the scientist for example to prove scientifically that science is objective for the question challenges scientific method itself Perhaps this challenge can be withstood but if so it must be by means of argument and reasoning and in attempting to withstand it we will be doing philosophy Doubting Objectivity It is these questionsabout methodology justification and the ultimate nature of realitythat are at the core of philosophy The question of objectivity is in a variety of guises a central theme of philosophy Doubts about objectivity are nothing new During the heyday of logical positivismthe 20s and 30sphilosophers wielded the verification principle like a poleax If a statement was not is principle verifiable by some kind of test or observation it was classified as meaningless and down it went Scientific theories were thought to pass this test without difficulty since experiments provided verification ethics was regarded as unverifiable and consigned to the limbo of emotive meaning which was a polite way of saying that for example racial discrimination is wrong means no more than boo to racial discrim ination It is in keeping with our loss of faith in science and the increasing attention now given to ethical considerations in government business and science itself that science the very touchstone of objectivity for the positivists now has to struggle to defend itself against charges of relativism while many recent works in ethics are finding much more scope for argument and reasoning in ethics than one possibly could find if ethics really were reducible to expressions of emotions Much of the stimulus for doubting the objectivity of science has come from Thomas Kuhn whose The Structure of Scientific Revolutions described historical situations in which experimental results that we would now regard as refuting a thenaccepted scientific theory were either ignored put down to some undiscovered error or interpreted so as to make them compatible with the theory Dr Kuhn drew the conclusion that scientists work from within what he called a paradigm a kind of conceptual framework Our standard ideas of scientific objectivity he said apply only within a paradigm not between different paradigms A dominant paradigm is likely to be abandoned only when a new paradigm has developed alongside it and the switch from the old to the new cannot according to Professor Kuhn be given any straightforward justification in terms of the objective superiority of the latter No judgment can be made without a pardigm Hence no judgment can be objective Anything Goes Professor Kuhns thesis has been hotly contested and he has been forced to qualify it Dr Kuhn however is not making the running any more he has been outflanked by Paul Feyerabend a philosophical maverick whose book Against Method is subtitled Outline of an anarchistic theory of knowledge According to Dr Feyerabend it is a mistake to try to pin science down to any special logic of discovery or to any particular methods or procedures the only principle he will accept is anything goes Science he says is an ideology a kind of modern religion and he concludes by demanding that the separation of church and state be followed by the separation of science and state That a position as extreme as Dr Feyerabends is taken seriously by philosophers may in part be due to the fact that WVO Quine professor of philosophy at Harvard University and possibly the most discussed living philosopher in the Englishspeaking academic world has also argued that our body of knowledge lacks objectivity For Professor Quine relativity comes in at the level of what philosophers call ontologythat is when we ask the very basic question what is ultimately real We normally take physical objects to be ultimately real substances out there existing independently of us Professor Quine maintains however that this assumption is forced upon us by our language and forced upon us in such a way that even if we were to come across people speaking a totally unknown language who might be operating with different notions of what is ultimately real we would be unable to translate what they were saying in a manner that preserved the differences between their and ours Dr Quines thesis reflects the importance placed upon language in contemporary philosophy This has been a continuing theme in postwar AngloAmerican philosophy but the current approach to language is quite different from the ordinary language philosophy which prevailed in the 50s The concerns of the heroes of that age J L Austin and Gilbert Ryle are not the concerns of those now breaking new ground in the philosophy of language Even Ludwig Wittgenstein whose work was widely seen only 20 years ago as ushering in a new philosophical era in which all the old questions would be explained and dissolved has now taken his place alongside other philosophical mortals like Bertrand Russell and G E MooreWittgenstein being treated as a little more mysterious perhaps but no less fallible Nor is the man of the moment in philosophy of language Noam Chomsky as some might imagine Professor Chomskys achievements in linguistics though they certainly raise philosophical issues have proved less important to philosophy than it was one thought they would Instead it is Donald Davidson now at the University of Chicago who currently holds the center of the stage In contrast to ordinary language philosophy which relied on a vague sense of what we might or might not say without sounding odd Professor Davidson urges the construction of a rigorous theory of meaning His program involves the application of symbolic logic to natural languages like English The task is an ambitious one because symbolic logic is at home in simple artificially constructed languages and not in something as vast and complex as a natural language Despite or because of the immensity of the task Professor Davidson has succeeded in attracting many of the best young philosophers to it Ethical Issues Twenty years ago ethics and political philosophy had been reduced by the dominance of ordinary language philosophy to the analysis of ethical terms an activity that was supposed to be valuefree and innocent of any implications for controversial ethical issues Today the philosophy that is done in these areas is full of ethical implications and proud of it There is still no generally accepted proof of the objectivity of ethics but philosophers have demonstrated that there is scope for reason and argument about issues like abortion racial and sexual discrimination civil disobedience and social justice There have been two books in particular that have stirred up an immense amount of debate John Rawls A Theory of Justice and Robert Nozicks Anarchy State and Utopia Both books emanate from Harvard and each advances a theory about how a society should distribute its wealth There however the similarity ends for Professor Rawls sees justice as requiring redistribution from the rich to the poor if the poor can be benefited thereby while Professor Nozick holds that anyone who has acquired wealth legitimately is entitled to keep it all The trend in ethics toward practical questions has had an impact outside university departments of philosophy A recent survey of United States medical schools showed a rapid growth in the teaching of courses in medical ethics and a good deal of this work has been done through joint programs with philosophy departments While the work being done in what one might call applied ethics too often lacks rigor it may turn out that the interest shown by philosophers in these issues has greater significance for our society as a whole than any other development in contemporary philosophy

At the Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/13/archives/at-the-movies.html,DO YOU WANT TO KNOW my fantasy whispered Tony Curtis his blue eyesgleaming boyishly I dreamed I would get the book published it would make the bestseller list and a producer would buy it and ask me to write and direct the movie In Hollywood such dreams have been known to come true though it is doubtful that Kid Andrew Cody  Julie Sparrow will nab a Pulitzer Prize Still Mr Curtis is pleased to take a bow as the surprise author of this justpublished novel extolling the virtues and vices of a raunchy westernmovie star and an engagingly thuggish Las Vegas gambler who turn out to be the offspring of the same frolicsome sire Perhaps the ecstasies of authorship will eradicate Mr Curtiss grief over not having been nominated for an Oscar as the sexually impotent matinee idol in The Last Tycoon I used to fantasize about the Oscar said Mr Curtis lean and youthful looking at 51 There I would be at age 26 the youngest and handsomest actor ever to win the Academy Award But Hollywood never gave me that chance When Jack Lemmon got nominated for Some Like It Hot and I didnt I took it personally man At a time when I needed the accolades of my peers they turned their backs on me Maybe it was because of my two marriages and of the ramifications to all the people involved The Oscars have been turned into a big business and they can be bought You tell me what the hell was 0 J Simpson doing up there on that stage Or Muhammad Ali What do they have to do with movies Where was arbara Stanwyck baby Where in fact was Tony Curtis Its been nearly three decades since Bernie Schwartz The Bronxs gift to Hollywood blossomed into Tony Curtis the curlytop wonder of such Universal quickepics as The Prince Who Was a Thief and Son of Ali Baba Although he later matured into an actor of impressive substance in The Defiant Ones The Sweet Smell of Success Some Like It Hot and The Boston Strangler his stature has been diminished in recent years because of personal pressures such as alimony paymentsthat have frequently forced him to grab at the first role dangled before his eye Nor is it likely that he will rebound glory with Sextette in which he plays one of a legion of lovestruck men in Mae Wests life or The Manitou an occult thriller in which he shares tremors with Stella Stevens Burgess Meredith and Ann Sothern In the coming months a sizable portion of Mr Curtiss artistic passion will be spent at the typewriter pounding out his second novel Starstruck about a handful of Hollywood hopefuls in the late 1940s one of whom commits suicide thereby reminding alert readers of Marilyn Monroe Marilyn and I met each other in 1948 at Universal where she was trying to get herself put under contract Mr Curtis recalled The guys used to fall off buildings when shed walk by wearing a seethrough blouse before anyone ever heard of a seethrough blouse I had a Buick convertible and asked her if she wanted a ride back to town After that we developed a genuine bond of affection Years later when I finally got to work with Marilyn in Some Like It Hot it seemed to me that she took unfair advantage of everyone making them adjust to her pace And it was not necessary She was not as vulnerable and frightened as she led people to believe That business of always being late of building up tension by being the last one to arrive at a party was carefully staged Marilyn got off on that sort of thingthat was her real movie Like Barbra Streisand Marilyn always knew precisey what she was doing    Our hero is such a good boy so Im sure hell make a wonderful mother said Joan Rivers The heartwarmingly virtuous hero under discussion is Billie Crystal a versatile newcomer who will portray the worlds first pregnant man in Rabbit Test an original screenplay by Miss Rivers and Jay Redack which the blonde comedienne is now directing Hollywood Miss Rivers was jolted by the inspiration for this tale while sitting under the dryer at her beauty parlor I was reading a movie magazine when all of a sudden a headline jumped out at meIs Elliott Gould Pregnant Wow I said to myself What a terrific idea for a movie Too bad I didnt think of it first Then I realized that the story wasnt about a movie at all it was about Elliotts wife It is conceivable that Rabbit Test will make a serious point or two about sexual identities and the nature of parenthood Were not making any points were just having a good time making a silly movie about a poor schlep who becomes preg Want I figure weve got something to offend just about every ethnic group except the Eskimos Gay lib is in favor of the man having the baby but womens lib is against him because they feel hes taking away their one unique function A few of the faces in the cast of Rabbit Test will be more familiar than those of Billie Crystal and Joan Prather who plays his perplexed spouse Roddy McDowell is playing a gypsy grandmother Miss Rivers rippled on and Imogene Coca is a crazed fortune teller Paul Linde is the obstetrician who discovers Billie is pregnant Alex Rocco Billies overtrained Green Beret brother George Gobel is the President of the United States Vincent Price is the Pope and Im going to play a small part too I wish I didnt have to act in the movie but thats the deal I made The thing that worries me is whos going to say Hey she stinks  Miss Rivers and Edgar Rosenberg her producerand husbandwill follow Rabbit Test with two more comedies one about the Rumanian mafia and one about a brokendown comedienne When pressed the zany comic will concede that guffaws are not her only goal There is a tremendously moving scene at the end when Billie decides not to get an abortion and he makes a big speech that is like something out of Mr Smith Goes to Washington We focused cur camera on Billies face and we never moved it It was just divine Of course it should have beenwe shot 19 takes Will Billie be the proud mama of a boy or a girl I cant tell you because that would spoil the ending But I can tell you that weve taken out a policy with Lloyds of London and any man who gets pregnant while watching Rabbit Test will receive a 2 million settlement But only if hes marriedwere aiming for a PG rating   What the devil does a graying semisenior citizen like Kirk Douglas see in a petite sadeyed girl like Amy Irving the high school senior who was left tossing and turning in her nightmareriddled sleep at the end of Carrie He sees the clue to the whereabouts of his mysteriously missing son according to the story line of The Fury Brian De Palmas fearful followup to Carrie which will also star John Cassavetes as a scheming Government agent John Farris based his screenplay for The Fury on his own novel to be published in July and Frank Yablans the producer of the film plans to start shooting the shivery shenanigans this August in Chicago Its not really going to be like Carrie said Mr Yablans managing nevertheless to make The Fury sound just a bit  like Mr De Palma lucrative little horror about an adolescent wallflower who uses her telekinetic powers with devastatingly fiery effects The Fury is a thriller involving the Government young people and astrological psychic phenomena Mr Yablans explained Amy plays the psychic twin of Kirks son an Kirk needs her to find the boy who has been abduct id by the Government It sounds as if The Fury may contain a message for our politically paranoid times If it does it wil be purely accidental said Mr Yablans and take it out in the cutting room The story has no been constructed to make a political statement it intended as an entertainment Actually rd like find a script that does make a political statement but thats a difficult thing to come byunless I decide to film the Declaration of Independence
A Measure Of Success,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/15/archives/a-measure-of-success-carters-goals-were-modest-so-were-the-deeds.html,President Carter has returned from his first overseas diplomatic journey able to report modest successmostly because his goals were also modestin his conference with leaders of six other important industrial nations in London To avoid the experience of the strategic arms limitation talks with the Soviet Union where preconference expectations abruptly dissolved in the actual Moscow meetings Mr Carter and his aides approached the talks with the leaders of Britain France West Germany Japan Canada and Italy in a more deliberate and subdued manner The careful preparation paid off Mr Carter is able to assert he has laid the basis for friendlier personal relationships with the leaders of Washingtons key allies and agreement in general principle if not in the actual implementation of policy in these important areas The economy There was no magic breakthrough in providing a solution for the persistently high unemployment or the threat of inflation that trouble the industrial world But Mr Carter won commitments from the Germans and the Japanese to achieve preestablished growth targets for their economies that should help stimulate international trade and so benefit their less fortunate partners The leaders strongly rejected any move toward protectionist policies and promised increased attention to the Geneva negotiations aimed at eliminating international trade barriers Aid for the developing world The United States and the other nations meeting in London have been criticized for insensitivity toward the poor nations whose economies have been particularly troubled by the recession and inflation of the 1970s With an eye on the socalled NorthSouth talks in Paris where the industrial oilproducing and developing nations have been discussing remedies for IS months the leaders assembled in London made several conciliatory moves They promised to help create a fund to stabilize commodity prices by accumulating buffer stocks of key commodities vital to the poor countries They accepted a plan pushed by the Europeans to set up another The next important economic conference is in Paris later this month Story Page 2 special fund to provide aid for the poor nations beyond that provided by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund Nuclear proliferation Mr Carters outspoken attempts to control the spread of nuclear arms had brought his Administration into conflict with West Germany and France which have pushed sales of atomic technology for domestic economic reasons This had been potentially the most contentious issue to be raised in London But it was sidestepped by an agreement to set up a study to see how development of nuclear energy can he reconciled with proper safeguards against increasing the number of nations that have the booth Despite that agreement however the risk remains Human rights The Carter Administrations ardent linkage of human rights to political issues has been blamed for the failure of the Moscow nuclear talks and has raised hackles even among traditional allies such as Brazil and Argentina In London Mr Carter was content to state his views without pressing for a collective declaration in support of his stand Before leaving London Mr Carter also took pains to reassure Washingtons European allies of the United States commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization The enthusiastic welcome given the new American President by the British people and the cordiality displayed toward him by the other leaders obviously pleased Mr Carter But the other participants could also take pleasure in the meeting All of them have domestic political reasons for claiming success in the discussions The British French and Italian Governments all face a serious erosion of voter support The West German and Canadian Governments though less immediately threatened are nonetheless insecure Concerted action to improve the world economy if successful would help them all President Carter has done something that eventually some President was going to have to do He has proposed revamping the way in which the Social Security System is financed The reason is that otherwise it will run out of money and soon Predictably the plan has provoked controversy since there is apparently no way for the system to survive without costing some peopleand under Mr Carters plan especially employers more money And because so many depend on it for old age survivor and disability benefits 33 million people are getting monthly checks this year and so many expect to 104 million people are now paying Social Security taxes the system is politically popular Hence the debate is not about whether it should continue but who should pay more for it and how Mr Carter has proposed to eliminate the systems growing deficits by means of a large tax increase for employers a small rise for workers and f diversion of general lax revenues into the system in periods when unemployment is over 6 percent Since the system began in 1935 it has been selffinancing Conservatives particularly oppose habitual recourse to Treasury funds because they fear Congress might then be tempted to increase Social Security benefits without increasing Social Security taxes Under the present formula employers and employees pay an equal amount in taxes Under Mr Carters plan employers would be taxed on all employee earnings while the wagebase on which workers are taxed would retain an upper limit Business opposition was immediate and strong Labor and liberals were generally pleased although some liberals would not limit the transfer of general Treasury funds They contend that similar systems in other industrial countries are in less difficulty because those countries systems are not selffinancing The conflicting interests make it unlikely that any comprehensive package will be enacted this year But some stopgap measure probably will Without action funds for benefits to disabled workers will he exhausted by 1979 and payments to retired workers will run out by 1983 Only five years ago the system was expected to pay its way for another generation What happened was stagflation High unemployment beginning in 1974 meant fewer workers and employers were paying in Conversely high inflation meant increases in benefits which are adjusted according to the annual rise in the Consumer Price index Without their knowledge 48000 New York State women have become subjects in an abortion study financed by the National Institutes of Health and conducted by the New York State Health Department The research legal because the data come from public records but questions arise as to whether or not it is ethical The study has been called a massive invasion of privacy Researchers are comparing the childhearing histories of 21000 women who bore children in 1970 and 1971 with those of 27000 women who had abor tions in the same years The stated goal is to find out whether or not women who have had abortions have a higher than average rate of miscarriage later on more complications in pregnancy and childbirth or more premature or malformed babies The idea for the study originated with the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development one of the National Institutes of Health According to Dr Heinz Berendes of the child health agency some countries among them Britain Israel and Japan report that abortion sometimes damages the cervix and carries risk of prematurity Until now he said there has been no United States research on the subject He said results of the study are to be published and used for policy considerations For instance officials might recommend some abortion methods over others Most of the data come from computerized Albany records The names of the women who had children are drawn from birth records The names of those who had abortions are from fetal death records state law requires doctors to file a report on every abortion patient that like a birth record includes name race education estimated gestation time and other medical facts used in the study Much of the information is not available to the public but it is open to Health Department researchers and can be seen by computer personnel and others Philip Quickenton assistant director of the Health Departments Office of Biostatistics said reports that study subjects had been traced to other states if they moved are untrue Researchers did try to find out from records of transferred drivers licenses whether or not they had lost many subjects to follow up Mr Quickenton said Parts of the names of some subjects the first three letters of first names the last five of last names were sent to the Department of Motor Vehicles The study came to light when a progress report to the National Institutes came into the possession of two state legislators The report included the names of 28 women Under Federal law documents such as the report must be shown to anyone who asks for them But according to Mr Quickenton officials in the National Institutes of Health realized that names should not have been sent to them and deleted them from their copy of the report The department did not inform the study subjects he said because it would have been difficult to reach them all

To the Class Of ‘77 With Love,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/15/archives/to-the-class-of-77-with-love-washington.html,OXFORD Ohio May 14This years college graduates are supposed to be the luckiest class since the last World War They are not being battered now by the cynicism and pessimism of recent years In some ways they have advantages no military draft no conventions Gods priests teachers or even parents standing in their waynothing but Freedom They are lucky too in other ways It is not only that they dont have to face a military draft but that they can pian their lives with more assurance than their parents and grandparents that they probably wont have to deal with the world wars and depressions of the first quarters of the century So things are different There seems to be a different melody to the speeches at the end of this academic year For example Derek Bok the president of Harvard went to Brown University in Providence RI the other day and talked not about freedom but about the importance of ethics and discipline He sounded like the old preachers and editors who founded Miami University here in Oxford Ohio at the beginning of the 19th century More attention must be given in the colleges and universities today he suggested to the questions of human character to problemoriented courses in ethics classes built around Americas moral dilemmas Thus he said premedical students can grapple with issues of abortion euthanasia and human experimentation while students interested in public service may discuss whether Government officials are ever justified in lying to the public or leaking confidential information or refusing to carry out the orders of their superiors    This same searching for a purpose is going on all over the world today The leaders of the free world have been meeting in London to reconcile their selfish national interests with their longings for a decenr world order The leaders of the divided religiotrs orders of the world have been tryine to find a compromise of faith The business leaders of America are recognizing that they now have for the first time the problem of dealing with a truly world economy and have to hsve some ethlcal rules about brib to avoid chaos And even the  of The press radio and television  begining to question whether  know how to report all this conclusion This years graduating class from the colleges and universities will undoubtedly be in the forefront of trying to puzzle out these intractable problems They will be about 45 years old the end of the century end therefore at thit critical point of personal experience and energy to take up the burden of leadership in the first quarter of the 21st century Obviously this is not much on their minds here in this lovely town in the south of Ohio or on any other campuses in the flowering spring but if I hear them accurately they are beginning to doubt the assumptions of the 60s to question the claims of unlimited sexual and political license and some of them are even searching for new disciplines and putting manacles on their hands to keep them from trembling The difference I think between this college graduating class of 77 and say the rebellious graduating classes in the days of Vietnam Cambodia and Kent State is that this years graduates have looked at the college rebels of a decade ago and find rebellious politics and the drug culture not very promising for the future This is not a new revelation Even in the 20s writing about the Jazz Age Walter Lippmann foresaw this problem What most distinguishes the generation who have approached maturity since the debacle of idealism is not their rebellion against the religion and the moral code of their parents but their disillusionment with their own rebellion It is common for young men and women to rebel but that they should rebel sadly and without faith in their own rebellion that they should distrust the new freedom no less than the old certaintiesthat is something of a novelty So the difference now is that at all levels of American society there is not only a new questioning attitude but more hopeful spirit of moderation The extremists in both political parties have been losingnot only here but in most of the major nations of the world President Carter is in more trouble with George McGovern and the ADA than he is with the Republican leaders or with the AMA The socialists in Britain are finding that Fabian Socialism doesnt work The Communist ideology doesnt unify but divides Moscow and Peking And almost everybody is finding out as Huxley said that a mans worst difficulties begin when he is free to do as he likes Maybe this is going to he the puzzle before this years college graduates Not that they will have to go to war or drive smaller cars or live in houses that are not boiling in winter and freezing in summer but that they will be free to do what they likewithout any clear heroes villains or ideologies It will not be easy and in this sense maybe they were not all that lucky

Pregnancies Rising,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/15/archives/pregnancies-rising-in-10to15-age-group.html,THERE are approximately 332000 girls in grades seven through 12 in New Jerseys public schools and medical experts familiar with the situation expect more than 60000 of them to get pregnant this year Estimates provided both by these physicians and social workers show that about 130000 of the girls in the states junior and senior high schools are sexually active with the number increasing each year Two out of every 10 girls in junior and senior high school today will get pregnant during the year Dr Robert L Johnson director of adolescent medicine at the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry in Newark said in a recent interview He added that the rate of pregnancies in the inner cities ranged as high as 30 percent and that there was an alarming increase in the number of pregnancies among girls under 15 Many such girls of that age are not physically capable of giving normal birth to a child The increase in pregnancies in girls 10 to 15 years of age is rising at a higher rate than for those over 15 Dr Johnson said Most school programs are geared primarily to giving birthcontrol information to girls in high school but almost nothing is being done for girls in the lower grades According to Dr Johnson young girls because they are not sufficiently developed biologically can inflict severe damage upon themselves and upon the children to whom they hope to give birth The stress of pregnancy cannot be handled as well by a girl who is not mature or who has not finished her own growth than by a girl who has finished growing Dr Johnson said Their bone structure makes delivery very difficult and 70 percent of these girls have to be delivered by Caesarian section In addition there are often other major complications Dr Johnson declared that although official school policy had not changed with respect to sex education for 11and 12yearold girls some students coming td Martland Hospital in Newark where he works reported that a number of teachers were discussing birth prevention in the earlier grades In 1975 we estimated that there were 30000 to 33000 15to19yearold pregnant girls in New Jersey said Norma Clark president of New Jersey Planned Parenthood Affiliates in urging increased sexeducation programs in the public schools According to estimates from these groups and from medical records about half of the young girls undergo abortions In 1975 the number of recorded abortions performed in the state totaled 45000 Dr Margaret Gregory director of maternal and childcare services for the state Department of Health said that in 1975 the latest year for which statistics are available there were 12262 children born to girls in the 15to 19year age group and 303 to girls 10 to 14 years old Officiali are showing a great concern over the birth to the younger group because the growing fetus makes sharp de mands for nourishment on young bodies that are themselves undergoing rapid changes and require increasing amounts of nourishment just to develop At a recent conference on teenage parenthood Dr Myron Winick director of the Institute of Human Nutrition at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University noted that pregnant teenage individuals have the greatest nutritional requirements during pregnancy than any other individual They appear to be like sponges in terms of nutritional requirements Dr Winick said that in general teenage eating habits were atrocious and that in pregnant teenagers it was even worse because they tried to maintain their current eating habits without getting the additional nutritional requirements needed by the fetuses growing within them Dr Johnson said that many of the younger girls received almost no prenatal care for themselves or the fetuses and that many children born to them suffered from nutritional or functional disorders Almost 18 percent of the deliveries to this age group are premature he said thus adding to the difficulties that the children must endure Health authorities note that babies born to girls under 15 are two to three times more likely to die during the first year of life and that the instances of child abuse and parental neglect to these youngsters stagger the imagination While some communities have begun programs to deal with the problem one New Jersey town already has taken some concrete steps It is Englewood where there 10 pregnant girls are enrolled in a special program in the public schools Officials estimate that about another halfdozen pregnant teenage girls are attending regular classes At the beginning of the year there were only a few that we were aware of said Dr Sol Heckelman director of Special Pupil Services in the school district As the year went on they seemed to come out of the woodwork The Englewood school system has special program for the pregnant girls They are given regular academic courses in addition to courses on health and prenatal care However Violet P Cherry director of Health Services for the city feels that much more has to be done The rate of pregnancies here is very high she said We have had very little cooperation from the school system on creating any kind of a wellcoordinated program on prevention I really get so angry with them They dont see young people as being in a crisis The Englewood Health Department recently received a state grant of 26000 to begin one of the few programs in the country geared to meeting the health and socialservice needs of pregnant teenage girls All the medical needs of the girls are met by the Health Department working in close cooperation with Englewood Hospital Not only is prenatal and delivery care given but the young mothers also are provided with postpartum care and a publichealth nurse visits them immediately after delivery and later at home Attendance at child healthcare conferences is urged The department not only looks into child care and care for the mother but also provides educational and vocational guidance to the young mother helps with emotional problems and works toward getting the total family involved through therapy for the girl and her parents While school officials acknowledge that there are about 18 pregnant girls in the school system other officials in the city feel that there are dozens of other pregnancies that go unreported because parents tako the girls away for abortions 
CARTER RENEWS VOW FOR U. S. HEALTH PLAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/18/archives/carter-renews-vow-for-u-s-health-plan.html,LOS ANGELES May l7President Carter mounted a spirited defense of his domestic policies today using an enthusiastic labor meeting as a backdrop for his response to recent liberal Democratic criticism that he was ignoring human needs Before 4000 delegates to the United Automobile Workers convention his first appointment in a whirlwind blitz of this state the President vigorously enumerated such legislative proposals as simplified voter registration and he committed himself to the phasing in of a workable national health insurance system a concept that the UAW has long endorsed and which its representatives today reaffirmed in a standing ovation And when Mr Carter mentioned his proposed tax on large automobilesthe socalled gasguzzler taxthere was not a sound of protest from the floor of the cavernous Los Angeles Convention Center where last night Senator Edward M Kennedy the Massachusetts Democrat suggested in another speech that national health insurance was a promise that the President probably would not keep The Senators criticism was part of a thematic pattern that has emerged from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party in the last few weeks and although Mr Carter did not raise it specifically in his speech he was clearly conscious of its reality The speech was a key element in a tour carefully designed to explain his policies enhance his popularity and extend his personal contacts with the American people He answered dozens of questions from local residents in a regionally televised program and he traveled to Fresno for the major news media event of the day a casual stroll across a rich sprawling farm in the droughtstricken San Joaquin Valley before flying back to Washington You make me feel like Im back in the campaign he told a woman who asked his position on abortion on the onehour broadcast from a Los Angeles stationand for most of the eight hours on his schedule in the state that impression remained constant In Fresno a crowd of nearly 6000 people eagerly awaited his arrival and screamed excitedly at his every wave Poised relaxed smiling quipping he moved briskly through the day at his loping gait shaking hands making promises showing little wear and tear from the pace of his schedule and finishing as strong as he started when he left the White House early this morning At television station KNXT he walked through a huge blue drapery and onto a set that included about 200 people selected at random and various television monitors over which he could receive questions from outside the studio at five separate locations in Los Angeles and Orange Counties Seated alone but in close proximity to the friendly audience he fielded more than two dozen questionssome of which were disguised as polemics including one from a young man in East Los Angeles who objected to Federal funds for such immigrant groups as illegal aliens from Mexico and Vietnamese refugees With the exception of a few Indians were all immigrants Mr Carter countered slightly irritated by the young mans persistent argumentThat was the end of that The others involved in the program raised a broad variety of subjects including the Federal Bureau of Investigation mental health Americans in Mexican prisons on drug charges his energy conservation program the plight of pregnant drug addicts the cost of singlefamily housing and even the problem of graffiti in public locales A black woman from Watts who wanted assurances from the President that black people would be appointed throughout the Federal bureaucracy spoke bluntly to Mr Carter much to his apparent delight We didnt play tictactoe with you in the election she said as the audience in the studio tittered and we dont expect you to play tictactoe with us It was the Presidents first visit to this state since his election and inauguration and one of his first pronouncements when he stepped from Air Force One at Los Angeles Airport was an assurance that unlike his political pollster Patrick Caddell he does not consider the states popular young Governor Edmund G Brown Jr a threat or a foe Then the two men climbed into a long sleek armored limousine for the careening ride down the citys freeways to the convention center where Leonard Woodcock the retiring president of the UAW introduced the President At first his presence on the dais prompted only a moderately enthusiastic response but the delegates soon warmed to Mr Carter and eventually seemed eager to applaud almost every statement They were particularly pleased with effusive praise for Mr Woodcock whom he has chosen as chief of the United States Mission in Peking Similarly they roared when he spoke of being driven to their convention in one of their finest products the limousine It was one of two that the Federal Government owns on the West Coast The other was transferred to Fresno for his use on the farm tour White House aides who noted that Mr Carters generally eschews such luxurious transportation nevertheless approved the use of the cars here on the basis of economy It would have cost more they said to ship an armored sedanthe Presidents preferenceto California than to use the cars on hand Although his speech before the convention was in its text typical of the Presidents restrained approach to public oratoryprecisely organized like a doctoral dissertation blandly worded like a cafeteria recipehe delivered it in such uncharacteristically ringing style that many who had heard him before were surprised The speech nevertheless accomplished just what he had suggested it would in his news conference last week It set forth as a response to his liberal critics his belief in an absolute necessity for an unceasing meticulous management of all the numerous facets and factors of national life all of which he sees as com plexly interrelated We aim to balance the budget in 1981 in a strong and healthy economy he said Cutting back programs that really help people is not the way to balance the budget but even with adequate revenue we would still have to make some help people is not the way to balance taxpayers money Then borrowing a line from Governor Brown who was at his side throughout the day the President cautioned against great expectations We cant afford to do everything he said The Presidents philosophy of cautious management and careful discipline were in fact cited by White House aides today as the reason for his own minutely planned schedule for this trip In less than 18 hours he would fly across the country twice a round trip of more than 5000 miles because it was said he wished to avoid the accumulation of papers on his desk during a more extended absence Despite the rigorous pace of his day Mr Carter seemed as fresh at the end as at the beginning and the President aides promised more of the same in the future

NEW YORK FIGHTS L.I. TO GET ADOPTION DATA,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/20/archives/new-york-fights-li-to-get-adoption-data-morgenthau-says-refusal-to.html,An investigation by the Manhattan Dis trict Attorneys office into an alleged nationwide black market in babies operated by New York lawyers is developing into a confrontation between the District Attorney and two suburban courts The District Attorney Robert M Morgenthau is seeking to overturn in the states Appellate Division a ruling by a State Supreme Court justice who held that adoption records must remain confidential The case expected to be argued in the First Department next Wednesday pits Mr Morgenthaus office against Suffolk Countys Clerk of the Family Court and Nassau Countys Clerk of the Surrogates Court both of whom succeeded in quashing subpoenas to produce adoption records The court battle is regarded as a test case for the District Attorneys office which has served subpoenas in 10 counties in the area in an effort to uncover alleged instances of perjury obstruction of justice conspiracy and the unlawful placement of children for adoption Morgenthaus Argument A brief presented to the Appellate Division by the District Attorneys office points out that the rules of each court having jurisdiction over adoption proceedings require that the adoptive parents and their lawyers submit affidavits in which they swear that they have not made or received any payment for the child Therefore the District Attorney argues examination of adoption records is imperative to the grand jury investigation seeking to uncover illegalities in private nonagency adoptions But the Nassau and Suffolk County court officials successfully argued before Justice George Pastel of State Supreme Court that compliance would violate the Domestic Relations Law which normally forbids access to such records Justice Postel set aside the subpoenas two months ago Adoption records are by law confidential unless a court order granting access is obtained after a showing of good cause and on due notice to the adoptive parents In his decision Justice Pastel said that the unfounded speculations of the District Attorney did not persuade the Court to release the records and that in the long run the release of such information might conceivably do much more harm than good Complaint from Jersey The District Attorneys investigation into the alleged sale of babiesa violation of the states Social Service Lawresulted from a complaint by a married New Jersey woman who had given up her baby for adoption According to the court brief the investigation has led to Manhattan lawyers who locate and support unwed pregnant young women who are induced to give up their babies to families that the lawyers have previously agreed to supply with infants Citing an affidavit by a detective assigned to the investigation the brief charges that several of these women were told that if they backed out of the arrangement they would be liable for all costs incurred while adoptive parents paid lawyers fees ranging from 4000 to 8000 The District Attorneys office believethat the natural mothers come from the Middle West and the South and from Europe The office said the mothers were referred to the lawyers by people in abortion clinics and hospitals and by doctors and lawyers in other states Mr Morgenthau said yesterday that in the investigation his office was dealing with law enforcement authorities in California Illinois Florida and New Jerscy where five lawyers were indicted for sell ing babies last month
TV VIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/22/archives/tv-view-the-british-are-still-the-masters-of-the-miniseries.html,There are three new miniseries in television town all of them playing outside the commercial networks and each of them reflecting different production arrangements Poldark the new 16episode tale on public TVs Masterpiece Theater Sundays at 9 on Channel 12 is an import from the British Broadcasting Corporation Hard Times a fourpart public TV production Wednesdays at 8 is a coproduction of WNET13 and Granada TV a commercial organization in England And Testimony of Two Men six hours based on the novel by Taylor Caldwell Mondays at 8 on WPIX Channel 11 represents the first major production of a new syndicated effort called Operation Prime Time If any general conclusion can be wrenched from generous samplings of the batch its that the British still seem to do these things better Experience is an indispensable asset Meanwhile with these new series more alternatives to the network schedules are at hand and the ratings charts are generating some intriguing reading Between the first week in March and the last week in April the combined weekly ratings for ABC CBS and NBC declined by eight points which translates into a loss of about 55 million homes This could be interpreted as the normal annual drop when spring and daylight savings time tend to keep people outdoors later in the evening But this has not been a normal year The networks have been facing stiffer competition with the most dramatic example found in the blockbuster ratings for the first installment of The Nixon Interviews With David Frost In addition with their own intramural competitions remaining intense the networks have been reverting to an uncommonly heavy schedule of special programming In one recent period for instance only 30 percent of NBCs schedule consisted of reruns Interestingly enough the less reruns that viewers get the less they seem to want Given a reasonable alternative they increasingly tune out on most of the reruns especially it should be noted on the miniseries such as Captains and the Kings On a recent Wednesday evening NBC clobbered its competition in major markets with a Boxing Night constructed around a heavyweight bout in which Ken Norton defeated Duane Bobick Primetime boxing automatically raises some embarrassing questions about violence on TV and NBC was devilishly clever in its packaging of the product An opening collage of the fighters arriving in New York set to the song Luck Be a Lady Tonight could have been designed for a musical variety special The fights complete with closeups of blood and assorted bruises were then surrounded by special features including a film on how Hollywood treated boxing from Body and Soul to Rocky Sylvester Stallone the actor was present on tape with anecdotes and sequences from Rocky which certainly didnt hurt the ratings One memorable moment capturing a certain essential something about show business boxing and television offered Stallone sitting in the middle of a ring expounding grandly to two awed NBC announcers Shakespeare said it best Stallone observed To those who feel life is a tragedy to those who think life is a comedy First of all that is not exactly the way it was said Secondly it was said not by Shakespeare but some 150 years later by Horace Walpole in a letter to a countess So much for literary sophistication on Boxing Night Back in the miniseries Poldark which reaches its third hour tonight is based on four novels by Winston Graham Written about 30 years ago the stories are set in 18thcentury Cornwall Returning in 1783 from service with the British Army in the rebellious American colonies Ross Poldark Robin Ellis finds his estate neglected following his fathers death and his intended wife the cool and blond Elizabeth Jill Townsend engaged to his cousin Francis Clive Francis The darkly handsome Poldark sets about putting his house in order but despite the most idealistic of intentions his personal life is wracked by tumultuous business and personal affairs This is the blatantly romantic tale stuffed with relationships constantly on the verge of either immediate disaster or eternal bliss With Grahams being a stickler for research the whole is spiked with accurate details about life and industry especially copper mining in old Cornwall Filmed on splendid Cornish locations the production depending on ones appetite for romance and pure escape works surprisingly well Poldarks relationship with the spirited Demelva Angharad Rees who resembles Mick Jagger in a red wig provides a neat symmetrical balance to his lingering love for Elizabeth And in a land of rigid social levels Poldark represents something of a fantasizing catharsis in his support of the underdog and his contempt for the savages among the gentry done up in their finery The first four episodes written by Jack Pulman are especially successful in striking an acceptable balance between romance and reality The tension is lost somewhat in the fifth hour when the assignment switches to Paul Wheeler and under Paul Annetts direction the production slips into jarring cuteness particularly in a sequence involving the building of a new home With 11 more episodes to follow however the chances for recovery are good WNET 13s participation in the dramatization of Charles Dickenss Hard Times consisted of providing some money and a smattering of editorial consultation Artistic control remained firmly in British hands with Peter Eckersley as producer but the American investment was certainly well placed Arthur Hoperafts script is remarkably faithful to Dickenss characters and to his conception of the industrial and lifedraining Coketown And the cast headed by Patrick Allen as Gradgrind and Timothy West as Bounderby concocts a marvelous collection of performances those character portrayals at which the British are masters If any flaw can be detected in this production it would perhaps be in an occasional failure to capture adequately some of the novels special Dickensian humor Even when people and events are at their bleakest Dickens is amused by human foibles The problem with any dramatization of his work is that the central situations of misery might overwhelm some of the parenthetical humor especially for those who havent read the book WPIX has been running Testimony of Two Men in three twohour installments the last is scheduled for tomorrow evening The station is a charter financing member of Operation Prime Time an MCAUniversal project designed to provide quality alternatives to network programming This first production arrives with reams of publicity about large budgets over 500000 per hour and an allstar cast consisting mostly of performers from expired TV series Unfortunately its claims to quality founder on the basic matter of content Miss Caldwells novel is a rather typical survey of several generations combining personal quests and several varieties of lust with conspiracy theories of economic history In this dramatization the history is downplayed for a nearly nonstop escalation of personal disastersfrustrated affairs unhappy marriages bloody wars abortions murders rapes and innumerable betrayals As the idealistic hero Jonathan Ferrier David Birney is regularly reduced to slapping his forehead and peering out hesitantly from under his palm But he does manage to salvage a creditable performance as do several of the women in the cast Linda Purl Laurie Prange Devon Ericson and Inga Swenson For all of its grand ambitions Testimony of Two Men is a curiously sloppy affair suggesting too little preparation and less than enough time for production The finished product appears to be not so much artistically realized as pasted together One clue to serious problems in such efforts can nearly always be found in the music track which gets heavier and louder in direct ratio to the emptiness of the production British productions for example use music sparingly Testimony of Two Men is drenched in the stuff from The Battle Hymn of the Republic to giant string ensembles for the love scenes Supposed alternatives to network fare must be expected to do better

grand jury witness suspected of wrongdoing could be used against him in a later prosecution for a substantive criminal offense even though he had not been warned in advance of his testimony that he

reasonable notice may he desirable in the wake of a newsworthy event while the interest of the public in observing jail conditions may be satisfied by formal scheduled tours The Court refused to review a ruling of a lower court that had declined to throw nut at a preliminary stage a libel suit over an article in Penthouse magazine involving persons connected with a California resort The case raises issues about the definition of a public figure as the phrase is used in libel cases to determine the standard by which a press report is to be judged The lower court in the case had declined to dismiss the suit summarily because it found that there were triable issues of fact as to whether the owners and operators of the resort were public figures or not Penthouse Intl Ltd v Rancho La Costa

The Race for Governor,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/28/archives/the-race-for-governor-derose-he-says-vote-total-is-growing-in.html,EAST ORANGE May 27In the 1973 Democratic gubernatorial primary Ralph C DeRose a former State Senator and a relative unknown ran third in a fiveway race with 95085 votes to Brendan Byrnes 193120 votes and Anne Kleins 116705 Mr DeRose one of 10 Democrats seeking the nomination on June 7 is confident that this time he will win I have visited the areas where people voted for me and I have maintained the support I had throughout the state that I had in 1973 he said during an interview in his law office here Brendan Byrne was conceded to be the winner at that time and the people who stood by me in my losing bid for the nomination did so because of my position on the issues My position on the issues has not changed The 48yearold lawyer who was appointed to the Bistate Waterfront Commission by Governor Byrne in 1974 contends that he can add 20000 to 30000 votes to the 14740 he received in Hudson County alone Mr DeRose hacked Thomas F Smith in the Jersey City mayoral election a few weeks ago and Mr Smith overwhelmingly defeated Mayor Paul T Jordans candidate The defeat forced Dr Jordan out of the race for Governor Though Dr Jordan gave his support to Governor Byrne Mr DeRose says that with the help of Mr Smith  I think Im going to be the beneficiary of a very substantial vote in Hudson Support in Essex County In Essex where Mr DeRose outpolled Mr Byrne four years ago he has the support of Harry Lerner the chairman of the regular Democratic organization Mr DeRose says he is the only major Democratic candidate who is unalterably opposed to the state income tax which he says is stifling the economy of New Jersey They use education as the reason for the income tax Mr DeRose asserts but I think the people refuse to accept that as a bonafide reason for the income tax He says that the taxpayers of the state spend more than 2 billion a year on education and that the schools are graduating students who can barely read comic book Mr DeRose who lives in South Orange with his vfe Joy and twin 21yearold sons says that once elected he would move to repeal the thorough and efficient education law and set minimum education standards and mandatory testing of students He said that he would define thorough and efficient as an education that guarantees that a child receiving high school diploma can function at the 12th grade level As for replacirm revenue from the income tax that is now earmKVet for education Mr DeRose said thzto this could he done through efficiency and economy in government He notes that the Department of Education has an army of bureaucrats that rivals that of the state and that thousands of paper shuffling administrative jobs could be eliminated with the teachers returning to the classrooms Sales Tax Change Urged Money for educational purposes could come he says by imposing the sales tax on the wholesale rather than the retail level He believes that this move would brill^b in 250 million that is now being lost because of a lack of sufficient controls on reporting and collecting of the sales tax In addition he advocates that 45 percent of the real estate taxes on a new or expanding industry go into a special pool he would create with the money being returned to school districts on perstudent basis He said he felt that this would not hinder expansion or an influx of industry since the tax levels would remain the same or even be reduced As for jobs he would move briskly on highway mass transit and construction projects which he says are stymied He says 1 billion in Federal money is available to the state with minimal spending by the state He would also press the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to develop Newark Airport as a major air cargo center with rail links to the Meadowlands where land is available for a massive industrial complex Mr DeRose scoffs at those who label him a conservative and says that his position includes stances on a wide spectrum of issues For instance on abortion he is opposed to it personally but believes the issue is a matter of personal choice He is in favor of the decriminalization of possession of small amounts of marijuana stating that Kids shouldnt have a police record because they tried pot He does not encourage the use of marijuana and wants stronger penalties for major drug dealers Stand on Death Penalty He favors restoration of the death penalty for people convicted of wanton murder or the killing of a law enforcement officer mandatory minimum sentences for those convicted of violent crimes and increased compensation for victims of crime He advocates a cautious approach to offshore oil drilling with the highest environmental standards and safeguards applied to sites off the New Jersey shoreline Mr DeRose has put together a team of professional campaign workers many of whom worked in the Carter campaign on the West Coast They plan a massive telephone drive of more than 370000 calls in the the closing days of the campaign They also have 650000 eightpage advertisng supplements ready to be inserted in six major newspapers in the state Mr DeRose is reluctant to say how much his campaign will cost stating that Well spend as much as we get in In his first financial statement submitted to the State Election Law Enforcement Commission two weeks ago Mr DeRose reported that he had raised 130000 and spent 115000 He borrowed 30000 from his brother Daniel and owes 68000 to other lenders He said that in his 1973 bid for the nomination he spent 240000 During that campaign he received 5400 contribution from the International Longshoremens Association and later when he was nominated to the Waterfront Commission there was talk that he had shadowy ties with underworld figures Innuendo Is Charged When asked about this Mr DeRose bristles annoyedly There was leaked innuendo which was an attempt to prevent me from being appointed to the Waterfront Commission but it failed miserably he said angrily An investigation failed to uncover any wrongdoing In 1975 Mr DeRose was again the subject of an investigation when he accepted a 10000amonth contract with a Morristown concern that had received a 50 million portion of a 300 million sewer project in Camden County I have never suffered or would I suffer a charge of impropriety he said When the Governor charged me with conflict of interest I took him to court and proved he was wrong He added that he no longer had any connections with the Morristown concern When youre up front he said of his present bid for the State House the long knives come out

Ideas &,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/29/archives/ideas-trends-in-summary-the-transfer-of-genes-that-make-insulin.html,In Summary The Transfer of Genes That Make Insulin Dr Howard M Goodman expiams process of transplanting insulin genes from rats into bacteria magnified above in a laboratory culture A longawaited development in genetic research that could eventually have beneficial consequences for diabetics has taken place Scientists have transferred genes for producing insulin the hormone whose absence or malfunction causes diabetes from a mammal to a bacterium Insulinproducing genes from rats were transplanted to a laboratory strain of the bacterium Escherichia coli after the transplant succeeding generations of bacteria continued to reproduce producing further copies of the gene The transplanted genes have not yet caused their hosts to manufacture insulin Like most genes most of the time they are dormant until they receive the biochemical stimulus that causes them to function A number of practical consequences such as the breeding of new bacteria to eat oil spills or manufacture antibiotics have been envisioned since the beginning of genetransplant research All such results are still speculative but the insulingene transplant is a Step toward several possible practical developments including the largescale production of human insulin by bacteria for use in the control of human diabetes and the study of the regulation of insulin gene function in humans The first if achieved would avoid a possible world shortage of natural insulin which at present is derived from the pancreases of animals slaughtered for food the second might lead to a means of turning on the defective pancreatic cells of diabetic humans enabling them to make their own insulin Diabetes can be marked at its onset by a variety of symptomsunusual thirst or hunger weight loss blurred vision numbness in the extremities drowsiness Serious cases if untreated can result in coma and death The disease affects an estimated 10 million people in the United States Of these only about 125 million are derendent on insulin injections the rest are either mild undiagnosed cases or are able to control the disease with diet or oral drugs About one million suffer from the socalledand more seriousjuvenile onset diabetes in which the body can produce no insulin at all Catholic Code on Sex A new study of sexuality commissioned by the Catholic Theological society of America advises Catholics not to rely solely on biblical injunctions or church codes as guides to texual behavior but to make their own judgments about sexual morality The society is the main professional organization of Catholic theologians in Canada and the United States It is not part of the Catholic hierarchy but its members play an influential role as teachers of priests and interpreters of doctrine A sexual act is to be judged moral the study counsels if it is selfliberatng otherenriching honest faithful socially responsible lifeserving and joyous No act is to be considered ini rinsically evil It is the whole action including circumstances and intention that constitutes the basis for ethical judgment The result some Catholics say is not necessarily a permissive view of sex When the proposed tests of morality are applied said John Kirvin who edited the study for the publisher Paulist Press you would be hardpressed to conclude that adultery morally justified Entitled Human Sexuality New Directions in American Catholic Thought the study discusses such topics as contraception extramarital sex masturbation sterilization childfree marriage and homosexuality without midemning any as wrong under all circumstances This contrasts with the position of the Catholic bishops of the United States Last November they approved by a vote of 172 to 25 a pastoral letter upholding the churchs traditional and absolute prohibition against divorce artificial birth control abortion extramarital and premarital sex and homosexual acts The Transplant Coordinators The development of kidney transplant technology has given rise to a new paramedical specialty the job of kidney transplant coordinator These specialists who work in hospitals and regional centers across the country have varying responsibilities but in general they handle the administrative and technical work required Many coordinators aggressively promote donations They keep in touch with doctors and nurses who may know where a kidney can be found and also persuade relatives who are often reluctant to consent to donations Because by one estimate there are about 11000 potential recipients at any time in the United States while only about 2000 kidneys are likely to become available transplant coordinators serve in effect as brokers of a scarce and precious commodity and their activities do much to affect the supply of transplantable organs Although no one is certain how many coordinators are at work according to one medical estimate about 100 may be directly involved in obtaining kidneys while another 100 may work in patient care and the followup required for years after a transplant A Ruling on Reportage A Federal appeals court appears to have established a new First Amendment privilege of the press that of the neutral reportage of serious charges by responsible sources against public figures without incurring the risk of libel The case arose in 1972 when The New York Times reported that officials of the National Audubon Society had suggested that some of the societys scientific critics were paid to lie and identified some of the critics the officials apparently had in mind Some of the scientists named successfully sued for libel but in reversing that finding last week Judge Irving R Kaufman said for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that the First Amendment protected the accurate and disinterested reporting of such charges regardless of the reporters private views regarding their validity The courts distinction concerning the reporters private views is important because under previous Supreme Court decisions a reporter or his newspaper might have been found liable for repeating an accusation he suspected to he false or whose truth he failed to investigate adequately Court Challenge By Adoptees A class action suit has been filed that challenges the constitutionality of laws permanently sealing the birth and adoption records of adopted children The lawsuit underlines the increasing militance of adoptees who believe they have a right to learn the identity of their natural parents Brought in Federal District Court in Manhattan the action apparently the first of its kind in the nation is directed only at New York state and city laws but association officials believe that court victory here would set a precedent for other states At present only Alabama and Kentucky open records to adult adoptees on request The organization that brought the suit the Adoptecs Liberty Movement Association has a membership of 10000 around the country It contends that the sealing of records violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment by causing adoptees psychological pain suffering and damage not experienced by nonadopted persons Controversy over adoption records has come to the fore in the last half dozen years Opponents of open records argue that natural parents are entitled to privacy Proponents among them many behavioral scientists believe that an adoptees longing to know his origins is a need that goes beyond curiosity and that satisfying the need strengthens an adoptees psychological identity Virginia Adams and Tom Ferrell
Coming of Age in the Sixties,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/29/archives/coming-of-age-in-the-sixties-sixties.html,THE most characteristic literature of our agewhether it bills itself as fiction faction nonfiction or even poetryconsists of a kind of hearing witness bearing witness to history seen through the prism of personal experience to personality formed in the crucible of society We have become so hooked on this kind of personal testimony that we tend to mistrust fantasy fairy tale and myth and to ask of our writers Did you do it Were you really there As if only a yes answer could validate their books could make them worth reading LOOSE CHANGE Three Women of the Sixties By Sara Davidson Illustrated 367 pp New York Doubleday  Co 950 Sara Davidsons book of fictionalized reportage Loose Change bills itself as the truetolife adven tures of three women of the sixties It purports to he a social history of that tumultuous period seen through the lives of three California women Sara Tasha and Susie who went to Berkeley in the early 60s were seniors when JFK was assassinated pursued the various panaceas of sexual liberation political activism spiritual questing and wound up being 30 and disappointed just like most people As in a novel the names have been changed except for Sara Davidson who appears as Sara in the book Her story is by far the most authentic and interesting What particularly distinguishes Loose Change from a novel about the same period is its formlessness its easy topicality its false sense conveying history when it is really only dropping the names of historical events as one might drop the of famous people The times were changin the waters had grown President Kennedy was shot The Beatles arrived Wed better start swimming or sink like a stone Erica Song is the author of How to Save Your Own Life Fear of Flying and three volumes of poetry She currently at work on a fourth book of poems Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert were run out of Harvard for fooling with LSD Negroes sat in at Woolworth lunch counters Buddhist monks set fire to themselves in South Vietnam where was that exactly while Madame Nhu went on tour declaring that Vietnam would soon win its war against the Communists providing US aid were not withdrawn It is as if the author expected the mere invocation of the events to conjure memories in the reader to carry their own emotional weight A teenager born in 1963 would read this hook in vain seeking to know how it felt to he a college student when the President was assassinated The author rattles off famous historical events for the reader rather than recreating them shaping them and making them come alive And yet there is a touching story here and it is Sara Davidsons own story Sara the character and perhaps the author too has an engaging sense of adventure a willingness to try anything once a real lust for life She is a risktaker willing to he a fool if in the process she may find enlightenment She chronicles her growing up in Los Angeles her college years at Berkeley her doomed marriage to a fascinating diskjockeynovelist a hilarious sojourn at the Columbia School of Journalism and her early attempts at articlewriting with an admirable effort to he descriptive rather than judgmental The vocation of the journalist Sara finds is inimical to honesty about the self One of the most moving sections of Loose Change deals with the authors passage from cynicism to trust and openness through her meetings with Ram Doss the American guru formerly Dr Richard Alpert Davidson sets out to nail and categorize Ram Doss and other salvation seekers and winds up questioning the roots of her profession and livelihood From my new perspective I saw that most pieces of journalism certainly my most successful pieces were based on an attitude of superiority and ridicule If I wanted to honor the divinity in people I could no longer treat them this waycoaxing them into spilling Information I could use against them to make a good story The Ram [ass material raises the most compelling spiestions in this otherwise rather cluttered book What good is political radicalism if we dont seek to know and change ourselves What good is sexual freedom if we find it difficult to love ourselves and others What point is there to the constant chasing after exotic experiences if in the process we lose our own centers The other two women whose lives are chronicled in Loose Change are exemplary in different ways Tasha is the beautiful one the blonde California girl with turquoise eyes who falls in love with poets and artists and spends a decade working out her fathers death in her mind before she can commit herself to a relationship with a man who nourishes her Susie is the orphan from Beverly Hills whose parents were killed in a plane crash when she was 10 and who dreams from earliest childhood of being a healer a helper of people a sort of Beverly Hills version of The Catcher in the Rye She marries the radical Big Man on Campus lives in his shadow for years hears a lovely son who is in part responsible for her liberation journeys around the world on forged plane tickets cures her own frigidity with a vibrator and finally enters medical school becomes a healer and only then is able to find love because she has healed herself The lives of all three women are interesting enough but the telling is often so sprawling that only at odd moments does one feel empathy for them As a writer Davidson has a tendency to drown the reader in trivialike a cook drowning a prime fillet in sauce We have to know the brandnames of every garment worn by every character and yet the most important emotional events deaths abortions political assassinations the disappearance of relatives in fascist countries are passed over with hardly an effort to describe what anyone thought or felt There is a heartbreaking shallowness hereheartbreaking because the hook might have been so much stronger It is not that one wants answers about the 60s and whether or not their particular contribution to sensibility survived the decade but only that the questions might have been posed more sharply Without a review to write I would have given up long before the end  which is a shame because the three stories do indeed have a kind of cumulative power and the end is far more potent than the beginning Nevertheless Loose Change did accomplish its purpose in that it left me pondering the 60s trying to relate the lives of my friends to those of the women Sara Davidson writes about and trying to make sense of the wave of reaction and retrenchment that has swept over our country in the past few years It is fascinating to hear Sara Davidsons characters circa 1968 predicting revolution within a minimum of six months maximum of six years and then to realize that here it is 1977 and such predictions have already en tered the hazy realm of nostalgiaalong with Scott Fitzgeralds flaming youth Hemingways Paris and the recipes of Alice B Toklas What does America do to gobble up incipient revolutions make their leaders momentarily famous on the cover of Time magazine and then throw them into the dustbin along with old soda bottles aerosol cans and other nonrecyclable trash Why do our most passionate revolutionaries whether leftist black or feminist eventually give up the hope of changing Americas ways and turn instead to yogic meditation Buddhism born again Christianity or Sufism Why is America the country of the most extravagant hopes and the most profound disappointments Does the media really have the power to trivialize and thus destroy every important social movement or does it only seem that way to us Are changes really occurring at a deeper level Loose Change prompts one to ask these questions for that alone 
"Quebec Separatists, Now Ruling, Decide to Moderate Their Policy",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/30/archives/quebec-separatists-now-ruling-decide-to-moderate-their-policy.html,MONTREAL May 29Under strong pressure from the Quebec government the provinces ruling party moderated its program today in an effort to attract domestic and international support for its goal of independence The removal from the program of the Parti Qubcois of any reference to a withdrawal by an independent Quebec from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or from North American defense arrangements was one striking example of the moderation shown in the first convention since the party assumed power in November When the threeday meeting opened in the Olympic Velodrome Friday night Premier Ren Lvesque warned the 1500 delegates that the party could no longer act as it had in opposition and had to take account of the limits and constraints of power It was apparent that the government sought elbow room to pursue policies that would attract as much support and frighten as few people as possible and when the convention ended tonight the most radical elements were in a minority Concern About Defense Issue The partys opposition to defense links with the West in general and with the United States in particular as expressed in the program that was in force until today had been cited by its adversaries as an example of how dangerous a separate Quebec might become and had encouraged talk of another Cuba on the United States doorstep In the new program the party continues to back a pacifist foreign policy but talks only of a reassessment of Quebecs alliances Claude Morin the minister of intergovernmental affairs said he had been constantly questioned on this point in his contacts with officials outside the province and he cited the West Germans as showing particular concern Mr Morin said the delegates had been content to set general goals and to leave the government free to determine how to achieve them Thus the goal of independence was reaffirmed but the convention took account of the governments promise to the electorate to hold a referendum before taking concrete steps to achieve political separation from the rest of Canada Gone from the program are references to immediate steps toward independence and instead the government will promote as much as possible the autonomy of Quebec for the period to spent be within the present political regime Agreement on Immigration This the government has already been doing A few days ago it won from the Federal Government an agreement to share power in determining what immigrants come to Quebec Up to now immigration had been a federal preserve exclusively In the same moderate vein today resolutions that urged abolition of Englishlanguage schooling in Quebec were defeated and the delegates backed legislation now under debate that would make French virtually the only language in Quebec but would allow a public Englishlanguage school system to continue The most notable exception to the moderate tone of the conventions deliberations came when the congress approved a resolution that would legalize abortion on demandonly possible after Quebec became independent because the criminal code is exclusively federal stand in favor of abortion could be damaging for the party in a predominantly Catholic province and Mr Lvesque ended the congress by saying the Government would not feel bound by the resolution Its only effect he said would be to open a needed debate
‘I Am the Law’,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/30/archives/i-am-the-law.html,In the third of his television interviews Richard Nixon spoke of the benefits of his foreign policy for Cambodia For five years he told David Frost from 1970 till 1975 Cambodia enjoyed    enjoyed is not the best wordit had what you call a flawed neutrality The actual impact of American policy was described by Rep Paul McCloskey when he visited Cambodia in 1975 as greater evil than we have done to any country in the world One of the last Western correspondents there John Swain of The London Sunday Times wrote on his journey out The entire countryside has been churned up by B52 bomb craters whole towns and villages razed So far I have not seen one intact pagoda The malign effects of some of the Nixon Administrations policies abroad the human damage the harm to true American interestswere immeasurably greater than those caused by the domestic abuses Generations will pay for the excesses in Chile the four added years of war in Vietnam Compared to such enormities Watergate was as Mr Nixon said a pipsqueak thing The destructive acts abroad were like Watergateor worsein manner as well as substance They were career out with crude deception of Congress and the public with contempt for the constitutional system with obsessive secrecy A gross example came in the Interviews when Mr Nixon was asked about the savage repression of East Pakistan in 1971 Lets not leave any impression he said that we condoned what the West Pakistani Army was doing But in effective policy terms that is exactly what Mr Nixon and Henry Kissinger did covered up the slaughter refusing to criticize or even to notice it American diplomats in East Pakistan sent repeated cables to Washington asking for a statement against the killing Roger Morris a former aide to Mr Kissinger quotes the cables in a book to be published this summer The diplomats said they were mute and horrified witnesses to a reign of terror by the Pakistan military to selective genocide But Mr Kissinger squashed a move in the State Department to say something Mr Morris concludes In the name of preserving Pakistans territorial integrity    Washingtons silence condoned a reign of terror that made secession of Bangladesh inevitable What is so striking about the arbitrary acts abroad as the interviews remind us is that Mr Nixon and his aides were never called to account for them as they were for the domestic abuses I think the reason for that distinction is clear and extremely important to understand The United States is dependent on law to control the abuse of official power more so than any other democratic country While the British rely on Parliamentary questions to correct their leaders or on the clubbish feeling of an intimate governing elite we depend on Judgesand on the ultimate respect for law that holds a heterogeneous society together That was the lesson of Watergate The sense that he had violated a leaders fundamental obligation to obey the law is what brought Richard Nixon down It was because the idea was so American that foreigners had difficulty understanding Watergate and still do But the sense of law and legal standards does not apply with the same force in foreign affairs That is largely because judges have traditionally declined to resolve issues touching on foreign and military matters deeming themselves incompetent in those areas even as they resolve the most controversial domestic questions of race and politics and abortion Without the restraints of law Presidents moved from primacy to the assertion of unlimited authority in foreign affairs The extreme was reached with Mr Nixon who treated disagreement with his policy as a form of subversion to be repressed by any method that he declared necessary He introduced to the White House the maxim that Boss Frank Hague used to apply in Jersey City I am the law And men otherwise committed to law did not challenge lawlessness in foreign affairs Elliot Richardson insisted that Spiro Agnew be held to account for graft but he excused an act infinitely more contemptuous of our constitutional system Mr Nixons bombing of Cambodia in 1973 without authority in any treaty statute resolution or need to protect American lives America has learned from Presidential abuses abroad as from Watergate Congress began to reassert a role in setting limits with the War Powers Act and the law forbidding military action in Indochina But in the absence of the judicial restraints that protect us at home we shall have to rely ultimately on our political leaders respect for the constitutional balance the mutual understanding and restraint that in the larger sense are law

Department had turned down the request to supply one because for the last several years the flag had been stolen regularly after the memorial service Next year well bring our own flagI guarantee it said John Morahan of the American Legion one of several veterans groups participating Every borough and nearly every suburb or community had its patriotic wreathlaying or community parade but the big

Mattatuck and a memorial service in Southampton were sparsely attended mainly by local residents The less hardy of the thousands of visitors who descended on the East End of Long Island thronged shops

roses on the monument to the towns war dead A weak lowpressure area moving from Pennsylvania and New Jersey brought intermittent showers to the city between 6 and 8 AM when the temperature was in the

golf courses bicycling and cookouts as well as parades It didnt seem there were as many Girl Scouts as there used to be said Patricia Murphy who attended the Westport Conn parade with her husband William and their daughters But a lot more Girl Scouts were in baseball uniforms than in previous parades In New York City many an entire area might as well have posted a gone fishin sign For

The Race for Governor,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/01/archives/the-race-for-governor-minor-candidates-run-with-faith-hope.html,Five of the 10 Democrats and two of the four Republicans seeking their parties governorship nominations next Tuesday are given virtually no chance of winning though in most cases they are campaigning vigorously and optimistically Perhaps the best known of the socalled minor candidates is State Senator Raymond Garramone Democrat of Haworth who began his political career in 1964 by getting elected as the first Democratic Councilman in the heavily Republican borough In 1969 he was elected Mayor and in 1973 to the State Senate Despite his 10 years in politics the 50yearold candidate bills himself as an engineer and businessman  he was graduated from New York University with a degree in electrical engineering and is a partner in a Manhattan commercial heating and airconditioning concern Gari Air Conditioning Incand wants to bring a business sense and business tactics to the job of running state government Timing is the key to it all Mr Garramane said during a recent speech As a businessman and engineer I know that no successful enterprise can be efficient unless it applies the discipline of program and capital improvement planning The days of government being able to get by with hitormiss methods or a letsworryaboutthatlater thinking are over Government must be cost efficient and cost effective Mr Garramone an affable and gregarious legislator feels that the states problems can be solved through practical systematic cohesive action He has proposed creation of a professional Department of State Planning He has also put together a package of bills designed to stimulate the economy by giving tax incentives to industries that expand or put on new employees His medical legislation has received support from consumer groups and from medical associations He voted for the state income tax last summer and is opposed to an increase in the sales tax When asked why he continues to run when the odds against him appear to be so great Mr Garramone smiled and said Im going to win of course Wallace Supporter Running The other lesserknown Democratic candidates are A Howard Freund 51 of Elizabeth who is running on a slogan of Democrats Against the State Income Tax In the 1960s he was a supporter of Gov George C Wallace of Alabama In 1970 he ran for United States Senate on the American Independent Party ticket In the past he has been involved in campaigns against busing abortion and the income tax George Koukos a 54yearold production worker from Union is an organizer for the steelworkers union and is opposed to the income tax He is running on a slogan of Demand Immediate Repeal of Income Tax Emery J Zold of Blenheim is the 38yearold owner of a thriving surplus equipment company who began his career by picking up boards at construction sites and selling them He is running on a slogan of Government for the People Stop Bossism Melvin H Whaley of Paterson is running on a slogan of Democrat of Change and divides his time between the campaign trail and his job as a teacher in the Passaic County Technical School Two Minor Republicans The two minor Republican candidates are C Robert Sarcone of Newark and William A Angus of Moorestown Mr Sarcone 51 has waged a strenuous campaign A lawyer he is a former Assemblyman and former State Senator He is also a former assistant prosecutor in Essex County He is running on a slogan of Republican [No State Income Tax] Mr Sarcone said that as Governor he would cut costs eliminate the spend for spend fake philosophy and return control of government to the level where the people can manage it He has proposed that the philosophy of zero budgeting be applied to all functions of state government to automatinally weed out the obsolete and overly expensiive operations Mr Angus 53 is a former Mayor of Moorestown where he served for six years and a member of the Town Council on which be served for 10 years He is running on a platform to abolish the income tax eliminate the thorough and efficient Education Act that mandates a formula for state financing of education He is opposed to strikes by public employees and would fire anyone who defied the law Mr Angus is also opposed to compulsory arbitration to settle public employee disputes since this is taxation without representation A business consultant he said he would apply conservative policies to the running of state government to eliminate waste and inefficiency He promises to combat the excessive retirement programs for those working in the public sector that are being sought at all levels of government He said They threaten to bankrupt our great system Weve already seen some of the results in New York City where public workers and the taxpayers have suffered
Letter: On Life‐and‐Death Decisions,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/01/archives/letter-on-lifeanddeath-decisions.html,To the Editor Nine members of the Kennedy Institute for the Study of Human Reproduction and Bioethics commented on May 18 on your May 2 editorial Who Shall Make the Ultimate Decision Their assertion that it is important to establish precise criteria to guide the judgment of reasonable people cannot be faulted I believe comment is called for however on your argument that vital decisions respecting life and death belong to the patient or when he is incompetent to make them to those who are presumed to have his best interests at heart The members of the Kennedy Institute concur It is a basic assumption of our society that individual members possess no right to determine matters of life and death respecting other individuals or even themselves That right belongs only to the state The prohibition of murder suicide and until recently abortion has rested on this assumption The right to determine whether lifepreserving efforts are to be continued or discontinued therefore belongs neither to the physician nor to the patient or his guardian but to the state In practical terms when such a decision is called for the decision is to be made only by some agency or agent of the state and it is to be made only by due process To cede the right to the individuals involved is to license murder Aside from the philosophic argument which not everyone will find cogent there are two practical reasons for requiring due process in such instances In discussion of matters of continuing or withholding lifesupport systems and euthanasia tile arguments usually offered relate to the best interests of the patient or to the economic cost to society Abortion too is discussed in these terms A far more important consideration it seems to me is what making lifeanddeath decisions does to the individuals who decide While most of us will doubt that having made a decision to terminate life support to a suffering relative will then incline one to commit murder still making such a decision does condition the unconditional respect for life and does weaken the concept of the distinction between what Is permitted and what is forbidden One can see a tendency to pass from withdrawing life support from the moribund to facilitating the death of the suffering and from there to the neglect or even abandonment of the profoundly defective and from there to the degradation or liquidation of any whom society might consider undesirable The undisciplined making of lifeanddeath decisions tends to corrupt the individual who makes them and corrupted individuals tend to corrupt society Second it is not necessarily true that the individual himself has his own interests at heart Afflicted with a painful and longdrawnout illness many individuals will wish for death even when objectively there is a reasonable possibility of recovery Permitting the patient to make the decision to die may amount to encouraging his suicide Anyone familiar with the ambivalence which prevails in family relationships will not take it for granted that family members will necessarily represent the patients best interests It is important for the morale and morality of our society that the ultimate decision be made only by a disinterested agent or agency of our society and only by due process MORTIMER OSTOW MD Bronx May 25 1977 The writer is Edward T Sandrow Visiting Professor of Psychiatry at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America Letters Our Tainted Refuse Collectors To the Editor Once again it has been demonstrated that the refuse collection function in New York City is in desperate need of restructuring At present collection from residences and collection from commercial establishments are completely separate activities carried out by separate organizations Commercial collection is carried out only by private firms some of which have engaged in collusive practices to restrict competition in Brooklyn and one of which was recently charged with using force to drive a legitimate competitor out of business in the Bronx On the other hand residential collection is the exclusive province of the Sanitation Department which has also engaged in illegal behaviorstrikes in violation of state lawto exploit its monopoly position and in effect to extort money from the public The remedy for this dismal state of affairs is more real competition something that neither the Sanitation Department nor some of the private firms want 1 The Department of Consumer Affairs should issue licenses to more firms including the publicly owned national firms that are listed on the stock exchanges and regulated by the SEC and also including local indigenous companies that might be started by the BedfordStuyvesant Restoration Corporation or by other local economic development organizations Collusion is difficult when there are many different firms with different origins in the industry 2 In some of the existing Sanitation Districts in the city qualified private firms should be awarded contracts of limited duration by competitive bidding to collect residential refuse The city would pay the contractor and monitor his performance to assure compliance with service specifications Oklahoma City and New Orleans have started experiments along these lines while Minneapolis Montreal and Boston have been doing it for years 3 In the rest of the city the Sanitation Department should continue to collect residential refuse and it should also sell its refusecollection service at full cost to commercial establishments anywhere in the city that wish to purchase that service 4 The Comptroller should systematically measure compare and report the relative cost and quality of service provided by the contractors and by the Sanitation Department 5 Depending on whether a contractor or the department were doing the better job one or the other would be awarded a larger area to service In this way the taxpayers of New Yorkresidents and businesses alike would benefit by increased competition and would be less likely to be victimized by public or private lawbreakers Prof E S SAVAS Public Systems Management Columbia University New York May 23 1977 Redlining Toward a National Solution To the Editor In your May 20 editorial on redlining of local neighborhoods by New York City banks you hit the local problem but overlook the conspicuous national solution that awaits action soon New York banks redlining is not the exception Its the rule with rare exceptions as you point out like Philadelphia President Carter and the Congress will have a chance to act on this within the next couple of weeks Heres how The Senate Banking Committee has reported to the floor an omnibus housing bill containing a provision requiring bank regulatory agencies to take a financial institutions record of reinvestment in its local community into account in approving applications to branch This provision is being hotly opposed by powerful financial institutions lobbies and will have to fight for survival on the Senate floor President Carter is expected within days to send to the Senate his nominations for the Office of Comptroller of the Currency This official will have the prime jurisdiction in regulating the nations national banks The attitude toward stopping redlining by the Presidents new appointee will be critical to our cities The President will also send shortly his nominee for head of the Home Loan Bank Board This agency is the regulator of the nations savings and loan institutionsthe principal source of housing funds in our nation If the Presidents nominee vigorously supports reinvestment by institutions in the communities whence come their deposits it will make a serious difference Rebuilding our cities cannot and should not be done primarily by the Federal Government It doesnt have the knowhow the presence or the resources of the private financial institutions The decision by President Carter and the Congress to bring the privatesector resources to bear for our cities is crucial The decisions in the next few weeks will determine for years to come the prospects for Americas cities Senator WILLIAM PROXMIRE Chairman Committee on Banking Housing and Urban Affairs Washington May 20 1977 Of Pornography and the New Pathology of Sex Without Affection To the Editor Porn Is Here to Stay by Amitai Etzioni [OpEd May 17] reflects the professors own bias and some male chauvinism as well Obviously he doesnt believe that the sexual hard hats have any of the truth when in fact 67 percent of Americans in a 1976 Yankelovich poll agreed that the government should crack down more on pornography in movies books and nightclubs When Etzioni trots out that contemporary chestnut about these people not having come to terms with their sexuality these people might counter that defenders of pornography have not come to terms with their spiritual nature in fact have managed now to suppress it entirely Familial and platonic aspects of our nature are also losing out to the obsession with the sensual relationship I suggest that the new pathology of sex without affection or commitment is far worse than the old repressive condition And indeed women are more sex objects than everthe very thing the womens movement once so adamantly opposed If anything too many women have adopted a macho attitude about sex and called it liberation Even The Times which still states that it prints all the news fit to print is printing retail ads that picture women as superprovocative and right out of Playboy Mothers Day ads pictured mothers as some sort of sexual sirennot a nurturing kind of at all And now children are the prime sex object in pornography This is a new and fearful low and Professor Etzioni overlooks this latest trend This letter is long on substance but short on form but I do hope that women especially will give it some thought BETTE DEWING New York May 17 1977  To the Editor Professor Etzionis OpEd article seems oddly superficial Consider his notion that were pornography accessible to all who want it Xrated theaters would be sprinkled across the community the way newsstands are rather than bunched together in Times Square This is simply not true If you specialize in rubber masks of Richard Nixon handpainted neckties or beanies with propellers on top you set up shop in Times Square for obvious reasons And so do pornographers Unfortunately the Xrated bookstore attracts the sort of customer who attracts prostitutes each of whom comes with pimp in tow who in turn brings along his frowsy friends People in wealthier communities such as mine protect these communities through all sorts of zoning restrictions Its absurd to insist that the urban poor cant constitutionally have even minimal regulations in their neighborhoods Professor Etzioni also argues that pornography does not incite people to rash behavior This is perfectly obvious As he notes pornography seems to provide a relief rather than a stimulant The real question is whether pornography be it a matter of sex violence or racist tracts has an adverse effect on a neighborhood in particular or a society in general and if it does whether society can do anything about it At the moment sex films involving children are an issue Everyone agrees that laws already on the books will serve to prosecute those who make such films assuming they are caught but suppose the film makers and the participants live in Tibet Can the resulting films be shown in midtown Manhattan so long as nobody is forced to view them and the ads outside the theater are inoffensive If some people enjoy such pictures should I interfere with their fun and if so why It seems to me that a distinction should be made between words and photographs for the latter exploit actual living human beings And these pictures treat the women as the violent films handle their victims for no feelings are involved Kicking somebody in the teeth or tearing clothes off the willing ladyeither way its just for kicks Does constant exposure to this have a brutalizing effect on society This would seem to be a much more important question than whether anyone comes out of an Xrated theater eager for rape A sociology professor might address himself to these deeper questions A A HORMEL Weston Conn May 18 1977  To the Editor Professor Etzionis essay is disingenuous in its suggestion that if pornography were available throughout the five boroughs it would no longer he concentrated in Times Square The professor surely knows that the citizens of other sections of this city will never permit the open merchandising of pornography in their communities It is and will continue to be a midtown problem ivorytower theories notwithstanding The professor finds the midtown business community shockingly reactionary in its attempts to dislodge the porn merchants and would have us believe that pornography does no real harm to the community that only hysterical and repressed puritans unable to accept their own sexuality are complaining I wonder how far the professor would get expounding this view to the thousands of men and women who live in the ChelseaClinton neighborhood They are offended every day of their lives by the squalid and malevolent atmosphere created by the sex industry As for the Broadway theater community hell get nowhere with us We will continue to struggle against the encroachments of the sex industry on our profession and our community for as long as it takes ALEXANDER H COHEN New York May 18 1977 The Triumph To the Editor George Willigs scaling of a World Trade Center tower expresses more purely than these words possibly can an emotion seated in the core of humanity His heroic climb is the triumph of man over a mass of manmade technologies The unselfish individual is finally able to command three full hours of media time without committing a murder hijacking or any other selfish and destructive crime No oversized overpriced metal sculpture could dwarf these giant towers as did the silhouetted body of Mr Willig exhibiting its gymnastic and balletlike grace He has satisfied a definite need if only to shift the gaze of thousands of New Yorkers from the sidewalks toward the skies I would like to thank Mr Willig for fulfilling a human dream ALAN GUTTMAN New York May 26 1977  To the Editor Twas Willig and the slithy tower Did gyre and gimble in the wind All mimsy were the bureaucrats But the Toymaker outgrabe JOHN P McNETT New York May 27 1977 Kissinger and Columbia To the Editor Appointing a medieval alchemist to an endowed chair in chemistry would make about as much sense as appointing

A Ban on Abortions Paid for by Medicaid Criticized as Unfair,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/02/archives/long-island-opinion-a-ban-on-abortions-paid-for-by-medicaid.html,WASHINGTON June 1The Carter Administration and Congress were denounced today at a meeting of organizetions and individuals opposed to a Congressional ban on the use of Medicaid funds for abortions Secretary Califano stated on television that he never met a woman who had an abortion said Gloria Steinem the feminist writer of Joseph A Califano Jr who heads the Department of Health Education and Welfare He must know very few women added Miss Steinem who represented the National Womens Political Caucus Her reference was to remarks Mr Califano made at his confirmation hearings in which he specifically opposed the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions Miss Steinem also recalled During the campaign the President once said that he personally would not have an abortion and she commented That was my fairorite statement The ban on using Medicaid funds for abortions was sponsored by Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois and was enacted into law last year The law was never implemented however because of a Federal injunction resulting from a legal challenge initiated in Federal Court for the Eastern District of New York Brooklyn and Long Island The case is still pending This year the ban was incorporated in an appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor and HEW that was approved last week by the Rouse Appropriations Committee It is scheduled for floor action June 15 and then will go to the Senate Speakers at todays meeting condemned the ban on abortions paid for by Medicaid as discriminatory against poor women Middleclass and wealthy women could continue to have abortions the speakers said A total of 1115000 legal abortions were performed in 1976 according to Dr Louis Hellman former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Health Education and Welfare for population affairs and the agencys health services administrator The real consumer of abortion services bas become the forgotten woman Dr Hellman said The nonconsumers decide the pros and cons of what is best for her not only for the moment but for her entire life and that of her family
U.S. Offers to Alter Deployment of Its New Warhead,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/02/archives/us-offers-to-alter-deployment-of-its-new-warhead.html,WASHINGTON June 1The White House spokesman Jody Powell said today that if the Soviet Union was willing to undertake serious negotiations on limitation of strategic nuclear weapons the United States can make changes in plans to deploy a more accurate intercontinental missile warhead capable of destroying more Soviet missiles in their launching silos At a daily news briefing Mr Powell declined to call the new nuclear warhead designated 12A and its refined guidance system as a bargaining chip in strategic arms talks with the Soviet Union He also declined to say that the decision to deploy the guidance system this fall and the warheads by 1979 had been triggered by Russian rejection in March of Mr Carters comprehensive proposal for substantial arms reductions However he said that the comprehensive proposal would have specifically prohibited this and many other sorts of qualitative improvements in intercontinental missiles He added that the President believed that qualitative improvements in strategic weapons was as serious or more serious an issue than mere numbers of weapons possessed by each side Mr Powell said however that we do not feel it is reasonable to expect the United States on its own to forgo deployment of something like the 12A warhead without equivalent and verifiable steps by the Soviet Union The Russians have extralarge missiles that can destroy launch silos with the highexplosive yield of their warheads rather than the pinpoint accuracy attributed to the 12A This was only one of several comments made on a wide range of subjects in what seemed an unusually loquacious day for the White House There were these developments President Carter urged passage of legislation to create a consumer protection agency asserting that the bill is in trouble because lobbyists have come out of the woodwork to oppose it and the Congress is under intense pressure Mr Powell said the Presidents reaction to criticism that his national energy policy proposals were not strong enough was his comment today that it would suit him fine if Congress wished to strengthen the proposals and we would certainly be willing to give them great latitude in doing so The President signed an eightyearold agreement aimed at protecting human rights in the Western Hemisphere The President appeared briefly today at a conference arranged by the White House of consumer advocates and some business representatives to express support for the bill to create the consumer protection agency which passed a House committee by one vote Mr Carter said that when Republican Presidents promised to veto such a bill Congress was more inclined to give it support He added Now when it is sure that the White House will approve this legislation the lobbyists have come out of the woodwork and the Congress is under intense pressure He called opposition to the bill illadvised asserting that it would permit the elimination of some 13 other Government offices employing 180 people saving 104 million a year He minimized both the size and the cost of the proposed new agency calling it tiny and an agency meant to be the focal point of fairness for voiceless consumers Later Mr Carter went to the headquarters of the Organization of American States to sign the InterAmerican Convention on Human Rights which was adopted by the OAS in Costa Rica in 1969 but which has been signed by only 12 Latin American states and ratified by only two The convention outlines basic human rights and creates a hermispheric commission on rights and an international court to hear complaintsbut only after legal processes have been exhausted within the country that is accused Referring to the United States delay in signing Mr Carter said this blank space on the page has been here for a long time and expressed his pleasure in signing Mr Carter did not mention a potential problem posed by the treatys Article IV which says that the right to life shall be protected by law and in general from the moment of conception The United States Supreme Court has made abortion legal in the early weeks of pregnancy Mr Carter has expressed personal opposition to abortion but is expected to ask the Senate to reserve American approval or that portion of the treaty

ANTI‐ABORTION MOVE IS BACKED IN ALBANY,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/02/archives/antiabortion-m0ve-is-backed-in-albany-senate-resolution-asks.html,ALBANY June 1After a long and bitter debate that resurrected nearly every argument of the last decade for and against abortion the State Senate went on record tonight in favor of an antiabortion amendment to the United States Constitution The vote was 35 in favor and 22 against a resolution asking Congress to call a constitutional convention for the purpose of adopting the antiabortion amendment Although there is virtually no chance that the resolution will get through the Assembly here its passage in the Senate is at least a technical victory for the national righttolife movement which has so far succeeded in getting the convention call through eight state legislatures including New Jersey If 34 state legislatures pass the resolution the constitutional convention will automatically take place A NeverUsed Approach The convention method of amending the Constitution has never been usedall of the existing constitutional amendments have originated in Congress and have then been ratified by threequarters of the state legislaturesand opponents of the antiabortion resolution warned today that such a convention could theoretically decide to undo much of the Constitution But as both opponents and supporters of the resolution conceded todays debate was essentially about abortion The fact that the debate was almost purely symbolicit is now four years since the United States Supreme Court legalized abortion and there is nothing that Albany can do about itdid little to diminish the fervor of the debaters The resolutions sponsor Senator Owen H Johnson Republican of West Babylon LI began the debate by declaring that since the infamous Supreme Court decision a plague of unborn infant deaths has swept our land The purpose of the resolution he said is to stop this manmade plague The opponents led by Senator Karen S Burstein Democrat of Woodmere LI said the only result of such a constitutional amendment would be a resumption of the desperate frantic search for a backroom abortion Former Foster Child Heard In one particularly emotional exchange Senator Richard E Schermerhorn Republican of CornwallonHudson said he opposed abortion in all circumstances He was sent to a foster home at the age of 3 months he said and might never have been born had abortion been legal Maybe I was unwanted by someone but I was wanted by someone else the Senator said Senator Burstein asked him what he would do about a pregnant 10yearold girl who had been raped by her father Im sorry that those things happen he replied But theres only one place where thats prevented and youve got to go up there He pointed toward the heavens Senator H Carl McCall Democrat of Manhattan recalled that last month the Senate had voted to cut welfare benefits to mothers with small children Id like to see the same compassion and commitment expressed here for babies that are born as for the unborn he said What about the children killed by our callousness and neglect Lets begin to look at our responsibilities to the people who are here The abortion debate has come up in some fashion nearly every year since the Legislature legalized abortion in 1970 Last year both houses passed a bill to require parental consent for teenaged girls seeking abortions Governor Carey vetoed that bill A number of supporters of the resolution today vowed that the abortion issue would never go away and on that assertion they got no debate Other activity here today included the following BOND ISSUE REFUNDING The Assembly passed unanimously and sent to the Senate a bill that would permit a number of municipalities and school districts to refinance at lower interest rates bonds that they had issued during the last seven years Taxing jurisdictions in Suffolk County alone have indicated a desire to raise 150 million at the comparatively low interest charges now prevailing in the bond market This would enable them to call in outstanding issues on which they are obliged to pay higher interest LICENSING BOARDS The Senate gave final passage to a bill requiring the State Board of Regents to appoint an additional consumeroriented member to each of the state licensing boards that regulate the professions TUITION AWARDS A bill to increase the maximum scholarship under the states Tuition Assistance Program from 1500 to 1800 a year passed the Senate
Mrs. Mondale is Traditional,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/05/archives/mrs-mondale-is-traditional-mrs-carters-model-is-very-much-her-own.html,It has been dear from the beginning that Rosaiynn Carter wanted to go not just to Jamaica and the six LatinAmen can countries she visited last week but anywhere that her concept of the First Ladys role led her It has been equally clear that no one except possibly her husband the President could make her do anything First man My wifes in the West Indies Second man Jamaica First man No she wanted to go A vaudeville joke The rumblings and murmuring surrounding her 12dap trip have highlighted the problems facing a Presidents wife who defines her role as an activist one and Mrs Carter seems more determinedly activist than any First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt who is said to be her heroine and model In a quite different and more unexpected fashion Joan Mondale has emerged from the nearanonymity that shrouds most Vice Presidents wives Unlike Mrs Carter she has her own special area of interest the arts to which she confines her activities When Mrs Carters LatinAmerican trip was announced its substantive nature was emphasized implying that this was to be no mere ceremonial goodwill tour Mrs Carter had prepared for it with typical hardworking earnestness taking Spanish lessons three times weekly and undergoing long briefings by State Department experts But quite quickly the questions arose about the appropriateness of a Presidents wifeneither an elected official nor a professional diplomatengaging in important discussions with foreign leaders Also signals of distress reportedly emanated from Latin America land of sunshine and machismo at a woman being sent as a serious negotiator although these were somewhat mild Despite lastminute efforts by the White House to quietly shift the emphasis of her trip from the substantive to the ceremonial the questions remained and quite obviously they rankled Mrs Carter In Kingston Jamaica when a reporter asked about the nature of her authority to speak for the President Mrs Carter replied firmly I think that I am the person closest to the President of the United States and if I can help him to understand the countries of the world thats what I want to do Her husband has called Mrs Carter his political partner a definition that might have been applied to Mrs Roosevelt and to a degree to Lady Bird Johnson but to few other Presidents wives Mrs Roosevelt in part because of her husbands physical disabilities served as his eyes and ears traveling 38000 miles during his first year in office Mrs Roosevelt ultimately evolved a separate identity a way that Mrs Carter has indicated she has no wish to do Mrs Carter appears content to see herself as an extension of her husband without feeling submerged To that extent she is in the tradition of many other First Ladies Neither Bess Truman nor Mamie Eisenhower involved themselves in their husbands political lives Jacqueline Kennedy often reluctant to fulfill the unceasing round of ceremonial appearances made the role of First Lady newly glamorous Lady Bird Johnson was known to exert a degree of general political influence on her volatile husband but she chose to concentrate her energies on conservation and beautification She travelled widely hiking through national parks and getting down on her hands and knees to plant flowers Pat Nixon also travelled flying to Peru in 1970 after a devastating earthquake attending inaugurations in Africa and South America as the Presidents representative and visiting volunteer groups in this country Betty Ford during her relatively brief tenure became best known for outspokenness often on controversial matters She campaigned and lobbied for the Equal Rights Amendment for abortion and for mental health In a way her unique contribution the one she apparently considered most important was her cheerful frankness about breast cancer All you need she once said addressing the fears of many women is a little foam rubber Mrs Carter during the election campaign indicated that apart from whatever her husband felt was important she was interested in helping the aging and the mentally ill She has already hosted a White House roundtable with representatives of 20 national senior citizens groups flown to Chicago and Philadelphia for hearings on mental health and made it clear that although she is only the honorary chairman of the presidents mental health commission she feels she can exercise authority Mrs Carter has also demonstrated her interest in the arts displaying American crafts at a White House luncheon and attending afternoon concerts at the Kennedy Center but Mrs Mondale has become in effect the White House advocate for the arts She has hung contethporary art much of it unlikely to appeal to a broad audience in the Vice Presidential residence and has garnered a good deal favorable publicity both for herself and her cause A dedicated potter with a lifelong and serious interest in artshe trained as an art historian and has written a book on the subject Mrs Mondale has lobbied for support for the arts and artists Last week for example she held a working luncheon to consider the problems of artists and taxes bringing together Treasury officials and representatives of the arts community Few Vice Presidents wives have had any public identity except as just that wives and in matters other than art Mrs Mondale has adhered to the traditional role leaving politics to her husband Mrs Carter with far more public interest focused on her has made it clear that she believes she does have real power and wants to use it When she was asked if she could exert this power as honorary chairman of the mental health commission she said I think that if I want to I canand I intend to
NONFICTION IN BRIEF,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/05/archives/nonfiction-in-brief-vested-interest-by-charles-b-lipsen-with.html,It was during my first attempt at book reviewing many years ago that the image of an aged seer materialized before me I knew he was wise because he had a long white beard a lantern and a nineroom rent controlled apartment Son he said in a quavering voice never review the book you would have written After looking through this collection I sought out the seer cleverly bidding him appear by fantasizing a particularly cushy writers conference Oh wise one I demanded what do you do about a book the author told us he was writing but somehow never got around to doing What about a book that takes an important topic and mangles it beyond recognition Never mind said the seer Do we get to that writers conference coach or firstclass VESTED INTEREST By Charles B Lipsen with Stephan Lesher 184 pp New York Doubleday  Co 695 The jacket of this book promises us a lobbyists account of Washington power and how it really works It is nothing of the sort primarily because Lipsens lobbying career has not taken him close to the epicenters of power Working to influence legislation on behalf of retail clerks cable television and the National Paint Varnish and Lacquer Association can have its rewards but cheekbyjowl intimacy with power doesnt seem to be one of them Vested Interest is really about one mans career as a Washington fixture Lipsen went to Washington in 1950 in response to a halfhearted invitation from Senator Kefauver and stayed on He went from the payroll of the Senate to interest groups to political campaigns and back again He has some funny stories to tell and within the modest borders of the books possibilities provides some insights into how legislation gets passed changed or beaten He also tells two of the most overpublicized tales ever to come out of Washington Senator Church and LBJ on Americas Vietnam policywherein Johnson tells Church to get his next dam built by Walter Lippmann and LBJ versus Senator Dirksen on car telephones But while Lipsen with Newsweek reporter Stephan Lesher has written a book with an appealing tone of authenticity Vested Interest just isnt very interesting A SEXUAL PROFILE OF MEN IN POWER By Sam Janus Barbara Bess MD and Carol Saltus 190 pp Englewood Cliffs NJ PrenticeHall 995 The private life of a public man is now about as private as a lovebite on the Johnny Carson show Following Watergate and Elizabeth Ray the protection once accorded powerful public figures is gone Further there is at least a suspicion that the character of someones private life may affect public actions a Senator who demands the infliction of pain as a source of sexual satisfaction may carry his needs into a debate on the use of force as a method of settling public disputes This is a serious question The answer attempted by this book is not What Doctors Janus and Bess have done is to interview prostitutes about the sexual demands of politically powerful clients The report is eyeopening no doubt about it Kinky sex particularly requests for beatings bondage and other assorted humiliations seem to rank high on the clients lists From this fact the authors have put together their sexual profile and conclude that politicians hyperactive sex lives are linked to their hyperactive drives Are politicians different from other power seekers financiers academics doctors Can a  profile be drawn by interviewing prostitutes whose occupation suggests some selectivity on the part of the clientele Arent there some important distinctions between politicians who enjoy active sex lives and those who must be tied up or whipped in order to enjoy themselves I happen to think that the private lives of public figures should not be shielded from public view if for no other reason than the enormous hypocrisy that the process involves But this book so filled with generalizations so trapped between being a serious study and a National Star expos is a poor beginning in the attempt to demonstrate the link between the rostrum and the bedroom POTOMAC FEVER By Fred R Harrts 214 pp New York W W Norton  Co 895 Fred Harris was one of the most appealing candidates for President weve had in the postwar age He had come to the Senate in 1964 at the age of 33 as a protg of the late Senator Robert Kerr one of the richest men ever_io sit in the Congress By 1972 Harris had recast himself as a Populist and in his 1976 Presidential campaign made the redistribution of wealth and income his principal campaign issue He also dispensed completely with bigtime campaign trappingstraveling by camper sleeping in private homes He made Jimmy Carter look like John Connally I picked up this book wanting to learn how Fred Harris had come this far whether his work on the 1968 Kerner Commission had helped him politically whether Potomac fever and the thirst for perpetual power keeps powerful politicians from speaking what they know to be true about concentrated power Its not here Instead there are affectionate anecdotes about Hubert Humphrey Lyndon Johnson and Robert Kennedy his lengthy tale of winning a Senate seat his memories of the 1968 Democratic Convention At times Harris is inexplicably indifferent to the book He tells us that a visit to black ghetto youths in Cincinnati was a searing experience but never tells us what happened there GROW OR DIE By James A Weber 255 pp New Rochelle NY Arlington House 1195 This is the most exasperating book of the lot because it deals with such an important subject Fears of a population explosion at least in America have now turned into concern about the consequences of the rapid decline in population growth What will happen when the war babies reach retirement age and start to live on taxpayerfinanced pensions and benefits How will a smaller and smaller work force pay for these benefits Important questions Yes But James Weber wants to include every reason why population growth is good for the world It is good for ecology good for national defense good for world health at times you wait for Weber to explain how a burgeoning population will make your teeth whiter than ever before There is also room for the expected conservative hobbyhorses that the Arlington House colophon suggests Abortion is an unqualified evil and Russia is outstripping American defense capabilities The concept that a rapidly growing population is a patriotic imperative suggests a dazzling new poster contest Webers most effective accomplishment is the compilation of statistics and opinion to counteract the population bomb fears that are so prevalent But the book overreaches and diffuses its message so that Grow or Die fails to achieve the important goal of getting us to think about the consequences of a diminishing population

Italy's Durable Andreotti,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/08/archives/italys-durable-andreotti.html,ROME June 7  In this city of heroic monuments and feeble governments Giulio Andreotti stands out as the most durable politician in Europe with the lone exception of Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia For over 30 years he has survived in the service of his countrysix times as Under Secretary to the President of the Council of Ministers 14 times as Minister of Internal Affairs Finance Treasury Defense or Industry and now for the third time as Prime Minister at the age of 58 He looks and talks in his dim office in the Palazzo Chigi like a professor of philosophy and to hear him tell it in a private talk the outlook for the future is no worse than the past and maybe a little better He made the following points The development of Europe over these last 30 years has been disappointing in some ways but remarkable in others At the beginning a united Europe was just a dream of Alcide de Gasperi Everyone thought it would be difficult to bring Britain into the Common Market but now Britain is in and progress obviously has been made Even in Italy though over a million young people are unemployed and inflation is running at 20 percent the standard of living today would have been unthinkable 30 years ago Some of Italys problems are the result of its success in spreading education without providing enough work for the new college graduates It would be inaccurate to say that the rising generation in Italy all shares the dream of a united Europe but there is a great awareness that the European Economic Community has been instrumental in avoiding a third world war for 30 years There is political unrest and uneasiness in Italy today even a revolutionary spirit It comes from two factors first great wealth in one section of Italian society and great poverty in another which we are trying to correct through tax reform and second a vast migration of people from the land into the cities But he insisted for the moment there are no threats of a popularfront government including the Communists Still there were he said great difficulties particularly because of what had happened in the field of international economics The oil crisis greatly slowed down the work on economic and monetary union It was originally scheduled for 1980 and is now much further off in the future The theme incidentally at Communist Party headquarters is not all that different from Prime Minister Andreottis observations Sergio Segre head of the foreign section of the party sounds infinitely patient and even cooperative He does not see the Soviet Union as an imperialist power His party is concentrating he says on building a consensus for order and a better standard of living in Italy It sees no conflict between dtente with the Soviet Union and President Carters campaign for human rights He does not agree that Italy is in a revolutionary mood or even that it is in a prerevolution phase Mr Andreotti had some amiable observations about President Carter at the summit meeting in London What impressed me he said was Carters sense of perspective    This comes out in the way he approaches problems I believe it reflects a great moral conviction He doesnt get bogged down in procedures We were very favorably impressed On the larger question of Italys present attitude toward the United States the Prime Minister said that the antiAmerican campaign of a few years ago provoked by Communist propaganda had declined The Prime Minister acknowledged that there seemed to be a rise of terrorism in the country and that he didnt quite know the whole cause of it Partly it was the result of the crowded cities partly the result of using permissive antiFascist legislation to weaken the authority of the state and partly due to a general moral decline in Western societies Perhaps he said Italy had emphasized economic development too much and ignored moral and cultural development but he believed the influence of the family and to a lesser degree of the Roman Catholic Church was still strong For example he said after a more liberal divorce law was passed in Italy there was a remarkably small number of requests for them Shortly after he spoke the Italian Senate defeated a bill to legalize abortion after a strong antiabortion campaign by the Church Asked about the rise of socalled Eurocommunism Andreotti said the West must not write off the possibility of independent national Communist parties and he implied that it would be wrong to criticize such a development too casually Naturally he said it seemed to us a bit strange that you should take such a rigid attitude toward this problem while you were cultivating good relations with Peking and Moscow In general however looking at the perspective of his 30 years in Italian politics Mr Andreotti took a cautiously optimistic view of the last quarter of the century Having survived so much over so long a time he was not prepared to believe he said in the collapse of Western democracy
Abortion Bill in Italy Is Defeated By a Two‐Vote Margin in Senate,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/08/archives/abortion-bill-in-italy-is-defeated-by-a-twovote-margin-in-senate.html,ROME June 7In a surprise decision the Italian Senate today defeated an abortion bill generally regarded as one of the most liberal in Western Europe The legislation previously approved by the Chamber of Deputies was strongly opposed by the Vatican Pope Paul VI repeatedly noted that the church viewed abortion as the killing of an unborn child The governing Christian Democrats closely linked to the Roman Catholio Church managed to overcome an intense and vigorous campaign and kill the bill by a twovote margin in the 315member Senate The governing party and the church had been expected to lose the parliamentary struggle over the issue The decision came on a technicality at the outset of the debate on the bill The Christian Democrats who hold 135 seats in the Senate won support in their opposition from members of the neoFascist party of nonCatholic parties and others Referendum Now Sought Those favoring the bill led by the tiny Radical Party and various womens groups promptly said they would continue their struggle by trying to attract 500000 signatures for a referendum next year The national vote would be designed to abrogate existing law against abortion As approved in January by the Chamber of Deputies the bill in effect would have allowed abortion on demand It would have replaced present law which dates from the Fascist era and which holds that abortion is a crime against the race For years the abortion issue has stirred Italy and its complex political life The debate became so bitter last year that it led to the fall of the Government and forced national elections last June It is not yet possible to measure the political fallout from todays decision Some politicians said that undoubtedly it would complicate the delicate negotiations now under way here between the Christian Democrats and the Communists and other parties on developing a joint program on a variety of pressing issues A Communist Party official said the vote clearly marked  a shift in the evolution of the present political situation and presented the risk of a clash among the political forces The Christian Democrats though worried about the repercussions were clearly satisfied with the bills defeat Victory for the Vatican For the Vatican the vote represented a victory after a series of defeats in Italian politics Its influence has appeared to decline particularly since Italians voted by a 3 to 2 margin three years ago to keep a controversial law permitting divorce in this Roman Catholic nation Vatican warnings of incompatibility between Marxism and Christianity have not succeeded in stunting the growth of the Communist Party Italys second largest party The Vatican has also been persuaded to make some major concessions in the present negotiations over revising the concordat that has governed churchstate relations since 1929 Under the legislation defeated today women over 16 could decide on their own with or without authorization from a doctor to terminate pregnancies during the first 90 days They would have to go to a doctor and request the abortion first and he could authorize it immediately If the doctor had doubts he would give the woman a document dated the day of her visit and suggest that she think it over for seven days After that she could take the document to a hospital or special clinic and obtain the abortion with a claim that her social economic or psychological state would be jeopardized without it

BILL WOULD RESTRICT ABORTIONS ON YOUNG,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/10/archives/bill-would-restrict-abortions-on-young-measure-by-carey-panel.html,ALBANY June 9A special panel set up by Governor Carey today recommended a number of procedural restrictions on abortions on teenagers that it said would reconcile the right of a young woman to get a legal abortion with the right of a parent to care for his child The panel headed by Dean Joseph M McLaughlin of Fordham Law School stopped short of giving parents a veto power over abortions for their teenaged daughters Governor Carey vetoed such a bill last spring and set up the eightmember panel to find a workable legislative solution that would make it possible for parents to know when their children face a situation of personal anguish and crisis The Governor did not endorse todays recommendations howeverprobably in recognition of the controversy they would engender at this point in the legislative session He said he would circulate the bill that the panel had drafted among interested parties and a spokesman said that there would be no bill introduced on the subject this year The panel cited Federal statistics indicating that each year one million girls between the ages of 15 and 19or 10 percent of the entireage groupbecome pregnant with twothirds of the pregnancies conceived out of wedlock Signed Statement Required In 1974 there were 177196 reported legal abortions in the age group Half of the 64000 New York teenagers who became pregnant in 1974 had abortions The panels bill would require that a doctor who performs an abortion on a girl under age 18 first receive a signed statement of informed consent either from the girl herself or if the doctor decides that the girl is not sufficiently mature or intelligent to give consent from a parent or guardian But if there is good reason not to seek the parents consent or if they refuse their consent then the doctor can get the order at a confidential proceeding before a State SupremeCourt judge Under the panels bill the consent statement must assert that the girl has been advised of possible adverse consequences of the operation and has received counseling about alternatives to abortion In addition to Dean McLaughlin the members of the panel were Dr Louise M Dantuono a gynecologist at Bellevue Hospital Dr Ian Morrison president of Greer Childrens Services Archibald R Murray executive direector of the Legal Aid Society Joyce Austin a former mayoral assistant Oscar Gonzalez Suarez a New York City lawyer Jacob Trobe executive director of the Jewish Child Care Association and Mildred Shanley an officer of Catholic Charities who dissented from the mainreport

They Are Now in Serious Talks With Other Parties,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/12/archives/they-are-now-in-serious-talks-with-other-parties-italys-communists.html,ROME  Italian politics Byzantine to many fascinating to some and too complex for most are entering a new phase that could have significant effects for Italy and the rest of Europe The Communist Party the largest in Western Europe may emerge with a formal role in decisionmaking as the result of talks that are under way between it and the other parties The dealing especially between the governing Christian Democrats and the Communists might well be expected The elections last June again left the Christian Democrats and the Communists as the preeminent political forces in Italy and almost polarized the nation at the expense of the smaller parties So sometimes openly and sometimes quietly the two have been working together The Communists are notified in advance on all pending important decisions and they have their say on issues ranging from aid to the south to police reform They were constantly consulted for example on the recent economic package and under pressure from the trade unions restrained the Christian Democrats from going too far on controlling wages if it were not for the postelection decision of the Communists abstain on crucial votes in Parliament the minority government of Christian Democrats would have collapsed sometime ago This is unique in Europe The French Communists are aligned with the stronger Socialists and remain firmly in the opposition maneuvering in hopes of winning a popular front victory in the elections next year The Socialists are weak in Italy and the immediate goal of the Italian Communists unlike their French counterparts is to share power not take it from those who now govern I wouldnt say the Communists have a veto power over everything we do said one cabinet minister Lets just say if the Communists say no we think again In the view of many rank and file Communists their party has not been saying no often enough Even Communist Party leaders have acknowledged unease within their ranks among members who see no reason to keep in power a party the left has struggled against for 30 years Moreover some of the recent violence in Italy is attributed to extreme leftist groups They are attacking both the Christian Democrats and the Communists with equal vehemence accusing the governing party of failure and the Communists of sellout This raises the question of course of who is hurt most by this oftencozy arrangement The Christian Democrats are having their own internal troubles because many of their members feel the party may be moving too close to the Communists Still would appear that in many ways the Christian Democrats stand to gain the most from the present system They maintain their grasp on power in the cabinet control the banks and other important institutions and manage to stave off the Communist pressure for the historical compromise that is a sharing of ministerial seats More importantly the Christian Democrats know that the Communists do not want to take any blame for a political crisis one that would lead to new elections The Communist Partys strategy is to take its time build on its image as a responsible and moderate party and avoid antagonizing the middle class voters whose support has been so important in the past It is true we do not want a crisis said a leading Communist official What we want is to cooperate and help solve Italys problems There is no way to do this without us On the surface the present discussions would not appear to be very important given all the past consultations But to the Communists they represent step forward and a turning point one that moves them closer to government and allows them to take a formal role in decisionmaking if not in execution The Christian Democrats feel that they have no other choice but to agree to such a formality although noting that they remain firm on keeping the Communists out of the cabinet itself The desire for the agreement largely explains why the Communists took a relatively calm stand on the defeat last week of an abortion reform bill long sought by the left They feel that to make an issue of it at this time might well jeopardize the evolving accord The Communists need the agreement to demonstrate to the unhappy party workers that moderation pays In any event Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti obviously fairly optimistic about his chances of survival perhaps for another two years His Government has developed a limited austerity program designed to curb inflation now running at 20 percent but he as fallen far short of finding the definitive cure to e Anomie ills It has all been enough however to satisfy the loan requirements of the International Monetary Fun d if not the economists of Italy As for the Italians generally wages are still rising faster than prices though this too may have to cease one day The current party talks will also cease one day but the Italians generally will find little to cheer about They will remain worried about their econom y their social troubles their unemployment and th eir violence But they apparently wont have to w orry about going to the polls again at least for a while I The Christian Democrats have one great advanthe these days noted one of the rime Ministers advisers Everyone agrees that there is no alternative right now to Mr Andreotti
Italy Turns Down An Abortion Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/12/archives/italy-turns-down-an-abortion-bill.html,A liberal abortion law suffered a surprising and narrow defeat in the Italian Senate last week prolonging an intensely fought political issue that led to the fall of one government a year ago and jeopardizing the delicate political partnership between Christian Democrats and Communists The governing Christian Democrats with the crucial aid of the Vatican managed to defeat the abortion reform bill by two votes The partys satisfaction was moderated however by hints of retaliation from the Communist Party whose cooperation keeps the Christian Democrats in power The defeat said a Communist Party official raised the risk of a clash among the political forces The billwhich would have authorized abortion almost on demandhad been earlier passed by the Chamber of Deputies but last weeks action means that a sixmonth interval must elapse before a new measure can come before Parliament Those favoring reform asserting that nearly a million illegal abortions are performed yearly are likely to try to collect the 500000 signatures for a national referendum on the subject That was the route by which the issue of divorce reform alio opposed by the Christian Democrats and the Roman Catholic church eventually was settled in 1974 Two years ago the proabortion forces led by the small but influential Radical Party did get enough signatures to force a referendum Originally set for May last year it was postponed when national elections were called after the fall of Prime Minister Aldo Moros Government
Mr. Carter's Cruel Abortion Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/13/archives/mr-carters-cruel-abortion-plan.html,Faithful to the strong personal views of both the President and his Secretary of Health Education and Welfare about abortion the Administration is engaging in a curious and misguided legislative maneuver it has included language in an appropriation bill for the Departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare that would prohibit the use of any of that money for abortions The principal effect would be to ban Medicaid abortions for the Door The merits aside this legislative gambit is curious because similar language in last years appropriation was immediately challenged and suspended by a Federal District Court pending trial in issuing its injunction the court cast serious doubt on theconstitutionality of the prohibition on two grounds The first is that it probably violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by making an irrational distinction between groups of pregnant women Medicaid could pay for prenatal care and births but not for abortions The judges second problem was that he perceived an attempt to enact one view in the continuing debate about when life actually begins in apparent violation of the First Amendment The legislative history makes clear that the prohibition is based upon the Roman Catholic view that life begins at the moment of conception On the merits the Carter Administrations position is deplorable social policy The issue is not whether some language in an appropriation bill will prevent some abortions Many women will continue to have them no matter what Congress does The affluent will continue to buy them the poor will seek them at bargain rates So the real question is whether poor women will obtain safe abortions or whether they will be forced to choose between back alley butchers and the birth of children they do not want or cannot afford Pregnancy among youngsters has reached epidemic proportions There are more than a million teenage pregnancies a year and over twothirds of them are unintended Government should be seeking multiple ways to prevent unwanted births as well as ways to provide better for such children The Administration is following neithercourse Despite Mr Carters campaign pledges to expand familyplanning assistance his Administration has proposed no increased spending in that area At the same time the Department of Health Education and Welfare is said to be weighing welfarereform proposals that would make it more difficult for teenage mothers to receive assistance A brief visit to innercity neighborhoods and schools would quickly instruct Secretary Califano in the pain inflicted on unwanted children and the damage they often do To mandate their birth by discriminatory arbitrary and backdoor legislation is the height of irresponsibility

Vote for Dams ‘Kind of Easy’ For Freshman,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/15/archives/vote-for-dams-kind-of-easy-for-freshman.html,WASHINGTON June 14There was nothing hesitant today about Representative Robert A Youngs decision to abandon his President for a darn Its kind of easy the Missouri Democrat remarked shortly before join ing a bare House majority in thumbing its collective note at President Carters attempt to kill or curtail 16 water projects The vote of the firstterm member was instructive as a symptom of the strains that exist with little likelihood of abatement between Democrats in the White House and on Capitol Hill Mr Young opposed the President because he has a political stake in one of the threatened projects because he is not overly awed by the Presidents legislative lobbyists because he is no more enthusiastic personally about Mr Carter than he was when both were seeking Federal office at this time last year and most interestingly because things have changed for the Bob Youngs in Washington A Junior in the House Though seniority scarcely means much in a Congress liberated by internal reforms over the last halfdozen years Mr Young whose name places him at the bottom of an alphabetized pecking order for firstterm members is technically the most junior member of the House sort of last among equals Until recent years a member of such modest rank would have felt obliged to get along by going along Mr Young might have been instinctively suited for that too as something of a good soldier for the Democrats all his political life The 53yearold Congressman still serves as a precinct committeeman for the party He earned 1200 as a pipefitter last year and still carries his union card For four of his 20 years in the Missouri legislature he was the Senate floor leader for then Gov Warren E Hearnes and lost but one of 18 major legislative fights Besides the Meramec Park Dam for which Mr Young is fighting lies about 50 miles south of the St Louis suburbs that comprise his Second Congressional District and based on a survey Mr Young conducted last month the project has the support of a bare majority of his constituents Pledged Support for Dam But Mr Young a conservative who thought little of the environmentalists arguments against the project pledged in his campaign last year to seek completion of the darn which Congress authorized 39 years ago and which has cost 353million so far When a White House aide telephoned last Saturday to ask support for Mr Carter in his opposition to the Meramec dam and 15 other projects Mr Young said that he was sorry I couldnt agree with the President on this particular issue It would have been easier to go along the tall trim Representative said as he slouched on a bench outside the House chamber However in this era you cant just blindly follow the leader Mr Young contended He opposed Mr Carters position on auto emission standards and as a Roman Catholic opposed to abortion he helped amend a foreign aid measure to forbid the use of aid money for involuntary sterilizations Mr Young was among a batch of Senators and Representatives invited to the White House last week and was impressed with Mr Carters apparent openness and desire to cooperate I want the Administration to be successful because it helps the whole Democratic Party he said But I want to disagree with the President when I think hes wrong and I want the Administration to be respectful of and pay attention to members of Congress It is no longer gauche for freshmen in Congress to believe they know more than the White House
Plan to Eliminate Maternity Wards In 40 Hospitals Scored at Hearing,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/17/archives/plan-to-eliminate-maternity-wards-in-40-hospitals-scored-at-hearing.html,NEWBURGH NY June 16A disputed plan to eliminate maternity wards at 12 of the 40 hospitals in the seven county midHudson region including Westchester County drew the fire of residents physicians hospital officials and local politicians at an emotioncharged meeting here last night They said that the proposed plan being considered for submittal to State Health Commissioner Robert P Whalen would lower the quality of health care in their areas jeopardize the existence of hospitals deny prospective mothers freedom of choice in selecting medical institutions and cause hardship and risk to mothers and infants because of longer and more precarious traveling distances If adopted the plan would shut obstetrical units at four of 15 hospitals in Westchester and prevent the opening of an obstetrics unit at the new 61 million Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla The four Westchester units that would be closed are in Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville Phelps Memorial in North Tarrytown St Agnes in White Plains and United in Port Chester In addition maternity units would be closed at Julia L Butterfield in Putnam County Doctors Sunnyside and St Anthonythony in Orange County Highland and Northern Dutchess in Dutchess County and Ellenville Community and Kingston Hospital in Ulster County Maternity patients of all these hospitals would have to use the remaining hospitals in their area under the plan Failure to open the 28bed unit at the Westchester Medical Center critics charged would mean the loss of a valuable medical service at an institution being planned for tertiary or specialized care in the region a number of critics said Political Effect Considered It would also deal a heavy political blow to County Executive Alfred B DelBello a Democrat who fought critics charging the center was too ambitious and who is now running for reelection The plan is being weighed by an obstetrical task force of am Hudson Valley Health Systems Agency a yearold Federally mandated group of physicians and consumers that must make its recommendations to state officials who have the power to close the facilities by withholding hospital Medicaid payments Dr Whalen has set the deadline for the groupgroup report as the end of this month Prepared by consultants and staff members of the task force the plan is an outgrowth of Federal and state attempts to control spiraling medical costs at time of a slackening in the nationnation birth rate by ending duplication and overlapping in hospital services Prof Jerome Pollack an economist who helped in preparation of the report estimated at the hearing that 175 of the 54 maternity beds in the region were excess and he admonished the audience that the cost of maintaining these beds was a penalty to you when you pay hospitalization premiums or taxes But sentiment among the 600 people who jamilled the auditorium of the North Junior High School in two sessions lasting until 11 PM was heavily against his ideas Almost Every Speaker Opposed Just about every speaker of more than 80 spoke in opposition The largely female audience many of whose members came in buses from other counties cheered and waved placards demanding their maternity units be kept open Between sessions Jeffrey Adams a Dutchess County resident who is the task forceforce chairman expressed the opinion that there will be beds eliminatedbut perhaps in the form of reducing units in size rather than closing them Hospital officials challenged assumptions of their costs in the report warned of a domino effectthe loss of obstetric units leading to eventual loss of gynecologists and pediatricians from their staffs A number of speakers criticized the reportreport piecemeal approach to planning and asked for postponement of the plan until all health services could be considered Once a maternity unit is closed they said it would not reopen Religious issues were raised by antiabortion groups seeking to keep open Catholic hospitals such as St Agnes or by others protesting they would be forced to use a Catholic hospital such as Benedictine in Kingston where they feared that antisterilization and abortion procedures would be tightly restricted Petitions with 5000 to 10500 signatures were submitted and resolutions of county legislative bodies in Dutchess and Orange also in opposition were presented In some cases lawsuits against the agency were threatened Speakers warned of dire effects on the poor as well as the middle class and called the plan a bureaucratic disaster that would turn mothers into nomads and ignored community selfdetermination We all agree that health care is extremely expensive said Dr Leonard J Rothman an Orange County obstetrician but more bureaucratic control is not the cure for this expensive disease
Library of Genetic Errors Is Compiled to Predict Defects,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/18/archives/library-of-genetic-errors-is-compiled-to-predict-defects-health.html,PORTLAND Ore June 13A national library of human genetic errors is being compiled here attbe University of Oregon Health Sciences Center This new library is collecting data from six genetic laboratories across the country on all of the many hundreds of mistakes additions and deletions that can occur in any of the 46 human chromosomes the tiny stringlike structures that govern each individuals heredity In time the catalogue is expected to help doctors everywhere in the country tell their patients the risks involved in a given departure from the normal the probability of its happening twice or more in the same family and other things vitally important to prospective parents worried about a possible genetic defect  May Serve as Early Warning As the data accumulate the registry may also serve as an important early warning system to alert public health officials of any increase in the occurrence of a particular chromosome abnormality For example does a risk go with certain occupations or environmental exposures Might four or five hard winters in a row increase the probability that pregnant women will bear babies with an extra chromosome No 21 who therefore will be doomed to mental retardation and other serious health problems Questions such as these are largely unanswerable today but the national library is collecting the data from which the answers may someday be forthcoming The library deals only with health professionals and research workers not with individual patients or families Its official name is the Interregional Cytogenetic Register System One Error in 250 Births There are hundreds of chromosomal errors of varying significance many associated with serious birth defects and mental retardation More are being found continually The techniques used to study the chromosomes in detail have been developed only within the past few years Significant abnormalities in chromosomes occur in about one in every 250 live births according to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences a unit of the National Institutes of Health The institute estimates that at least threequarters of these genetic errors are harmful and that in addition at least onethird of all spontaneous abortions are probably caused by chromosomal abnormalities Yet each individual departure from the normal is rare Some are so rare that a pediatrician or obstetrician may go through a professional lifetime and see only one or two examples of that particular kind He or she usually finds such a case when a chromosome study called a karyotype is done on a child who has a birth defect At that point the doctor has an urgent need to know what to tell a family in which case the national collection of chromosome  abnormalities would prove valuable Equally important will be the librarys role in research according to its director Dr Gerald H Prescott As the data accumulate patterns are expected to emerge that will help determine the circumstances that caused the error in the genetic material Disparities Go Unexplained Most such abnormalities are simply unsolved puzzles today The baby who has an extra chromosome 21 will suffer from mental retardation birth defects infection and some other serious diseases known as Downs Syndrome Yet the per son whose chromosome 21 is partly translocated to another chromosome may be normal although he may have heightened risk of producing a baby with Downs Syndrome No one knows why this disparity exists The chromosome register has been under development since 1973 but it went into full operation only last October The six contributing laboratories including the one here directed by Dr R Ellen Magenis submit data on every portrait they produce of a persons chromosomes So far about 7000 of these karyotypes have been collected more than twothirds of them normal Dr Prescott expects that they will continue to accumulate at the rate of about 5000 a year and that the data will teach scientists much about the harmless normal variations in human chromosomes as well as about the harmful abnormalities The other five institutes contributing to the library are the New York State Birth Defects Institute Laboratory in Albany and the medical schools of Yale the University of Colorado Indiana University and the University of Tennessee It is possible that other laboratories may join the effort later The register is financed by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development also a unit of the National Institutes of Health Privacy is Preserved Elaborate precautions are taken to make sure that the privacy of individual patients is preserved The New York State laboratory for example sends the central library no names at all but only a number to go with each set of data Each contributing center sends data on the specific characteristics of the chromosomes in each case health and genetic data on the parents and other family members and health and development data on the individual whose chromosomes were studied All of this is fed into a computer 150 miles away at tile universitys Eugene campus Dr Prescott and his colleagues have immediate access to it by telephone lines It was not until 1955 that scientists learned the true number46of human chromosomes Most of the known abnormalities and their significance have been found only in the 1960s and 1970s While the first of these abnormalities to be assessed were major defects such as the absence of a piece of chromosome an extra chromosome or a translocation of the segment of one to another an entire new and complex area has been added to the research within the past few years Scientists have learned how tcp stain chromosomes to bring out horizontal light and dark bands across the arms of the tiny twisted Xshapes of each chromosome pair They have already dis covered 983 of these bands and more will almost certainly be found Dr Prescott said Sometimes the absence of only a single band will b e linked to severe birth defects or mental retardation For most such defects the cause is unknown Yet more knowledge could almost certainly aid in prevention or other means of coping with the problem We are on the threshold of a lot more knowledge to be gleaned Dr Prescott said The Nifty York TimesDavid Falconer Dr Gerald H Prescott heads library of human genetic errors at the University of Oregon Health Sciences Center

Dutch Tolerance of Illegal Abortions Draws Clients From All Over Europe,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/18/archives/dutch-tolerance-of-illegal-abortions-draws-clients-from-all-over.html,THE HAGUEThe abortion clinic on 134 Van Beverningkstraat in The Hague is a lot quieter now than it was two years ago when the small 20bed clinic was performing 60 abortions a day The number has dropped to 20 a day in the last year but the proportion of nonDutch women among the patients has continued to rise sharply despite moves revoking antiabortion laws in other countries The Dutch clinics offer abortions to women of any nationality on any grounds whatever up to the 22d week of pregnancy In 1976 the clinic on Van Beverningkstraat performed over 3500 abortions but as Marina Rupert the Dutch social worker who heads the clinic pointed out 70 percent of the patients were West German and 20 percent French of Belgian The number of Dutch residents seeking abortions has dropped 50 percent in the last year because of an intensive campaign for contraception On weekends said Marina Rupert the newspapers even carry ads telling you where to go to get a morning after pill if you need it All this is in a heavily Roman Catholic country where abortion is officially illegal Questioned about the tolerance of the Dutch Government on the abortion issue Mrs Rupert and her colleagues all agreed that despite heavy Roman Catholic opposition the strength of the womens movemenr and the Socialist Party in Holland is responsible At one point a little over a year ago said Mrs Rupert they closed down the oldest clinic in Zwolle but there was such an incredible storm of protest organized by the very active womens groups that the authorities hac to reopen the clinic two days later Elsewhere in Europe the Catholic Church and antiabortion forces continue to exert tremendous pressure on proabortion activities Even in France and West Germany where liberal laws exist the actual possibility of obtaining a legal abortion remains slight at best And in Italy the Senate just recently voted down the abortionondemand bill that had been approved by the lower house of Parliament earlier this year setting back the possibility of any abortion reform for at least six months in that country In France where Socialists and active womens groups forced through an abortionondemand bill two years ago religious and ethical beliefs have caused a seemingly unbridgeable gap between the law and reality French hospital directors doctors and nurses refuse to participate in abortions turning away qualified applicants seeking abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy In West Germany before 1976 there were no legal grounds for an abortion except in cases of mortal danger to the mother Since changes in the penal code went into effect last June the possibilities have opened up considerably at least on the books The law now recognizes medical grounds where either mother or child risk serious illness or birth defects and there is a genetic clause for abortions where inherited defects can be expected In addition the law allows for abortions up to the 12th week in cases of rape and in the most controversial clause the socalled social indications admit unbearable psychological stress as legal grounds The problems begin with the interpretation of the law in the different German states reports Elke KeinathVogel an official of the Bonn Health Ministry whose job it is to oversee the practical effects of the reform throughout West Germany In the south one has difficulty obtaining an abortion for even the most valid medical reasons whereas in Hamburg the authorities are much more tolerant especially in interpretating psychological stress where such factors as age marital status and financial situation are taken into consideration Hamburg which is primarily Protestant and has a strong Social Democratic majority has less trouble finding doctors and hospitals willing to perform abortions In the south especially Bavaria and BadenWuerttemberg strong Roman Catholic tradition severely limits the possibilities of obtaining legal abortion The law exempts any doctor or nurse from having to take part in an abortion if it is against his or her religious or ethical principles Anne Louise Prager director of Pro Familia a family counseling service said Even in Frankfurt we end up having to send women to Holland who have every right to a legal abortion here because we havent enough doctors who are willing to perform th operations A medical student in the waiting room of the abortion clinic in The Hague hadnt even tried to arrange for a legal abortion in West Germany She feared that she might suffer some sort of reprisal during the course of her medical studies through the influence of the church The church is still too active In opposing any abortions in Germany legal or not she said I preferred to come here where an abortion is arranged with a phone call and no questions are asked We have to send women to Holland because we havent enough doctors who will perform the operation

exception is contained in existing law whose restrictions on abortions are under challenge in the courts The stricter amendment was the result of a successful parliamentary tactic by proabortion members Their technical argument on a point of order was that the exception to the ban created new duties for Federal officials an improper provision in an appropriation bill The argument prevailed

"ABORTION FOES LOOK TO ULTIMATE VICTORY House Curb on Medicaid Funds Pleases Them, but They Expect Stiff Fight Remains Ahead",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/19/archives/abortion-foes-look-to-ultimate-victory-house-curb-on-medicaid-funds.html,CHICAGO June 18  When word reached the National Right to Life Committees convention here of another antiabortion victory in Washington a great cheer went up But the groups leaders were not satisfied What they had hoped to get was more overwhelming outcome than the 201to155 vote by which they gained House passage of an amendment to an appropriations bill that would forbid the use of Medicaid funds for any abortions But if leaders like Dr Mildred F Jefferson president of the national committee and Dr Robert L Krebsbach special projects director have their way those who voted against them will face stern retribution the next time they stand for election The leaders hopes are based on the rapid growth of what they call the prolife movement and the increasingly more sophisticated use of its political power Were now the biggest movement in America Dr Jefferson asserted in an interview Supporters Put at 11 Million From a standing start about four years ago after the Supreme Court struck down state laws against abortions the movement has grown to the point where it now declares that more than 3000 antiabortion groups are affiliated with its national committee and that its active supporters number 11 million What we have to do now said Dr Jefferson is to wring more political effectiveness out of all those numbers The 2000 or so delegates who registered for the convenion which ended here at the Conrad Hilton Hotel today were a quiet cross seltion of middleincome America as subdued in manner as in dress united only in a conviction that the ending of a pregnancy is an immoral taking of a human life It may have seemed that every other delegate was a physician spokesmen said because medical doctors are disproportionately represented in the groups leadership and doctors can more easily afford to attend conventions than other members can Physicians Have High Posts Four of the six officers listed in the convention program are physicians as are seven of the 51 persons listed as members of the board of directors Lawyers are the professional groups with the next largest representation and an undetermined number of the officers are clergymen But the overwhelming majority of the Right to Life Committee members are homemakers There are good reasons why both doctors and lawyers are so well represented said Dr Jefferson a small vivacious woman who was born in Texas and now a practicing surgeon and assistant professor of clinical surgery at Boston University Medical School I became a doctor because I considered it a high calling she said 1 think society has an obligation not to ask a doctor to kill Lawyers affiliated with the committee may have a moral abhorrence of abortions she said but they are also motivated by legal factors Dr  Krebsbach the special projects director from Lawton Okla had a different reason for joining Right to Life Obstetricians and Pediatricians I fight abortions as I would fight any disease that kills my patients the pediatrician said Obstetricians in the movement are even more dedicated said Dr Eugene E Diamond of Chicago another pediatrician Its our patients theyre killing but its the obstetricians that do the killing he said Robert E Winn a Roman Catholic lawyer from New Orleans said his attitude was a combination of legal and religious philosophy I felt segregation was wrong and feel abortion is wrong he said The purpose of the law is to keep conduct within socially tolerable limits The groups gain in Washington this week was only a step toward the ultimate victory they hope one day to win a constitutional amendment banning abortions We expect to work through Congress to get them to nullify the effects of the Supreme Court decision said Dr Jefferson who was reelected this week to her third term as president of the national committee Ratification Route Preferred Although nine states have now passed resolutions for a constitutional convention to seek an amendment that isnt the road the committee wants to go Dr Jefferson said because of the difficulty of getting the same sort of resolution passed by 34 states as would be required A more promising approach she believes would be an amendment approved first in Congress with a simple ratification process then needed in the states Although the committee continues to fight skirmishes as in the appropriations amendment most of its activities are directed toward that ultimate goal And its methods are timehonored About 145 lobbyistsare now working with Congressmen Dr Jefferson said and each contact with a Congressman is coordinated with letterwriting campaigns and telephone calls from someone the legislator knows Meanwhile the group has a vigorous grass roots campaign under way including a continuing voter survey project In some states Dr Jefferson said the survey has found as many as 70 percent of voters opposed to abortions What we have to do is convert that sentiment into political decisions she said Those Congressmen who voted against the antiabortion amendment this week can expect to be targets next week Dr Jefferson said adding By this time Tuesday every organization affiliated with us will know who voted for us and those who voted against lie
"Rights and Rhetoric Sometimes Collide as 3,000 Convene in Princeton for Women's‐Year Events",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/20/archives/rights-and-rhetoric-sometimes-collide-as-3000-convene-in-princeton.html,PRINCETON June 19The little train that once carried F Scott Fitzgeralds jaded flappers to Princeton weekends was full of women yesterday morning As they alighted however they were met not by silkly undergraduates but by a waiting taxicab driver who greeted them wits cries of Hi girls are you here for the womens lib Nearly 3000 men and women from across the state jammed the Princeton University campus this weekend to attend the New Jersey International Womens Year Meeting one of 56 mandated by Congressional order to be held before final national conference in Houston in midNovember Directed by the National Commission on the Observance of International Womens Year the New Jersey meeting began Friday evening with a tribute to New Jersey women public officials In a keynote address Donna Shalala Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for Policy Development and Research urged women to campaign for theMselves and to get elected to public office Representatives Millicent Fenwick and Helen S Meyner were in attendance over the weekend along with Caroline Bird feminist author and historian for the national commission Governor Byrne and State Senator Raymond H Bateman Republican of Somerville appeared in a state gubernatorial candidates forum on Sunday But the most heated activities of the conference were the voting to select 40 delegates to represent the state at the national conference this winter and an exchange of information informally and at 44 workshops scattered throughout the campus The latter were panel discussions on subjects that included women starting their own businesses and buying houses as well as the legal status of homemakers Women Loving Women the Lesbian Life Style and Should South Jersey Secede shared the agenda The status of battered wives and female offenders was discussed along with women in politics Sixty women shared forgotten experiences in an outdoor session on women and Anger the Forbidden Feeling conducted by Doris Weiss Rothman a Lawrenceville psychotherapist Ron Cox founder of the Summit Mens Center discussed the raising of male consciousness at a workshop on the impact of womens equality on men Men learn to lean on each other he said As a result I have a closer relationship with my wife and I think Im more a person than a father to my daughter Most of the workshops produced recommendations to be voted on by those attending with the final resolutions to be incorporated into a New Jersey womens platform for the national conference The conference is to prepare an advisory report for President Carter and Congress Arguments in Some Workshops Although organizers of the Jersey meeting reported that the workshops with the heaviest registration dealt with assertiveness training and the elderly those on abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment generated bitter noisy arguments Resolutions in favor of womens legal right to control reproduction were defeated at a morning session and then adopted in the afternoon by different workshop participants But after a resolution supporting the Equal Rights Amendment had been approved at a morning meeting the later session was disrupted by those against the amendment and no vote could be taken Wearing a construction workers hard hat with the message Under Protest and pausing frequently to quote the Bible Inez Franko a representative of the Citizens Alliance to Stop ERA in New Jersey led a group of men and women who blew police whistles at the afternoon workshop on the amendment and the meeting was abandoned The state committee reprimanded the disrupters publicly Mrs Franko also protested what she said was an underrepresentation on workshop panels of opponents of the two resolutions There was some scattered protests over the relatively small turnout of black women at the meeting Robbie Cagnina chairman of the conferences Outreach program said that attempts had been made to reach black women through social organizations and institutions and that 13000 of the conferences Federal budget of 72000 had been spent to provide financial assistance for 500 women An Appeal to the Shy We wanted to appeal to those who never go to conferences she said Some were shy We told them Yes you do know how to talk Just pretend youre talking to your girlfriend There were representatives of Ukrainian youth and Hispanic and Asian womens groups and a state association for the deaf Few men were in attendance I think its about 5 percent said Tom Barat an engineer from Bridgwater who said he had become interested in the womens movement when his wife suf1 fered job discrimination I see discrimination at work too he added But the Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers a professional organization of 140000 members to which belong hasjust passed a resolution supporting the Equal Rights Amendment One underrepresented minority was the prostitute according to the Rev Depaul Genska a Franciscan priest from Lafayette who works with prostitutes and appeared in a panel on prostitution Several said they would attend but theyre very intimidated he said They dont think the square community will accept them Also its a little early in the day for them Many dont get home until now Some women were disappointed with the conference I hate to see these libbers behind microphones one woman said as she left a workshop Who needs assertiveness training I just told my boss I wanted a raise and I got it This is a way of keeping things going said Constance Brown one of 36 women employees of the Army Reserve and Development Command in Dover Women go back to the office and rant and rave for a few days about unfair treatment then they settle down again because no one listens
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/20/archives/letters.html,To the Editor Your correspondent Ben A Franklin did a good job May 31 reporting the differences over President Carters proposal for the installation of flue gas scrubbers on all new coalfired utility plantswith one critical exception He neglected to stress the vital point that insofar as lowsulfur coal is concerned the Presidents proposal is designed to cure a problem that doesnt exist Thus the proposal if adopted unchanged may well balk the Presidents laudable effort toward a sorely needed national energy program We in our company find the Presidents energy proposals generally worthy of support and have declared so publicly But even the most scrupulous environmental precautions need not be unreasonable or counterproductive and that would be the probable consequence of a provision in the House of Representatives amendments to the Clean Air Act based on the Presidents recommendations on coal The House proposal makes no distinction between plants burning highsulfur coal that requires scrubbing and lowsulfur coal that can already comply with stringent emission standards without scrubbing Our company is developing both highand lowsulfur coal reserves so we are well aware of their relative economic and environmental implications Lowsulfur surfacemined Western coal competes in certain areas with highsulfur deepmined coal The costefficiency equations between the two are intricate but they boil down to these Because of greater efficiencies in surface mining techniques up to 10 times the productivity lowsulfur Western coal can be brought to certain markets depending on transportation factors at a lower cost than highsulfur higherBTU coal In addition highcost scrubber technologies create environmental and energy problems of their own Limestone scrubbing units produce massive amounts of sludgeenough to cover 50000 acres of land to a depth of 20 feet by 1990 based on existing scrubber installment schedules Moreover scrubbers wastefully consume about to 7 percent of the energy generated by the plant that uses them It seems mindless to extend a costly scrubbing requirement to a fuel that can burn ceaner unscrubbeci than most highsulfur coal can after scrubbing So much for the producers standpoint Consider the customers for coal who inevitably pick up the tab As it is electric utilities will spend nearly S10 billion between 197585 to control sulfur dioxide Under the Presidents plan these costs would jump to 225 billion The proposed requirement would boost electricity costs by about 93 a year for the average household by 1985 Thats a wasted 8 billion a year for consumers nationwide We need not abandon the new source performance standards for sulfur dioxide But heres an example where the states ought to decide the best way to meet those standards H E BOND Vice President Atlantic Richfield Co Los Angeles June 13 1977 A Case Against JobsThroughInflation To the Editor In his letter of June 11 Prof Ervin Miller accuses the Federal Reserve Board of using unemployment in its efforts to contain inflation But consider the alternative Having the Government inflate its currency to create more jobs is a lot like having Robin Hood steal from the poor to give to the poor Such action redistributes wealth but it does not create wealth For in the same way that taxes tend to restrict economic growth and reduce real prosperity the eroding effects of currency inflation undermine the nations ability to sustain real growth and provide real jobs Of course in a world in which people are going hungry from lack of work this is not necessarily a bad idea But it is important that those proposing it are fully cognizant of the effects of such action and are not deluding themselves into thinking that jobsthroughinflation is anything more than the financing of direct aid to the unemployed through higher prices for everyone Set in proper perspective if the jobless need aid would it not make more sense to direct such aid through established taxwelfare channels in which at least some degree of control can be exercised over it and through which the nations ability to create real jobs is left unimpaired rather than through the wildly uncontrollable procedure of inflation which not only damages the economys ability to create real jobs but which also robs from the poor as well as the richan alternative the original Robin JACQUES VOORHEES New York June 11 1977 Abortion This Homicidal Type of Surgery To the Editor The Planned Parenthood Federation is not satisfied with the 1115000 abortions performed in the United States in 1976 Clamoring for up to 650000 more it demands to know why 80 percent of public hospitals refuse to do abortions when abortion on demand is the law of the land The Planned Parenthood Federation perhaps fails to consider that the abortion operation is a most gruesome procedure In many areas of the country it is not always easy to recruit volunteers for this homicidal type of surgery With the unborns heartbeat often being heard at eight weeks of pregnancy abortion repels not only physicians but also nurses operating room personnel and hospital administrators Many nurses and doctors in perinatal intensive care units who struggle around the clock to save the lives of tiny 2pound infants will not work in hospitals where other medical personnel are allowed to kill babies of similar size for little or no reason Then too there is the issue of human rights The human rights of the unborn are clearly being denied one million times a year in our countryevery time a human life is destroyed by abortion Many segments of the American public simply d not want public hospitals engaged in lifedestroying operations at taxpayers expense Nor do they want an abortion clinic in every neighborhood Planned parenthood should stick with what it can do bestthe education of the public on the methods of family planning consonant with the religious beliefs of the individuals concerned it should cease its incredible efforts to make the killing of the unborn a commendable act MATTHEW J BULFIN MD Lauderdale Fla June 3 1977 The writer is president American Association of Pro Life Obstetricians and Gynecotogists Dr Ronan on Port Authority Audits and a Trip to Japan To the Editor Your June 15 paper carries a story headlined RonaregPublic and Private Funds Often the Subject of Controversies that contains gross errors of fact and is damaging to me The malicious thrust of the article is to cast doubt upon my record of public service involving the management of billions of public dollars without scandal by innuendo and careless or deliberate disregard of the facts and misleading juxtaposition of items The article refers to Dr Ronans own quarrels with the State Comptrollers office over just how thoroughly his Metropolitan Transportation Authority books should be audited This is untrue The argument MTA not personally had with the State Comptroller did not have anything to do with his audit of the MTA finances Indeed the MTAs books were audited not only by the State Comptroller but by other city county and Federal agencies The issue was whether the State Comptroller was empowered to conduct management surveys of Authority operations The article however states In 1973 the Appellate Division ruled that Dr Ronan could not deny State Comptroller Arthur Levitts staff access to his books and records Not only is the statement false but the caldulated use by the article of Dr Ronan in lieu of the MTA and the use of his in lieu of the MTAs records leaves the misleading impression I sought to withhold access to my personal financial records The article then selects quotes from a subsequent audit by the Comptrollers office criticizing the Transit Authoritys documentation of travel expenses This gives a false impression that only after the court decision was the financial information available It says the audit also  cited Mr Ronans many trips to European cities for conferences and said that his vouchers often did not include adequate documentation of his expenses It ignores my refutation The Comptroller acknowledged documentation adding The audit report was one of a series dealing with the Transit Authority hence its significance is limited to one phase of the enormous and complex operations of the Authority It should not be interpreted as a reflection on the accomplishments of the Authority nor on the high professional competence and integrity of the former Chairman whose work on behalf of mass transportation has received wide and well deserved recognition The deliberate placement of this article next to an article on the RonanGilbert trip suggests a deliberate editorial decision to discredit me That article states The trip described as a meeting with Japanese auto makers was also paid for by the Port Authorityleaving an inference that it was not so That trip involved intensive sessions with Toyota and Nisson Motors For me and Mr Gilbert unsalaried commissioners this meant 22 hours In an airplane from New York to Tokyo 34 hours in Tokyo and 13 hours flying Tokyo to New York These biased articles not only are damaging to me personally but will scarcely advance the industrial jobs we seek to bring here WILLIAM J RONAN Chairman The Port Authority of NY and NJ New York June 17 1977  From the Editor Court records establish that the State Comptroller went to court to gain full access to MTA books and records instead of the limited access the MTA wanted to grant Some of the documents the Comptroller soughtand the MTA wanted to withholdincluded the records on contracts leases sinking funds and purchasing policies The court upheld the Comptroller In short Mr Ronan as head of the MTA resisted full disclosure of his agencys records and activities Mr Ronan refused to talk to Times reporters who many times sought to reach him for comment on the reports concerning him On Papps Return To Lafayette Street To the Editor Many will decry the departure of Joseph Papp from Lincoln Center but the true theater lover will applaud his decision to leave New York City needs the honest creativity of Joseph Papp Only at the Public Theater on Lafayette Street have we seen this the experimental theaterthe good the bad the beautiful Those who are pass holders at Devera Ehrenberg the Public Theater nave seen some of the most exciting and interesting theater in America over the past years When Mr Papp turned his attentions to Lincoln Center the Public Theater downtown suffered Now he will be back at the theaters in the old Astor Library We who live in New York City Nassau Westchester or even the State of Maine will be the beneficiaries of the return of Joseph Papp to the Lafayette Street Public Theater VOYLE A BESSE Hempstead LI June 10 1977 Fuel Arithmetic 747 vs the Car To the Editor The June 11 letter comparing fuel consumption of the 747 airplane with the 10mpg automobile certainly deserves rebuttal The 2000mile flight the writer used as an example would consume 11492 gallons and not 50000 If the consumption of the 747 is divided by the total of 350 passengers the fuel used per passenger for the trip would be 328 gallons The auto at 10 mpg would consume 200 gallons With five passengers in the auto the fuel consumption per passenger would be 40 gallons each Put another way it would take 70 autos consuming 14000 gallons of fuel to do what the 747 could do with 11492 gallons Having served as pilot in command ea the 747 since 1970 I feel I speak with some authority J B WEiss Spring Hill Kan June 13 1977
Summary of Decisions on Constitutional Issues by the United States Supreme Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/21/archives/summary-of-decisions-on-constitutional-issues-by-the-united-states.html,WASHINGTON June 20The Supreme Court took the following actions today ABORTION The Court held that neither the Constitution nor the Social Security Act requires states to provide Medicaid funds for elective abortions Mahar v Roe No 751440 Beal v Doe No 75554 The Court also held that the Constitution does not require municipalities that have public hospitals to provide elective abortions in those hospitals Poelker v Doe No 75442 In each case the vote was 63 with Justices Harry A Blackmun William J Brennan Jr and Thurgood Marshall dissenting [Article on Page 1] CIVIL RIGHTS By a 72 vote the Court held that neither Federal law nor state statutes of limitations restrict the time period in which the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission may bring lawsuits against employers who allegedly violate the antidiscrimination provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Justice William H Rehnquist and Chief Justice Warren E Burger dissented Occ dental Life Insurance Co v EEOC No 7699 The Court agreed to hear a case from North Carolina raising the question of what standards judges should follow in deciding whether attorneys fees should he granted for the defense when the defendants win lawsuits brought against them under Title VII Christinansburg Garment Co v EEOC No 761383 COMMERCE The Court held that a North Carolina statute restricting the labeling of apples violated the commerce clause by burdening and discriminating against the interstate sale of apples from the State of Washington Hunt v Washington Apple Advertising Commn No 7663 The North Carolina statute required that containers of apples sold or shipped into the state bear no other grade than the applicable Federal grade or standard Washington has its own strict grading system The North Carolina statute would thus bar sales in that slate of boxes marked with the Washington grades The Court reasoned in part that the statute deprived the Washington apple industry of the competitive advantage it had earned by the state inspection and grading system Chief Justice Burger wrote the Courts opinion All the Justices joined it except Justice Rehnquist who did not participate in the case LIBEL Without comment the Court turned down a petition from the publisher of The Los Angeles Times seeking review of a Federal appeals court decision that held there were enough contacts between the newspaper and the State of Wyoming to allow a libel suit against the paper to go forwardin a Wyoming court The appeals court found that the newspapers sale of syndicated articles to Wyoming newspapers its solicitation of advertising in the state and the presence of three of its reporters in the state to work on the article were enough contacts to subject the paper to suit in the state The article giving rise to the lawsuit involved alleged criminal activity in Wyoming Times Mirror Co v Aanselmi No 761524 CRIMINAL The Court agreed to hear the Governments appeal from a Federal court order last year that dismissed the triple homicide charges against Dr Jeffrey R MacDonald He was accused cleared and then accused again in the highly publicized slayings of his wife and two young daughters while he was an Army doctor stationed at Fort Bragg NC in 1970 The United State Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found that Dr MacDonald had been denied his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial The doctor was formally charged by the military in May 1970 The investigating officer subsequently recommended that the charges be dismissed The commanding general of the unit dismissed them in October 1970 The Government subsequently investigated and at its behest a Federal grand jury indicted the physician in January 1975 It was this indictment that the appeals court ordered dismissed US v MacDonald No 7511892 Following the Governments suggestion the Court refused to hear an appeal by citizens of Alaska seeking to upset the Alaska Legislatures approval of a settlement between the state the Federal Government and Alaskan natives regarding land claims Under the settlement certain state land was transferred to the United States for use in settling claims by natives The land in dispute is in the Cook Inlet region Lewis v Alaska No 761490 [Article on Page 41] OIL The Court asked the office of the Solicitor General to file a brief express ing the views of the Government on an antitrust complaint filed by the independent producer Nelson Bunker Hunt against various major oil companies The lower court in the case dismissed the complaint and Mr Hunt is seeking Supreme Court review of that action The Court did not announce whether it would grant review presumably it wants to get the Governments views before doing so Hunt v Mobil Oil Corp No 761403 Article on Page 41 RELIGION The Court announced it would review a decision by the Tennessee Supreme Court last March upholding a provision of the Tennessee Constitution that bars ministers and priests of any denomination from serving in the state Legislature The Tennessee court found that the provision did not offend either the free exercise or establishment clauses of the First Amendment McDaniel v Paty No 761427 SCHOOLS The Court declined to review and thus left in effect a decision by the California Supreme Court holding that the states system of financing its public schools violated the equal protection guarantee of the California Constitution The financing system is based mainly on local real estate taxes and it results in wide disparities in amounts spent per pupil Clowes v Serrano No 761512 TAXES At the request or Massachusetts the Court agreed to consider the constitutionality of the Federal excise tax on the use of civil aircraft as the tax is applled to stateowned aircraft used for official purposes The aircraft in question is a helicopter purchased by Massachusetts in 1969 for use by the state police Mass v US No 761500 VOTING RIGHTS The Court handed down two decisions that limited the power of courts to review decisions made by the Attorney General under the Voting Rights Ac In one Morris v Gressette No 731583 the majority held that a court cannot review the decision of an Attorney General not to object to a state election statute in this case a South Carolina Senate apportionment The vote was 6 to 3 In the other Briscoe v Bell No 7660 a unanimous Court held that Texas had no right to appeal an Attorney Generals decision that the state fell within the language minority provisions of the 1975 amendments to the act [Article on Page 21] WELFARE By a vote of 5 to 4 the Court upheld a Federal regulation that authorizes the states to deny benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent ChildrenUnemployed Fathers program to families in which the father is unemployed because of misconduct or a strike or because he voluntarily quit his job Batterton v Francis

COURT RULES STATES MAY DENY MEDICAID FOR SOME ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/21/archives/court-rules-states-may-deny-medicaid-for-some-abortions.html,WASHINGTON June 20The Supreme Court ruled today 6 to 3 that neither the Constitution nor current Federal law requires states to spend Medicaid funds for elective abortions The Court ruled by the same vote that cities and towns that had public hospitals were not required under the Constitution to provide or even permit elective abortions in those hospitals The rulings do not mean that states must bar funds for abortions They do mean however that all states and localities are free if they wish and if their state laws and constitutions permit to bar the use of public funds and facilities for socalled nontherapeutic abortions The rulings may also mean that the Federal Government is free to bar the use of Federal funds and resources for such abortions In New York Joseph T Lynaugh the president of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation said that mu nicipal hospitals there would continue to perform abortions with Medicaid funds while the legal implications of the Courts decisions were being studied Spokesmen for Governor Carey and Governor Byrne of New Jersey said that there would be no comment until a legal study of the decision had been completed The rulings came in three cases from Connecticut Pennsylvania and Missouri that involved only state and local rather than Federal efforts to limit public support for abortions Undoubtedly more litigation will be needed to clarify the full reach of the decisions The logic that the Court followed seem as applicable to the Federal Government as to state and local bodies The point is critical because Congress is currently considering proposals that would bar the use of Federal funds for many and perhaps all abortions In other decisions today the Court upheld the right of the Attorney General to subject a state to the restricions of the Voting Rights Act and his authority to allow debatable state voting laws to go into effect automatically by refusing to exercise his power to disapprove them [Page 21] Todays rulings suggest that a ban on all abortions even those that are medically necessary might be invalid They appear to clear the way however for a ban on funds for abortions which are elective or not medically necessary The rulings are a major victory for antiabortion forces the biggest so far in the effort to limit the reach of the Supreme Courts landmark 1973 decisions striking down state laws that made it a crime to perform an abortion The rulings are a severe setback for the proabortion forces and for the womens movement generally The decisions seem sure to have practical consequences for tens of thousands of women Medicaid funds have paid for abortions for as many as 300000 womenin a year at a cost of 50 million Indigent women will find it increasingly difficult to get abortions and some as the Court conceded may find it impossible Consequently abortion advocates contend more unwanted children may be born and the number of illegitimate births may rise The rulings also appear to have sociological significance because they affect only the poorwelltodo and middleclass women are not dependent on Medicaid funds Legally the rulings seem to change a trend in the law started by the 1973 Supreme Court abortion decisions Various lower courts that have ruled on the issues presented by todays cases reached a contrary result to the one the high court reached today Those lower courts had generally based their rulings on what they thought the Supreme Courts 1973 decisions required The majority today insisted that the Court was standing by its 1973 abortion rulings The decision Justice Lewis F Powell Jr wrote for the majority in the Connecticut case signals no retreat from its earlier rulings The dissentersWilliam J Brennan Jr Thurgood Marshall and Harry A Blackmundisputed that None can take seriously the Courts assurance Justice Brennan said An antiabortion leader Msgr James T McHugh director of the Committee for ProLife Activities of the National Council of Catholic Bishops welcomed the decitiony saying that it was to the advantage of the family unit Officials of the National Right to Life Committee also hailed the rulings It indicates it may be the Supreme Court is realizing at last what it wrought with its [1973] abortion decision said Robert E Winn of New Orleans chairman of the antiabortion groups legal advisory committee and a member of its boatd Dr Robert L Krebsbach of Lawton Okla vice president of special projects for the committee said Maybe because of the knowledge thats being spread by the right to life movement the judges on the Supreme Court are waking up to the facts surrounding their very bad decision of 1973 and their very bad decision regarding fathers last yearthe decision holding that it is unconstitutional to let a husband veto his wifes decision to have an abortion Many groups and persons on the opposing side of the question including the American Civil Liberties Union the Planned Parenthood Federation of America Americans for Democratic Action and Bella S Abzug the New York mayoral contender issued statements decrying the rulings The Supreme Court antiabortion decision this morning was a national tragedy forcing poor women into back alleys for their abortions Joseph L Rauh Jr vice president of the ADA said What todays decisions do is reestablish pregnancy termination as a secondclass medical service unequal to pregnancy continuation and the poor as secondclass patients unequal to the more affluent in their opportunities for service said a statement from Planned Parenthood Last year Congress enacted an amendment to the Social Security Act known as the Hyde Amendment after its sponsor Representative Henry J Hyde of Illinois that barred the payment of Medicaid funds for abortions unless the abortion was necessary to save the life of the mother However that amendment has not been enforced Last fall responding to two lawsuits challenging the law including one suit by New York Citys Health and Hospitals Corporation a Federal District Court held the statute unconstitutional Its enforcement has been enjoined pending appeal Last week the House passed a new amendment barring the use of Medicaid funds for all abortions including those to save the life of the mother What was before the Supreme Court today was not the Hyde amendment but the Medicaid system as currently in effect Various states under this system have on their own limited the use of funds for abortion In the case from Pennsylvania the issue was whether the Social Security Act permitted states to bar Medicaid funds for nontherapeutic abortions In the case from Connecticut the question was whether the Constitution permitted states to do this The third case involved a public hospital in St Louis Because of a policy directive from the mayor and also the longtime practice of staffing the hospitals obstetricsgynecology clinic with faculty and students from a local Jesuitoperated institution women could not get elective abortions there Mayor James Conway of St Louis halted all nontherapeutic abortions at the citys two general hospitals while the citys law department studied the decision The Court decided the first two cases with separate majority opinions both by Justice Powell It decided the third case with a brief unsigned opinion resting on the opinion in the Pennsylvania case First it found that the words of the Social Security Act requiring states to establish reasonable standards for determining the extent of medical assistance the state will give permitted states to bar funding for elective abortions It said in part that states had a valid and important interest in encouraging childbirth and that there was nothing in the words of the statute to show that it was unreasonable for a state to further this interest Second the Court found that the Constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws was not violated by state Medicaid plans that bar funding of elective abortions even while providing funding for women who chose to bear their children The theory of lower courts that have reached the opposite conclusion and the theory of the dissenters is that paying for childbirth but not for abortion is an undue interference with a womans constitutional right established in the 1973 decisions to decide whether to bear the child The majority found today however that the existence of this right to decide whether or not to bear ones child did not bar the state from making a value judgment favoring childbirth The dissenters disputed the justices in the majority on their logic on their cornprehension of the practical consequences of their rulings for women and also on their suggestion that a different result could be found in the legislatures Justice Blackmun accused the majority today of allowing states and municipalities to do indirectly what it forbade them to do directly in its 1973 rulings Justice Marshall described in detail the practical effects on women that the rulings could haveunwanted children unsafe but cheap illegal abortions and deaths from those abortions He said that already many women have had to travel from their home states to get abortions poor women he said may not be able to travel for abortions He said also that nonwhite women would suffer disproportionately from todays ruling since proportionately more nonwhite women than white women get abortions and are dependent on Medicaid I am appalled he said at the ethical bankruptcy of those who preach a right to life that means under present social policies a bare existence in utter misery for so many poor

COURT RULES STATES MAY DENY MEDICAID FOR SOME ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/21/archives/court-rules-states-may-deny-medicaid-for-some-abortions-elective.html,WASHINGTON June 20The Supreme Court ruled today 6 to 3 that neither the Constitution nor current Federal law requires states to spend Medicaid funds for elective abortions The Court ruled by the same vote that cities and towns that had public hospitals were not required under the Constitution to provide or even permit elective abortions in those hospitals The rulings do not mean that states must bar funds for abortions They do mean however that all states and localities are free if they wish and if their state laws and constitutions permit to bar the use of public funds and facilities for socalled nontherapeutic abortions The rulings may also mean that the Federal Government is free to bar the use of Federal funds and resources for such abortions Reaction in New York In New York Joseph T Lynaugh the president of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation said that municipal hospitals there would continue to perform abortions with Medicaid funds while the legal implications of the Courts decisions were being studied Spokesmen for Governor Carey and Governor Byrne of New Jersey said that there would be no comment until a legal study of the decision had been completed The rulings came in three cases from Connecticut Pennsylvania and Missouri that involved only state and local rather than Federal efforts to limit public support for abortions Undoubtedly more litigation will be needed to clarify the full reach of the decisions The logic that the Court followed seems as applicable to the Federal Government as to state and local bodies The point is critical because Congress is currently considering proposals that would bar the use of Federal funds for many and perhaps all abortions Attorney General Upheld In other decisions today the Court upheld the right of the Attorney General to subject a state to the restricions of the Voting Rights Act and his authority to allow debatable state voting laws to go into effect automatically by refusing to exercise his power to disapprove them [Page 21] Todays rulings suggest that a ban on all abortions even those that are medically necessary might be invalid They appear to clear the way however for a ban on funds for abortions which are elective or not medically necessary The rulings are a major victory for antiabortion forces the biggest so far in the effort to limit the reach of the Supreme Courts landmark 1973 decisions striking down state laws that made it a crime to perform an abortion The rulings are a severe setback for the proabortion forces and for the womens movement generally The decisions seem sure to have practical consequences for tens of thousands of women Medicaid funds have paid for abortions for as many as 300000 women in a year at a cost of 50 million Indigent women will find it increasingly difficult to get abortions and some as the Court conceded may find it impossible Consequently abortion advocates contend more unwanted children may be born and the number of illegitimate births may rise The rulings also appear to have sociological significance because they affect only the poorwelltodo and middleclass women are not dependent on Medicaid funds Legally the rulings seem to change a trend in the law started by the 1973 Supreme Court abortion decisions Various lower courts that have ruled on the issues presented by todays cases reached a contrary result to the one the high court reached today Those lower courts had generally based their rulings on what they thought the Supreme Courts 1973 decisions required The majority today insisted that the Court was standing by its 1973 abortion rulings The decision Justice Lewis F Powell Jr wrote for the majority in the Connecticut case signals no retreat from its earlier rulings The dissentersWilliam J Brennan Jr Thurgood Marshall and Harry A Blackmundisputed that None can take seriously the Courts assurance Justice Brennan said An antiabortion leader Msgr James T McHugh director of the Committee for ProLife Activities of the National Council of Catholic Bishops welcomed the decitiony saying that it was to the advantage of the family unit Officials of the National Right to Life Committee also hailed the rulings It indicates it may be the Supreme Court is realizing at last what it wrought with Its [1973] abortion decision said Robert E Winn of New Orleans chairman of the antiabortion groups legal advisory committee and a member of its boatd Dr Robert L Krebsbach of Lawton Okla vice president of special projects for the committee said Maybe because of the knowledge thats being spread by the right to life movement the judges on the Supreme Court are waking up to the facts surrounding their very bad decision of 1973 and their very bad decision regarding fathers last yearthe decision holding that it is unconstitutional to let a husband veto his wifes decision to have an abortion Many groups and persons on the opposing side of the question including the American Civil Liberties Union the Planned Parenthood Federation of America Americans for Democratic Action and Bella S Abzug the New York mayoral contender issued statements decrying the rulings The Supreme Court antiabortion decision this morning was a national tragedy forcing poor women into back alleys for their abortions Joseph L Rauh Jr vice president of the ADA said What todays decisions do is reestablish pregnancy termination as a secondclass medical service unequal to pregnancy continuation and the poor as secondclass patients unequal to the more affluent in their opportunities for service said a statement from Planned Parenthood Amendment Is Cited Last year Congress enacted an amendment to the Social Security Act known as the Hyde Amendment after its sponsor Representative Henry J Hyde of Illinois that barred the payment of Medicaid funds for abortions unless the abortion was necessary to save the life of the mother However that amendment has not been enforced Last fall responding to two lawsuits challenging the law including one suit by New York Citys Health and Hospitals Corporation a Federal District Court held the statute unconstitutional Its enforcement has been enjoined pending appeal Last week the House passed a new amendment barring the use of Medicaid funds for all abortions including those to save the life of the mother What was before the Supreme Court today was not the Hyde amendment but the Medicaid system as currently in effect Various states under this system have on their own limited the use of funds for abortion In the case from Pennsylvania the issue was whether the Social Security Act permitted states to bar Medicaid funds for nontherapeutic abortions In the case from Connecticut the question was whether the Constitution permitted states to do this The third case involved a public hospital in St Louis Because of a policy directive from the mayor and also the longtime practice of staffing the hospitals obstetricsgynecology clinic with faculty and students from a local Jesuitoperated institution women could not get elective abortions there Mayor James Conway of St Louis halted all nontherapeutic abortions at the citys two general hospitals while the citys law department studied the decision The Court decided the first two cases with separate majority opinions both by Justice Powell It decided the third case with a brief unsigned opinion resting on the opinion in the Pennsylvania case The Court made two basic findings First it found that the words of the Social Security Act requiring states to establish reasonable standards for determining the extent of medical assistance the state will give oermitted states to bar funding for elective abortions It said in part that states had a valid and important interest in encouraging childbirth and that there was nothing in the words of the statute to show that it was unreasonable for a state to further this interest Second the Court found that the Constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws was not violated by state Medicaid plans that bar funding of elective abortions even while providing funding for women who chose to bear their children The theory of lower courts that have reached the

TV Weekend:,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/24/archives/tv-weekend-germany.html,THE television schedule has slipped quietly into a typical pattern of summer sluggishness but it is not without occasional offbeat forays that for good or ill can Jeave the viewer startled One unusual project scheduled for this afternoon at 315 on Channel 13 is called Documenta 6 In a live international transmission by satelite from the Documenta Art Exhibition in Kassel West Germany three artists will concoct new works for the electronic screen Nam June Paik will offer a video opera Douglas Davis will manipulate images of himself And Joseph Beuys will deliver a critique on Art as Social Sculpture In a splendid postcard from Germany the indefatigable Paik reminds this writer that the date is June 24 exactly 20 years after Sputnik The event will be rerun on tape at 1030 this evening  Shifting to more familiar documentary ground there is Guess Whos Pregnant being carried on Channel 13 at 10 tonight Produced at WTTChicage it proceeds on the premise that teenage pregnancies are at a shocking level and very little is being done about it But Michael Hirsh and Elayne Goldstein the writers and producers are somewhat confusing when they deal directly with solutions and what should be done about it The statistics are indeed disquieting when rattled off quickly against a barrage of images For instance more than a million girls between the ages of 15 and 19 will become pregnant this year But on closer examination after accounting for abortions and miscarriages these pregnancies will result in 600000 births onefifth of the United States total And on still closer examination twothirds of those births will be produced by married women A woman can become a mother in her teens and still lead a normal and fulfilling life That leaves of course 200000 births in that category to unwed mothers and in addition and constituting the real focus of this documentary 30000 unmarried girls under 15 whose pregnancies will produce 12000 babies According to another statistic 9 out of 10 women have sex by the age of 20 and the starting age keeps getting younger Associating itself with birth control groups such as Planned Parenthood the program comes down carefully on the side of sex education and contraceptives There is a curious fudging though on the more complex issue of morals Reference is indeed made to the erosion of the roles of parents and religious institutions in setting standards But then some of those same parents and religious leaders are portrayed as the villains of the piece as they are seen opposing sex education The enlightened viewpoint is articulated by a sex education teacher schools should beteaching not morals but how to make a decision Guess Whos Pregnant is most provocative and valuable when it examines the bombardment of sexual messages being unleashed daily in everything from popular music Paul Ankas smoothly moronic Having My Baby to television commercials Catherine Deneuve purring over Mercury car bodies It is then pointedly observed that all radio and TV networks and major broadcasting stations subscribe to a code that prohibits the advertising of contraceptives  Viewers who have access to Home Box Offices pay cable system can conclude their television weekend on another decidedly offbeat note The venicle is called Totie Returns and it will be made available to Manhattan dwellers this Sunday 9 PM Totie is Totie Fields the comedienne who underwenta leg amputationin the past year The Home Box office production is a recording of her return to performing before a celebrityfilled audience in Las Vegas The portrait of a resilient and determined performer is most affecting ironically when it is interviewing Miss Fields offstage She speaks quietly and acmirably of her ordeal and the support she received from her husband Onstage Miss Fields quickly reverts to her incomparable blast of grossness and vulgatity to her role of what has been described as Bionic Yenta Tailored mugly to the demands of Las Vegas the act remains quite literally unbelievable

The Showdown Seems Near,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/26/archives/the-showdown-seems-near.html,WASHINGTONIn the course of the latest House conflict over abortion Representative Mary Rose Oakar managed to be accused of treachery by both sides The antiabortion movement branded the Ohio Democrat as a backstabher The proabortion forces called her a doublecrosser Miss Oakars sin as it turned out was to be a feminist who opposes abortion Somehow she said with a rueful laugh I became a national target for both groups Though Miss Oakar ultimately restored her standing with the Right to Life camp by voting with a House majority to bar use of Medicaid money for abortions her experience suggested the intensity with which the debate is being conducted A young Wisconsin man walked here bearing wooden cross to demonstrate his opposition to abortion and other protestors descended on the White House with placards bearing messages such as Life Aint Peanuts Jimmy Proabortion leaders have begun enlisting likeminded campaign contributors to put the heat on individual members of Congress The issue has produced the most highly charged lobbying since the contentious days of the Vietnam war and a consequence of the United States Supreme Court rulings last week on abortion Miss Oakar and her 534 Senate and louse colleagues are apt to be buffeted with increasing erocity by constituents with irreconcilably opposing views ihe Court ruled that states were not obliged to spend Medicaid funds nor were localities required to offer public hospital facilities for elective abortions But the Court specified it was not deciding whether as a matter of policy public money ought to be used for nontherapeutic abortions and in fact tossed that hot potato hack across the plaza separating the Supreme Court from the Capitol When an issue involves policy choices as sensitive as those implicated by public funding of nontherapeutic abortions the Court majority said the appropriate forum for their resolution in a democracy is the legislature The Justices language signaled to those devising rival strategies here the need for redoubling an already vocal intense and sometimes vehement legislative battle over the unborn The immediate object of affection or scorn is the Senate whose members will consider this week the appropriation measure to which the House tacked the stipulation that Medicare money cannot be used for abortions therapeutic or not Both sides sense as Cory Richards of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America put it that what goes in that law is going to stick for a while and determine the extent to which the poor may obtain Governmentpaid abortions Abortion foes whose grassroots movement now claims 11 million activists in 3000 chapters loosely federated under the aegis of the National Right to Life Committee is demanding retention of the House language or failing that the most restrictive limit possible on Federally assisted abortions Abortion advocates a mixture of standing and ad hoc interest groups including Planned Parenthood Americans for Democratic Action the National Womens Political Caucus and the National Abortion Rights Action League will try to obtain language fuzzy enough to let states continue to pay for operations terminating abortions where the life Dr health of a woman or infant might be jeopardized by thildbirth For the longer term both here and in state capitals the opposing sides are equally determined to press their cases Thea Rossi Barron the legislative counsel to the National Right to Life Committee said the group would urge that Medicaid funds instead be channeled into such activities as counseling women with problem pregnancies upgrading sex education courses researching safer contraceptives and improving adoption procedures Forlorn about their prospects in Congress proabortion groups are preparing to implore states to continue providing abortions and related services to the poor even without Medicaid funds But one abortion supporter conceded privately that the states will all be under siege now and the RighttoLifers are strongest in the hustings Thats where theyve all come from The Right to Life coalition has emerged so suddenly and lately successfully that some abortion advocates no longer scoff at the ultimate goal of the movement constitutional amendment outlawing abortions entirely The standard explanation for the impact of the antiabortion movement is that its members while representing but fraction of the electorate cast bullet ballots singlemindedly for or against Federal candidates on the basis of their abortion positions alone In a close race that 2 or 3 percent could defeat you said Senator Robert Packwood Republican of Oregon That explanation may be too facile though zmd the Right to Life leaders who claim to represent majority view have some evidence to support the belief that they are at least a sizable minority A Gallup poll conducted 16 months ago found that 45 percent of Americans favored a constitutional ban on abortion except where needed womans life The source of the surge in antiabortion strength may lie in the differences between the techniques and circumstances of the contending sides Abortion advocates are at this point trying to prevent change As Ellen McGovern director of the ProChoice project of the National Womens Political Caucus stated When youre trying to maintain the status quo its more difficult to mobilize people let them know things are slipping Proponents of abortion are generally wellfinanced professional and inclined toward traditional lobbying methods But the Right to Life movement relying on neighborhood bake sales dinner dances and nominal membership dues for financing has generated a crude but powerful lobby with the most potent force of allgrassroots activism Representative Dale Milford Democrat of Texas switched to the Right to Life side in the House debate saying he could not ignore the hundreds of letters from forceful constituents opposed to abortion The Supreme Courts rulings made it likely that Miss Dakar and other officeholders will have to run the abortion gauntlet repeatedly Most members of Congress were hiding behind the protection of the courts said Mr Richards of politicians who cast their votes in the expectation the judiciary would set matters to rest anyway But the Supreme Court made it very clear these decisions are going to be made in the legislature The conflict may turn more shrill because there is no longer any place for politicians to hide James M Naughton is a reporter in the

Anti‐Abortion Forces Gain,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/26/archives/antiabortion-forces-gain.html,Four years ago when having an abortion was still a crime in most states the United States Supreme Court ruled that the constitutional right to privacy entitled women to have them The decision as well as the relative speed with which the explosive social and religious question was settled at first stunned opponents of abortion Then regrouping they moved to unsettle the issue by taking it back to the courts and the legislatures Last week the foes of abortionondemand won significant victories in both Substantially qualifying its 1973 ruling the Supreme Court decided that neither the Constitution nor any Federal statute required states to use public funds to offer elective abortions to the indigent for free And the Senate as if taking its cue from the Court indicated it would join the House in prohibiting Medicaid funds from being used for abortions Both the Courts and the Senates actions intensified the already sensitive abortion issue by adding the question of discrimination by class Are the poor the only ones unable to secure such operations Opponents had succeeded in persuading many states to refuse public funding for operations when the life of the mother was not in danger Advocates of abortion had argued before the Court that such refusals violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by granting free medical services to pregnant women who wished to bear their children but denying them to those who wished to exercise their right not to bear the child The Court in a 7 to 2 decision disagreed declaring that while states may not make abortion illegal they may make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion and   implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds In his dissenting opinion Justice Thurgood Marshall asserted that the ruling would in practice mean a bare existence in utter misery for so many poor women and their children The decision meant that the choice of whether to provide publicly funded nontherapeutic abortions is now clearly up to the legislators both at the national and state levels many of whom are under increasing pressure from the foes of abortion Responding to these forces the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to bar most elective Medicaid abortions The Senate is considered likely to pass the provision which would then have to be reconciled in conference with an even stricter House provision A similar ban voted last year had been invalidated by the lower Federal courts before last weeks Supreme Court ruling The Soviet Union worried that it hold over Western European Commu nist parties is slipping has sharply at tacked the socalled Eurocommunis movement and one of its leading exponents the Spanish Communist leader Santiago Carrillo Whether Moscow can reassert its primacy is doubtful At a meeting of European parties in East Berlin last summer the Russians under pressure from Italian Spanish and French Communist leaders affirmed the right of each party to pursue its own path to socialism the keystone of Eurocommunism But an article published in Moscow last week that clearly represented Kremlin views took pains to blunt criticism of the Soviet system by Western European Communists Referring to Mr Carrillos critique of Soviet policies both in the recent Spanish election campaign and in a book Eurocommunism and the State the article said he had spoken of our country and our party in terms that even the most reactionary writers do not venture to use The Italian and French parties have also shown signs of ideological heresy The tension between the Soviet and French Communists who are preparing for an election next year was evident last week Although it was not clear who snubbed whom Leonid I Brezhnev the Soviet leader did not see George Marchais his French Communist Party counterpart during visit to Paris
Soviet Medicine Mixes Inconsistency With Diversity,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/26/archives/soviet-medicine-mixes-inconsistency-with-diversity-soviet-medicine.html,MOSCOWA middleaged woman from a country town about 100 miles from Moscow was admitted to the finest cardi ac institute in the Soviet Union several months ago She had little hope of survival without radical surgery so in an eighthour operation one of the countrys most skilled heart surgeons implanted an artificial valve The prognosis is guarded but she is recovering well Although the cost to the state of the valve and the procedure was 11000 rubles almost 15000 at the official rate she paid nothing Not long before a young pregnant woman entered a maternity hospital in Leningrad Although her pelvis was too narrow for a normal delivery and her chart called for a Caesarean section the harassed nurse responsible alone for the entire floor had no time to read charts The womans labor went on and on Now and then the nurse came to check the fetal heartbeat The labor continued Finally the fetal heartbeat stopped the baby had died The two cases described by the patients friends and relatives reflect the immense diversity and inconsistency of the Soviet Unions fully socialized system of medical care As pieced together from Soviet doctors and patients and from Western physicians and scientists who have worked here a picture emerges of a system capable of the wildest extremes Pioneering heart research is done but a young man is transfused with incompatible blood until he nearly dies Artificial plastic lenses are implanted into eyes but a Muscovite who breaks his glasses cannot get new ones for months In medecine as in other areas of Soviet science the system seems unable to give its research discoveries grassroots application it has failed to make the best health care available to all but a small fraction of the population of 255 million Free medical service is one of a cluster of economic rights guaranteed under the new Constitution along with housing education jobs and other benefits that form the centerpiece of the Soviet definition of human rights Despite the eatensive network of hospitals local clinics end neighborhood doctors who will even make free house calls a Soviet citizens access to good hospitals knowledgeable specialists and required drugs is erratic Like comfortable housing red meat fresh fruit new cars attractive clothes good books and other commodities that are scarce here superior medical care often depends on rankwhich provides admittance to special clinicsor on what Russians call blata combination of personal connections favors and cash payments that take the patient beyond the formal system It is illegal in most Instances for doctors to charge feesIt is a violation of citizens rights said Dr Leonard I Rubanovich deputy director of the Health Ministrys Medical Departmentbut it is widespread practice that serves as a safety valve for the systems inefficiencies It rarely leads to prosecution Many pay just to have a choice to gain some sense of control over the care they receive instead of accepting the bureaucracys decisions In the hospital patients try to choose their surgeon a doctor explained They ask for the head surgeon of the department They try to get a professor My uncle paid 200 rubles [268] to a professor for a gall bladder operation on my aunt Barter is also common At a low level of surgery the doctor said we did not ask and as a rule we slid not receive money We received cognac wine Another physician Dr German Shapiro of Riga described an arrangement with a meat seller in the market There is no meat in the stores so he comes to me for treatment and my wife goes to him for meat Up to three times a week he added the meat was given without payment Dr Shapiro who discussed his experiences in an interview shortly before emigrating to Israel several months ago on the understanding that his name would not be used until after he left said that even the right to buy certain goods was cherished and traded He recalled trying in vain to buy typewriter ribbons in Riga For two months no ribbons he said When I had lost all hope I told an 18yearold salesgirl who had said she had no ribbons I am a physician and maybe sometime I can help you  She reached under the counter pulled out two ribbons and asked him to help her get a quick abortion he said Abortions are legal here up to 12 weeks but she had a special problem Her sisterinlaw worked in her neighborhood hospital and the salesgirl did not want her to know she was pregnant She had been trying for weeks to get the abortion else where Dr Shapiro related and she was almost too late so I bought two ribbons and I called my friend in another hospital and he did it for 10 rubles In some instances payment is a last resort to avoid improper treatment My father had a benign tumor of the prostate Dr Shapiro said One doctor told him it was cancer a second told him it was too late to operate a third said he must be castrated I had to bring him from Riga to Moscow to find two or three doctors I could trust I finally had to pay 150 rubles to a surgeon to perform the operation excellently Decent nursing care in hospitals is also sometimes for sale I sent my mother to the hospital with a bunch of oneruble bills a Muscovite related After her operation there was bleeding She wanted the sheets changed at least every two days Without one ruble a day she would have had new sheets only once a week For the bed pan you wait an hour or pay 150 rubles An American tourist who broke her hip and did not know she should bribe spent four days lying in her own excrement grossly mistreated and abused said a Western doctor who worked on the case Many Russians assume that a doctor who is paid will do his job better and the Government has even created a small chain of feecharging clinics to satisfy the urge to pay There is a bitter Russian saying Lechitsya darom darom lechitsya a play on words that translates roughly Treatment for free is treatment in vain Doctors tend to disagree Paying gets you a choice of a surgeon a physician explained but I do not think a surgeon will ever operate worse than he can The difference is that if he is paid he will see the patient 5 to 10 times afterward and get the newest imported drugs Shortages of drugs equipment and even current information plague the medical system and create a thriving black market Much of the modern spectrum of antibiotics and other medicines is simply not available in the Soviet Union said an American physician who has done extensive work here Stories are rampant about being given a prescription and not being able to fill it Drug stores will not call around as American stores do to find something they are out of he noted Diabetic patients sometimes die because of a lack of insulin Dr Shapiro said before he emigrated When I go to a patient with high blood pressure and I have no drugs to lower the blood pressure I do not know what to do Sometimes he added there is even a shortage of bandages Most ambulances in cities have doctors riding along on emergency calls One of them saying that he and his colleagues kept their own stocks of drugs beyond those officially issued pulled out a box marked Bensons English Toffee and lined with plastic foam It was filled with ampules of scarce but sometimes urgently needed medicines among them potassium an inexpensive commonly available substance in the United States They are obtained from wellplaced medical friends he saidin his case from the Fourth Department of the Health Mina wellequipped center for the highest party and government officials Just as patients need blat doctors expend great effort cultivating contacts with influence istry a euphemism for the Kremlin clinic in the supply of equipment and drugs Outside Moscow access to such items is even more restricted A young woman said that when her aunt was hospitalized in Kaunas Lithuania with a serious heart attack speculators brought drugs right into the hospital to sell According to Dr Shapiro drugstore clerks carrying bags of scarce medicines for sale often appeared in the Riga Polyclinic where he worked A pediatrician in Tbilisi complaining of insufficient streptomycin and penicillin and consequent epidemics of bacterial infections said that she and her colleagues often told patients how to buy the drugs on the black market and bring them back to the hospital for administration Three months ago an unusually frank analysis of equipment shortages was written by the Health Minister Dr Boris V Petrovsky and published in the labor newspaper Trud Only a few dozen of the 30000 clinics in the country have artificial kidney machines he said much Xray equipment is obsolete only 75 percent of the needed Xray film is being produced anesthetic equipment and artificial breathing machines are being manufactured in only  half the required amounts and surgical instruments are inadequate in quantity and quality Even such a basic tool as the thermometer is in short supply he complained Although 30 million are needed annually he wrote 236 million were produced in 1976 and this year 241 million are plannedmuch less than our order The problems roots are in economic priorities and organization he said Glass factories that make Xray film first fulfill orders for their own ministries and then if they have time and opportunity left they produce for us but as a rule time and opportunity are insufficient Economic planners generally cut the medical institutions orders for new technology in half Dr Petrovsky complained While this may stem from an honest effort to distribute resources equally he observed the special priority that peoples health deserves is overlooked Some 400 enterprises scattered through 30 fields of production manufacture medical equipment he noted suggesting that such plants be concentrated under the Health Ministrys jurisdiction Soviet health care is also troubled by the low prestige afforded doctors About 70 percent of them are women which many in the field insist reflects inferior status and relatively meager pay Accord ing to official figures doctors base pay runs from 105 to 140 rubles 140 to 187 a month with the average industrial and office wage at 151 rubles While the Government has spread its medical personnel into all corners of the countrythere are 334 doctors per 10000 populationtheir skill on the average has not impressed American doctors here on joint research The United States is engaged in a broad and fruitful series of exchange programs investigating heart disease cancer and the biological basis of schizophrenia Eye research where the Russians are reportedly ahead may soon he added to the exchange putting aside the upper crust of highly advanced scientists and surgeons most Soviet doctors are trained more as medical technicians without having the bookwork an American physician said Septic measures another remarked are very carelessly handledin the operating room the length of time a surgeon scrubs the frequent visitations of people coming in and out of the operating room to ask questions the overall aproach to keeping things undirty I would lot be treated by one of their physicians I would walk to Helsinki first In contrast another American surgeon doing research at a prestigious highly specialized institute expressed great admiration for the operating techniques facilities and hygiene It simply depends on where one is and this highlights another acute problem of the Soviet system rigid stratification A foreign woman having a miscarriage was admitted to Botkin Hospital one of Moscows best She had Rhnegative blood and needed the drug rhogam developed seven or eight years ago to block the formation of antibodies that would destroy the red blood cells of an Rhpositive child in a future pregnancy Botkin did not have rhogam and the consulting physicians were not even aware of its existence said a Russianspeaking Western doctor However at the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Moscow the countrys foremost teaching and reseerch facility in the field one of the professors was conversant with the whole history of rhogam was up on the latest developments and even had it available the doctor said in amazement Access to information as to equipment and drugs is dependent on rank and connections Theyre not aware of whats going on in their own country much less whats going on in America said an American biomedical scientist doing re search here Some of our delegation have to tell people in Leningrad whats going on in Moscow because theyre not aware The authoritarian nature of the political hierarchy is duplicated in smaller agencies and bureaucracies throughout science Young researchers must usually get permission from superiors for experiments and both Russians and Americans say they have seen this stifle potentially creative work A nowprominent surgeon remembers conservative professors resisting innovative techniques he was trying to develop they killed his research animals he said and had him transferred to a series of small distant cities The epitome of conservatism elitism and exclusivity is the Kremlin clinic As a result a surgeon explained highranking figures sometimes byptpass it in favor of lesser institutions whose medicine is less stodgy Thus it is that sovient czens from all stations of life shop around for their medical care sometimes with superb results sometimes with disastrous ones Im sure the cemeteries are full of mistakes said an American surgeon who has watched many operations here He added that the same could probably be said about any country
THE CLASS OF ‘77; ALL'S QUIET AT SCARSDALE HIGH,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/26/archives/the-class-of-77-alls-quiet-at-scarsdale-high-scarsdale.html,CSCARSDALE NY hris Douglass came to Scarsdale High School to teach English in the late 1960s right out of Harvard He remembers how it was then what students were like what he was like and how things have changed The first year I was here he said recently I taught Streetcar Named Desire The class was fascinated with the play and felt sorry for Blanche du Bois They would spend hours talking about how Stanley Kowalski represented the coarser inhumane kind of mentality of America a hundred years ago and how you could still find this kind of cruelty in our behavior in Vietnamall sorts of analogies This year he said he resumed teaching the Tennessee Williams play and as a kind of joke I stood up and said Blanche du Bois is the kind of woman who deserves what she got Her behavior clearly shows that she should have been abused I went through this whole list and showed all the things she did wrong There was a great silence No one said anything No one defended poor Blanche I had to spend the next two weeks trying to undo the damage of that first hour Mr Douglass said The class of 1977 at Scarsdale High School may not be uncaring but they do seem to care less  about Blanche about politics about each otherthan their older brothers and sisters As graduates last week of one of the nations most prestigious public schools they emerge into adulthood with a pragmatic approach to life that is sometimes a source of relief to their elders and sometimes a source of dismay Their teachers say they are motivated largely by the prospect of an uncertain job market They seem to he organizing t heir energies interests and time around what other people expect of them explains Mr Douglass They reflect a passivity conformity and materialism reminiscent of the 1950s the teachers report and observers of the educational scene say they are part of broad national trend For example National Association of Secondary School Principals concluded that quiet had settled over highschool campuses with students declaring that they are satisfied with their country families and schools It was only a few years ago recent graduates recall that Scarsdale students were boycotting grapes to support striking West Coast farm workers wearing black armbands at graduation to protest the Vietnam War handing out leaflets for a probusing schoolboard candidate and going on hunger strikes for Biafra They shared in the social upheavals of the 60s and raised sharp questions about the values of heir parents and their affluent community In 1969 the school achieved frontpage notoriety for a summersession course in guerrilla warfare Armed with water guns and waterfilled balloons students dressed as soldiers and peasants conducted war games in a local wooded area Running through the woods makes you feel that you know something about what the [Vietnam] war is like said one student of that era And another earned an A on a paper that suggested capturing the village of Scarsdale by spiking its water supply with LSD School officials were bitter over the unwanted publicity which they said exaggerated an experiment in education popular at the time They defended the course as relevant to todays world These days relevance is less fashionable Eric Rothschild a popular history teacher says he used to teach about the past by using analogies to current events Whenever I try it today I wind up having to explain the analogy It doesnt necessarily mean they dont care The best thing about this school is the kids The problem is that they will go home and read four hours for their homework but it wont occur to them to pick up the paper and try to really think seriously about whats going on because that has not been given to them to Instead of worrying about the large problems of society Scarsdale students seem to worry about the future in starkly practical terms Loretta Toscano darkhaired President of the Drama Club said I think everyone has turned inward  into the school perhaps into classwork Maybe its a matter of seeking independence in a different way think here the kids are interested in grades in striving for a goal and succeeding and just establishing a good life Were not as radical anymore think here kids want a good income good place in life Those desires can add up to an impressive level of motivation Mr Douglass asserts that the kids seem to get more out of the school than when began here in 6869 and he recalls that on seminar day when alumni returned to discuss their carreers  a girl in the ninth grade wanted to know the steps she had to go through for a certain specialty in medicine She announced that she was going to be married that she would have children and that she was going to be a specialist in medicine She said it very seriously and not a person laughed There are times however when motivation seems to get the better of values Mr Rothschild declares that I think there are a lot of really good kids here some great qualities but as he chats with a visitor he is interrupted twice by students coming in to ask about test grades  nut to question them in intellectual terms but to talk the teacher into revising them upward Its only been in the last two years that Ive had people coming in here to try to talk up scores he remarks Others make the rather disturbing observation that anomie appears to pervade personal conduct as well as attitudes toward study Some teachers sense an increased lack of consideration for others among students They fail to keep appointments the teachers complain and they fill up the town and school libraries with loud talk If they are brighter and more prepared to achieve the scholastic goals demanded of them they are also ready to go to greater lengths to do so There is definitely more cheating plagiarism and glibteacher remarked They have less group identity than their older brothers and sisters of a decade ago and they are prepared to criticize friends some teachers feel if it will make them appear more important to their peers One administrator said they have lost a sense of personal worth A teacher speaking of qualities he found admirable paused as a contradiction struck him They also seem so defeated now he said For years the butt of cartoonists playwrights and novelists as the stereotype of upperclass suburban living Scarsdale nevertheless is home to more than highpowered executives and stately matrons Labor leaders journalists politicians scientists educators artists and owners of small businesses as well as doctors dentists and lawyers can all be found within its six and a half square miles They live for the most part on quarteracre lots in homes built 40 to 50 years ago They earn 30000 to 540000  in many cases much more in some considerably less  participate with frightening intensity in civic and social organizations and show up in large numbers for Boy and Girl Scout dinners elementaryschool picnics class plays Memorial Day parades winter Sunday lectures and a popular adult school A good speaker will always pack a The village has one major industry residents say  education The school system has long been a major attraction and Scarsdale High is its flagship Built between 1917 and 1919 the traditionallooking red brick structure on the White Plains Post Road is surrounded by young firs and ancient willows spacious parking fields and well trimmed lawns tennis and platformtennis courts track and baseball facilities and a football field that has long boasted the support of parents and alumni many of whom eventually return to live in the village The teaching and learning that take place within the ivycovered walls rank with that of the best public schools in the country On scholastic aptitude tests in mathematics for example mean scores for Scarsdale students have ranged between 558 and 560 compared with the national range of 472 and 488 The curriculum is collegeoriented with honors courses in all major academic areas and advancedplacement courses in several subjects Graduates often complain that their first year of college includes much already covered in high school But the school also offers vocational electives such as auto mechanics bookkeeping and accounting business law architectural drawing stenography and clothing design For the students the demanding classwork only aggravates the anxieties they may feel over pressure to succeed from home and among their peers but in the current pragmatic atmosphere most are inclined to accept the situation While some have clear motivation others study without knowing why Senior Paul Silverstein one of New York States lop linemen and a likely starter at the University of Rhode Island said he messed up his sophomore and junior years because he did not attend class If you go to class teachers will help you out he said If you show an interest they will show an interest Otherwise not But I asked myself why should I work What will get out of it whats the purpose If you get a college degree what do you get for it Paul took eight major academic courses in his final year to catch I have a 32 average about Bplus beating my brains out The pressure is something I know a girl in the ninth grade and her dean has already asked her what college shes going to Shes 14 She doesnt know what she wants Im looking toward business working with people with numbers but other than that Im not really sure Some kids you wouldnt believe it The last thing they ever thought about was being a doctor or a lawyer When they got out of high school their parents pressured them into prelaw or premed They hated it but they stuck out They never went to law or med school however and now theyre stuck with this degree They sit hack and say why am I doing this why did I do this  This academic stress is compounded today by the emotional pressure some students experience perhaps even more so than in the 1960s Chris Douglass said he confers with one student by going outside to where I know he will he sitting alone or with friends He has particularly severe family problems There is usually a relationship in kids between their personal problems and their schoolwork Some drop out under really tremendous emotional pressures at home  divorce drinking fights  and the ones who give up just cant cope any longer The responses to academic pressure may recall the 50s but the 60s did leave some marks According to a recent survey by the school newspaper Maroon an estimated 63 percent of Scarsdale students have tried marijuana while 28 percent claimed to use it at least once a week The figure for regular use among Scarsdale seniors was 39 percent A nationwide survey of highschool seniors conducted in 1975 by the University of Michigans Institute for Social Research reported that 55 percent had tried illicit drugs while 30 percent had used them within the previous month In a parallel drinking survey at Scarsdale High half of those polled said they drink enough to get drunk among seniors the figure was 62 percent There was no indication of how often they did so however Students at Scarsdale under the influ ence of alcohol or in possession of marijuana are suspended for three days reported to the police and asked to join a conference with parents But here too todays procedures reflect the struggles of the past decade The American Civil Liberties Union publishes a pamphlet of student rights that kids know about and ask about says Paul Kelleher Scarsdales principal We have it available for them and I think it is an excellent thing Issues come up all the time around searches for example Sometimes we need to search a locker We do it infrequently but were usually right We need a witness and a suspicion that theres something ille The apparently elevated level of sexual activity is another clear legacy of social change in the 60s 1 know about a lot of sex but not about much pregnancy senior Dave Markowitz said But there is Loretta Toca no said sharply they did not know each other well and were talking about seniors in general in Mr Rothschilds office Do you know any girls who are pregnant Dave asked Sure she replied But I cant remember anyNidy dropping out he said That doesnt mean anything Loretta said There abortions Sexually active students represent a problem in many high schoolsif the 1744 pregnanaiming girls 19 years of and under in Westchester County in 1975 the last veal which such figures an available 979 terminated in abortion and rots in outofwedlock births The balance of girls were married A Scarsdale senior girl said Kids are very liberal here in their relations a lot of sex with a lot of guys The dating is not serious and they go from guy to guy after a couple of miinths 1 dont believe many people around here guys or girls are interested in saving themselves Were given a lot of health courses were taught a lot about it Being aware of all these contraceptive methods means well why nut We have all those methods and if theyre 100 percent safe what could he wrong about t hat Dave said So many people say everyone is doing it You know what your own family situation is  this is one thing you dont do  but there are so many contradicting views someone has to he right Loretta agreed It reflects on what you do and what you dont do Maybe thats why Im so aware of what kids do around here The turmoil of the 60s has also left its mark on academic routines and perhaps some of the current passivity reflects the fact that the confrontations of a decade ago resulted in significant gains for the students produced forums for grievances and established lines to challenge authority Compulsory study halls are gone and the open campus concept where juniors and seniors can leave the vicinity of the school if they have no class has arrived The dress code has all but disappeared Dean Elwood Woody Gray a counselor said The rule is roughly that you must wear shoes and not interfere with One teacher translated that as meaning the seethrough stuff is Out But just step out onto the Brewster Road lawns and see what theyre wearing  tight Tshirts tight jeans shorts cut right up to here he said slashing a finger across his rump The students evaluate their courses and their teachers and they exert influence in the development of electives An alternative school established in response to student doubts about the meaning of traditional educational methods continues to survive But ironically it has given up much of its early experimentation for a more structured approach It has become more conservative with a very complicated sophisticated and structured curriculum Mr Rothschild says They used to spend the first month recreating the wheel organizing learning from scratch deciding how they were going to do the year Then they sent some people out to learn how to make this fairly complicated schedule Now they have a secretary and even teach grammar He screws up his face in Attitudes toward the project also reveal changes in the times In the beginning it was a reflection of what students thought would be an important direction to go in says Chris Douglass shaking his head Now we hear kids referring to it as freakish They say that parents dont mind sending their daughters to the A school [as it is known] because theyre probably going to end up being married but they dont want to gamble on it for their sons No Scarsdale parent would admit to such sexist talk but Mr Rothschild rollment  45 girls and 24 boys It used to he evenly divided he says Administrators point out that collegebound seniors from the A school do just as well as those who took traditional courses if not better Mr Kelleher the rangy principal talks about student rights when asked about innovations that survive from the 60s For example student organizations here have places in the school they consider their own We had a problem with one earlier in the yearit was the drama group downstairs  involving marijuana and we closed it clown They went to the student senate got its support and we finally negotiated a compromise involving more supervision cleaning up the place and increased responsibility in general He offered another example with a less satisfactory conclusion Some students were making a film billing it as their senior class project Although we have such a course here they never got school approval or an adviser  it was sort of an underground film In fact it was quite a large project and very creative a remake of D W Griffiths Orphans of the Storm But now they wanted school support because they needed time off from class and more money for film I said they couldnt have it both ways that wouldnt now take responsibility for all the things they had done They gathered strength from other students elicited support from parents and one day I found myself negotiating with 10 kids and a lawyer one of the parents He said he was only a father but he acted as their advocate Well the final answer was no and one Friday afternoon there was a small group of them chanting outside my office Shades of the fins Similarly the senior class sought to change last weeks graduation program by having the school remove the separate list of students who had won honors preferring instead that they he included in the general listing They raised a valid point Mr Kelleher said arguing that this encouraged competition while graduation day should emphasize unity The administration wanted to maintain the names however saying that if the school rewarded students for achievements in sports music and other areas it should continue the only major acknowledgment of straight We suggested that asterisks designate the honor students in an alphabetical listing but they went to the Board of Education They knew where the power was Of course I lobbied the board in advance the principal said and it ended up saying it would go along with what decided Essentially the hoard has to do that The awareness of opportunities for women also has changed markedly in the past few years The school has a Womans Studies Program that is reasonably popular today but a recent graduate recalls with some bitterness the contempt she felt from other students when she became active in its first year The increasing awareness of young women has been noted by teachers Jessie Furey a mathematics teacher said If I give an example lets say of a scientist doing a problem and I he is using a particular setup I will hear a few voices say he  Eric Rothschild has a sheet titled Sexist Statements by Mr Rothschild on his office wall a gift of two sophomores When I found they were looking for my language I used it as a teaching device to make them listen and once a day Id say something that was really awful to keep them interested He wrote across the top of one of their final papers Really superior work and for a girl you did well  Some see the greater acceptance of women on all levels as having contributed to the return of cheerleaders who were regarded as a joke in the I 90s Theyre taken quite seriously Mr Kelleher said He recalled being stunned when a senior breakfast began with some spirited work by uniformed cheerleaders The crowd loved it I think it was a hit tongueincheek by both sides but the feeling is hack We have pep rallies again bonfires the night before a football game that sort of thing The ordeal of applying to colleges tends to focus as much as anything the 1970s anxieties about academic pressure and success Next fall more than 90 percent of the class of 1977 will go off to college a percentage that hasnt changed much over the years Valerie Kindred who has danced 20 hours a week for 10 years will go to Middlebury College She was also accepted by Colgate waitlisted by Dartmouth and Brown and rejected by Princeton despite a straight A average and a full complement of other activities Scarsdale had a real problem this year with Ivy League schools she said A lot of us applied and a lot were rejected We had trouble with safeties [secondary choices considered safe because the college says Oh thats Scarsdale Were just a safety Or the good college says Oh well theyre from Scarsdale Theyll get accepted somewhere else And kids here are seen as the same as everyone else here Were I felt I worked extremely well in high school Valerie sand with good grades dance and so forth I felt I should have had a choice Its a letdown to get a nice letter from Princeton saying youre an excellent applicant but we cant accept you You want to say Whats it for

secular Israelis who foresee churchstate strife ahead as the religious bloc extracts the price for its support the new regime The conflict between secular and religious Jews in Israel has been an issue since the state was founded in 1948 In recent years it has simmered just below the surface of the nations military concerns large measure because the preceding Labor Party Government deliberately muted it This conflict now seems destined for a noisy airing as the Likud Government starts its rule after 29 years as the main opposition bloc In return for their support Mr Begin has conceded the following to the religious bloc  Zevulon Hammer a member of the National Religious Party was made Minister of Education a post the party has long sought and finally obtained because Mr Begin neded the 12 seats in Parliament the party won in the May 17 general election The religious parties have long decried the secularization of Israeli public schools and have called for a return to traditional religious values Mr Hammer has asked to be judged by his deeds not by my skullcap in his new post  Mr Begin acceded to the religious blocs demands that women who wish to be exempt from the compulsory draft be able to receive an exemption merely by swearing in a notarized staement that their religious scruples prevent their serving At present a panel screens such applicants on their religious knowledge This concession has raised the specter of widespread abuses has been criticized as contributing to the Israeli militarys chronic need for manpower and has resulted in demands that the service of women be made voluntary not mandatory  A series of demands made by the religious groups were agreed upon including revision of a recently passed law permitting abortions that will all but scuttle it tightening up on permits permitting work on theJewish sabbath curbing of routine autopsies Autopsies are forbidden under Orthodox law  In addition it was agreed to try for an amendment to the socalled law of return to require that Jew be defined according to Orthodox Jewish law If such an amendment comes to pass it will certainly anger many Jews outside of Israel particularly Reform and Conservative Jews in America who are heavy contributors to the State of Israel In the parliamentary debate which preceded the vote of confidence in the new Government the vanquished Labor Partys leader Shimon Peres warned that the new Government was certain to bring about internal and external antipathy At least for now there is an attitude among the general population of wait and see regarding Mr Begin and in his first days of office a sympathy can be detected for him because all during the years he was in the opposition he remained steadfast in his principles This steadfastness may be a stumbling block when Mr Begin has to deal with the Americans the Arabs and the many social and economic concerns facing Israel He is Prime Minister today in large measure because his party attracted so many of the nations socalled Oriental Jews those from Yemen Iraq and North Africa as well as young voters and residents of development towns The blue collar vote went heavily for his party largely because it was fed up with a Labor Party hierarchy that was paying them lip service but little else Now these voters the lower middle class and the poor are preparing to face the consequences of their ballot as the Likud starts trying to implement its economic policy The Likud platform favors compulsory arbitration in jobs involving essential services emphasizes the need for strengthening the private sector of the economy and calls for a regulated system of unemployment as a means of stemming inflation a controversial position in a nation that is still fostering immigration Some of those blue collar voters may sour in the months ahead if Mr Begin pushes these policies successfully Last week Israels huge general labor federation the Histadrut an amalgam of management and labor that is the largest entity in the Israeli economy held elections The Labor Party again emerged predominant despite a Likud effort to increase its strength There were indications that as many as 200000 federation members who voted Likud in the general election decided to vote Labor in the Histadrut race where the word went out that the Likud economic policies would hurt the working man Labors retention of its role as head of the Histadrut means Mr Begin will face formidable obstacles as he deals with the countrys stagnant economy Mr Begin a hardliner who opposes the return of the West Bank Arab lands in peace talks because he says they are part of the biblical Jewish homeland goes to Washington to meet President Carter on July 18 Many Israelis believe that if Washington pressures Mr Begin too much the effect could be to enhance rather than dilute his leadership because many opponents would rally around him at least temporarily on an issue so critical to the countrys future There is conjecture already in this highly political country about how long Mr Begins Government can last No one really knows because they do not know how the new Prime Minister will act now that he is in charge and no longer the carping leader of the opposition William E Farrell is a correspondent for The New York Times based in Jerusalem That his present majority is fragile is evident Theoretically it could be brought down by 12 venerable Talmudic scholars called the Council of Sages The ultraOrthodox council permitted Agudat Israel which controls four seats to enter Mr Begins Government but not to accept Cabinet posts because the ministers would then be responsible for some of the countrys secular norms such as television on the sabbath If for some reason the council ordered Agudat Israel out of the Government the party would defect since the sages rulings are unquestioned That would leave Mr Begin with 59 seats two short of the bare minimum needed to govern as a majority

Supreme Court Ruling Sparks Moves to Halt Medicaid Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/27/archives/supreme-court-ruling-sparks-moves-to-halt-medicaid-abortions.html,A 20yearold woman sat in a St Louis clinic the other day holding her ticket for abortionan orange welfare card Where would I get the money to pay she said Like many of the 300000 women who receive Medicaid abortions every year this woman is black and already a mother Her baby stays with relatives she said while she goes to college so I wont have to be on welfare for the rest of my life As she spoke government officials in Missouri and in several other states including Connecticut Pennsylvania and New Jersey but not New Yorkwere moving to halt state financing of elective abortions either by reinstituting laws that had been nullified by the courts or by changing state policies The Supreme Court cleared the way for this action last week when it ruled that states are not required to spend Medicaid money for elective or nontherapeutic abortions The ruling also appeared to clear any constitutional barriers to Congressional passage of legislation to ban Federal funds for abortions Such legislation has already passed the House of Representatives It is expected to go to the Senate floor today Abortion advocates as well as groups concerned with the rights of women and minorities have decried the Supreme Courts decision as unfair to poor women in view of the Courts 1973 Iandmark that women had a constitutional right to abortion Now they are lobbying hard against the bill to cut off Federal funds for abortions the Labor HEW Appropriations Bill Calling defeat of the bill our last recourse Ellen McGovern of the National Womens Political Caucus said Clearly the states have the power to decide whether poor women have to pay Its up to Congress now to act responsibly She and other feminists related conservative attitudes on abortion to a backlash against womens issues in Washington and around the country White men see women and minorities as a threat Miss McGovern said AntiAbortion Victory Antiabortion groups who have hailed the Supreme Court decision as a victory in their fight to limit the Courts 1973 ruling legalizing abortion were waging a battle for passage of the appropriations bill Prospects for passage are excellent Dr Mildred F Jefferson president of the National Right to Life Committee said The cruel and inhumane use of public funds which are being used to get rid of the poor and yet make the poor think it was a benefit simply cannot be tolerated In any event the welfare mother in St Louis has since had her abortion It was performed at the Reproductive Health Services clinic there not a public hospital In another ruling last week stemming from a St Louis case the Supreme Court said public hospitals are not required to provide or even permit elective abortions Accordingly Mayor James F Con way of St Louis has banned all elective abortions at city hospitals even those for women who can pay And Supervisor Gene McNary of St Louis County has ordered the county to suspend its program of referring indigent women to abortion clinics Its unfair said the woman in the St Louis clinic If people cant get it off Medicaid some will go the back alley Such predictions were heard over and over in recent days as word of the Courts decision on state funds and the Congressional proposal on Federal funds came home to the abortion clinics It is at these clinics that 60 percent of the countrys 11 million legal abortions are performed each year according to a recent survey by Planned Parenthoods Alan Guttmacher Institute By comparison 29 percent of abortions are done in private hospitals 8 percent in public hospitals and 3 percent in doctors offices Judith Widdicomb president of the National Abortion Federation a 100 member umbrella organization of facilities providing abortions said members are being asked to continue to accept welfare patients for a minimum of four more weeksjust as though nothing had happened We have got to mobilize the silent majority in this country who assume that because the Supreme Court said a woman could get an abortion that she could get one If shes a poor women she may not be able to get one now The average abortion is somewhere between 150 and 200 At the St Louis clinic for example the rate schedule ranges from zero to S170 depending on the patients ability to pay In the past the state has paid 75 for welfare cases How will the clinics the prime providers of abortion continue to meet the needs of poor women if they are not reimbursed by public funds Certainly as one director put it the clinic cant pick up the slack for the 300000 abortions that were paid for last year by Medicaid Thats 50 million There isnt that much charity to be dished out But there will be some charity In Houston a PIanned Parenthood official named John Wyly said I can assure you that Planned Parenthood locally and nationally will remain committed to the right of all women regardless of their economic situation to choose for themselves how to handle a pregnancy Among the solutions to the possible fund cutoff problem being discussed by Planned Parenthood were longterm lowinterest loans special clinic programs to generate a surplus income to subsidize abortions for the poor and fund drives In Salt Lake City Sandra Bagley of the Utah Womens Clinic which performs most of the states abortions said her facility would adopt a payasyoucan policy for lowincome patients with free abortions for the destitute Equally firm assurances came from New York City where 35000 Medicaid abortions are performed every year At Parkmed a clinic that provides more than 15000 abortions annually 25 percent cf them financed through Medicaid there is talk of a reduced rate for such patients if the funds are cut off But money is not the only problem as Dr Milton Danon executive director of Parkmed explained There are a certain number of poor patients who would probably pay and there are a certain number of others I guess we wont hear from until they come to the city hospitals to have their babies That according to Planned Paienthood officials is the tragic flaw in the argument that welfare abortions should not be financed because they cost the taxpayers too much money Welfare babies cost much more money According to the latest HEW estimates maternity costs for a welfare mother plus pediatric fees for her babys first year plus public assistance funds from Federal state and local governments add up to 2200 Said Alfred Moran executive vice president of Planned Parenthood This puts the state in a position of having a public policy of telling poor women We prefer you to have that baby Were prepared to pay the costs no matter what those costs are It also puts the states in a position of fiscal insanity If the flow of Medicaid money is cut off however Mrs Widdicombe of the National Abortion Federation predicted that some small clinics would have to close their doors that others would have to raise their rates for paying patients and that still others would be forced to curtail auxiliary service such as counseling Carol Downer founder of the Feminist Womens Health Center in Los Angeles agreed The private sector will have to absorb more of the patients who were previously served by public hospitals that accepted Medicaid funds she said Many private clinics will go out of business because they wont be able to offer lowcost abortions The clinic cant pick up the slack for the 300000 abortions that were paid for last year by Medicaid Thats 50 million
Carey Planning to Sign State Ban On Topless Entertainment in Bars,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/28/archives/carey-planning-to-sign-state-ban-on-topless-entertainment-in-bars.html,ALBANY June 27Governor Carey with a blast at garish smutty and filthy entertainment that has no place in New York City said today he would sign a bill to ban topless entertainment in bars licensed by the State Liquor Authority Its a bill against dirt the Governor declared at his weekly news conference He said he thought the bill would withstand an expected constitutional challenge It safeguards the public from what is not entertainment something that has no redeeming social value he said What about those who do not want to be safeguarded from topless dancers he was asked If you want all that you go to San Francisco Mr Carey replied On other questions raised at the news conference the Governor said he would veto any bill to legalize use of the controversial drug laetrile [Page 18] He also said he would oppose any attempt to cut off the use of state Medicaid funds to pay for abortions The United States Supreme Court ruled last week that states were not required to spend Medicaid money for elective abortions and bills have already been introduced here to ban the spending of such funds Stressing that I do not believe in abortion Mr Carey nonetheless said that as long as abortion is legal he would oppose a Medicaid ban because the net effect is to force those who feel they must have an abortion into the hands of the alley practitioners or those who would inflict damage upon the body of a woman Mr Careys position is consistent with his earlier stands on legislative attempts to restrict access to abortion A year ago he vetoed a bill that would have required teenaged girls to get their parents consent before having an abortion In his veto message Mr Carey said that requirement would impose a cruel and intolerable burden on young girls who lack a secure home and could not as a practical matter get their parents consent The bill to ban topless entertainment was passed overwhelmingly by both houses of the Legislature on June 6 It is an amendment to the states Alcohol Beverage Control law directing the State Liquor Authority to take administrative action against violators by either suspending or revoking their liquor licenses The sponsors Senator Frank Padavan and Assemblyman John A Esposito both Queens Republicans gave the bill an administrative rather than a criminal sanction in an effort to help it withstand the constitutional challenge it will almost certainly face once it goes into effect 30 days after the Governors signature The courts have handled similar cases an contradictory fashion but generally have been more tolerant of antipornography laws that do not impose criminal penalties The State Liquor Authority itself had decided against banning topless enter tainment in 1975 when it put into effect a ban on bottomless entertainment Topless waitresses have long been prohibited under SLA rules Last week four of the five SLA cornmissioners voted to ask Governor Carey to sign the bill The Liquor Authoritys chairman Michael Roth said today that the authority was prepared to enforce the new law but he noted that he had only 85 investigators for the entire state He said there were probably hundreds of bars featuring topless entertainment According to an estimate by Sidney Baumgarten head of the Midtown Task Force in New York City there are perhaps 30 to 35 bars in midtown New York with topless entertainment Such bars he said constitute a small part of the sex business at least in that area The bill applies to bars cabarets and dinner theaters where patrons watch topless entertainment while drinking It does not apply to legitimate theaters which are licensed to serve liquor at bars out of view of the stage During his news conference the Governor also did the following Said he planned to appoint James Larocca a lawyer who now heads the states Federal Affairs Office in Washington as commissioner of the State Energy Office That office has been without a top executive since it was created last summer Indicated a willingness to bargain with the Republicans on their new nofault insurance bill but said he strongly opposed as inadequate the provision that would increase the threshold of medical costs needed to file a lawsuit from 500 to 1500 Hinted that he would support 10 million or 12 million worth of tax breaks for industries that created jobs The Legislature has been pushing for a jobincentive program worth up to 90 million linked to the increase the Governor wants in unemployment and workmens compensation benefits Motorcycle Death on Garden State BLOOMFIELD NJ June 27 AP  A Paterson man has become

MAJOR LOSSES CITED INHUGHESOPERATIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/28/archives/major-losses-cited-in-hughes-operations-131-million-decline.html,In the last six years of Howard R Hughess life the Summa Corporation his holding company with three of his longtime employees in firm control lost 131799000 according to an affidavit by a Hughes tax lawyer filed in Chancery Court in Wilmington Del The tabulations by Milton H West a Houston lawyer who has done the Hughes tax work for many years were filed in connection with a case involving control of Summa Mr West named Chester C Davis chief counsel F W Gay president and Nadine Henley senior vice president as the controlling group of Summa during those years They are also in control of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute of Miami in whose name the Delaware litigation was filed The import of Mr Wests declaration was to show that the three Summa officers were responsible for heavy losses that created a difficult position for management that took over after Mr Hughes died on April 5 1976 The statement by Mr West a partner in Andrews Kurth Campbell  Jones of Houston supports his former partner William Rice Lummis the Hughes cousin who left the law firm in May 1976 to become the top authority in Summa by virtue of an order of the Delaware Chancery Court Mr West was placed on the Summa board by Mr Lummis last year Mr Lummis is the leader of a large group of maternal cousins of the late Mr Hughes who will inherit about 47 percent of the Hughes estate if no valid will is found His mother Annette Gano Lummis who is 87 years old is the aunt and closest surviving relative of the late reclusive industrialist She stands to get about 23 percent of the Hughes estate if no will is verified Paternal cousins would get about 30 percent A month ago Mr Lummis dismissed Mr Davis a New York lawyer from the Summa board although he allowed him to remain as chief counsel of the company a position that pays Mr Davis a retainer of 100000 a year according to the West affidavit 1971 a Significant Year Mr Davis responded with a petition to the Chancery Court to limit Mr Lummiss authority and to order that Mr Davis be restored to the Summa board Chancellor William Marvel heard arguments on that petition on June 17 and is expected to rule within the next week before the Hughes Federal estate tax return falls due on July 5 Mr Daviss petition was based on the assertion that the Howard Hughes Medical institute might be the beneficiary of an unfound Hughes will and that Mr Lummis was dissipating Summa assets to raise cash to pay taxes that would not he due if the will was found Mr Davis also argued that Mr Lummis as leader of the intestate heirs had a position that conflicted with the best interest of Summa as a continuing business In the tangle of the Hughes affairs 1971 is significant It was at the end of 1970 that Mr Hughes left Las Vegas Nev and moved to Paradise Island at Nassau the Bahamas At that time he discharged Robert A Maheu who had been his Nevada operations manager and negotiator as Mr Hughes bought five hotels and seven casinos from 1966 to 1970 Mr Maheu refused to believe that Mr Hughes had discharged him but the clinching evidence produced in a stormy court hearing in Las Vegas in December 1970 was a dramatic memorandum written on a yellow legal pad and addressed to Dear Chester and Bill in which Mr Hughes set down his wish that Mr Maheu turn affairs over to Mr Davis and Mr Gay So Mr Wests report of losses for 1971 through the first nine months of 1976 had the special significance of covering Mr Gays and Mr Daviss period of control The losses reported by Mr West were the following 1971 40574000 1972 21834000 1973 15228000 1974 2005000 1975 29692000 1976 nine months 22466000 Earlier Experience Recalled Reached by telephone in Las Vegas Mr Maheu said he had no figures on the operating experience of the hotels and casinos during his years in charge but that he thought the worst year was a loss of 17 million which he attributed to the purchase of casino properties that had outstanding losses A spokesman for Summa said that Mr Gay was unavailable for comment Mr West said in his affidavit that despite such losses as he listed Mr Gay was paid 400680 in 1975 and 360523 in 1976 Bonuses for the respective years were 188583 and 108582 Mr West said He said that during the years of losses in the Hughes operations the major competitors in Las Vegasthe Webb Corporation Caesars World MetroGoldwynMayer Hilton Hotels Inc Golden Nugget Inc and Showboat Incall made money every year One of the basic conflicts with Mr Davis it appears from his petitions filed in May was over plans to liquidate certain assets None of these was named but Las Vegas sources have said Summa is trying to sell the Landmark Hotel The administrators of the Hughes estate are confronted with the task of raising large sums to defray claims against the estate including private claims including those of government for both income and death taxes with an ailing business and nonrelated nonliquid assets as the only source thereof Mr West said At issue in all this is an estate which has been appraised at a low value of about 168 million and at a high range of about 1 billion If there is no will Federal and state estate taxes will take about 77 percent of it and what is left will be divided under the terms of an already signed agreement between all known relatives If a will is found leaving it to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Mr Davis 66 and Mr Gay 56 as directors and Miss Henley 70 as secretary treasurer a longtime Hughes associate will come into control and no estate taxes will he owed because the Institute is a taxexempt foundation

MEDICAID IS BANNED IN SOME ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/28/archives/medicaid-is-banned-in-some-abortions-judge-allows-jersey-law-to-bar.html,TRENTON June 27A Federal District Court judge ruled today that an 18monthold New Jersey law barring the payment of Medicaid funds for elective abortions could go into effect pending a final hearing next month Judge George H Barlow lifting an injunction that he had imposed on the law in March 1976 contended that constitutional challenges to the statute had little chance of succeeding in light of rulings by the United States Supreme Court last Monday The Supreme Court held 6 to 3 in cases in Connecticut Pennsylvania and Missouri cases that neither the Constitution nor existing Federal law required states to spend public Medicaid funds for abortions that were not considered essential to the protection of the mothers life The New Jersery State Attorney General William F Hyland promptly moved for a summary judgment that would lift the temporary injunction and enable New Jerseys law to go into effect immediately Judge Barlow has set July 18 for formal arguments on Mr Hylands motion for dismissal of the temporary injunction that had been obtained in 1976 by the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union Appeal Expected The organization had challenged the constitutionality of the law signed by Governor Byrne on Dec 18 1975 in a class suit representing unidentified indigent pregnant women and their physicians or others who regularly provided abortion services to the poor Marian B Copeland a cooperating lawyer for the state chapter who has handled the case for the plaintiffs said Judge Barlows decision today would probably be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia Representing the state Erminie L Conley deputy attorney general said that funds that might have been used for elective or nontherapeutic abortions had not been cut off but that study was being given to the method of giving notice The state ACLU challenge filed against the New Jersey law on Jan 16 1976 contended that the law violated both the Constitution and medical assistance provisions of the Federal Social Security Act The Supreme Court meanwhile is considering the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment to the Appropriations Bill passed by both the House and the Senate that would limit Medicaid payment for abortions considered necessary to save the mothers life Legal observers here consider it probable that the high court will also eventually uphold the Hyde Amendment further diminishing the likelihood of success for the ACLU challenge of the New Jersey law The New Jersey Right to Life Committee meanwhile hailed Judge Barlows ruling as a victory Chris Smith executive director of the committee said however that the organization supported constructive and progressive solutions for distressful pregnancies Ann Klein State Human Services Commissioner proposed that private agencies provide funds to enable poor women to exercise their constitutional rights to terminate an unwanted pregnancy Meanwhile the United States Supreme Court refused today to review a decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court last November that nonprofit nonsectarian hospitals could not prohibit the use of their facilities for abortions The high courts action left the New Jersey ruling in effect The ruling involved the Bridgeton Hospital Association in Bridgeton the Newcomb Hospital in Vineland and the Salem County Memorial Hospital in Salem
SWISS VOTERS TO DECIDE ON ALLOWING ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/28/archives/swiss-voters-to-decide-on-allowing-abortions.html,GENEVA June 27  After three years of acrimonious debate the Swiss Parliament has passed a bill that would permit abortions for other than medical reasons But it is to go into effect only if a proposal to allow abortions freely within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is defeated in a referendum that had been previously scheduled for Sept 25 During the years of debate the required 50000 signatures for a referendum on the 12week proposal were obtained by the Swiss Union for the Decriminalization of Abortions Under the Swiss system before a referendum is held the Government must offer a substitute proposal for approval by Parliament and then place it on the ballot next to the propsal of the referendums sponsors With the legislators unable to agree Parliament decided on May 5 to leave the question to the voters Last Friday however legislation allowing a certified social worker to authorize an abortion if convinced that the pregnant woman would otherwise suffer grave distress was passed If the 12week rule is defeated in September both proand antiabortion groups are expected to press for a second referendum to kill the new law
Kitchen‐Table Justice,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/28/archives/kitchentable-justice.html,If youre a pregnant woman with enough money to pay for an abortion in a hospital youve got an ironclad constitutional right to have that abortion If youre a pregnant woman without enough money to pay for an abortion in a hospital youve got an ironclad constitutional right either to beg or borrow the money or to have yourself butchered on a kitchen table off some back alley So ruled the Supreme Court of the United States last week in an opinion consonant with the views of the Carter Administration and to which Congress seems about to give further legislative force Thus with the support of all three branches of government triumph inequity poverty misery the welfare culture and the billions of tax dollars it annually consumes The first step down this strange course was taken by Congress last year when it adopted a ban on the use of Medicaid funds for elective abortions those not undertaken for therapeutic reasons A Federal court acting on what it and everyone else thought was the Supreme Courts guarantee of the right to an abortion in a 1973 decision set aside enforcement of this ban until its constitutionality could be tested Enter the Carter Administration in the person of Secretary of Health Education and Welfare Joseph A Califano He said he would not support the use of Federal funds for abortions and President Carter backed him up Possibly owing to that encouragement this year the House of Representatives went even further than Congress had last year it passed a ban on the use of Medicaid funds for any kind of abortion even to save the life of a mother At that point last week the Supreme Court acted on cases from Connecticut and Pennsylvania ruling that a the constitutional guarantee of the equal protection of the laws was not violated by a state decision to use Medicaid funds for childbirth but not for abortions and b it was not unreasonable for a state to pursue its valid and important interest in encouraging childbirth by refusing to pay for abortions The next day the Senate Appropriations Committee approved the House ban on Medicaid abortions but amended it to permit therapeutic abortions required by threats to the physical wellbeing of the mother or the child after birth or both This provision which apparently is about all that can be hoped for in the Senate coincides with the Supreme Court ruling in that it guarantees affluent or middleclass women the right to abortions on demand while preventing the use of Government funds to pay for elective abortions for women who cannot otherwise pay for them The latter must either have their babies at even greater cost to the taxpayers or seek out some flybynight amateur for a kitchentable abortion Aside from a persons moral and ethical views on the larger question of abortion the situation wrought by Court and Congress is insupportable It plainly discriminates against a class since a right guaranteed to the rich is denied in practice to the poor That discrimination will be most often felt by black women in the city ghettos those very welfare mothers against whom the righteous wrath of the comfortable and the calloused is so often directed And what conceivable valid and important interest can cities like New York and Detroit have in encouraging more welfare mothers and more welfare children more poverty and hunger and disease and drug addiction in the ghettos more unemployed on the corners more crime in the streets more flight of the middle class to the suburbs The real questions here are not of morality or religion or ethics If the case could be made against legal abortion for anyone that would be at least equitable among women although long step backward for them all But to make the poor alone ineligible for abortions defies justice common sense rational policy and the Federal budget As Senator Edward Brooke of Massachusetts put it the ban on Medicaid funds for abortions is nothing but means test saying whos allowed to have an abortion And as Mr Jus tice Harry Blackmun in dissent chided his colleagues There is another world out there the existence of which the Court I suspect either chooses to ignore or fears to recognize And so the cancer of poverty will continue to grow IN THE NATION The figures that support him are as depressing as they are impressive Medicaid funds have paid for abortions for as many as 300000 women a year at a total cost of 50 million Sixty percent of the nations 11 million abortions a year are performed in clinics for the poorand only 29 percent in those private hospitals in which the Supreme Court absolutely guarantees the right of a woman who can afford it to an abortion on demand

Senate Votes to Block Carter From Forcing Schools to Bus Their Pupils,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/29/archives/senate-votes-to-block-carter-from-forcing-schools-to-bus-their.html,WASHINGTON June 28The Senate tonight passed legislation intended to block the Carter Administration from forcing school districts to bus pupils to achieve school desegregation The measure approved 51 to 42 would prohibit the Administration from withholding Federal funds from school districts that refused to merge black and white schools if the plan required students to be bused to a new school The provision was considered as part of a 606 billion appropriation bill for the Department of Labor and the Department of Health Education and Welfare The Senate faces a long dispute on abortion before it completes action on the measure Brooke Attacks Proposal The bill is among the measures President Carter has threatened to veto because the Senate Appropriations Committee increased spending for health and education by nearly 2 billion over his recommendations However the panel reestimated spending for welfare and Medicaid to keep the total close to his figures The busing provision was similar to a provision included by the House in its 613 billion version of this appropriation bill But Senator Edward W Brooke Republican of Massachusetts argued that it should be eliminated He contended that the amendment would amount to dismantling of Federal desegregation efforts His view was challenged by Senator Thomas F Eagleton Democrat of Missouri who told the Senate that bigcity busing will be completely counterproductive and would increase minority dominance of school systems in cities like Kansas City Mo and Chicago Largescale busing he argued will lead ultimately to less rather than more integration Senator Robert Morgan Democrat of North Carolina supported Mr Brookes effort to eliminate the antibusing provision saying that it would only relieve the burden north of the MasonDixon line and keep the South busing until kingdom come And Senator Jacob K Javits Republican of New York called the antibusing amendment a rearguard action against common human decency If senators supported Mr Carter on human rights abroad they should oppose the rider and be an example for the world he said But Senator Eagleton and Senator Joseph R Biden Jr Democrat of Delaware the coauthors of the Senate antibusing provision contended it was necessary because the department had used the school pairing device as a way to get around an antibusing provision written into last years appropriation bill Their amendment would close the loophole they argued Thirty Democrats and 21 Republicans voted for the antibusing amendment with 28 Democrats and 14 Republicans opposed All six Senators from New York New Jersey and Connecticut voted against it An attempt to return to last years less sweeping language was tabled on a 47to43 vote Before the busing vote the Senate decisively rejected an effort to bar the department from employing any timetable goal ratio quota or other numerical requirement related to race creed color national origin or sex Senator S I Hayakawa Republican of California proposed the amendment which matched language in the House version of the bill He said that affirmative action programs encouraged by the Government were damaging American education Mr Brooke contended that the amendment would set race relations back 25 years The amendment lost 31 to 64 All New York New Jersey and Connecticut Senators voted against it An even more onesided vote barred an attempt by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina to stop HEW from keeping records on race The proposal lost 26 to 64 Debate about the overall spending levels in the bill sputtered throughout the day Senator William Proxmire Democrat of Wisconsin said that it was time to begin paring wasteful programs and urged a cut of 12 billion or 13 billion by restricting spending to no more than any request by Mr Carter But Senator Warren G Magnuson Democrat of Washington who is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that handled the bill said that the spending would come down considerably in conference with the House and argued that Congress should not abdicate its responsibilities to Mr Carter The Proxmire amendment lost 62 to 32 with 14 Democrats and 18 Republicans supporting it An additional 18 Republicans opposed it as did 44 Democrats Mr Brooke and Mr Magnuson repeatedly reminded their colleagues that the bill was below the Congressional budget ceiling and contended that their reduced estimates for welfare Medicaid and aid to the aged blind and disabled18 billion below Mr Carterswere supported by the Congressional Budget Office and would be accepted soon by the Administration But after Mr Magnuson and Mr Eagleton agreed that there had been rumbles of a possible veto they agreed to cut 65 million from the aid to the disadvantaged in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and 325 million from aid to school districts with high concentrations of children of Federal employees a program that Mr Carter wanted to eliminate entirely
Tough Death‐Penalty Bill Passed By Big Margin in Albany Assembly,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/29/archives/tough-deathpenalty-bill-passed-by-big-margin-in-albany-assembly.html,1ALBANY June 28The Assembly passed overwhelmingly late tonight the tough new deathpenalty bill it created last week with an unusual amendment on the floor The vote was 91 to 50 The bill passed after more than four hours of often emotional debate would extend capital punishment for all premeditated murders and for virtually all killings committed in conjunction with another crime Supporters of the bill argued that it was a necessary deterrent to stem a rapidly rising crime rate Opponents said the bill would not deter crime and in some cases might encourage murder by spurring the suicidal on in the hope of receiving the death penalty The measure now goes to the Senate where it will face some but perhaps not unsurmountable opposition It faces a certain veto however by Governor Carey who has said he would veto any death penalty bill During the debate tonight supporters countered arguments that the death penalty was too final a punishment by calling for consideration of the victims I hope that were thinking of the thousands of elderly that are being killed said Assemblywoman Gerdie Lipschutz DemocratLiberal of Rockaway Park Queens Opposing the bill Edward F X Ryan Democrat of Weschester County said he found it curious that the death penalty was the only situation where society took the eyeforaneye and the toothforatooth type of revenge Knifing Penalty I think wed be embarrassed Mr Ryan said to take a knife to someone convicted of a knifing Approval of the bill tonight was expected although the amendment last week was a surprise extension of the relatively limited capitalpunishment measure that had passed the State Senate The Assembly move last week was unexpected because one of the arguments put forward in the Republicancontrolled Senate had been that a tough mesure would have no chance in the Democratcontrolled Assembly Let the word go forth to that chamber down the hall that the Assembly is in favor of a tough law said Vincent J Graber a Democrat of West Seneca a Buffalo suburb in explaining the obvious change in the Assemblys mood on capital punishment as he opened the debate tonight Mr Graber last week had introduced the milder Senate bill in the Assembly on the ground that it was the only one that could succeed After last weeks 88to44 vote pn the toughening amendment that proved him wrong he quickly changed his support to the stronger measure Some observers say it was easy for members of the Assembly to vote for the stronger measure because while the vote would satisfy strong constituent pressure to do something about crime the vote really would not enact a tough death penalty because the Governors veto would prevent the bill from becoming law Although supporters of the tough measure confidently predict passage in the Legislature there is little expectation a veto could be overridden The new capitalpunishment legislation is an attempt to keep at least part of the death penalty intact in the face of increasing Constitutional challenges by the United States Supreme Court Special Juries Provided To meet the High Courts objections to deathpenalty statutes that did not take mitigating factors into account the measure passed by the Senate would require that a special jury be convened after a conviction to make certain that all factors had been considered The law currently on the books in New York State allows the death penalty only for the killing of police officers and correctional workers and murders committed by convicts under life sentence Proceeding cautiously the Senate added only three limited categories to that listhired assassins and those who killed a witness in a criminal case or who committed murder during a kidnapping Backers of the Senate version conceded that it extended the penalty to only a small traction of the murders committed but they maintained that this token extension could be expanded later if the first step stood up under court tests But most of those in the Assembly wanted to go all the way at once There were these other developments here today COURT REVISIONS The Legislature gave final passage to constitutional amendments that would if approved by the voters in November provide for appointment instead of election of the Court of Appeals institute a new system for disciplining the states judiciary and establish a unified administration of state courts In a compromise between thte two political parties the Republicans gave up their desire to postpone for a year the referendum on an appointed bench for the Court of Appeals The Democrats who had wanted the three elements submitted to the voters in a single package agreed to put separate propositions on the ballot SOLAR TAX BREAK Governor Carey signed into law a bill that would prevent municipalities from collecting for a period of 15 years added tax revenues based on the value of solar or wind energy systems installed by property owners ABORTION The Assembly passed a bill to guarantee that an infant born

Hers,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/30/archives/westchester-opinion-hers.html,I HEAR a pendulum swinging Topless entertainment may lose some of its license homosexual rights are wronged a Wisconsin judge finds rape normal in a permissive world only to find himself strictly overruled by an outraged community Well be back with these and other stories in a minute I never bother with people I hateThats why the lady is a tramp Lorenz Hart Meanwhile my friends are whispering again Is this good or bad for women As usual the answer is of course The other day I sat in a roomful of illustrious feminists who were meeting to discuss the latest pornography blight and the latest radical cure for it Street actions Referendums A 10000 ad explaining the feminist stance on porn it isnt sex were againstits antiwoman violence Well how about a national group called Save Our Women Inc I said seriously I wish we had Anita Bryant on our side There was an audible gasp and scattered hollow laughter Surely I was kidding AnitaBryant Among feminists these days thats a fourletter fighting word One of the women an activist for homosexual rights shook her head in dismay If I was kidding it was Not Funny Another woman suggested that perhaps what I had meantif I had actually meant anythingwas only that Anita Bryantism is awesomely effective that feminists might need to learn the secret of that kind of effectiveness if we are ever to win our own battles We could after all also use the secret formula of Marabel MorganismPhyllis Schlaflyism too for that matter One suspects that they are all the same All of these women know or are carefully taught which emotional buttons to push and when and how hard to push them Well that was certainly part of what I meant though nowhere near all I tried to explain away the shock Of course I deplore what that woman stands for of course I stand against her But the Bryant constituency is ours too at least some of the time We even have identical goals in some crucial areaspornography violence wifebattering child abuse So wouldnt it help if we could begin finally to seeand to usethe connection All around that room there were murmurs of protest Not out of anger but profound discomfort Not because we didnt all sense the urgent need to broaden our base for some of our toughest causes but simply because most of us couldnt imagine playing any kind of sexual politics in which the likes of Anita Bryant became our bedfollows Where we diverge is too sharp where we meet or overlap too slippery Yet some leaders of the fight against child pornography are also righttolifers A leader of the fight to clean up Times Square is against the ERA John Birchers are for freedom of choice in medical treatment so is the womens health movement And church groups may join a feminist outcry against sexual abuse though they mean everything but man and wife in the missionary position Remarkably even Anita Bryants phalanx of enemies male and female homosexuals and their supporters diverge sharply over gay male attacks on her as a woman and lesbianfeminist trashing of her as a straight woman At the meeting heads were still shaking however Passing references to Puritans and witch hunts were made along with a chilling reminder that we are the witches Finally Robin Morgan the poet and author reached for the common chord Women who love their children she began women who are deeply religious they dont feel at one with us They arent even aware that we share any of their feelings I Can just hear their astonishment You mean you feminists love your kids You mean youre against smut The fact is Anita Bryant can reach and move those womenbut we cant I nodded gratefully suddenly remembering a recent encounter with a woman I dont know well and whose politics and life style are vastly different from my own At a party she said that she felt closer to me lately and I asked her why Because I realize youre not a feminist she said youre a woman I didnt contradict her because I understood what she meant She had simply begun to see more of the bonds between us and to focus less on the divisions I knew there was a lesson in there somewhere  There are other lessons we could be learning too The night after that meeting I saw Godfather II on Home Box Office and also read a book called The Managerial Woman Both were filled with the sobering images of determined men getting where they want to go by doing business with their sworn enemiesor else Ethnicslurring US Senators and proud Mafia dons Pragmatic industrialists and greedy military dictators Big wheelers and dirty dealers Godfather II like Godfathers I III and the whole bloody Family may be the quintessential American male selfportrait for the 70s a riveting photograph of the essential amorality that supports his Americandream twins Family and Winning Besides it looks a lot like the evening news Feminists are hardly godfathers or mothers in training nor do we want to be But we do want power we do want to win And we do need to be aware of what it takes Obviously I dont mean murder nor do I mean betrayal corruption selling out or compromising who we are and what we are about All I mean is what in the business world is called flexibilitythe knack of dealing with the realities of the environment  If Godfather II is a photograph The Managerial Woman is an Xray The authors two women PhDs who work as management consultants for major corporations offer a matteroffact diagnosis of what makes men tick politically while women still dont have the rhythm Something to do with tolerating putting up with and using the people one cant stand Men start doing it when they are children the day they learn that it takes 11 to make a football team and nobody can find 10 other kids he really likes Hes got to choose play only with friendsor play football Girlsthose solitary skaters gymnasts swimmers pickupsticks playersnever learn to make that necessary adjustment So they grow up thinking they dont have to play ball with anyone who isnt their friend They also grow up thinking that enemies who shake hands over bargaining tables and start helping each other are hypocrites Even when the shaking of those hands and the giving of that help can mean the difference between winning and losing In politics sexual or otherwise it matters a lot who won or lost Which determines how you play the game Besides whatever happened to the old ethical feminism that operated in consciousnessraising groups We used to come together from very different places and we came not to judge destroy appease or lie to each other but to find the connective tissues without ever disowning our differences Therein used to lie our strength So if a woman who was against ERA against abortion against homosexual rights walked into that roomful of feminists and said Im with you on rape child abuse and pornography what can I do to help could we really afford to cut her dead I dont think so The fact is she aint coming to us If we want her though we know where she is Its up to us to get in touch The Hers column was created as a forum for women writers on a rotating basis This is Lois Goulds final column For the next several weeks the column will be written by Phyllis Theroux

SENATE VOTE FORBIDS USING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR MOST ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/30/archives/senate-vote-forbids-using-federal-funds-for-most-abortions-high.html,WASHINGTON June 29The Senate voted tonight to bar Federal funds for abortions except when the mothers life is in danger in cases of rape or incest or in certain other cases when it is considered medically necessary Earlier in the day the Supreme Court acted to lift an injunction imposed by a Federal judge in Brooklyn who held that last years similiar Congressional ban on the use of Medicaid funds for abortions was unconstitutional An attempt by Senator Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon to remove the ban on Federal money for abortions altogether was defeated 56 to 42 after several senators who opposed the limitation last year voted for it this time The term medically necessary was inserted on an amendment by Senator Edward W Brooke Republican of Massachusetts It replaced language in the committee version of the bill that detailed specific diseases and conditions under which Federal money could be spent for abortions The Senator prevailed despite arguments the term would open a vast loophole The Debate Is Tense Few of those who changed their stands spoke and no one explained his shift in a tense debate in which senators sneered at one another and at their arguments The High Court without issuing an opinion directed Judge John F Dooling Jr to reconsider his ruling in light of decisions by the Court last week when it held that states could refuse to spend public funds on abortions not required by medical need Because the Supreme Courts mandate to Judge Dooling will not take effect for 25 days the Department of Health Education and Welfare announced that it would continue to provide Federal money for Medicaid abortions A statement by Joseph A Califano Jr Secretary of Health Education and Welfare termed Judge Doolings ruling still technically in effect The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights which joined with Planned Parenthood in bringing the case said that they would seek a further injunction when the case got back to Judge Dooling They said that the decisions in the state cases did not necessarily mean that Federal spending for abortions could be constitutionally withheld Senators Cite Court Action The High Courts action was cited in the Senate debate on the issue which came up in amendments to the 606 billion appropriation bill for the Department of Labor and the Department of Health Education and Welfare The bill passed later 71 to 18 Under the version of the bill passed earlier this month by the House no Federal money could be spent for abortions in any circumstances Under the provision voted last year and dealt with by the Court today an exception was written in for cases where a mothers life was endangered by pregnancy The differences between the two versions set up a conference situation comparable to last years when the House also voted an absolute ban on spending for abortions and the Senate voted no ban at all After a long conference the exception for threats to a mothers life was written into the law and some other exceptions were listed in the conference report This year the differences are narrower but still important perhaps more so because the Supreme Courts decision makes it more likely that action taken by Congress will have an effect Under the Brooke amendment adopted 56 to 39 psychological as well as physical problems could justify abortions aided by Federal funds and House conferees are expected to fight that exception Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina said This morning the United States Supreme Court ruled the Hyde amendment constitutional Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois won passage of the prohibition last year But Mr Packwood contended that the Court had properly shifted the issue back to Congress by not deciding it He argued that while Congress did not have a constitutional obligation to pay for abortions it had a moral obligation He said that 250000 women were either going to have babies they dont want or are going to go to backroom abortionists To deny them abortions because senators view the practice as immoral he said is a disdainful haughty arrogance that should demean this Congress Some of the Senates most conservative voices defended the prohibition with Senator Jake Garn Republican of Utah saying that taxpayers should not have to pay for something they regard as a crime Mr Helms said that funding abortions would compel the American taxpayer to finance a form of killing But some of the key votes came from liberals On June 23 1976 an effort by Senator Packwood to delete the Hyde amendment carried 57 to 28 These Senators who voted with him on that occasion and against him today when the amendment he sought to eliminate contained more exceptions than last years version were the following Area Senators Back Packwood Howard H Baker Jr Republican of Tennessee Quentin N Burdick Democrat of North Dakota Howard W Cannon Democrat of Nevada Lawton Chiles Democrat of Florida Frank Church

Democrat of Louisiana Thomas McIntyre Democrat of New Hampshire Edmund S Muskie Democrat of Maine and Sam Nunn Democrat of Georgia Also James B Pearson Republican of Kansas Richard S Schweiker Republican of Pennsylvania John Sparkman Demccrat of Alabama John C Stennis Democrat of Mississippi and Herman E Talmadge Democrat of Georgia All six of the senators from New York New Jersey and Connecticut voted on Mr Packwoods side The debate was unusually bitter and personal Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah told Senator Charles H Percy Republican of Illinois who is a supporter of Federal funds for abortions The only persons who argue for abortions are those who are already born Recalling that Mr Percys parents had been poor he said You might not be here if your views were accepted 57 years ago Then Senator Birch Bayh Democrat of Indiana observed a remarkable parallel between those who opposed abortion and those who voted against housing education and rat control and who do not have the same degree of sensitivity for the quality of life after birth Mr Hatch replied that lie discerned a remarkable similarity between those who believe in abortion and those who are spending us into bankruptcy

SENATORS ELUCIDATE SHIFT ON ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/01/archives/senators-elucidate-shift-on-abortions-say-liberal-language-in.html,WASHINGTON June 30Several liberal and moderate Senators who changed their positions yesterday and voted to limit Federal funds for Medicaid abortions said today that they had been influenced by the Supreme Court President Carter public sentiment and especially by what they considered the liberal language of the bill The House earlier voted a flat prohibition on Medicaid abortions similar to the one rejected last year by the Senate The bill adopted by the Senate yesterday allows the use of Federal funds for abortions when the mothers life is in danger in cases of rape or incest and in certain other cases when the operation is considered medically necessary The Supreme Court ruling in 1973 said Whether an abortion is necessary is a professional judgment that may be exercised in the light of all factorsphysical emotional psychological familial and the womans agerelevant to the wellbeing of the patient All these factors relate to health This allows the attending physician to make his best medical judgement Senator Bob Packwood an Oregon Republican who had fought the ban on Medicaid abortions asked today Is there any abortion that couldnt fit within this definition Senator Edward W Brooke Republican of Massachusetts who introduced the medically necessary language predicted today that there would be an uphill fight to save it when the bill went to a HouseSenate conference Several of the Senators who switched positions cited this clause as the major reason for their reversals The bill finally took a form that I could accept said Senator Frank Church Idaho Democrat who campaigned for his partys Presidential nomination last year There were more exceptions The bill reflected my view Senator Walter Huddleston Kentucky Democrat said It was the Court ruling I had really felt that we would not be permitted to withhold funds for Medicaid abortions In my state the vast majority of the people even those who dont feel strongly about abortion object to tax money being used for that purpose The Supreme Court ruled last week that states could withhold Medicaid funds for abortions and yesterday lifted an injunction imposed by a Federal judge in Brooklyn who had held that last years Congressional ban on Medicaid abortions was unconstitutional A significant number of liberals and moderates who voted against the Medicaid abortion ban last year voted for a limited ban yesterday They included several Senators who last year sought a place on the national ticket of the Democratic Party which was thought to be more proabortion than the states the Senators respresented Senator Edmund S Muskie Democrat of Maine said that he failed to grasp the significance of the abortion issue When it first arose in his 1968 VicePresidential campaign His position has remained constant he said I have been for funding abortions that would be for the health of the motherI dont just mean the life of the mother he said Senator Hubert H Humphrey Democrat of Minnesota who is a perennial Presidential candidate and was waiting in the wings last year said today If I were political on this I would have done ast year This is a nowin type of vote he said If youre doing it on the basis of ow youre going to get votes youd need  computer He said that he had switched because the Senate liberalized the much more strict language of the House He said that he was pleased with the medically necessary clause because it would place the responsibility with the prospective mother and a doctor Although the medically necessary clause was introduced by Senator Brooke after the defeat of Senator Packwoods amendment to remove the Medicaid abortion ban altogether most of the senators had been aware that it would be offered Senator Packwood attributed his defeat to the intensified pressure exerted by antiabortion forces They are a very significant force he said To politicians they are a frightening force They are people who are with you 99 percent of the time but if you vote against them on this issue it doesnt matter what else you stand for
Feminist Leaders Join Anti‐Smut Campaign Despite Reservations,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/02/archives/feminist-leaders-join-antismut-campaign-despite-reservations.html,Conservative womens groups that have traditionally been in the forefront of the nations antismut campaign may be startled by their newest allies women who believe in free love sex education abortion on demand and equal rights for homosexuals Feminists have begun to discuss analyze and organize against the dehumanization of women as demonstrated by new and violent trends in pornography Some leaders of the feminist movement who in the past have opposed anything they viewed as a curtailment of civil liberties are now arguing for the elimination of the new pornography on the grounds that it is more important to fight the degradation of women than to protect the civil rights of the publishers involved A meeting of New York feminists was held last week at the home of Susan Brownmiller author of Against Our Will Men Women and Rape Among those in attendance were Leah Fritz author Gloria Steinem editor of Ms Magazine Robin Morgan author of Going Too Far Adrienne Rich poet Lois Gould columnist Grace Paley shortstory writer and Shere Hite who compiled The Hite Report Though these women are all New Yorkers their views tend to have a national impact There is nothing new in the feminists distaste for pornography Even softcore porn has long been considered insulting by feminists But the kind of pornography that provoked the meeting is considered by the group to be worse than insulting Record album covers now frequently feature brutalized mutilated or murdered women women in chains women screaming in pain Fashion magazines include picture layouts of women being beaten up by men This is meant to humiliate and degrade and it will encourage violence against women said Robin Morgan The human body is not obscene sexuality is not obscene said Gloria Steinem But this is not sex it is violence It encourages acceptance of the idea that violence is a legitimate part of sexuality The tactics and strategies of the fledgling group are still under discussion Those interviewed explained that they could not speak for the entire group which is tentatively being called the Womens AntiDefamation League One thing we obviously dont want to do is tangle headon with the civil libertarians said Miss Brownmiller We are not going to smash any presses or try to stop anyone from printing One legislative remedy the women seem inclined to seek is a city ordinance limiting display of pornography Some women are already boycotting local newsstands to protest the pornography that greets them when they come in to buy The Ladies Home Journal or Scientific American But feminists concede that as long as the store acrossthe street iS displaying Hustler nostand can afford the competitive disadvantage There are a number of things thatcan be done about pornography shortof eliminating it and one is to keepit inside under a counter said MissSteinem f someone wants to see ithe should have to go into a store ortheater and ask it now assaults everyone who walks on the streets The legalprecedent lies in the nuisance principleA man who exposes himself in publicisnt protected by the First Amendment hes a nuisance She added that the old standard ofredeeming social value was a moreworkable standard against which tomeasure pornography than the communitystandards recommended in theSupreme Courts recent decisions Shesaid if a suitable legal case could befound to again raise the constitutionalissues before the Court feministswould be interested Adrienne Rich emphasizing theeducational campaign that is neededsaid that consumer action can be effective in some casessuch as when anadvertisement for a Rolling Stones album was recalled after protests Possible Backlash The feminists seemed aware of thepossibility of setting off a backlashFeminist struggles for sex educationand freedom of sexual preference couldfall victim to an overzealous antiporncrusade In fact the New York Legislaturein the wording of its recentlypassed bill intended to stop child pornographymanaged to include legitimate sex education books The thought of feminists involved inantipornography efforts brings tomind the possibility of some peculiaralliances One envisions the NationalOrganization for Women and theDaughters of the American Revolutionmarching shoulder to shoulder in thewar against porn This matter of alliances has alreadyproduced differences in the group Someof the women are prepared at leastto contemplate making alliances withtraditional antismut groups But otheractivists cannot see cooperating withfor example the Catholic Churchwhich opposes abortion even to savethe life of the mother or with AnitaBryant who believes homosexuals aresuffering from a curable disease In 1970 the National Report on Obscenity and Pornography concludedthere was no evidence that exposureto or use of explicit sexual materialplays a significant role in the causationof social or individual harms and themajority of expert opinion still holdsthat pornography unlike exposure toviolence is harmless But some morerecent studies do suggest a connectionbetween sex offenses and heavy useof pornography particularly at a youngage and help furnish the feminist rationale for containment of pornography According to a recent book by JeanMacKellar Rape The Bait and theTrap Police have noted a change inthe tone and patterns of rape in thelast few years It has become more violentwith new elements ofhumiliation  There used to be justenough violence to subdue a victim andto persuade her not to reportNowthere are a lot of bizarre additionalactivities It is as if forced sex alonewere no longer vile enough Asked Where do you draw the lineMiss Brownmiller said I dont haveto draw the line But I can tell youthat Hustler and Snuff are beyond it Snuff was a film allegedly portraying the killing and dismemberment ofa woman It was big on the under ground porn circuit for a while and then went into theaters where it was protested by feminists Leanne Katz coordinator of the National Coalition Against Censorship noted that the 27 participating organizations have differing stands on pornography While the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Library Association take the absolutist positionthat the First Amendment covers all expressionsome of the other groups in the coalition are involved in efforts fo curb violence obscenity racism and sexism on television Pat Beryea director of the Womens Rights Project of the ACLU said Frankly I could argue either side of this question There are rights in conflict here Well have to wait and see what kinds of tactics the feminists use against pornography to see if they raise constitutional issues None of the feminists involved in this fledgling effort expects that the problem of violent antifemale pornography can be solved by hiding it under store counters They believe that the hatred for and contempt of women given expression in such pornography can be resolved only by continued efforts to sensitize the public to sexism

Notes: A Flying Force Called Friendship,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/03/archives/notes-a-flying-force-called-friendship-the-other-metro-notes-about.html,The Friendship Force an Atlantabased organization that is mounting an international peopletopeople exchange program endorsed by President and Mrs Jimm Carter sends off its inaugural flight tomorrowto Newcastle England Threehundredandeighty one Georgians will fly from Atlanta on a chartered Pan American 747 and stay in the homes of Newcastle families The net cost per head 250 Before the Americans take off for their 10day stay the same jetliner will have landed with 381 visitors from the Newcastle area who will stay in private homes in and around Atlanta Three more peopletopeople exchanges with other countries are planned tentatively by state committees of the privately funded nongovernmental groupfrom New York Connecticut and Tennessee  in November Next year Friendship Force plans to operate about 100 flights to more than 50 countries and by 1980 according to officials of the organization President Carter would like to see one flight a month from each of the 50 states The program grew out of a 1972 citizen exchange between the United States and Brazil that had the support of President Carter when he was Governor of Georgia Mrs Rosalynn Carter is honorary chairman of the new organizationformed last March and says Wade Seal executive director will be giving a lot of time to the project Tom Deardorff one of the permanent staff of six at the Atlanta headquarters says that local committees have already been set up in 37 states The plan is that Friendship Force will operate on a statebystate basis with the local committees screening applicants for the exchange flights They will not be told when they sign up and pay their 250 induction fee which foreign country they will be visiting The purpose of that Mr Deardorff says is to encourage travelers genuinely interested in a cultural exchange program and to discourage those just looking for a cheap vacation The 250 fee the only charge made for a trip will not be refunded if the applicant dces not approve of the destination when it is revealed and drops out Travelers who do go need not in theory at least spend any other money since they must agree to stay as a guest in a familys home either for the duration of the trip or for half of it On the Newcastle trip Mr Deardorff reports less than 30 percent of the Americans will spend the second half of their visit in Newcastle Many are traveling on to London or Edinburgh after the first four days with a family and then returning to Newcastle to catch the plane home The state committees will be responsible for matching each ambassador as Friendship Force calls its travelers with a host family and officials of the organization emphasize that a crosssection of Americans are wanted for the flights About 5 to 10 percent of the travelers on tomorrows exchange they say had part of their 250 fee subsidized by the FF headquarters which is funded by private and foundation grants Since the organization does not charge an exact air fare it had to obtain a special waiver from the Civil Aeronautics Board to operate tomorrows flight and it has applied for a fiveyear waiver to cover future trips Mr Seal said that the program is not designed to be competitive with regular tour offerings The address of the headquarters of Friendship Force is 575 South Omni International Atlanta Ga 30303 tel 4045229490 In New York Governor Carey has appointed one of his special assistants Mrs

The Vexing Abortion Issue,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/03/archives/connecticut-opinion-the-vexing-abortion-issue-politics.html,THE impatient arguments that attended the abortion issue on its long tortuous course over the last several years in Connecticut from the General Assembly to the courts and back to the General Assembly again were always perplexing and from all that could be seen and understood of them irreconcilable But the arguments were a shade simpler at one time than they are now The individuals and groups advocating a more liberal abortion policy wanted it mainly so that poor women who could not afford to go to New York to have abortions as many women did could have them in Connecticut at public expense Poverty and deprivation are hard enough to bear without the arrival of unplanned and unwanted children the argument went  a civilized society ought not to want to perpetuate and intensify the miseries of its poor Besides it was said the society is also deprived by having to support not only the mother and the rest of her children but the new unwanted child as well By the time the states 1860 statute banning abortions was struck down in 1972 by a threejudge Federal Court in Hartford that simple social argument had been overtaken in a billowing cloud of medical legal and religious ones along with the confusing philosophical one about womens rights The right to control our bodies is something we must have insisted State Senator Betty Hudson the Democrat from Madison who railed against the decision that came down from the United States Supreme Court on June 20 in which it was held that while Connecticut could not constitutionally prohibit abortions neither did it have to pay for them The cruelty really of this kind of decision is absolutely lost on the court the Senator said noting that there was not a woman among the nine Justices Men do not get pregnant cannot get pregnant do not understand the kind of responsibility a child represents for a woman she said Governor Grasso is a Roman Catholic and a stanch opponent of liberal abortion law But she suggested that Senator Hudson got only halfway to the truth when she said a woman should have control of her body Yes the Governor said but not the body of an unborn child Thats another life The Governors predecessor Thomas J Meskill a Republican unlike Mrs Grasso but also a Roman Catholic and now a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second District was at least as adamant as is Governor Grasso about the right of an unborn child to life In October 1972 when the United States Supreme Court refused to stay the lower courts decision and give effect again to Connecticuts abortion ban Governor Meskill likened the decision to the Courts famous Dred Scott decision in 1857 in which it was held that a slave while undeniably a human being simply did not exist as a legal person and therefore had no standing under the law SometimesI find it hard to believe we have learned so little about human rights and values in the 100 years since Dred Scott Governor Meskill said However you feel about abortion this is not the issue in this case Senator Hudson said The issue in this case is that the Supreme Court on the one hand has said that the right to choose abortion at least during the first trimester is legal in this country The Supreme Court then says it is OK if you can pay for it but if youre poor you dont have the right She sought an emergency session of the General Assembly to get a law enacted that would force the state to pay for abortions for those in need but the President pro tempore of the Senate Joseph J Faulise of Hartford a Democrat who is a Rbman Catholic and another foe of abortion said there was not a chance of a special session He had his own perspective of what the Supreme Court held What the court is saying is this namely that a woman has a right to do what is private that is to have an abortion but publicly when it concerns public funds certainly the public should not be subsidizing this the Senator said That argument clouded the landscape even more in the view of Senator Hudson who argued that the place to oppose some aspect of spending is where it is done in the Legislature by elected representatives I cant think of any other issue that went to the Supreme Court because someone didnt want to spend their tax dollars that way she said I dont happen to believe that my tax dollars ought to go for chemical and biological warfare research I dont think my tax dollars ought to go to defoliate countries and destroy their farmland trees vegetation life itself I dont believe my tax dollars ought to go into napalm But I didnt go to the Supreme Court She will continue to try the Legislature instead hoping now to force a special session on the leadership by gathering the signatures of a majority of the members of each of the two houses of the General Assembly when they convene briefly to deal with vetoed legislation But the Senator already is getting signs from the overworked soulweary legislators that they may not be ready just yet to take on the vexing question of abortion People are reluctant to come back she said Cant it wait Hudson You know God cant it wait You know what Im saying We get very poor pay Were probably one of the lowest paid legislatures in the country Were overworked Were harassed and the human response is Oh lets wait 
I IN AMERICA,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/03/archives/in-america-the-new-sexual-revolution.html,SAN RAFAEL Calif he six young women highschool juniors and seniors sat on deep cushy pillows in the room where as volunteer counselors they lead rap sessions on contraception for the Planned Parenthood Association of Marin County They were talking in astonished tones about the sophistication in matters sexual manifested these days by eighth and ninth graders some of whom turn up at the Planned Parenthood clinic here for contraceptive guidance The world was certainly changing they agreed Long ago  two years or three  when they were that age the undertow and currents and eddies of sex were not nearly as powerful or immediate as theyve since become In the eighth grade like we didnt know what was there said Allison her voice tinkling with laughter at the memory of that innocent time I wasnt that aware of what the possibilities are I mean I knew but I never thought they were possibilities for me Now it was considerably less than extraordinary although not quite commonplace for an eighth grader to seek an abortion I shiver when I think about it admitted Katherine because I do see a lot of girls who are having sex at that age Adults are likely to feel the same involuntary shiver when confronted with the evidence that the time between the onset of puberty and the onset of sex is rapidly narrowing Ten years ago the sexual revolution on college campuses was big news real shocker in some circles Evidence of an emerging sexual revolution in the high schools hasnt hit quite as hard partly because its harder to shock and partly because not knowing what to think or do we would just as soon not hear about it Still a national survey published this spring by two Johns Hopkins researchers reported a 30 percent increase in teenage sexual activity in only five years By age 16 it indicated 25 percent of young women had been initiated into sex by age 17 it was up to 40 percent And that was as of 1976 soon to be ancient history No statistics exist on the sex life of teenagers in Marin County a privileged stretch of suburbia in the droughtparched hills across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco But if the levels of teenage sex here were shown to be half again as high or even double those reported in the nal ionalsurvey only some parents would be greatly surprised Its like a race to see whos going to have sex first said Susan And so in a typical week 25 or 30 teenagers turn up at the Planned Parenthood office here Usually they are there because they suspect they may be pregnant Often enough their suspicions are correct Assuming that California is the vanguard  that Marin County on this score represents the future for middleclass America  the connection between teenage sex and teenage pregnancy deserves some pondering Its not just a simple matter of biology be corrected by the application of an appropriate contraceptive at an appropriate time Nor is it to be corrected simply by more adequate sex education in high schools or junior high schools where very little else seems to be taught or at least learned adequately The truth is that teenagers now have ready access to contraceptives here in Marin County and nationally know more about their use and are more likely to use them effectively than has ever been the case They are also becoming pregnant in tremendous numbers  more than one million a year leading to some 350000 Is that really a paradox Only when fundamental factors are overlooked that teenage sex is a pastime of teenagers and that the process of initiation they are going through involves conflicting pressures ardent emotions and little premeditation It one thing for the Supreme Court to declare that laws on the sale of contraceptives cannot discriminate against teenagers It is one thing for their biology teacher to show them schematic models of reproductive systems But it is something quite different fur 15yearold girl to apply the lesson and exercise the right when shes balancing the likely disapproval of her parents against the example of her friends and her own urges Seeking contraceptives is tantamount to seeking sex it is also risking discovery Ignoring the question of contraception is a way of leaving the issue of sex open and unresolved of retaining the right not to have any It is a reasonablesounding compromise therefore to conclude that sex is all right if its natural and spontaneous but wrong if its planned If youre into contraception youre assuming youre going to have sex one of the teenage counselors here said and thats putting yourself in Its a calculated risk thats hardly new to this generation But adult problemsolvers who tend forget the bittersweet ambiguities of adolescence imagine the risk can be eliminated It can be course but only when teenagers are prepared to accept the implications of their own sexuality Since adults are reluctant to hurry them to that end pregnancy scare is generally what does it Thats called learning front experience the need for which isnt easily eliminated in adolescence or in life Megan one of the teenage counselors was telling Susan about a friend who had gone through an abortion Shes really been changed by getting pregnant Megan was saying Like she doesnt have the casual sex she used to have like shes much more wrapped up in caring for a person Thats good said Susan but its a terrible way to get there The earlier sex starts obviously the more likely pregnancy is to be used in this way as a route adulthood But teenage sex doesnt just start and continue on smoothly ever after It starts and stops One of the most striking findings of the Johns Hopkins survey was that although teenage sex was starting earlier it seemed to be occurring less frequently than had been the case five years before Of sexually experienced girls between the ages of 15 and 17 slightly more than half had experienced no sex in the four weeks before the interviews and 20 percent had experienced it only once The Marin teenagers were ready with an explanation They had friends who reacted to the social pressure to devirginize themselves as one them put it  then having shown that they could cross that threshold they resumed their girlhood Were they compromised by that compromise No by the standards of their time and place it seemed they were compromised no longer Why the pressure for earlier and earlier sex Its just so easy the young women said in their middleclass environment  most homes are vacant much the time Mothers go to work or to their tennis clubs Very often they are single and out on dates Divorce is more the rule than the exception and divorced parents vying for the affection of their children and overtly preoccupied with sex themselves are in no position to offer strictures In such households the young women said its not uncommon now for highschool couples to have sleepover dates The shiver returns It returns because of the dynamics that the teenagers themselves sense The failure of families  families that stay together as well as families that break up  leading kids to seek new and stable relationships those relationships leading to the creation of new families that will break up even sooner to the birth of children who will set out in quest of new relationships even earlier Some 12yearolds you speak to are incredibly grownup Katherine was saying conveying an impression she could hardly believe They know their bodies and they know their heads You could say the same thing of some adults some

Abortion Bill: Not Yet Final,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/03/archives/abortion-bill-not-yet-final.html,Proponents of abortionondemand expected little from the Senate and that may turn out to he just about what they got Voting two weeks after the House decided to ban the use of Federal funds for all abortions without exception the Senate passed a less restrictive bill that permitted Medicaid to pay for the operation under three conditions when the mothers life is in danger in cases of rape or incest and when the abortion is medically necessary This intentionally vague language led some proabortion Senators to vote for the measure Bob Packwood for example who fought the ban on Medicaid abortions asked k there any abortion that couldnt fit within this definition The answer may be yes but the question may be wrong The Senate bill now goes into HouseSenate conference where a final version will be hammered out and though the odds are against retaining the medically necessary clause substitute language may also be open to interpretation So far neither the White House nor the Department of Health Education and Welfare has swung their weight in the debate though President Carter and Joseph A Califano Jr have declared their personal opposition to abortion

Abortion Fight Stalls Massachusetts Budget,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/04/archives/abortion-fight-stalls-massachusetts-budget.html,BOSTON July 3 APAntiabortion forces in a chaotic session of the Massachusetts House blocked final action on the 426 billion state budget today The issue was deferred until Tuesday with the prospect of a possible resumption of a filibuster that tied up the legislature for hours at a tumultuous session last night Legislators on both sides of the abortion issue bitterly denounced the tactics involved in stifling a filibuster against the budget that had been raging three and a half hours The strategy of the antiabortion contingent is to force the majority leadership to insert into the budget a ban against using tax money for elective abortions based on a recent Supreme Court ruling that states do not have to pay for these medical procedures The pending budget bill has to be rejected over the objections of the Democratic leadership to accomplish that goal
Supreme Court's Year Is Marked By Changes in Patterns of Voting,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/04/archives/supreme-courts-year-is-marked-by-changes-in-patterns-of-voting.html,WASHINGTON July 2The Supreme Court in its justcompleted court year handed a number of major setbacks to the drive for womens rights and to the efforts of civil rights groups to combat racial discrimination The setbacks included some of the most stunning defeats either movement has had in several years At the same time the Court expanded the reach of the First Amendments free speech guarantee It did the same to the constitutional protections for the rights of aliens and of illegitimate children The Court continued its prolawenforcement stance in criminal cases but it did so with markedly less fervour than in some recent years In some of its rulings in fact the Court firmly rejected lawandorder positions taken by the Federal Government and by many states The 19761977 Supreme Court term was in short very mixed The Court was still clearly the Burger Court leaning toward conservatism sharp contrast to the egalitarian and liberalleaning Warren Court of the 1960s But it was not entirely predictable one of the hallmarks of the year was a loosening of the Justices past voting patterns Some civil rights leaders and advocates bitterly criticized the Court after it adjourned for the summer last Wednesday having issued an endoftheterm flurry of rulings on issues ranging from abortion to school desegregation I think theyve just shoved the car in reverse and its going backwards mile a minute Nathaniel R Jones general counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People said of the Courts stance on racial issues Speaking about one of the biggest civil rights losses the ruling in May that seniority systems perpetuating the effects of past race and sex discrimination are not necessarily illegal Mr Jones said Frankly that is the kind of language that even people worried about the Court never expected to come out Its as if they missed the whole point of the Civil War It Was Disappointing Norman Dorsen chairman of the board of directors of the American Civil Liberties Union said I would not say the year was an unqualified disaster I wouldnt say that But I would say it was disappointing and overall the Court did not adequately perform its signal constitutional role defending individual rights However another civil liberties advocate Prof Leon Friedman of the Hofstra Law School noted that even from the civil liberties perspective there were a few good spots most notably in the First Amendment area where the Court ruled among other things that lawyers may not be barred from advertising the availability and prices of their services Thats really new good First Amendment law he said Scholars who examined the range of the Courts work over the year saw substantial mix Liberal Thrust The most predictable elements of Burger Court performance have by and large continued said Prof Gerald Gunther of the Stanford University Law School Among these he included their inclination to limit access to the Federal courts whenever possible  when in doubt throw them out  looking at criminal defendants rights as narrowly as possible without overruling past decisions and the continued extension into the civil area of a doctrine that limits the power of Federal courts to hear lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of state laws or proceedings Yet along with these patterns Professor Gunther said there were also three areas in which the Burger Court had previously established a liberal direction and in which with some exceptions it continued that liberal thrust this year These he said were cases involving the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws such as the cases on aliens the First Amendment and the right to privacy Prof AE Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School who is writing a book about the Burger Court commented What struck me is how side by side in the same Court you have two powerful forces at work On the one hand he said The collective wisdom if you like of the newer members of the Courtthe Nixon appointeesand the aims that they seem to carry around with them are reflected in a fair number of opinions He cited the interest in federalism the trend toward limiting the remedial power of the courts and the preference to have social issues decided in a political forum rather than in the courts But at the same time Professor Howard added theres a remarkable viability remarkable ability to survive of fundamental Warren Court techniques including judicial activism Among other things he noted the Court in almost every capital punishment case overrules a legislative judgment despite all the talk about letting legislatures decide such matters There is a kaleidescope of values being vindicated by these opinions he contended adding There is an awful lot of Warren Court in this Court The rulings that got the most public attention during the Courts term were those involving women and civil rights especially allegations of racial discrimination In previous years the Burger Court had established some major advances for women Indeed women were considered one of the Courts new constituencies as blacks were of the Warren Court This year the Court again made decisions favoring women But its new rulings taken together tended to overwhelmingly reject the arguments of womens rights groups In a ruling of broad practical impact the Court held last December that private employers who have programs temporarily compensating outofwork employees for a broad range of disabilities may refuse to compensate women for absences caused by pregnancy This was an interpretation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 On June 20 the Court ruled that neither the Constitution nor current Federal law requires states to spend Medicaid funds for elective abortions Most Stunning Blow This was the most stunning blow of the year said Ruth Bader Ginsburg the Columbia Law School professor who is the preeminent legal scholar and courtroom advocate for the womens movement For in deciding what position women will have in our society she said the first thing she must have is the ability to control her own body Rulings helpful to women included decision that invalidated Social Security provisions under which husbands of workers covered by Social Security had to prove dependency on their wives before they could collect certain old age and survivors benefits whereas wives did not The result of this requirement had been to give the family of the woman wageearner less protection In the area of racial relations the Courts set of rulings on seniority systems were widely viewed in civil rights circles as extremely damaging The Court held in those cases specifically that Title VII does not prohibit the use of bona fide seniority systems that perpetuate effects of discrimination that occurred before the act went into effect on July 2 1965 Jack Greenberg director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc which has been a leader in the effort to fight discrimination in employment called the ruling just plain horrible It is likely he said to affect tens of thousands of workers bearing heavily on blacks but also on women because sex discrimination cases are also affected by the ruling In another case involving the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights the Court ruled last January that it is not inherently unconstitutional for a suburb to refuse to change zoning restrictions whose practical effect is to block construction of racially integrated housing for persons with low and moderate income This decision carried into the housing and zoning area the reach of a decision from the previous high court year holding that proof of racially discriminatory intent and not just of racially discriminatory effect was necessary to make out a case of unconstitutional racial discrimination The Courts record regarding schools was more mixed In a case involving Detroit the high court ruled in a broadening of the remedial powers of the courts that Federal courts could order school districts to provide remedial education programs to help children recover from the effects of going to illegally segregated schools Findings Specified The Court vacated lower court rulings upholding desegregation plans for some other cities however In one case involving Dayton Ohio the Court reaffirmed the power of courts to impose citywide desegregation plans But it stressed that there must be specific findings of citywide violations and elaborated a standard for making these findings Mr Greenberg contended that the Dayton ruling was a step backward and took most of the teeth out of the Courts 1973 ruling in the Denver case allowing citywide remedies School experts at the NAACP fund and the ACLU took a different view and generally were pleased that the Dayton ruling did not drastically limit the power of the courts as they had feared it might Mr Jones however said that there was a danger that lower courts might misinterpret the Dayton ruling seeing it as a signal to cut back He also said that while the NAACP fund which litigates many school cases could meet the Courts test as set not in the Dayton case it was an unfair test given the long history of treatment of blacks in the United States Welcome Ruling The Justices did issue one ruling on racial matters that was welcomed by civil rights leaders such as Mr Greenberg In a case involving the Hasidic Jewish community in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn the Court ruled that under the Voting Rights Act a state drawing up a reapportionment plan may sometimes use racial quotas that are designed to assure that blacks and tither nonwhites have majorities in certain legislative districts The Court issued a variety of criminal law rulings In an Iowa case the Justices rejected a request by 22 states that overrule the landmark 1966 Miranda decision on confessions in a Massachusetts case they rejected the Federal Governments request that they substantially limit the requirement that the police get warrants before conducting searches In the other direction the Court further eased the prosecutions ability to use evidence obtained in questionable eyewitness identification procedures It also held that customs inspectors looking for contraband may open mail from abroad without first getting warrants The Court ruled that the death penalty may not be imposed for the rape of an adult woman It also ruled that states may not have statutes making death the mandatory penalty for the murder of police officers On the other hand it upheld a death sentence imposed on a man under a Florida law for murders he committed before the law went into effect It also refused to block the execution last January of Gary Mark Gilmore by the state of Utah Abortion Rulings Prof Yale Kamisar at the University of Michigan Law School an expert on constitutional and criminal procedure law commented Its been sort of thawingout year My feeling is the ideological blocks are not as rigid and are sort of melting Maybe its a sober second look he added The Courts rulings on abortions limited the privacy rights of a woman to decide whether to bear a child The Court bolstered a related privacy right however by voiding a New York law that limited access to contraceptives and that forbade anyone but a doctor to provide persons under 16 with contraceptives In the First Amendment area the Court continued its tough stance on obscenity But it also continued and expanded its trend toward protecting commercial speech In addition to permitting lawyer advertising it also in the New York case invalidated a ban against advertising contraceptives and in a New Jersey case it ruled that communities generally may not ban the posting of for sale signs in front of houses even if the aim is to prevent the flight of white homeowners for racial reasons In the financial area the Court continued to curb efforts to broadly interpret the securities laws It also made two decisions last month that were viewed by analysts as weakening enforcement of antitrust laws Once again the Court deals with some Watergate issues It upheld the statute that gave the Government custody of Richard M Nixons Presidential papers and tape recordings And in an incident that embarrassed the Court because the result was disclosed to the press ahead of time the Court declined to review the convictions in the Watergate coverup case of John N Mitchell the former Attorney General H R Haldeman former chief of staff in the Nixon White House and John D Ehrlichman former chief domestic adviser to President Nixon Throughout the year the Courts voting patterns seemed less settled than last year Chief Justice Warren E Burger and Associate Justice William H Rehnquist again were the furthest to the right and often voted together Associate Justices William J Brennan Jr And Thurgood Marshall again voted together on the most liberal position But the five other Justices between those poles varied widely Associate Justice Harry A Black mun in particular separated himself more often from the BurgerRehnquist veiw according to numerous observers John Paul Stevens the Courts newest member was decidedly independent The other Justices are Lewis F Powell Jr Byron R White and Potter Stewart To some extent the Courts actions this year seemed to reflect views elsewhere in the nation the seemingly growing backlash against the womens movement and the confusion and debate over school desegregation Professor Howard suggested We are in a transitional period both in law and in society at large It may be a good thing the Court doesnt try to decide eases too categorically Some of this breathcatching may be helpful he added I think theres touch of the Hegelian dialetic to it

1975 and by the Bicentennial in 1976 authorized funds for the series of state meetings this year and for the national conference in Houston Controversy and verbal fireworks have highlighted previous meetings this year In Ohio and Missouri for example the Tighttolife forces were able to elect slates to the national conference that would strongly represent their opposition to abortion At the Oklahoma meeting stopERA groups outnumbered proERA groups about 5 to 1 In many other states however those in favor of abortion reform and the adoption of the proposed equal rights amendment were in the majority Homemaker workshops have clearly drawn the most interest everywhere with discussions centering on what to do with displaced homemakersthose who have been widowed divorced or separated do not have any job skills and may be unfamiliar with even the simple task of writing out checks Informal polls taken at the conferences have shown that as many as half of those attending had never gone to a meeting of that type before and did not belong to any organization including womens and church groups Those organizing the meetings had hoped to attract that hitherto untapped segment of the population Mary Burke Nicholas chairman of the New York meeting said that this is not going to be a meeting of feminists or middleclass homemakers or working women or rural women or innercity women It is going to be all of thatand more Alaskas 12member delegation to the national conference includes Tlingit Eskimo Athabascan black Japanese and Caucasian women Black representation on many Southern

law President Carter has said that the meetings are part of an effort that is bringing together an unprecedented diversity of American women to act on issues of common concern she explained Our first responsibility to the cause of human rights the President said in his message is to ensure that those rights are fully respected here at home and that goal can be attained only when all aspects of our national life are open to the equal participation of the majority of Americans who happen to be female The President reiterated his support and that of his wife Rosalynn for the equal rights amendment
Will Our Humanity Also Be Aborted?,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/05/archives/will-our-humanity-also-be-aborted.html,When they got around this year to focusing on abortions the three branches of the American Government achieved a rare degree of unanimity With certain differences in shading the Administration the Congress and the Supreme Court decided against paying with nublic funds for abortions for poor women The Supreme Court decided that neither the Constitution nor the Social Security laws require a state to pay Medicaid money for abortions or to provide them in public facility The President and the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare Joseph Califano declared their opposition to publicly funded abortions And now the Senate  albeit more humanely  has joined the House of Representatives in sharply restricting the use of Medicaid funds to provide abortions for poor women What has been done is outrageous But what now These decisions have large consequences It is estimated that 250000 to 300000 poor women obtain Medicaidfunded abortions each year Dr Louis Hellman former Deputy Assistant Secretary of HEW for Population Affairs has projected that if the restrictions on Medicaid abortions hdd been in effect last year 850 women a week would have sought illegal abortions of them would have been hospitalized for resulting injuries and five would have died of such injuries each week Nor does that exhaust the casualties It is difficult to estimate how many children will be born of parents who are neither ready nor able to provide for them There are more than a million teenage pregnancies each year and more than twothirds of them are unintended That should suggest the magnitude of the problem now created Will the antiabortion forces that have carried the day now form as effective a political coalition to insure humane conditions of life for these children and their parents We are not optimistic The other side of Candidate Carters antiabortion position was a promise to beef up family planning programs and research into contraception and family health This promise has not been kept The increase in family planning funds suggested by the Administration would just about keep pace with inflation As for contraception researchso vital for poor women who cant obtain abortionsthe Administration proposes a token 2 million Secretary Califano has been making speeches about the importance of sex education in the schools But the same forces that oppose Medicaid abortions are apt render such efforts meaningless thanks to mindless pressure the schools in Fairfax County Va have ruled contraception homosexuality masturbation and abortion to be forbidden topics of instruction If the Administration were moving forward with substantial welfare program that would be a sign of concern where it counts But the Carter Administrations welfare plan at least in its early outlines appears designed to make life even more bleak for a large portion of teenaged welfare mothers Until the forces that have been so effective at diminishing the scope of the Supreme Courts 1973 abortion decision mobilize on behalf of poor women their children and their families the humanity of their movement will remain in doubt Those under severest scrutiny must be the President and his administrators Their power is real but their deeds have been token and their words evasive

President Now Doubts Early Talks Because of Brezhnev's Conditions,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/06/archives/president-now-doubts-early-talks-because-of-brezhnevs-conditions.html,WASHINGTON July 5  President Carter is increasingly doubtful that an early conference with Leonid I Brezhnev can be arranged in view of conditions laid down by the Soviet leader for such a meeting Mr Brezhnev told Ambassador Malcolm Tcon in a 100minute meeting today that a meeting with Mr Carter should serve primarily to ratify agreements already made particularly on strategic arms limitation Mr Carter it was said has felt that such visible diplomatic progress is not necessary and has suggested consideration of a meeting perhaps next month and perhaps in Alaska Mr Carter is known to feel that merely gettingbetter acquainted would be valuable and that the two men could informally explore possible means of overcoming impasses between the two nations Carter Still Has Some Hope In light of Mr Brezhnevs views the President felt today that an early meeting was unlikely although he has not given up all hope He said in a news conference on Thursday that he would welcome an informal meeting with Mr Brezhnev Mr Carter also believes it was said that some supporters of Israel in the United States have incorrectly perceived that his Middle East policies are asking more of Israel than of the Arab states In the Presidents view it is difficult for Arab leaders to agree to such concepts as recognizing Israels right to exist in peace but he feels they have become more flexible The discussion that he believes he initiated on such questions as future borders in the Middle East a Palestinian homeland and more normal relations between Israel and its neighbors is in the Presidents view inevitable and useful if any progress is to be made Approved of Mideast Statement Although he had no direct part in it Mr Carter is understood to approve of a controversial statement issued last week by the State Department saying that some Israeli withdrawals from occupied Arab lands on all fronts are vital to a peace settlement Any conference between Israeli and Arab leaders would be simply fruitless if Israel took an avowed position not to yield any land in some of the occupied territories such as the West Bank Mr Carter believes American officials have tried to make clear that what they are suggesting not simple withdrawal by Israel but rather a phased withdrawal in which Israel would be protected by what the Administration calls special security lines until the good intentions of the Arab states and the permanence or peace had been demonstrated Mr Carter does not believe that his decision last week to stop production of the B1 bomber will complicate strategic arms negotiations with the Soviet Union even though an important part of the decision was to develop and deploy the unmanned drone aircraft known as cruise missiles a weapon that has caused concern in Moscow Mr Carter believes that the two sides are already in virtual agreement on such questions as the range limit to be set on airlaunched cruise missiles which would be about 1500 miles and on sealaunched cruise missiles about 360 miles There is still disagreement as to whether each bomber or other aircraft carrying cruise missiles should be counted as vehicle carrying multiple warheads under an arms limitation accord The United States view is that they should not be so counted The President also Understands that the Soviet Union is sensitive to the deployment of groundlaunched cruise missiles in Western Europe Mr Carter who surprised many people in Washington with his decision to stop the B1 production program apparently never leaned toward either fullscale production or building a substantial number He tended to think that either a smallscale production program should be undertaken or production should be halted and he chose the latter alternative Brezhnev Health Held No Obstacle Mr Carter does not believe that his Brezhnevs health which has often been reported to be uncertain is any obstacle to a meeting Ambassador Toon reported that the Soviet leader seemed to be vigorous and in good health Mr Carter it was learned has not formed any definite impression as to whether the United States should accept refugees from South Vietnam who are stranded in Southeast Asia A proposal by the State Department that about 15000 such refugees be admitted to the United States has not yet reached Mr Carter although his national security staff is studying it He feels that there is certainly some humanitarian obligation to such stranded people but apparently he has not decided whether there is a moral obligation growing out of American involvement in the war Mr Carter it was learned is in general agreement with a recent Supreme Court decision that governments need not pay under medical insurance programs for the costs of nontherapeutic or medically unnecessary abortions He seems to believe that there is a difference between the ability of more affluent women to get abortions which the court left undisturbed and an insistence that taxpayers have to help finance abortions for the poor Management Techniques Area Used Mr Carter apparently uses some management techniques as a form of mental discipline among his policymakers without foreclosing subsequent compromises in the final policy For instance he insisted that an interagency study group exploring changes in the welfare system work on the assumption that costs would not be permitted to rise above present levels He found that it was all too easy for such planners to retain present programs and add new costs to achieve equity or broader coverage Mr Carter finally insisted on a fundamental rethinking of how present expenditures could be better spent but he does not rule out more money for the programs at some future date Similarly he instructed officials working on a tax reform program to be submitted to Congress to try to devise a new system that would neither increase or decrease total tax revenues accruing to the Federal Government But he does not rule out some tax reduction to make the program more politically acceptable When the officials seemed to treat some tax loopholes as sacrosanct Mr Carter instructed them to go back and start from scratch and critically examine all deductions and credits His departure point was a concept in which many loopholes could be eliminated and in turn a considerably lower tax rate could be imposed
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/07/archives/letters.html,To the Editor I wish to counter Professor Nahms view on Korea [letter June 22] and his support for General Singlaubs position which was openly repudiated by President Carter Professor Nahms view on Korea is reminiscent of the Nixonite Asian scholars of yesterday who grossly misled us on Vietnam in an emotional appeal to our antiCommunist paranoia Why should we continue to apply yesterdays Vietnam policy to Korea today The lessons of Vietnam compel us to overhaul our Korea policy One may wonder whether there is a parallel between Korea and Vietnam Historically Vietnam and Korea are the twins of the cold war legacy A classical VietnamKorea analogy appeared in 1950 Jacques Soustelle former Governor General of Algeria expressed a French version of the cold war analysis by pointing out that the two conflicts differ from each other in many ways However each clearly has a place in the same strategic and political complex They share a basic common factor In an arrogant expression of dealing with a colonized people Soustelle asserted that no one even the Indochinese themselves could have done for Indochina what France has done France did all that was in her power for the people of Indochina often more than she did for her own people Wasnt our Vietnam policy based on a parallel vision At this critical junctvre the Vietnam experience cries out for us to reexamine our basic assumptions on which our Korea policy rests Prof Edwin O Reischauer former Ambassador to Japan cited the lessons of Vaetnam in warning the United States that the defense of South Korea regardless of the nature of its systems is not vital to American interests What should be our priorities in our relations with South Korea The only way to repudiate the allegation that the South Korean Government is a puppet of the United States is to make South Korea itself independent of the United States military presence That is the real meaning of the withdrawal of all military troops from South Korea If all the past economic and military aid could not produce a viable democratic state hI South Korea how is it possible that ten or twenty more years of military presence and aid will make the difference In every respect the two Koreas policy lacks logic realism and principle Therefore the United States must recognize the legitimacy Of the Korean aspiration for reunification instead of cynically continuing to follow a two Koreas policy of yesterday Pitted against the Korean determination to unify the country the American determination to prop up the status quotwo Koreasis destined to fail as it dki in Vietnam ANTHONY KAHNG Morristown N J June 28 1977 SoViet Nuclear Strategy To the Editor This reader wishes to congratulate The New York Times on the very informative report on Soviet nuclear strategy by Drew Middleton news story June 25 The USSR newspapers and their official statements certainly do not subscribe to the mutual assured destruction doctrine or to the statement so often heard in our country that a nuclear war would be the end of mankind They claim that their civil defense would reduce their casualties in a nuclear war to a small percent of the population  this is perhaps the principal point not sufficiently emphasized in the reportand the calculations of these losses available in our country indeed estimate their losses at between 2 and 4 percent This against our losses of 45 percent because of the absence of similar civil defense preparations EUGENE P WIGNER Dept of Physics Princeton University Princeton NJ June 28 1977 The Neutron Bomb To the Editor The proposed neutron bomb is the antithesis of what the United States of America is all about That we who used to invite our crowded neighbor nations to send us your tired and your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free should now offer to become their exterminator is to my mind the ultimate in godlessness Is there no one in Washington mature and wise enough to start the process of developing creative alternatives to war for the settling of international disputes Rules for Cyclists To the Editor The bicycle it would appear becomes ever more popular not only as an alternative and inexpensive mode of transportation but alsolike joggingas an alternative mode of exercise As one who has biked all her lite from childhood in England I deplore the complete absence of any kind of road safety regulation being imposed on New York cyclists today Blatant disregard of traffic signals and the oneway street system and the use of sidewalks as alternate thoroughfares make pedestrians drivers and other lawabiding cyclists nervous and angry as witness the revenge wreaked daily on cyclists by sideswiping bus and cab drivers Now with mopeds adding to the chaos would seem an ideal time for traffic rules and regulations for cyclists  3speeders 10speeders and moped riders alike  to be laid down If the bicycle and the moped are indeed here to stay then like every other country in the world America too must learn the rules of Safety First JOAN BRANDT New York June 29 1977 On Denying Funds For Abortions To the Editor It is easy to understand the view that denying the poor the right to choose abortions is inhumane unjust and likely to increase public welfare costs But one must sympathize with the disinclination of those who view abortion as murder to have their tax dollars used for this purpose just as many of us sympathize with those who refuse to pay taxes to support wars and swollen defense budgets One must also understand that while the criminality of abortions like the constitutionality of capital punishment is an appropriate decision for the Supreme Court recognition and implementation of societys duties to the poor is primarily a legislative function The obvious solution is for those of us who strongly believe in the right of poor women to choose between abortion and childbirth to suppbrt private charities which can provide the necessary financial support It is also necessary for those who oppose abortions to do all within their power to make it financially and psychologically possible for poor and teenage women to bear and adequately raise the children they unintentionally conceive ROBERT L BARD Professor of Law University of Connecticut West Hartford Conn June 27 1977 To the Editor The ban voted by the House of Representatives on the use of Midicaid funds for abortion could well result in a consequence not intended by our legislators a rise in infant mortality Our nations surprising inferiority in this important health parameter 14th lowest in the world in 1974 is due to the large excess of lowbirthweight babies With their very high mortality who are born to poor mothers in the United States A recent analysis by New York Citys Bureau of Maternity Services and Family Planning has shown that since legal abortion has been accessible to the poor in New York there has been a dramatic decline in the birth of infants weighing less than three pounds at birth and a consequent unprecedented decline in infant mortality in New York City Abortion when available is used by those women most at risk for delivering small infants who die soon after birth the poor the malnourished teenagers The denial of Meditaid funds for abortions to this group of women will simply mean that many more highrisk pregnancies will proceed to infant death NIGEL PANETH MD Asst Clinical Professor Pediatrics Albert Einstein College of Medicine Bronx June 26 1977 Waste in School Food To the Editor Fourteen years of working as a school volunteer should qualify me to write an opinion on the school food programs I have worked in at least five schools most recently at PS 198 on 95th Street and 3d Avenue The children are predominantly Hispanic or black but 1 fear the dietician must have been Italian Day after day the kids were served pizza spaghetti bologna hot dogs peanut butter sandwiches along with the usual carrot sticks ketchup French fries and ice cream Here were children hating almost everything they were served but still needing sustenance to get through the day until they got back to their mothers arroz con polio The amount of food waste was appalling more than half of it thrown into the big plastic containers in the cafeteria by me and other aides untouched My second observation is that the children really cry No peanut butter just bread or No hot dog just bread One would think that the dietician could get the ethnic message that all children are not born to like pizza Thirdly and most of all dishonest unemployed parents babies younger siblings almost anyone who needed foodowas invited to partake Why To keep the food budget up thats why Why do so many children get taken on school bus trips late in the spring To keep the bus allotraent up There can be no economy when half of a schools food is thrown away every day and Ive seen it happen ELIZABETH S THOMPSON New York June 30 1977 The Breeder Is a Necessity for the US To the Editor I would like to correct a number of errors in your June 16 editorial The Nuclear Breeder Still Breathes 1 The cost of breeder reactors is not destined to exceed the cost of alternate fuels Reliable estimates show that because of low fuelcycle costs electricity generated by breeder reactors will be economically competitive with electricity from light water reactors and coalfired plants No other advanced technology for base load electrical generation has progressed as far technically as the breeder reactor and no alternate technology promises to produce electricity as inexpensively as breeder reactors until well into the next century at the earliest 2 Breeders do not pose a threat to international security The breeder reactor will assure a reliable domestic supply of nuclear fuel Without the breeder the possibility of future international conflicts over access to diminishing supplies of fossil fuels would be enhanced The US has a moral obligation to minimize such possibilities 3 Industry does not discount the concern about the proliferation of weapons But termirfation of the Clinch River plant will not solve the proliferation problem The use of breeders or other commercial nuclear power plants to obtain weaponsgrade material is clearly the most costly risky and timeconsuming This important point is constantly overlooked Effective International agreements governing the use of breeders and other reactors are the only realistic solution to minimizing their use for illicit purposes If the US shuns breeder technology it will thereby undermine its leadership role in reaching effective agreements 4 Clinch River is vital to our ability to build breeder reactors a decade from now It is widely accepted that the development of any hightechnology energy system requires a demonstration phase Clinch River represints a prudent scaleup of major plant components midway between purely experimental plants and fullsized commercial units Moreover if the Clinch River project is terminated and breeders become necessary in the future a new demonstration plant will cost far more to build than it will cost to complete the Clinch River project 5 Other nations Including France the United Kingdom West Germany the Soviet Union and Japan have been and continue to be fully committed to reprocessing and to the development and use of breeder reactors Since April these countries have on numerous occasions individually reaffirmed their commitment to the breeder Most of these countries and many others have such longterm commitments because of a lack of indigenous fuel resources Japan for example imports 89 percent of its energy The breeder is not an option for nations like Japan it is a necessity It is also a necessity for the United States President Power Systems Westinghouse Electric Corporation Pittsburgh June 23 1977
Recent Supreme Court Rulings Have Set Back Women's Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/08/archives/recent-supreme-court-rulings-have-set-back-womens-rights.html,WASHINGTON July 7In rulings with consequences for thousands perhaps millions of women the Supreme Court in its 197677 term handed down decisions counter to the thrust of womens rights advocates on critical matters ranging from abortion to seniority The rulings will especially affect prospects of women in the job market innidng it harder both to get jobs and to keep them The court issued a few rulings on other issues such as certain kinds of Social Security benefits that adopted or bolstered feminist arguments Those rulings too will have significant practical impactincreasing for instance financial benefits for the families of many female wageearners But overall the justended Supreme Court year went against womenheavily It feels as if everything has gone back a decade said Carol H Arber a cofounder of the first allwoman law firm in New York City Lefcourt Kraft  Arber Its so troublesome You dont know where to pick up the pieces A young man who spent the year as a clerk for a Supreme Court Justice and who did not want his name used because of the Justices insistence that law clerks not speak to news reporters put it more bluntly Asked for his overall assessment of the years rulings on the whole spectrum of law from antitrust to civil rights he replied This was the year the women lost The thrust and tone of this Court years rulings on women contrasted sharply with that of some recent years for the Burger Court had previously established some substantial advances for the womens movement Beyond that though some of this years rulings also limited or erased some specific legal victories that womens rights advocates had won in the last few years either in the lower courts or in the Supreme Court itself Every case seems to be decided on its own facts depending on how the Court felt that day said Kathleen Willed Peratis director of the American Civil Liberties Unions Womens Rights Project There was she said a lack of a clear standard a lack of a clear guiding principle that can be consistently applied Professor Ruth Bader Ginsburg of Columbia Law School made a similar complaint contending that the Court is not giving courts and lawyers the guidance that they need The Courts rulings on sex discrimination have in fact been criticized often over the years for the ad hoc nature of the rulings This year however according to experts in the field the pattern stepped upon abortion for instance the Courts rulings up until this past year had been generally consistent The list of Court rulings inimical to the womens movement begins for many of the movements leaders and members with the Justices 6 to 3 ruling on abortion on June 20 The Court held specifically that neither the Constitution nor current Federal law requires states to spend Medicaid funds for elective abortions The Court also ruled that cities and towns that have public hospitals were not required under the Constitution to provide or even permit elective abortions in those hospitals Medicaid funds have paid for abortions for as many as 300000 women in a year The Court conceded in one of its opinions that the rulings may make it increasingly difficult for women to get abortions and for some women may even make it impossible Employment Cases The majority specified that it was sticking by its landmark 1973 decision that states could not make it a crime for doctors to provide abortions As a practical matter though the rulings were a major limitation on the 1973 decision In the employment area there was a string of setbacks In December the Court ruled that private employers who have programs temporarily compensating jobless employees for a broad range of disabilities may refuse to compensate women for absences caused by pregnancy Before that ruling though every Federal court of appeals that had considered the matter had ruled instead that under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 exclusion of pregnancy from coverage is illegal as sex discrimination The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had also concluded that exclusion of pregnancy violated Title VII In May the Supreme Court issued a set of rulings on the relations of Title VIIwhich prohibits both race and sex discrimination to seniority systems In one ruling in a case from Texas involving truck drivers the Court held that Title VII does not prohibit the use of bona fide seniority systems that perpetuate the effects of discrimination that occurred before the act went into effect on July 2 1965 The case involved racial discrimination but the logic applied to sex discrimination as wall Another ruling mat day involved stewardess who was fired when she got married under an airline policy that was subsequently invalidated and who later went back to work for the airline She wanted to get seniority based on her prior employment and was denied it She contended in effect that since she would have had that seniority status had she not been fired and since the firing had been sex discrimination the denial of her seniority claim meant that she was still suffering the effects of sex discrimination The Supreme Court ruled against her It said in effect that the time to file a complaint of illegal sex discrimination was when she was fired not several years later when at her rehiring she was denied backdated seniority Possible Broad Impact Of these rulings the first on pregnancy disability benefits has the broadest potential impact because of the specific ruling itself and also because of the possibility that it may lead to employers setting up other restrictions involving pregnant employes According to Kathleen Peratis Theres a vast potential of having it applied to any employer rule that has to do with child bearing The Court also dealt the womens movement something of a setback on the issue of sexsegregated schools In April it announced that it had deadlocked 4 to 4 on a case from Philadelphia that raised the question of whether citys public school system may have one college preparatory school for boys and one for girls The effect of the deadlock was to affirm a ruling by Federal appeals court that permitted sexsegregated schools That type of affirmation by the Court resulting from a 4 to 4 split rather than from a majority vote does not set a precedent for other cases Thus the action does not have broad application However womens rights lawyers had hoped to get a Supreme Court decision that would reverse the lower court and set a precedent forbidding such schools Rulings by the Court that either adopt the legal arguments of the womens movement or do not specifically oppose them are varied For example the Court ruled last week that it is unconstitutional to impose the death peanalty as punishment for the rape of an adult woman That coincides with the views of several womens rights groups that had entered the case They had contended that the death penalty for rape was an outgrowth of the view that a wife was her husbands property and that rape of a woman was a crime against mans property The womens groups had also argued that the penalty was so severe That it was rarely applied and that rapes thus went unpunished Another ruling helpful to women came last December when the Court invalidated an Oklahoma plan in which girls could buy beer at the age of 18 but boys had to wait until they were 21 Equal Protection of the Laws What was helpful to the womens movement was that the Court articulated a tougher standard than it had previously described for deciding whether a distinction based on sex violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws To be constitutional the Court said a classification based on sex has to serve important Governmental objectives and be substantially related to achieving those objectives This is not as tough a test as the one the Court uses in judging categories that are based on race but it is tougher than the more typical equal protection standard under which something need only be rationally or reasonably related to legitimate Government purposes The Court issued two separate rulings on Social Security benefits issues that womens rights attorneys welcomed In one the Goldfarb case the Court struck down as unconstitutional a dependency requirement under which widowers had to show they had been dependent on their spouses before they could collect survivors benefits based on the wifes lifetime of work Widows seeking those benefits based on their deceased husbands work however did not have to show dependency Womens advocates had attacked this provision on the ground that it had the effect of giving the family of a female wageearner less protection than it gave to male wage earners family In the other case the Court upheld the constitutionality of a former section of the Social Security Act under which millions of retired men were treated less favorably than women in determining old age benefits In this provision the Congress had specifically created the distinction in order to compensate for past employment discrimination against women The Court issued a ruling this year favorable to the womens rights movement involving restrictions on the employment of women as prison personnel in Alabama It invalidated the state prison systems height and weight restrictions which would have automatically excluded a number of women without regard for individual capabilities The Court permitted a ban against women guards in the contact positions though saying that it fit within the narrow Title VII exception for distinction between sexes that is bona fide occupational qualification To Professor Ginsburg the ruling on the whole was a plus in terms of this court To Kathleen Peratis however the ruling on the bona fide occupational qualification was worrisome The fact that the court applied it she said may encourage employers to appealadverse rulings in hopes that they can convince an appeals court or the Supreme Court that their restrictions on employment of women are in fact bona fide under this provision
100 Bills Affecting Women Are Still Before Congress,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/08/archives/100-bills-affecting-women-are-still-before-congress.html,WASHINGTON July 7Over 100 bills and resolutions that would affect women have been introduced in the 95th Congress Legislation that is still pending includes The Labor HEW Appropriations Act The House version included an amendment that would prohibit the use of Medicaid funds to finance abortions The Senate version would bar Medicaid funds for abortions except when the mothers life is in danger and in other cases where abortions are considered medically necessarj and in cases of rape or incest The differences between the two versions must be ironed out in conference committee before the bill can become law The Pregnancy Disability Act It would amend Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy Intended to overturn the effects of December Supreme Court decision that termed pregnancy a unique condition that employers are not required to treat as an insured disability the bill would require employers to cover pregnant workers under temporary disability and health insurance plans and would prohibit discrimination against pregnant women in all other aspects of employment Both the House and Senate have completed hearings on the proposal Parttime employment and flexible hours A number of bills have been introduced that would encourage the employment of workers on a parttime basis Other bills would authorize Federal employees and agencies to experiment with flexible work hours and compressed work schedules These bilis would have the greatest impact on homemakers particularly those with young children and on the elderly The bills have not emerged from committee The Federal Retirement Income Equity Act This bill would provide prorated share of retirement benefits for former spouses either divorced of widowed who have been married for at least 20 years to a Civil Service employee The bill however would not provide for retroactive benefits Although hearings have been held it is still in the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee The Displaced Homemakers Act The bill has been introduced in both the House and Senate and referred to committee The measure would establish 50 service centers for displaced homemakers widowed or divorced spouses who have lost their source of income The centers would provide counseling training and referral services for employment The House begins hearings on Thursday the Senate version is in committee but no hearings have been scheduled The Public Assistance Amendments of 1977 The bill would make permanent an increase of 200 million in social services funds which would include money to upgrade standards in daycare facilities and would increase Federal funds for foster care and adoption subsidies The bill has passed the House but remains in the Senate Finance Committee where hearings are scheduled this month Privacy for Rape Victims Act Both versions of the bill which would protect rape victims from crossexamination on their sexual histories in Federal courts are in committee
MITE HOUSE BACKS SUBSIDY FOR ADOPTING UNWANTED CHILDREN,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/09/archives/white-house-backs-subsidy-for-adopting-unwanted-children-califano.html,WASHINGTON July 8The Carter Administration plans to endorse next week legislation that would provide Government subsidies to families that adopt hardtoplace children Joseph A Califano Jr the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare disclosed the plans in an interview this week He said that the subsidies which could amount to several thousand dollars a year to each family as long as their adopted child was dependent would be part of the Administrations effort to find alternatives to abortion The Administrations support of adoption subsidies represents a change in position Last spring officials testified against the concept on the basis of the belief of the White House Office of Management and Budget that it would be too expensive Nonetheless the House of Representatives approved last month a bill that would provide for such subsidies The measure is now before the Senate Finance Committee Mondale Advocates Plan Mr Califano said that the Administrations turnabout was in large part the result of Vice President Mondeles longstanding advocacy of the idea and of the fact that President Carter expressed interest in it in recent weeks Other officials gave two further reasons for the change in position First they said the Presidents support of legislation forbidding the use of Federal money for most abortions and the Supreme Courts ruling last month indicating that such legislation was probably constitutional made it politically imperative for the Administration to support alternatives to abortion Second they said the Administration hoped to influence the shape of the Housepassed legislation involving adoption which seems likely to become law in some form Some Hard to Place Generally there is a shortage of children available for adoption But older orphans and those who are handicapped chronically ill or members of sonic minority groups often cannot be placed in adoption The Government now spends about 170 million in welfare payments each year to 117000 such children who are in foster homes or institutions If the same children are adopted however they normally lose their Federal assistance under current law It doesnt make any sense Mr Califano said of the law We pay for foster care in homes and institutions but if you love the kid and want to adopt him we cut you off The Secretary said that he believed one of the main reasons the children in foster homes had not been adopted was that families could not afford the high cost of medical treatment special education and rehabilitation they require The Administrations proposal will have two main parts Mr Califano said The first would provide Federal funds to pay couples who adopt the hardtoplace children The second would provide the states with money to improve their adoption procedures The Administrations plan differs from that approved by the House in the following principal respects 9The Administration would allow subsidies only to families with low and moderate incomes while the House bill would make them available to anyone whose adopted child met the criteria 9The Administration would pay the subsidies each year as long as the child remained a minor while the House bill would not allow subsidies after a year in most instances unless there were unusual medical expenses 9The Administration would allow a child to remain eligible for Medicaid even if his adoptive parents were not eligible while the House bill would not era so Mr Califano said that he hoped the adoption subsidies proposal could be severed from the Housepassed bill and enacted separately The House measure contains a number of provisions involving public assistance that do not relate to adoption In addition several senators have indicated that they hope to attach various pet projects to the bill

WHITE HOUSE BACKS SUBSIDY FOR ADOPTING UNWANTED CHILDREN,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/09/archives/white-house-backs-subsidy-for-adopting-unwanted-children.html,WASHINGTON July 8The Carter Administration plans to endorse next week legislation that would provide Government subsidies to families that adopt hardtoplace children Joseph A Califano Jr the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare disclosed the plans in an interview this week He said that the subsidies which could amount to several thousand dollars a year to each family as long as their adopted child was dependent would be part of the Administrations effort to find alternatives to abortion The Administrations support of adoption subsidies represents a change in position Last spring officials testified against the concept on the basis of the belief of the White House Office of Management and Budget that it would be too expensive Nonetheless the House of Representatives approved last month a bill that would provide for such subsidies The measure is now before the Senate Finance Committee Mondale Advocates Plan Mr Califano said that the Administrations turnabout was in large part the result of Vice President Mondales longstanding advocacy of the idea and of the fact that President Carter expressed interest in it in recent weeks Other officials gave two further reasons for the change in position First they said the Presidents support of legislation forbidding the use of Federal money for most abortions and the Supreme Courts ruling last month indicating that such legislation was probably constitutional made it politically imperative for the Administration to support alternatives to abortion Second they said the Administration hoped to influence the shape of the Housepassed legislation involving adoption which seems likely to become law in some form Some Hard to Place Generally there is a shortage of children available for adoption But older orphans and those who are handicapped chronically ill or members of some minority groups often cannot be placed in adoption The Government now spends about 170 million in welfare payments each year to 117000 such children who are in foster homes or institutions If the same children are adopted however they normally lose their Federal assistance under current law It doesnt make any sense Mr Califano said of the law We pay for foster care in homes and institutions but if you love the kid and want to adopt him we cut you off The Secretary said that he believed one of the main reasons the children in foster homes had not been adopted was that families could not afford the high cost of medical treatment special education and rehabilitation they require The Administrations proposal will have two main parts Mr Califano said The first would provide Federal funds to pay couples who adopt the hardtoplace children The second would provide the states with money to improve their adoption procedures The Administrations plan differs from that approved by the House in the following principal respects 9The Administration would allow subsidies only to families with low and moderate incomes while the House bill would make them available to anyone whose adopted child met the criteria 9The Administration would pay the subsidies each year as long as the child remained a minor while the House bill would not allow subsidies after a year in most instances unless there were unusual medical expenses 9The Administration would allow a child to remain eligible for Medicaid even if his adoptive parents were not eligible while the House bill would not era so Mr Califano said that he hoped the adoption subsidies proposal could be severed from the Housepassed bill and enacted separately The House measure contains a number of provisions involving public assistance that do not relate to adoption In addition several senators have indicated that they hope to attach various pet projects to the bill
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/10/archives/letters-the-b1-decision-and-the-arms-race-giftgiving-an-old-korean.html,The B1 Decision and the Arms Race To the Editor Tom Wicker has said it best July 3 president Carter has earned an A1 on the B1 His decision was victory for moral courage and clear thinking Great consequences follow 1 The decision was not merely against the B1 It was for a far superior less costly and less vulnerable nuclear delivery system based on the strategic cruise missile which I had described as our ace in the hole in a Jan 21 letter It not only strengthens the air component but since it can also be launched from land or sea is an important auxiliary of our entire triadic system of nuclear defense 2 The decision marks the first stage of a realistic reassessment of our selfdeceptive doctrine of mutual deterrence which was never accepted by the Russians and succeeded only in deterring us 3 The cruise missile is by this decision inextricably incorporated into our strategic planning into the 1980s and has thus been irrevocably placed outside the framework of the SALT 11 negotiations Consequently the entire approach to SALT II and its link to Mutual Balanced Force Reduction must be rethought on both sides with return to fundamentals 4 The fundamentals are that the ineluctable laws of war are not repealed by technology or by wishful thinking As Clausewitz taught the object of war grand strategy will always be victory for which military superiority material and strategic is quintessential In the nuclear age nuclear war and conventional war are complements not alternatives Consequently for victory or to avoid defeat it is necessary to have both a firststrike capacity and the capability of conducting or halting a superblitzkrieg The Russian Communist leaders following the early teachings of Engels who was also a profound Clausewitzean military thinker have always understood this have armed and the of achieving it if they have not already done so Will we grasp this lesson in time 5 The cruise missile Is not an absolute weapon there is none but it can help to buy us what is desperately needed timetime to meet and turn the Russian challenge if we have the understanding and will 6 The prospects for world peace would visibly improve if our President would explain to the people that we cannot continue along the present path deluding ourselves that saline solutions like SALT II III etc can prevent or alter the laws of war He must help us to summon the courage to look into the abyss and say The only escape for nations from the scourge of war is for the great powers to transcend both SALT H and MBFR and to move together to destroy the capacity to make warthrough rapid mutual progressive disarmament both nuclear and conventional with onsite inspection and verification at each stage with open borders and free movements of peoples There is no other way But if that fails and without mutuality it must fail there is no choice but for America with its Sisyphean task New York July 4 ELIAS M SCHWARZBART GiftGiving An Old Korean Custom To the Editor The House ethics committee with Is recent decision tr establish Korean connections among members of Congress embarked upor a rather dubious course of action which might tarnish the integrity of honorable men and women due to its failure to consider the practice of giftgiving within the context of Korean customs It seems that the Park Tongsun episode has been blown out of proportion because of the lack of understanding of the rather extravagant giftgiving practices among Koreans Giftgiving carries an entirely different connotation in this country where a gift is usually cherished for its token value or the thoughtfulness the gift embodies while in Korea a gift is considered an expression of sharing oneself with others Giftgiving clearly signifies a fine Oriental virtue of generous selfgiving In Korea for instance Dutchtreating among friends is absolutely abhorredindeed unheardof Anyoneincluding some of the vehement critics of the Korean Governmentwho is familiar with Korean culture would not find lavish giftgiving practices out of bounds or en attempt to compromise the integrity of the recipient Needless to say the fault lies with the givers who did not comprehend the possible misunderstanding their giftgiving might entail But it should not be considered such a morally reprehensible act inasmuch as gifts were given in most instances by Koreans who feel eternally Indebted to the American people for what they have done for them This is not to suggest that obvious cases of outright attempts to buy intluence should go unpunished but the committee should take into account the delicate cultural differences in the giftgiving practice and not go ovqm board in its investigations Assoc Prof Political Science Georgia State Unify Atlanta July 5 1977 NACK YOUNG AN Inferior Stamp Glue To the Editor The Post Office seems to have hit upon an ingenious new fundrais19g deviceinferior glue Several tirhes during the last weeks I have had letters returned for postage as the stamps had simply fallen off in transit or selfdestructed in the mailbox Some of them were large letters to Europe which amounted to quite a large double investment My complaint to the FDR Station led to the serious suggestion that I go to the information counter for a lesson in stamplicking I politely declined Surely the service is bad enough without being charged twiPa for it in cnrh a devious way New York July 2 1977 ROOERICK COO Charity or Malice Toward Those Who Fled Draft To the Editor On January 21 President Carter issued a general pardon for draft resisters who fled conscription in the Vietnam War He further ordered an individual review for those who entered the military and then were given undesirable discharges for violation of the Military Code Congress now proposes that funds be denied for the upgrading of military discharges and for the reentry of the 2000 or more young men who fled the draft Thus we again face tin delicate problem of Executive versus Congressional power A page from history is instructive In July of 1862 Congress authorized the seizure and confiscation of all property owned by those participating in the existing rebellion The property was to be sold and the proceeds deposited in the Treasury Those who had not given aid or comfort to the rebellion could eue for damages resulting from erroneous seizure In December of ISti3 Presieent Lincoln issued a blanket pardon offering the return of all seized property to those who abandoned the rebellion In late December of 1864 the Union Army laid siege to Savannah where Edward Padelford a major banker had stored over a thousand bales of cotton that was subsequently seized He immediately took the oath of amnesty and allegiance and sued for the return of his seized cotton The Supreme Court affirmed a judgment of more than 100000 in his favor Congress promptly amended a pending appropriations bill to deny all funds for the payment of judgments based on the Presidential pardon Defending this action the Attorney General in US v Klein argued that Congress alone has the power to dispose of United States properties and therefore in spite of the pardon could deny altogether or condition the disposal of seized property But the Supreme Court held otherwise saying To the Executive alone is intrusted the power of pardon and it is clear that the Legislature cannot change the effect of such a pardon any more than the Executive can change a law Hamilton wrote in The Federalist that because the sense of responsibility is always the strongest in proportion as it is undivided the Presidents pardoning power should be as little as possible fettered or embarrassed He added that without easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel Thus the question over two centuries Should we bear the mien of charity or of malice History and President Carter opt for charity One hopes Congress on sober reflection will too Member of Congress 4th Dist N J Washington July 1 1977 FRANK THOMPSON Jr To the Editor Tne first goal e the B1 campaign was to terminate the weapons system itself This was clearly accomplished The second goal was to expose the cozy connections that tie together the corporations the Pentagon the labor unions and the Congress to show how weapons systems are conceived approved funded promoted produced and deployed This too was accomplished in some degree The third goal was to raise fundamental questions about the meaning of national security and the militarization of American foreign policy using the B1 as symbol par excellence Our success or failure in achieving this goal will be revealed in the weeks immediately ahead To the extent that the Administration is allowed to replace an obsolescent technology the manned bomber with a new and even more dangerous technology the cruise missile it can be assumed that the public the press and the Congress have failed to learn the most crucial lessons of the B1 campaign Chmn North Shore Committee Clergy  Laity Concerned Wilmette 111 July 4 1977  To the Editor The recent B1 decision will make some people happy But before they rejoice too much theyd better consider some of the fallout from that decision Deciding not to produce B1s will not recover the 5 billion already committed or necessary to complete the research and development which Mr Carter has promised to finish To this must be added another 5 billion to update the B52 fleet add cruise missiles etc In computing costs of the B1 critics like to use the Pentagons technique of lifecycle costing whereas they frequently leave off lifecycle costs for competitive systems Last night I heard commentators say that the 100 million B1 will be replaced by the 500000 cruise missile ignoring many factors like RD spare and maintenance etc But the largest effect is likely to be elsewhere than in the immediate costs of the systems Deciding not to replace the ancient B52 we will be under pressure to replace the Minuteman with the MX a silo buster of extreme accuracy and cost And once we 14unch into production on the cruise missile there is no way we can predict the outcome The Soviets will be compelled to build their own and just as we were disappointed when they did not stop at 1000 landbased ICBMs we will be disappointed with their decision to build more cruise missiles than we build Also we will be completely confused about how many they have built where they are stored or what they expect to do with them The President is moving away from a world of known weapons systems where all major weapons can be counted and tracked for a worldof imponderables about weapons He could not have found a way to add more to the arms race than he has done by this decision As in the case of Minuteman he will have traded a temporary advantage in technology for a loosened control over weapons in general If we thought the triad was a valid concept why must we go on to the tetrad with all the problems a whole new weapons system entails Falls Church Va July 1 1UY The writer is former Secretary of the Air Force ROBERT A CLELAND JOHN L MCLUCAS Morality and Abortion To the Editor The Timess June 22d editorial on

When Is a Right a Right?,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/10/archives/when-is-a-right-a-right.html,On June 27 the House of Representatives approved without debate an amendment that would prevent Federal funds from being used to provide legal assistance in any proceeding or litigation arising out of disputes or controversies on the issue of homosexuality or socalled gay rights That was lust a week after the Supreme Court ruled that Federal funds need not be used to pay for abortions for poor women and after the Senate voted that Federal funds could not be used for such abortions except when medically necessary Thus a peculiar link was forged between the abortion and the gayrights issues In its 1973 decision on the matter the Court had seemed to say that a woman had a constitutional right to an abortion if she so chose The act to which the antigay amendment was attached by the Housethe Legal Assistance Act  seems to say that lack of means should not interfere with a citizens ability to vindicate his or her legal rights Yet the Court and Congress now are saying that poor women in need of Federal funds to pay for an abortion will have to do without and the House is saying that poor homosexuals in need of Federal funds to fight for their legal rights will have to do without The antigay amendment introduced by Representative Larry McDonald of Geogia and whisked through the House 230 to 133no doubt in deference to Anita Bryant  is doubly ironic A act designed to provide legal assistance to the poor is made to discriminate against certain kinds of poor people and an amendment designed to discriminate against homosexuals leaves affluent homosexuals untouched A poor homosexual must be deemed more despicable than a rich homosexual by the House of Representatives But surely the Senate which takes up the Legal Assistance Act this month will correct this shabby bit of legislative pornography To let the McDonald amendment stand would be to deny some citizens the ability to defend or seek their legal rights while providing federally funded legal assistance for all others in need of it If that isnt a violation of the equal protection of the laws what is The Court and Congressional actions on abortion cannot be so easily repaired Yet the inequity is as great and the consequences will be far more costly in dollars immediately and in social and economic debility later on Since that view was expressed in this space following the Supreme Court decision last month numerous letters have denounced the idea that it is inequitable to guarantee affluent women the right to elective abortions while refusing to provide Federal funds for women too poor to pay for their abortions The poor have a right to travel too the letterwriters frequently argued but nobody proposes that the Government should pay for itor for say the right of the poor to live as well as the affluent Just because a poor woman has a legal right to an abortion does that mean the Government has to pay for it if she cant Well numerous cases have held in effect that a constitutional right that someone is prevented from exercising is a violated right When a landlord in Mississippi threatens to evict a black tenant if he dares to exercise his right to vote the tenant is effectively denied his rights The Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the courts that upheld it declared that the Government had to enforce that tenants rights Other cases have held that the children of the poor have a right to an equal share of state funds for education A wealthy school district cannot constitutionally spend as much as it IN THE NATION wishes on its pupils while another school district in the same state is forced to provide inadequate educational funds because it has a lower tax base Some form of equalization of education expenditures is required to vindicate poor childrens rights Even in the abortion matter lower courts held onsistentlyafter the 1973 decisibn  that the principle of the equal protection of the laws was violated by a state decision to pay for childbirth but not for an abortion each of which is an elective decision by the mother The Supreme Court ruled otherwise but there nevertheless remains a sound constitutional and intellectual basis for the argument that to deny federally funded abortions to women who cannot otherwise pay for them is effectively to deny them a right guaranteed to other women Most correspondents argued too that since they were morally opposed to abortion the state had no right to spend their tax money to finance abortions Of course there are those of us who are morally opposed to war too and the neutron bomb and wiretapping and capital punishment and political repression in South Korea etc The point is not anyway the morality or constitutionality of abortions which the Court dealt with in 1973 The point now is that poor women alone are being made dependent on private charity or backstreet butchers Some right that is
Court Hearing Set On Abortion Funding,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/10/archives/new-jersey-weekly-court-hearing-set-on-abortion-funding-hearing-on.html,THE social implications of recent new rulings on abortions have not been completely weighed as yet But in New Jersey both sides agree that they will be significant There are estimates that welfare costs in the state could be increased by as much as 30 million a year and that the indirect cost could be much more The current dispute centers around the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions for thiise women who cannot afford the cost of such an operation 300 to 500 New Jersey has a law prohibiting the use of such funds or even special Federal grants to pay for abortions unless they are clearly needed to save the life of the mother The exact status of this law is now being determined and arguments on its constitutionality will be heard in Federal Court in Trenton on July 18 The law was passed in 1975 but it has never been enforced Before it could take effect the Federal courts ordered it held in abeyance while the Federal Government decided whether states could prohibit the use of Medicaid funds for abortions Recently the United States Supreme Court ruled on severah cases dealing with the subject In June it held that states have the right to prohibit the use of Medicaid funds to pay for elective abortions and it is now pondering whether Congress can impose a similar restriction Proabortionists view such a finding as a probable death knell for the use of tax dollars to pay for abortions in New Jersey In the state in recent years Medicaid has been paying for 10000 or so abortions annually in almost every instance the woman involved was either on welfare or was eligible for it Ann E Levine director of the New Jersey Family Planning Public Affairs Office a private nonprofit group said that in 1975 the United States Department of Health Education and Welfare had estimated that it cost 3000 a year to take care of a mother and child on welfare However Mrs Levine notes that the indirect cost is often much higher than 3000 because many such children require more and more services as they grow older If the New Jersey law prohibiting Medicaid abortions is upheld there may be a stepup in family planningthe advising of women of the various methods of contraception There are now 23 family planning clinics in New Jersey Ten are associated with Planned Parenthood a nonprofit organization that offers advice to women three are supported by hospitals four by county health departments four by community action groups and two are financed privately In 1976 about 41 million was spent in New Jersey dispensing advice information and in some instances contraceptives and for abortions Of this total 35 million came from Federal grants 125000 from the state and 500000 from private organizations The states Department of Health reported in a statement submitted to the Federal Court that Medicaidfinanced abortions in New Jersey had been increasing each year since they were begun in 1974 In the first year there were 5500 such abortions costing 1792000 an average of about 325 each This was broken down to show hospital costs of 185 physician fees of 125 and related clinical services of 15 In 1975 there were 8300 Medicaid abortions in New Jersey costing 27 million last year there were 10000 costing 35 million It has been predicted that there will be 11000 abortions this year costing 41 million Public Health officials estimate that of the 15 million New Jersey women of childbearing age about 10 percent will get pregnant in any given year Of tIpse 155000 who get pregnant about 18200 will have miscarriages on spontaneous abortions and 45000 will have indifFed abortions The abortion issue has become a very emotional one and may yet emerge in the 1978 gubernatorial race For example State Senator Anthony Imperiale of Newark one of the most active of th0 independent candidates for governor is intensely antiabortion and the antiabortionists have demonstrated considerable politcal influence in the last 18 months Earlier this year under urging from the New Jersey Right to Life Committee the Legislature adopted a resolution asking Congress to call a conventioq to consider an amendment to the Federal Constitution that would outlaw abortions altogether in the United States It is widely believed that many antiabortionists also are against increased welfare programs but the executive director of the New Jesey Right to Life Committee Christopher Smith said that this was not accurate I am willing to pay more taxes for welfare and many others in our organization feel the same way said Mr Smith He became interested in stopping abortions after getting involved in the subject during a debate while a student at Trenton State College The American Civil Liberties Uniod nonprofit legal organization that specializes in protecting lost causes bas spelled out some of the dangers of ending Medicaid abortions The rich will continue to have accEss to safe quiet abortions and the poor will be forced into the back alley butcher shops as was the case prior to 1973 the group said

An Inquiry Into the Coming Excess,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/12/archives/an-inquiry-into-the-coming-excess.html,After many an artful dodge our leaders have finally come clean about where they really stand on abortion They are against it for poor people All of them are agreed on this point President Carter Congress The Supreme Court Thats a unanimity you dont often see in Washington As a result poor people must now produce more unwanted children What is behind this decision to boost the unwantedchild supply How do unwanted children and the poor feel about it Will it throw a monkey wrench into the SALT talks What does it mean for the future of prize fighting To answer these and a host of similar questions we interviewed the usual broad spectrum of American society starting with Sims Lovelace a 43yearold pauper and father of 17 children 15 of them unwanted except by the FBI Actually Im kind of glad the Government wants me to get back into production said Lovelace For three or four years there what with the missus getting Governmentsubsidized abortions every time another unwanted little nipper threatened to loom on the horizon I felt like the Government didnt want my work I was being quashed more often than a politicians indictments Now ready to resume grinding out unwanted children at his nations call Lovelace believes the new policy means war is in the offing Not so insists Ursula Wegg an unwanted child Ursula believes the new policy is part of a Government conspiracy Involving the neutron bomb which was being secretly developed and tested at the time the politicians were pretending that the right to life at least for unwanted pauperswas the thing uppermost in their minds Face it said cynical 7yearold Ursula those hypocrites down in Washington will pay billions for the latest bomb but not one cent for holding down the flow of unwanted paupers Why If you ask me I think they want to have plenty of unwanted paupers on hand to test their neutron bomb on The coarse cynicism of these remarks from a mere 7yearold reveals how severely a child may be scarred by being unwanted It also reinforces the argument that persons of this sort would make appropriate subjects for the testing of a neutron bomb A more profound insight came from Yelberton Crankshaw swindler For years Crankshaw has made millions by milking the Government of funds earmarked for lifes losers What youve got here basically said Crankshaw is a Government effort to fill a gap for us swindlers Youve got your Government oldage programs which enrich crooked doctors and nursinghome thieves And youve got your midlife programs where a hardworking crook can rip off the welfare the unemployment the food stamps and so forth Up to now however the Government has provided very little help for the swindler who hopes to get rich by abusing children Crankshaw foresees a Federal child adoption program aimed at changing unwanted children into wanted children And if I know the Government he said they will try to do it with money You take an unwanted kid put it up for adoption and nobody wants it Why Its an unwanted kid thats why So what do you do If youre the Government you put the kid on the block stuff a wad of money in his pocket and suddenly that unwanted kid is wanted Crooks like me will be adopting unwanted kids by the thousands Crankshaws belief that the new program is designed to encourage fresh ventures in racketeering may be farfetched There are already so many opportunities for swindling the Governments welfare programs that there arent nearly enough crooks to operate Federal swindles efficiently With a big surge in the population of unwanted paupers however this deficiency can be overcome and the nation can attain maximum efficiency in criminal acquisition of Federal funds by the end of the century One does not fancy todays unwanted pauper children becoming tomorrows wellheeled crooks One prefers them to remain sweet miserable unwanted little children about whose existence one can feel tender and morally upright It is annoying that such rewarding creatures should turn to swindling particularly If they do it successfully
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/12/archives/letters.html,To the Editor While agreeing with your editorial advocacy of adjustment assistance as an alternative to import restriction When Free Trade Hurts June 30 I believe that your statement on the shortcomings of freetrade proponents in this matter is too sweeping It does not apply to some of us You said that freetrade advocates have proposed no realistic alternatives to orderly marketing agreements the new protectionism that is gaining popularity as less objectionable than tariffs and import quotas The socalled free traders most of whom unfortunately shy away from advocating free trade do indeed support adjustment assistance But to this extent you are right they have with Very few exceptions done nothing to seek a more effective adjustmentassistanCe program They did not participate in the adjUstrnentassistance oversight hearings of the House Ways and Means Committee And they have not advocated a fullemployment policy as an essential ingredient in an affective adjustment strategyan ingredient that would make free trade more acceptable to labor You conimendably attack orderly marketing agreements as only a milder form of protectionism and you correctly imply that freetrade advocates most if you please not all have come to accept them at least as being preferable to import quotas or higher tariffs Thtliberaltrade community as a whole goes into political action when major protectionist legislation gets moving in Congress But other types of legislated protectionism get no such attention and international negotiation seems to give orderly marketing agreements a respectability they do not merit The freetrade advocates have themselves to blame for much that has gone wrong with US trade policy DAVID J STFINBERG President US Council for an Open World Economy Washington June 30 1977  To the Editor Those who recognize the inadequacy of an unqualified freetrade argument find your editorial of June 30 very gratifying It shows a new awareness of the consequences of free trade in industries rhich employ large numbers of workers with low transferable skills Xdjustment assistance shows little sign of being adequate to the task The Federal Government has never shown itself capable of effective retraining and redeployment in peacetime Money grants are not enough The dignity of productive employment is essential Yet the domestic economy shows no sign of increasing its demand for unskilled workers who dominate the unemployment rolls Moreover the problem seems to be growing as the ranks of the unskilled swell by more than the can accommodate Far better to protect textiles and footwear than to add to the permanently displaced The NorthSouth probiem can be met by the payment of a fine in terms of foreign aid equal to the cost of our protection to the frustrated exporters The extension of protection to steel and automobiles is not inevitable if political spine is available One solution which may be preferable to protection through quotas or tariffs is the payment of a subsidy to importcompeting industries according to the number of unskilled workers which they employ Such a step would obviously require a quid pro quo from the industry and from the unions to insure that the subsidy served its intended purpose H PETER GRAY Visiting Professor of International Business New York University New York June 30 1977 Two Classes of Care Child Misuse Obscene by Definition To the Editor Incredible as it seems the Supreme Court has mandated and HEW is about to implement that there shall be two classes of medical care one for those who can pay and one for those who cannot This is exactly what the recent decision disallowing the expenditure of Medicaid funds for elective abortions will amount to With all the efforts being made to equalize medical care in the United States today this is an incredible development One wonders parenthetically what the policy will be in that vast network of federally funded military and veterans hospitals In the light of what is about to happen it is imperative that qualified physicians working with privately funded health care facilities do their utmost to correct this inequity between those who can and those who cannot afford a medical service which the Supreme Court has declared to be a constitutional right HUGH AUCHINCLOSS MD Associate Clinical Professor of Surgery Columbia College of Physicians  Surgeons Ridgewood N J July 2 1977 To the Editor On June 29 The Times reported that various groups such as The Association of American Publishers and The American Library Association were urging Governor Carey to veto the bill before him protecting children from sexual exploitation for commercial or other purposes My outraged surprise at this action by groups who should know better was turned into horror upon reading the Topics column in your July 1 edition First the bill passed by the Legislature but later withdrawn is an amendment to the Child Abuse and Neglect statutes not an antipornography bill Therefore words such as obscene do not apply There is no obscene or nonobscene burning flaying or beating of a child Likewise there is no obscene or nonobScene sexual performance Every use of a child for exploitive sexual needs of an adult is obscene by definition There are no First Amendment issues here The First Amendment was written to protect freedom of expression not freedom of action One should not be able to defend the ovens at Auschwitz because they were part of a Cecil B de Mille spectacular Unless the Governor signs such leg islation the law now stands as follows It is prohibited for a man to have Intercourse with his fiveyearold daughter but not for him to hire her out as an actress to star in a film where she is repeatedly raped as long as Uwe is a disclaimer that such does not reflect on her personal conduct In the latter instance her emotional psychological or physical needs remain unprotected On January 13 1977 knowing that the United States produces each month over 264 different pornographic magazines using children Odyssey Institute began the campaign against the use of children for pornographic purposes not against pornography On that date only six states in the Union so safeguarded their children Connecticut North Carolina North Dakota South Carolina Tennessee and Texas and now Rhode Island I urge all New Yorkers who care about children to press the Governor for prompt action New York along with California the leading producer of kiddie porn must join the states that protect rather than destroy children JUDLANNE DENSENGERBER MD President Odyssey Institute New York July 6 1977 Gulf Oils Involvement With the Uranium Cartel Where Were the Auditors To the Editor Congratulations on your June 18 editorial Gulf Cartels and Corporate Citizenship wherein you refer to the overt collusive conduct by officials of Gulf Oil Corporation in the implementation of a uranium cartel The details of that involvement surfaced during the course of hearings by a Congressional oversight committee These disclosures coincide with the recent revelations of bribery by Gulf offidials of representatives of the Internal Revenue Service who were auditing the corporations income tax returns What seems already to have been forgotten are the tales of perfidious conduct told just two years ago at the hearings of a Senate subcommittee that of multinational corporations of the Committee on Foreign Relations It was these tales involving illegal and illicit payments to officials and political parties in Korea and Italy as well as the United States which prompted a cri de coeur from the committees chairman Senator Frank Church It is time for plain speaking A cancer is eating away at the vitals of Western society and that cancer is corruption corruption on an endemic scale But all this is prologue to pointing up that Gulf has for decades been the subject of independent audit by Price Waterhouse le Company a firm which is according to the testimony of its senior partner before another Senate committeethat headed by Senator Lee Metcalf Investigating the Accounting Establishment one of the oldest and one of the most proficient and respected of the independent accounting firms in the country and in the world That senior partners assertion is undoubtedly fair but merely serves to underscore the questions In the light of that proclaimed proficiency and high regard where were the auditors while all of these perfidious acts were being perpetrated Where should they have been Undoubtedly after this round of Metcalf committee hearings the auditors will be somewhat more regarding their debits and credit But how will they move to respond to the essential demands of society fir the auditors assurances of complete visibility and accountability from our major corporations My professional colleagues should be much informed by the observation by SEC Chairman Harold M Wil Hams testifying before the Metcalf committee that society has become much more concerned with the ethics of corporate management and the impact of corporate behavior and a fundamental challenge facing the [accounting] profession is the need to understand its role in meeting these new demands Just a decade ago Justice William 0 Douglas writing about the corresponding burdens then sought to be imposed on the independent auditing profession concluded If the accounting profession does not respond effectively to the challenges presented there may be little alternative but to hive possibly a new profession fill the breach Gulf Oil at al are clear manifestations that during the intervening decade the accounting profession had not met the challenges to which Justice Douglas alluded Will it commit itself to doing so in the immediate future Let it be remembered that we are ten years closer to the dismal alternative ABRAHAM J BRILOFF New York July 1 1977 The writer is Emanuel Saxe Distinguished Professor of Accountancy at Baruch College of the City University  Gulf Role Within the Law To the Editor You editorialized on June 18 regarding Gulfs participation in a foreign uranium carte suggesting that our participation therein reflects adversely on our position as a good corporate nitizen of the United States Unfortunately for corporations that attempt to operate on an international basis the concept of corporate citizenship is recognized by the host countries at well as the home countries of multinationals The United States demands that foreign corporations operating within its borders adhere to certain regulations that their homelands might not require The same can be said of foreign governments of the countries in which Gulf is required to operate Indeed when Gulf was forced by the power of subpoena to surrender certain documents pertaining to the cartel to Congress we were severely criticized by the Canadian Government The Canadian Governments sensitivity to this issue is more understandable when it is recognized that one of the reasons it helped form the uranium marketing arrangement was in response to the United States Governments efforts to control the uranium market by banning the use of foreign uranium in US reactors With our nations system of regulation and justice corporations and citizens are alike expected to avoid violating established precepts When viola tions are deemed to have occurred by the authorities they are dealt with through legal procedures Gulf is convinced that its participation in the uranium marketing arrangement was within the strictures of the law WILLIAM E MOFFETT Vice President Gulf Oil Corporation Pittsburgh July 1 1977 Ewing Galloway
President Defends Court's Action Curbing Federal Aid for Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/13/archives/new-jersey-pages-president-defends-courts-action-curbing-federal.html,WASHINGTON July 12  President Carter conceded today that denial of Federal aid for abortions could discriminate against poor women but he said that there are many things in life that are not fair and that the Government should not attempt to make opportunities precisely equal when morality was at issue Mr Carters remarks at a nationally televised news conference were unusually blunt for a sitting President and seemed to suggest that he believed there were inherent limitations on the Governments obligation to right economic injustice He said the denial of abortion aid to poor women though unfair did not alter his support of the recent Supreme Court decision that states were not obliged to spend Medicaid funds for elective abortions He said the Courts ruling should be interpreted very strictly [Question 9 Page A101 Called President of the Rich Some members of Congress and civil libertarians reacted sharply to the Presidents statements Aryeh Neier executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union said in New York that Mr Carter had shown that he is the President of the rich Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan Democrat of New York who does not approve of abortion personally said nonetheless There are minimum social services that everyone must be provided with and access to abortion as a last resort is one of them The President told reporters assembled in the Executive Office Building that he knew as well as anyone in the country having faced this issue during a long campaign that there were intense sentimeats on both sides of the abortion issue But he said his own judgment was that the Supreme Courts rulings now are adequate and they are reasonably fair and that the Federal Government should not be required or encouraged to finance abortions except in cases involving a threat to the prospective mothers life rape or incest Mr Carter was asked how fair he believed it was that women who can afford to get an abortion can go ahead and have one and women who cannot afford to are precluded from this Well he answered as you know there are many things in life that are not fair that wealthy people can afford and poor people cant But I dont believe that the Federal Government should take action to try to make these opportunities exactly equal particularly when there is a moral factor involved Mr Carters statement on abortion was the strongest of his Presidency although consistent with his support of the Court on the subject It differed somewhat in tone from his campaign position that while he personally opposed abortion he supported the Supreme Court decision leaving the matter to the discretion of a woman and her doctor in the early months of pregnancy Earlier today Vice President Mondale and Joseph A Califano Jr the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare announced an Administration proposal to provide Government subsidies to families that adopt hardtoplace children Mr Califano described the plan as obviously an alternative to abortion He also said the Administration endorsed legislation to allow the Government to pay maternity expenses of women planning to put their babies up for adoption The adoption proposal is similar to legislation passed by the House of Representatives last month and pending in the Senate Finance Committee It seems likely to become law in some form On other topics Mr Carter made the following points Massive Soviet interception of airborne American telephone communications governmental and private did not constitute an aggressive act [Question 41 His relations with Congress are improving as legislators get to know him better [Question 10] He has interviewed only two of the five men on the list of possible directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation he will interview two more this week and the choice may not be limited to those five [Question 11] The lack of Investor confidence in the stock market reflects a worldwide unease over the economic future not a lack of confidence in his Administration [Question 5] On the subject of Soviet tampering with American telephone communications the President said such practice has become a common ability for nations to pursue Its not an act of aggression or war its completely passive he added When I became President 1 asked to have a multidepartmental assessment of the threat to our own security he continued We have been embarked since in the United States were taking the same impervious to intercept those telephone lines that were involved directly in national security for instance the lines going into and out of the Defense Department and my own office He said some commercial companies lin the United States were taking the same precautions primarily by using underground cables instead of air transmissions to carry calls The New York Times reported Sunday that the Administration was completing a topsecret plan to protect against communications intrusions by foreign governments by corporations and even by criminal groups U S Monitoring Reported The Times account also said that the National Security Agency had been monitoring some domestic longdistance calls by Americans in part to keep track of foreign agents in the United States and in part to monitor Soviet eavesdropping Mr Carter said that while he still had some disagreements with Congresson nuclear breeder reactors and on water projects for examplehe thought in general theres been a good and mature working relationship between us He cited passage of his economic stimulus package and authorization for Government reorganization The authorization for the new department of energy will be completed I think within the next few days he added The Congress has made good progress on strict ethics legislation I think we have made good progress also in the effectuating of the energy policy which is very controversial very difficult and requires a great deal of courage on the part of the Congress I think the Congress now understands much more clearly what I am what I hand for what proposals we put forward and the priorities accruing to those proposals On New FBI Director The President said he was not yet sure whether he would go outside the list of five potential nominees for director of the FBI The list was provided by a selection commission he appointed to search for a replacement for Clarence M Kelley who will retire Jan 1 Ive only met so far with two of the five Mr Carter said I think this week Im scheduled to meet with two others and Ill meet with the fifth one And then the Attorney General and I will decide together whether or not to interview others There has been growing criticism about the original list to the effect that the commission had not adequately screened the backgrounds of the five candidates Attorney General Griffin B Bell said yesterday that there was another person Hes in the back of my mindin the back of the President mind There was speculation in law enforce ment circles that the sixth person was Georgiaborn John Mintz 41 years old counsel to the bureau Mr Mintz was among the final contenders when the commission was making its list Despite some signs of impending fiscal problems Mr Carter said he was generally optimistic about the economy

leaving the matter to the discretion of a woman and her doctor in the early months of pregnancy Earlier today Vice President Mondale and Joseph A Califano Jr the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare announced an Administration proposal to provide Government subsidies to families that adopt hardtoplace children Mr Califano described the plan as obviously an alternative to abortion He also said the Administration endorsed legislation to allow the Government to pay maternity expenses of women planning to put their babies up for adoption The adoption proposal is similar to legislation passed by the House of Representatives last month and pending in the Senate Finance Committee It seems likely to become law in some form On other topics Mr Carter made the following points Massive Soviet interception of airborne American telephone communications governmental and private did not constitute an aggressive act [Question 41 His relations with Congress are improving as legislators get to know him better iQuestion He has interviewed only two of the five men on the list of possible directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation he will interview two more this week and the choice may not be limited to those five [Question IL] The lack of Investor confidence in the stock market reflects a worldwide unease over the economic future not a lack of confidence in his Administration [Question 5] On the subject of Soviet tampering with American telephone communications the President said such practice has become a common ability for nations to pursue Its not an act of aggression or war its completely passive he added When I became President 1 asked to have a multidepartmental assessment of the threat to our own security he continued We have been embarked since in the United States were taking the same impervious to intercept those telephone lines that were involved directly in national security for instance the lines going into and out of the Defense Department and my own office He said some commercial companies lin the United States were taking the same precautions primarily by using underground cables instead of air transmissions to carry calls The New York Times reported Sunday that the Administration was completing a topsecret plan to protect against communications intrusions by foreign governments by corporations and even by criminal groups U S Monitoring Reported The Times account also said that the National Security Agency had been monitoring some domestic longdistance calls by Americans in part to keep track of foreign agents in the United States and in part to monitor Soviet eavesdropping Mr Carter said that while he still had some disagreements with Congresson nuclear breeder reactors and on water projects for examplehe thought in general theres been a good and mature working relationship between us He cited passage of his economic stimulus package and authorization for Government reorganization The authorization for the new department of energy will be completed I think within the next few days he added The Congress has made good progress on strict ethics legislation I think we have made good progress also in the effectuating of the energy policy which is very controversial very difficult and requires a great deal of courage on the part of the Congress I think the Congress now understands much more clearly what I am what hand for what proposals we put forward and the priorities accruing to those proposals On New FBI Director The President said he was not yet sure whether he would go outside the list of five potential nominees for director of the FBI The list was provided by selection commission he appointed to search for a replacement for Clarence M Kelley who will retire Jan 1 Ive only met so far with two of the five Mr Carter said I think this week Im scheduled to meet with two others and Ill meet with the fifth one And then the Attorney General and I will decide together whether or not to interview others There has been growing criticism about the original list to the effect that the commission had not adequately screened the backgrounds of the five candidates Attorney General Griffin B Bell said yesterday that there was another person Hes in the back of my mindin the back of the President mind There was speculation in law enforce ment circles that the sixth person was Georgiaborn John Mintz 41 years old counsel to the bureau Mr Mintz was among the final contenders when the commission was making its list Despite some signs of impending fiscal problems Mr Carter said he was generally optimistic about the economy
Transcript of the President's News Conference on Domestic and Foreign Affairs,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/13/archives/transcript-of-the-presidents-news-conference-on-domestic-and.html,Following is a transcript of President Carters news conference in Washington yesterday afternoon as recorded by The New York Times through the facilities of ABC News QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS CARTER Good Afternoon everybody Do you have any questions 1 Neutron Bomb Q Mr President how do you reconcile your decision to go ahead with the neutron bomb with your inaugural pledge to eliminate all nuclear weapons Also why didnt you know the money was in the bill And three doesnt this escalate the arms race And I have a followup A Well its a very serious question In the first place I did not know it was in the bill The enhanced radiation and neutron bomb has been discussed and also has been under development for 15 or 20 years Its not a new concept at all not a new weapon It does not affect our SALT or strategic weapons negotiations at all Its strictly designed as a tactical weapon I think that this would give us some flexibility I have not yet decided whether to advocate deployment of the neutron bomb I think the essence of it is that for a given projectile size or for a given missile head size that the destruction that would result from the explosion of a neutron bomb is much less than the destruction from an equivalent weapon of other types The essence of the question is that if the neutron weapon or atomic weapon ever should have to be used against enemy forces in occupied territory of our allies or ourselves the destruction Would be much less Before I make a final decision on a neutron bombs deployment I would do a complete impact statement analysis on it submit this information to the Congress But I have not yet decided whether to approve the neutron bomb I do think it ought to be one of our options however Q If you decided to go ahead would you renounce first use of the bombfor example you would not use it un  less there was an aggressive enemy action  A This is something that I have not yet decided Of course we hope that we can reach an agreement among all nations in the future to forgo use of  all atomic weapons and also to eliminate the possession of all nuclear weapons There are two distinct classes of weaponsone is the tactical weapons which have not been under the purview of discussions with the Soviets or others the other is the strategic nuclear weapons But the definition of under what circumstances we would use such atomic weapons has not yet been spelled out publicly I obviously hope that our continuing inclination toward peace shared Im sure by the Soviets and others will prevent any use of atomic weapons They are there as a deterrent however and the option for their use has to be maintained as one of the viable options 2 Minimum Wage Proposal Q Mr President just today you are reported on the brink of approving compromise minimum wage proposal of 260 an hour Now if thats true did you raise your sights because of political factors economic factors or a combination A Well the fact of the matter is that the minimum wage proposals are being handled by the Congressional CommitteesCongressman Dent Congressman Perkins This afternoon think at 4 or 5 oclock Congressman Perkins will have a press conference to spell out the committee proposal We have no Administration legislation to propose and I do not intend to send the Congress any message on the minimum wage I might say in advance that we have come to agree with the proposal that Congressman Perkins will propose but it is not an Administration bill 3 Starting Nuclear War Q Mr President may I go back to the neutron bomb A Please Q Now much do you think there is to the argument that if you have a cleaner weapon as you define it makes war more possible that it might be used and secondly where do you stand on the ageold question of nuclear weapons in Europe for instance as to whether if you start using them it wouldnt automatically escalate into a fullscale nuclear war A I think one of the concepts that must be avoided is an exact description ahead of time of what I as President would do under every conceivable circumstance The ownership of atomic weapons and their potential use is such a horrifying prospecttheir usethat it is deterrent to a major confrontation between nations who possess atomic weapons I believe that the nation that uses atomic weapons first would be under heavy condemnation from the other people of the world unless the circumstances were extremely gross such as an unwarranted invasion into another country But Im eager to work with the Soviet Union with China with France with England on a continuing basis so that there would never be a need for the use of those weapons To answer the other part of your question my guess is that no one would certainly know that the first use of atomic weapons might very well quickly lead to a rapid and uncontrolled escalation in the use of even more powerful weapons with possibly a worldwide holocaust resulting This is a prospect that is sobering to us all and thats why the Soviets and we and others have worked so hard to try to reach an agreement in the prohibition against atomic use Q To follow it up with one quick question A Yes Q Doesnt that give you a terrible paradox because we are inferior on the ground in Europethe Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces If we dont use atomic weapons can we and our NATO alliance stop a ground invasion A My guess is and my belief is that \Aithout the use of atomic weapons we nave adequate force strength in NATO to stop an invasion from the Warsaw Pact forces There is some advantage in the commitment and effectiveness of the forces of a defending nation if they are fighting on their own invaded territory And I think this would mean that in a rough balance that the invading nations would have to have an overwhelmingly superior force We are now putting as a much greater priority in our budget request for defense expenditures monies for improving our conventional forces in Europe In years gone by 15 or 20 years ago we had an overwhelming superiority in nuolear weapons Now I would say we have a roughly equivalent strength in atomic weapons And so we must insure that within the bounds of measurement that our conventional forces are equivalent also And I dont acknowledge at all the fact that an invasion of the Warsaw Pact nations would be successful without the use of atomid weapons 4 Soviet Eavesdropping Q Mr President Senator Moynihan of New York says that the Government both the Ford Administration and yourshas avoided telling American citizens that they are the subject of massive eavesdropping on the part of the Soviet Union If the Senator is correct why has the Government not alerted American citizens to this situation Second do you plan to demand that the Soviets withdraw their rooftop electronic equipment And third they do not will there be diplomatic reprisals A Well Senator Moynihan as you know has been a member of the Nixon Administration in the past in a very high official position And hes well able to judge the knowledge that was possessed by that Administration I think its accurate to say that any detailed discussion of the electronics capabilities of different nations intelligence forces is not a proper subject for a complete discussion Within the last number of years because of the radio transmission of telephone conversations the intercept on a passive basis of these kinds of transmissions has become a common ability for nations to pursue Its not an act of aggression or war Its completely passive I dont know the full circumstances involved When I became President I asked to have a multidepartmental assessment of the threat to our own security We have been embarked since Ive been in officeand I think before in an effort to make impervious to intercept those telephone lines that were involved directly in national security for instance the lines going into and out of the Defense Department and my own office Weve tried to make sure that they are cables Theyre buried under ground theyre not subject to this electronics type of being overheard Some of the major commercial companies in our nation who want to prevent any eavesdropping on their transactions commercial transactions not involved in national security also make an attempt to prevent intercepts by those who listen in on the free airwaves But I would not interpret this use by the Soviet Union or by other embassies to be an act of aggression And although it may be an intrusion into our security I think we are taking adequate steps now to prevent its creating a threat Co our country 5 Stock Market Uncertainty Q Mr President you obviously are doing well in the popularity polls But how do you explain the uncertainty that investors in the stock market seem to have in you A That was a very difficult thing for me to understand during the campaign I thought that they should have given me their overwhelming support The leading investors on Wall Street and others only gave me a 5 percent support compared to my opponent President Ford I think that theres a general uncertainty in the world about future economic circumstances We also of course are involved in a reassessment of some very controversial issues concerning energy tax reform welfare reform that causes some governmental contribution to their uncertainty We have an increasing dependence in the consuming nations on all imports which means that the OPEC nations have about a 40 billion trade surplus and the rest of the world has to absorb a 40 billion deficit So I think there are many areas of uncertainty Ive been impressed with the longrange trend projections that have been given to me Weve had about a 1 percent reduction already in the unemployment rate since I became President And the results last month on inflation were encouraging But monthly figures fluctuate fairly widely Since last November weve had about three million net increase in the number of jobs available in our country I feel very good about our economy and I cant assess that feeling of mine as compared to investors in the stock market prices But I think since the first of the year the stock market prices although they fluctuated somewhat have been relatively stable 6 Natural Gas Deregulation Q Mr President yesterday a Congressional Republican group released a study showing that your natural gas plan pricing plan would cost American consumers about 48 billion more than deregulation of natural gas would by 1990 They mainly said that Americans would not be able to get as much gas under your plan and therefore would have to resort to other types of more expensive fuel Could you respond to that A Yes I havent heard of that report But I can tell you that the Congressional Budget Office and the Library of Congress independently of Dr Schlesinger and his assessments have confirmed our own figures In fact both those reports anticipate that deregulation of natural gas would be much more expensive than even the figure that we had put forward My estimate is that our own proposal which I think gives an adequate incentive for production and exploration of new natural gas would amount to about a 15 billion increase in income for the oil companies natural gas producers by 1985 The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this would be under deregulation about 85 billion which is 70 billion more with complete natural gas deregulation for new gas than what we proposed The Library of Congress figures go up to about 150 billion This means that the consumers of this country would have to pay to the oil and natural gas companies an enormous extra amount for a very slight increase in natural gas production if it was completely deregulated Im not in favor of complete deregulation We estimate that if natural gas was completely deregulated that the increased production would be about 11 trillion cubic feet of natural gas at an increased cost of more than 70 billion This means that for every additional thousand cubic feet discovered it would cost the American consumers about 60 So I think that our proposal is reasonable I think that deregulation as proposed by some members of the Congress would be a gross overburden on the American people and would not result in a substantial increase in production 7 Soviet Rhetoric Q Mr President what do you think of all the unfriendly rhetoric coming out of Moscow lately and do your sources suggest that it may not just be because of your human rights campaign A I dont know how to explain the unfriendly rhetoric Our proposals have been fair and reasonable and almost all of them have been made public We have pursued our hopes for increased friendship to the Soviet Union a reduction in nuclear weaponry an easing of the tensions between ourselves and the Soviets through quiet diplomatic channels with myself talking to the Soviet Ambassador with Cy Vance the Secretary of State going to Moscow and in continuing negotiations at Geneva and other places by Paul Warnke and other representatives of me I believe that the Soviets perhaps have some political reasons for spelling out or exaggerating the disagreements I dont know what those reasons are Our positions have been carefully contrived and constantly reassessed have no inclination to change the positions that we have taken I think they are fair And I believe that calm and persistent and fair negotiations with the Soviet Union will ultimately lead to increased relationships with them And the public statements that the Soviets make attacking me personally or our own nations good faith are both erroneous and illadvised But what their reasons for it might be I do not know 8 Middle East Q Mr President with Mr Begin coming to visit Id like to ask a question about the Middle Easta twopart question When you talked about the necessity for a Palestinian homeland were you thinking of locating that homeland in territory that at one time was Palestine or in your mind could it be located anywhere The second part of the question is do you still believe as you said a few weeks ago that Israel eventually must withdraw with only minor changes to the pre1967 borders A I have not changed my opinion since the earlier statements that I made concerning the general outline of terms to be sought at a possible Geneva conference We have never tried to define geographical boundaries for a socalled Palestinian entity My own preference which Ive expressed since Ive been President and also as a candidate was that the Palestinian entity whatever form it might take and whatever area it might occupy should be tied in with Jordan and not be independent But I dont have the authority nor the inclination to try to impose that preference on the parties that will negotiate And I think that in his coming over here to our country next week on the 19th that Prime Minister Begin is trying to bring with him an open mind and an ability to go to a possible peace conference with all items being negotiable He said this publicly and hes also sent me private messages to that effect Ive seen an inclination in the Middle East in recent days towards an alleviation of tension I got a private message from President Sadat for instance that he is going to make every effort again to comply with the Sinai Agreement He had a few extra troops in the territory that had been identified Hes withdrawing those He authorized me to announce that hes returning with full military honors 19 Israeli bodies that had been left in Egypt Hes erapressed his willingness to go to Geneva without prior commitments Hes had negotiations or talks lately with the King of Jordan and theyve agreed that the Palestinian enmity ought to be tied in with Jordan so theres a general inclination of all parties for success But I dont think its advisable now for me to get any more specific than I have in the past And although I havent changed my position I want to reemphasize that were not going to go to the different nations involved and say This is an American plan youve got to accept it as a precondition to going to Geneva Its what we think would be fair Its been deliberately general in nature and the ultimate results would have to be agreed to by the Arab and Israeli nations 9 Abortion Q Mr President how comfortable are you with the recent Supreme Court decision that says the Federal Government is not obligated to provide money for abortions for women who cannot afford to pay for them themselves A I do not think that the Federal Government should finance abortions except when the womans life is threatened or when the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest I think it ought to be interpreted very strictly In my opinion the Federal Government being willing to finance abortions as it has been in recent months is an encouragement to abortion and its acceptance as a routine contraceptive means and I think within that strict definition that Ive given to you I would like to prevent the Federal Government financing abortions I think its accurate to say that Secretary of H E W Califano agrees with me completely and we are trying to make it possible for the people of this nation to understand how to prevent unwanted pregnancies with education programs and with the availability of contraceptives and other devices when they believe in their use as an alternative to abortion But I dont believe that either states or the Federal Government should be required to finance abortions Yes Q Well then how fair do you believe it is then that women who can afford to get an abortion can go ahead and have one and women who cannot afford to are precluded from this A Well as you know there are many things in life that are not fair that wealthy people can afford and poor people cant But I dont believe that the Federal Government should take action to try to make these opportunities exactly equal particularly when there is a moral factor involved I know as well as anyone in the country having faced this issue during a long campaign about the intense feelings on both sides of the abortion issue But my own personal feeling is that the Supreme Courts rulings now are adequate and they are reasonably fair and that the Federal Government should not be required or encouraged to finance abortions other than Ive spelled out 10 Relations With Congress Q With the passage of time your working relationships with members of Congress seem to be improving What accounts for the truce A Well I dont know that its a truce exactly I think the Congress now understands much more clearly what am what I stand for what proposals weve put forward and the priorities accruing to those proposals I think weve had good success with the Congress alreadythe passage of the economic stimulus package that we proposed was done expeditiously and is working well already The authorization for me to reorganize the Government is doing well The authorization for the new department of energy will be completed I think within the next few days The Congress has made good progress on strict ethics legislation think we have made good progress also in the effectuation of the energy policy which is very controversial very difficult and requires a great deal of courage on the part of Congress Theyve still got some hard questions to answer One of course is how to finance the Social Security system And we will be proposing to them in the future a comprehensive welfare plan and a comprehensive tax reform proposal But I think in general its just been a matter of getting to knoor one another And weve been very forceful in our position There are some things on which the Congress and I still disagree I thought the Congressthe Senatemade an improper decision yesterday an the Clinch River breeder reactor I think there are excessive amounts of allocation of funds for water projects Im concerned about the Senate level of prospective expenditure on the farm bill so we do have some differences but I think in general theres been a good and mature working relationship between us 11 FBI Director Q Mr President are you going to go outside the list of FBI director nominees supplied by your selection commission to choose the man to replace Clarence Kelley and if so isnt that an indictment of the manner in which that search was conducted A I dont know yet When I announced the five names that had been recommended to me I pointed out that we would interview those five If one of them is patently the best pernon to hold the job of FBI director in the judgment of the Attorney General and approved by me then we would go with those five But we reserve the right to interview others in addition to the first five recommended If we do so then we would use the information derived by the search committee as a basis for our own assessment of those additional candidates Ive only met so far with two of the five I think this week Im scheduled to meet with two others and Ill meet with the fifth one And then the Attorney General and I will decide together whether or not to interview others Its not an indictment of them I think they did a good job We deliberately made public the names of those whom they did recommend to get information etc from those who knew the candidates that we would not have gotten otherwise We did not do an FBI full field background check on any of those five candidates or any of the other 225 who were assessed until they were recommended to us And so we are now accumulating information about the nominees and then having an interview with them The Attorney General meets with them two or three hours and gives me report on what he thinks I meet with them 15 or 20 minutes to get acquainted and my expectation is that the Attorney General will make a recommendation to me and I will go along with his recommendation But Ill reserve the final judgment 12 Soviet Relations Q Mr President could I get back to relations with the Soviet Union A Yes Q Despite the hopes which you express for better relations there are several things that suggest that in fact relations have grown worse between the United States and the Soviet Union since you took office Do you think thats the case and if so where are we headed in this Are we seeing an end to the period of dtente A No I dont think so I believe that its inherent that tough and public debate will accrue when controversial issues are addressed It would be very easy for me and the Congress to get along completely harmoniously if never made a proposal and if I agreed with everything that Congress did and we didnt address any of the controversial issues like welfare reform tax reform reorganization or an energy policy The same thing applies to the Soviet Union We have never before made an attempt with the Soviet Union drastically to reduce the level of atomic weaponry In the past weve put limits on increasing production of atomic weaponry Weve never tried with the Soviet Union to get a complete prohibition against all testing of atomic devices Now we are trying to work with the Soviet Union to get this very controversial and very difficult goal realized Weve never tried before to work with the Soviet Union to demilitarize the Indian Ocean or to restrict any further militarization of that area Its a controversial matter It affects other nations as wellIndia Australia New Zealand Iran Somalia etc So we are now trying to address some questions that in the past have been avoided or delayed The question of human rights is one that obviously has caused some tough debate and difference of opinion expressed publicly and privately We could have sat quiescently and never raised the issue of human rights I believe that our raising of the issue was compatible with the hopes and dreams and inclinations and commitment to the American people And theres been varying kinds of responses to this pursuit We did not initiate all these controversies As you know the basket three aspect of the Helsinki agreement would have raised the human rights question to some degree absent any commitment on my part But dont think that this is an indication of deteriorated relationships between us and the Soviets because we are finally addressing in a forceful way from different perspectives some extremely controversial but important issues So although I would like for us to agree on everything I think the period of debate disagreement probing and negotiation is inevitable and I have no apologies to offer and I have no regrets about the issues that have proven to be controversial Q Thank you Mr President A Thank you Frank very much The New York TimesTeresa Zabala Vice President Mondale and Joseph A Califano Jr head of the Department of Health Education and Welfare before briefing newsmen on the proposed system of subsidies to help low and middleincome families adopt foster children particularly those hard to place

Topics,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/14/archives/topics-reprise.html,DEATH AND BIRTH  Sometimes acts of political decency are obscured by the cynicism that surrounds much of public life New Yorkers ought to pierce that fog and gaze admiringly upon two recent acts by their Governor and their junior United States Senator The Governor vetoed as promised the death penalty bill despite the pressures arrayed against that decision He took the course dictated by his conscience and spoke good sense when he said that the death penalty Is no proven deterrent to crime We must have the stamina to take the hard road of Improving and perfecting the everyday administration of criminal justice And Senator Moynihan after making the hard decisionfor a Catholic  to vote against the ban on Madicaid abortions replied to President Carters callous justification of the unfairness of that ban in these words There are minimum social services that everyone must be provided with and access to abortion as a last resort is one of them UNFAIR PLUS  We have stated our sharp disagreement with President Carters view that the Government should not finance abortions for poor women But when heldeFended his position this week by saying there are simply some things that are not fair that wealthy people can afford ed poor people cant we have to wonder whether he realizes just how pronounced is the unfairness he is content to be so fatalistic about The fact is the availability of abortion Is strikingly more important to poor women than to those of means Poor women are much more likely otherwise to experience unwanted births The National Fertility Study of 1970 showed that among couples with annual income under 4000 33 percent of births were unwanted but among couples with 15000 or more the figure was only 12 percent More recent studies disclose similar divergence In sum those who can afford abortion as the contraceptive of last resort need it less but those who cant afford it without public assistance need it much more
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/14/archives/letters.html,To the Editor I would agree with Max J Rubin letter July 6 that The Timess proposal of a return to a parttime unpaid Board of Education is unworkable But I would like to point out that his arguments against such a return are equally valid in demonstrating the unworkability of his alternate proposal  a Commissioner of Education appointed by the Mayor advised by a powerless citizens council At the recent public hearings few speakers shared Mr Rubins belief that such a commissioner serving at the pleasure of the Mayor could be either independent or apolitical Nor would the Mayor have to defend or Justify inadequate allocations for education since he would have his own appointee to do the Job for him Mr Rubin fails to indicate how a commissioner even with a greatly expandeti staff could effectively carry out all of the responsibilities now undertaken by the Board both statutory and nonstatutory With no Board to hear appeals from decisions made by staff aggrieved teachers students parents or community school boards would presumably have to turn immediately to the courts or the State Education Commissioner for a hearing Who would perform the ombudsnian 0 function now provided by members of the Board and their staff Who would fight for additional funds for educational services as this Board has done in pressing the city to abide by the StaviskyGoodman Law and In taking legal action to compel the state to revise its discriminatory aid formula The problems of the public schools are real and significant steps have been taken in the last three years to overcome some of them Central operations have been reorganized and staff has been significantly reduced Management reforms are being introduced to resolve some of the problems often first identified by Board staff which have been the subject of recent audits for which others have claimed credit in attacking the Board Demands for change improvement and reform have come at a time when severe budget cuts have significantly reduced the manpower to perform those tasks and when it has been necessary for that staff to concentrate its efforts on meeting demands imposed by the fiscal crisis Governance of the public schools is an appropriate subject for public discussion and debate but its time to stop looking for a panacea through structural changes that will have no significant impact on the education of the citys children The schools cant bring about change alone We need to examine the role played by the numerous agencies that deliver services for children in this city and make sure that all of them work together for the benefit of those they are supposed to serve STEPHEN R HELLO President Board of Education Brooklyn July 7 1977 To Be Second to Someone in Something To the Editor Harris L Present in a recent letter to The Times deplores the inability of the United States to produce chess players on a pair with Soviet grandmasters and suggests that this country subsidize the development of chess as does the Soviet Union There is no reason why our country should be second to any other in this field he writes I think there are reasons One is that the Department of Health Education and Welfare which Mr Present would have administer the program is too big as it is what it does not need is another agency Another reason has to do with precedent If we subsidize chess today to best the Russians why should we not subsidize bridge tomorrow toovertake the Italians A third argument would be that so long as one American is illfed or illclothed the United States has no business subsidizing games And finally one outstanding reason not to subsidize chess As a nation we have a desperate need to be permanently second to someone in something It will do inestimable good for our soul if not our national ego Therefore let us as a nation commit ourselves to ineptitude in chess and re solve that if we begin producing too many grandmaster we will take every other one out and shoot him JAMES MOFFATT Willingboro N J July 4 1977 Convention Center Stand To the Editor For the umpteenth time I must refute the charge this time made by Mayor Beanie that I oppose a convention center for New York City This misrepresentation has appeared so many times that I believe it must be deliberate As the elected Representative from the 20th CD I worked closely with the neighborhood groups in the Clinton area of midManhattan where the center was to be located to make certain that it would not touch off a wild real estate speculative spree in the adjoining lower middle class neighborhood drive people out of their homes and dump hundreds of extra cars into the neighborhood After consultations and negotiations between the Clinton community and the center a satisfactory neighborhood preservation and parking plan was agreed upon that met most of our concerns At no time did we oppose the convention center per se What stopped the center was the citys fiscal crisis and its realization that it did not have the funds needed to get this project going I believe the city should now decide on the best possible site for the center work out the financing and clear the way for a convention center that we all hope much needed boost to our tourist industry BELLA S Aszun New York July 6 1977 Mozambique Two Views on the Question of Aid and Arms To the Editor Having returned recently from a twoweek visit to Mozambique during which I saw impressive evidence of that countrys efforts to improve the lives of its people I am puzzled by two recent U S Government actions The US participated in the unanimous vote in the UN Security Council to condemn the constant military attacks by the racist Rhodesian regime into Mozambique and to encourage aid from member states of the UN for Mozambique Yet just a week 4 earlier the US House of Representatives placed Mozambique on a list of countries to be barred from any aid whether direct or through international agencies Mozambiques Government has been recognized by the US practically since the day it was independent of Portugal two years ago The US is represented by an ambassador in Maputo the capital Mozambique seeks friendly relations with the US despite the fact that during the 11 long years of the armed struggle for independence the US gave no more than verbal support while NATO arms were used against its people There are no Soviet bases or Cuban troops in Mozambique I did see however a brief glimpse of a society struggling hard to eliminate the vestiges of colonialism and working to reconstruct the country after long years of war I saw a country that is eliminating disease bringing literacy and that has virtually eliminated prostitution and alcoholism I saw a Mozambique which has provided refuge for 30000 Africans who have fled the terror of the Smith regime in Rhodesia and cut off the illegal governments shipments at considerable cost to its own economy even before the US finally nullified the Byrd amendment Mozambique is bearing the brunt of the struggle for majority rule in southern Africa which the new Administration professes to support Action must be taken to redress the Houses punitive action and move to implement the US vote at the Security Council to provide the maximum assistance possible to Mozambique PAUL IRISH The writer is executive associate American Committee on Africa New York July 1 1977  To the Editor Your front page headline today July 1 reads Security Council Appeals for Help for Mozambique Material Aid is Urged to Counter Rhodesia I read the ensuing article carefully but in vain to ascertain whether the Securityi Council considered at all Mozambiquesheltered guerrilla attacks on Rhodesia Is it verboten in todays political climate to ask why not Perhaps because Rhodesia was not permitted to attend and be heard The United States delegate Andrew Young is quoted by you as declaring If there is a way to expedite peaceful negotiation of an honorable settlement in Rhodesia through aggressive application of economic pressures and diplonacy there is still hope that untold lives will be spared in that region Aggressive application of economic pressures and diplomacy only on Rhodesia will produce peaceful negotiations Mr Youngs stated hope is shared by all persons of good will black and white alike as is his statement of the imperative of bringing about a transfer to majority rule My difficulty is in appreciating how this hope and this imperative can be promoted by bringing peace only from West to East Mr Young stated that even the United Nations charter includes the right to protect ones security Is that right color blind in reverse Your article states that Andrew Young the chief United States delegate and other Western representatives stressed in the Council that they interpreted the request for material help as being limited to economic aid meaning that it was not a bid for weapons or military equment But your article then states Disagreeing African negotiators have said at least privately that aid also covers arms such as those Mozambique has been receiving from the Soviet Union Considering our experience in Angola Moscow and Havana must be having a good laugh at the naive Westerners PAUL R SHAW New York July 11977 Of Abortion the Poor And Our Humanity To the Editor Your lead editorial of July 5 Will Our Humanity Also Be Aborted claims that until the forces that have been so effective at diminishing the scope of the Supreme Courts 1973 abortion decision mobilize on behalf of poor women  the humanity of their movement will remain in doubt Not so The prolife forces that have worked to diminish the scope of the Supreme Courts 1973 abortion decision contribute out of their pockets to foundling hospitals birthright clinics homes for unwed mothers and the like though much more can and should be done They do so out of a conviction that the way to a better humanityagain The Timess word is not to be found over the bodies of millions of aborted fetases Surely those who like The Times have a different moral convictionthat 250000 to 300000 poor womens abortions every year will help solve societys and those poor womens problems  likewise should pay for that supposed solution It seems therefore that the socalled moral onus of helping poor women procure abortions now rep on There may be many who agree with the editorial position of The Times though I am not one of them and who themselves should be willing to pay for poor womens elective abortions until such time as the Government can be made to pay for themif or when that day ever comes I suggest that the humanity of The Times remains in doubt until it brings its enormous influence to bear on getting private money for poor womens elective abortions which The Times evidently regards as a moral impemtive Perhaps there are fountitions willing to step in on an emergency basis to avert the illegal abortions you so graphically predict and decry The Rockefeller Foundation or the Rockefeller Brothers Fund or Ford or Carnegie could be approached I can see your headline now Rockefellers Fund Abortions for the Poor What a for humanity Rev THOMAS H STAHEL SJ New York July 6 1977 The writer is an associate editor of America magazine Unfair Treatment To the Editor Although President Carters increased standard deduction for 1977 Federal income tax simplifies the preparation of Federal tax returns it still gives New York City taxpayers the short end of the stick New York City residents pay a high state income tax a high city income tax and an 8 percent sales tax and yet they get the same standard deduction as residents of states having no state or city income taxes and lower sales taxes Moreover a Newo York City taxpayer who takes the standard deduction on his Federal return must take it standard deduction on his state and city return as well The state and city standard deduction is much lower than the Federal deduction Thus the New York City resident loses out on his state and city income tax as well as on his Federal returns There must be some way to treat New York City taxpayers a little more fairly ELY LEVOWITZ Brooklyn July 6 1977
"At State Women's Conference, a New Constituency Speaks",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/15/archives/at-state-womens-conference-a-new-constituency-speaks-up.html,For many women the feminist move Went has long seemed a vehicle for the superstarsthe sleek bright successful career women of legend who asserted their superiority in a world of file clerks and housewives But there were signs at the recent statewide womens conference in Albany that at a time when the movement appears to have lost some ground with the defeat of the equal rights amendment in 12 states it is starting to provide a forum for the views of a wider range of women Homemakers and bluecollar working women as well as a number of women from minority groups are moving onto the stage previously held by the sparklies as one feminist called tile movement superstars The New York State Womens Meeting in Albany last weekend was one of 56 Federally sponsored state and territorial meetings mandated by Congress in response to the International Womens Year in 1975 At each conference women have elected delegates to represent their views at the national womens conference to be held in Houston Nov 1821 and they have held workshops and passed resolutions on a range of issues of concern to women some of which will be reflected in the national conferences report to President Carter The organizers of the Albany meeting were expecting about 3000 participants but instead more than 7000 showed up increasing the confusion inherent in most large political gatherings The conference was much like a political convention Lights were onthrough the early hours of Saturday and Sunday in the offices and meeting rooms of the Empire State Plaza as caucuses were held to shape tactics and slates of delegates sympathetic to various womens causes were drawn At the Plaza Convention Hall and the Palace Theater nearby group clamored to be heard at the microphones But there were other voices too from Women who belonged to a variety of interest groups drawn to the convention For Geraldine Miller it was the second trip to Albany in nearly as many weeks She had gone up earlier from the Bronx with members of task forces for the Household Technicians and the Battered Women And one group of women from Queens has organized spontaneously for the womens conference and planned to continue meeting informally after it was over Rosemarie Reed and Jean Alagna had traveled to Albany from Brooklyn Mrs Reed had helped to found one of the states first shelters for battered women and she and Mrs Alagna were active members of the National Con of Neighborhood gress of Neighborhood Women Minority and poor white women have felt left out of the womens movement Mrs Alagna said But we arent now A lot of our concerns are based on viable neighborhoods and the survival of families The fact that we are all causing and forming coalition slates shows a lot of unity among groups with similar concerns though We may not all agree on womens roles in life but weve got to work on the goals that unite us There are more of those than the ones that divide us which we could hassle over all year She continued A lot of women I know are frightened by the word feminist But they are feminists The same rhetoric doesnt apply to neighborhood women Ive been a feminist since I was 8 but there was no place to put it I never knew there were other women who felt the same way  For some the gap between activist chic and grassroots radicalism remained a wide one All these people are writers and professors Ruth Dunne a postal worker from Brooklyn said as she surveyed the long line outside the Palace Theater early Saturday morning These people dont punch time clocks they sign in And there were other gaps Jacqueline Carter waited in yet another line the next morning holding her 5monthold son A young black woman from Brooklyn she had been intrigued by upstate homemakers with whom she had talked A lot have never worked she said Theyre conventional women who came to the workshops saying I came out of the house finally and Im trying to change my ways But they couldnt let go It was a clash of the cities and small towns a crossroads On one of the buses that shuttled conference participants back and forth all weekend Alice Hall sat quietly with her daughters Chris 17 years old and Cindy 16 two of eight children Mrs Hall had come to the conference from Syracuse and like many conservative women at the meeting she expressed her feeling of separation from the feminist movement I happen to be the average person where I grew up Mrs Hall said And I like to think we represent the average woman We will be affected by all this too but its difficult to communicate with people who dont share your views The average housewives dont want to put their children in daycare centers or go into the armed services We still believe women have a tremendous role raising the child and what kind of values will children have growing up in daycare centers  The New York meetings most bitter confrontations centered on the equal rights amendment the civil rights of lesbians and in particular the right to choose legal abortion Like a litany the arguments of proabortionists and antiabortionists ran through the weekends conversations sometimes drying up previously amiable discussion It is the age of mens liberation when women are asked to mutilate their bodies Im not using the words abortion or right to life Im just interested in humans My husband is a fireman and he risks his life to save the people you are trying to kiil If theres one thing I want this conference to achieve its that women stop using the term pmabortion No one is in favor of abortion theyre in favor of legalized abortion This is a war between God and the devil God is not mentioned in one resolution this conference has proposed When a group of conservativewomen threatened to break up a workshop on lesbian households Maxine Sobel a softspoken young lesbian writer who works with the handicapped in Rochester sought out women to join the meeting in an attempt to quell the antagonism One of the women she encountered was her mother who had come to the conference with a Long Island chapter of the National Organization for Women I hadnt been intending to stay for the workshop Miss Sobel said But I did When it came time for discussion several women stood up to protest equal rights for lesbians Youre ugly they said Youre disgusting You are weird Miss Sobel watched her mother whosix years earlier had been hysterical when her daughter revealed her sexual orientation She got closer and closer to the edge of her chair Miss Sobel recalled Finally she stood tip and said Im Maxines mother and Ive never been more proud of her I never thought I would stand up and say this I wish more people cared about people and liuman rights as she does She went on for a while Miss Sobel said She was really dynamite There were tears in her eyes and someone came up behind me and held me I was sobbing so though I tried not to make any noise When she finished everyone stood up and clapped and she left The discussion had continued in a more temperate vein and at the end of the meeting two young women approached the panelists to apologize One of them said she had only heard horrible things about lesbians Miss Sobel said but that now she saw we are human  One of the most telling incidenti of the conference occurred high up in an office building overlooking the mall where about 50 women had gathered for a selfassertiveness training session one of over 100 workshops on consumerism education employment the family health and international iSsuet As they waited for the session to begin the women many of whom had never been to a womens meeting before began to chat with one another The murmur of the conversation grew louder as 20 minutes Passed and the sessions leader still had not appeared Here we are all sitting for a halfhour and the session hasnt even started said Harriet Fine of Albany Like most of the women in the room she was attending her first assertiveness training session and could see the need for it Why no ones even gotten up to protest she exclaimed Nearly an hour had passed when George and Dorothy Wiesner of Slingerlands NY dropped by with their daughter Hillary They had been sampling as many workshops as possible and the assertiveness training session was on their list I wish we had something like this for men Mr Wiesner said Then he glanced across the room Hasnt it started yet he asked incredulously Gee why are all you women sitting here As the Wiesners turned to go a woman strode in briskly papers in hand Sorry Im late she announced We cant heir you women called back The microphone had gone dead Mr Wiesner slipped unobtrusively to the front of the room to fiddle with some wires His wife stifled a grin watching him as he went to work The funny thing she whispered is that he doesnt know a thing about electricity
TV WEEKEND,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/15/archives/new-jersey-weekly-tv-week-end.html,SHADES OF GREENE the anthology of Graham Greene short stories carried on WNET13 on Fridays at PM is one of those uneven affairs stuffed with thoroughly delicious performances Tonights representative example is When Greek Meets Greek in which Paul Scofield plays Nicholas Fennick owner of a correspondence school for servicemen during World War II Fennick is a con man of course and his school located in a seedy flat above the shop of a dotty chemist Derek Smith in Oxford is named St Ambroses College The prospectus asks Why not a gain a real Oxford education at Tom Browns old college When Fennicks young niece Annette Robertson hesitates on joining the scam he aasures her that a swindle would be difficult to prove in court because the advertisement is very carefully worded my dear Eventually Fennick is done in by his snobbery and his shrewd niece An application arrives from a selfproclaimed peer of the realm and Lord Driber Roy Kinnear turns out to be another con man He thinks the degree might be socially useful for his son Terence Budd who is just finishing a stretch in a school for delinquent youths Lord Driber decides to visit Oxford and his tour of the university with Fennick as guide is punctuated with looney exclamations of By jove and Top ho Before Fennick and Lord Driber get their comeuppance in a plot device that is less convincing and just barely serviceable the story has been visited by several other eccentrics including an unsavory bottompinching minister I stumbled madam and I groped for the nearest thing at hand Mr Scofields finicky Fennick is a marvel of slimy propriety and malevalent arrogance IN slightly tattered tweeds and gaudy pincenez he quietly underplays everthing to scenestealing perfection And the Lord Driber of Mr Kinnear as equally riveting Watch him explode in hustling righteousness when on being told that Fennicks hotel has been bombed he blusters Is there no infamy to which theHun will not stoop There are flaws in the construction of When Greek Meets Greek but the curious inhabitants are realized delightfully The series is imported from Britains Thames Television  Live Your Life is also a dramatization but of a very different order As the first presentation of Television From Scandinavia which will be running on WNET13 for six weeks Saturdays at 9 PM this story of a 45yearold housewife dying of cancer is at once powerful and hauntingly beautiful Nina is a fairly uncomplicated woman bursting with passion of life At a party she can laugh heartily or unselfconsciously sing a bawdy song Suddenly she feels a strange internal pressure on her eyes Several months later Nina is dead of a brain tumor This extraordinary drama written by AnnaMaria Hagerfors simply follows Nina through those final months from initial nervousness to gradual and ful realization to bitterness and despair and finally to a fiercely accommodation with the fact of death Her husband and three children are supportive Another woman patient also dying becomes an invaluable source of tenderness But Nina copes with the situation of her own sometimes impossibly demanding and difficult terms Filmed in a style that captures some of the innocence and artless impact of a home movie this import from Sweden is itself often difficult to bear But in dealing courageously with the essentials of all our lives it is also startingly lovely strangely comforting and completely memorable The performance of Mona Malm as Nina and Gosta

Program,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/16/archives/new-yorks-legislature-recesses-after-its-passage-of-a-years.html,ALBANY July 15The 200th session of the New York State Legislature was gaveled into recess today after approving a oneyear extension of the controversial temporaryrelease program for prisoners The longest regular legislative session since 1911 ended at 532 PM as the Democraticled Assembly finished churning through its last calendar of bills and prepared at last to go home The Republican  controlled Senate had worked straight through last night and brought its business to a close at 230 AM today It is not so much the accommodations I am complaining about but the length of time you kept me said Stanley Fink of Brooklyn the majority leader quoting appropriately from the bankrobber Willie Sutton on the eve of his parole Minimum of Votes Available The prisonrelease program shuttled through the almost  empty Assembly chamber without debate just after the session resumed early this morning scraping by with the minimum of 76 votes needed for passage It was part of a twohouse bargain in which the Senate Republicans gained some toughening of sentences for serious crimes by juveniles particularly against the elderly After the Assemblys approval yesterday of the Senate Republicans version of a bill to phase out the effects of New York Citys stocktransfer tax the vote on the prisonrelease programa forced partyline tally with exceptions which permitted the many empty seats to vote as the party leaders wishedcompleted all the major issues that could be resolved Left open was the question of continuing state aid to five upstate cities a measure that the Republicans took hostage in an effort to gain 40 million in additional assistance to counties The Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut Demociat at of Brooklyn said at a news conference that he was not concerned about the lack of agreement on the aid program and that thet e would be ample time to work out a solution for the five upstate cities lett without state funds because of the Republican maneuver For the first time in recent memory the session ended with sunlight streaming through the stainedglass windows of the Assembly chamber rather than in the dead of the Albany night Legislators considered in remarkably orderly fashion a procession of dozens of bills o which at least some people in the chamber emed to hate some understanding It was in fact precisely to this end that the Assembly recessed for a dinnerandsleep break early last night while the Senate remained and the Assembly leaders spent the afternoon congratulating themselves publicly on their success Salary Increases Dropped Perhaps because of orderliness of the close the Assembly this afternoon quashed a measu e that would have granted salaries of 2500 to 3000 to regional officers of the Offtrack Betting Corporation In addition several measures that would have increased pension plans for certain individuals some of which had been included in another bill earlier his yearf iled to ain the approval of one or the other of the houses Throughtout the day some members groumbled that they had been deprived of their right to debate the prisonrelease measure The bill which Governor Carey is certain to sign will continue the program under which about 3000 adult prisoners work or go to school in the community but with additonal safeguards against abuse Even the Assembly sponsor of the measure Richard N Gottfried DemocratLiberal of Manhattan seemed astonished that the bill had sliped through without controversy Are you kidding You must be kidding he said to a reporter who informed him of the passage when he arrived in the chamber 20 minutes after the bill was approved Assured that the reporter was not Mr Gottfried dissolved into a gale of laughter In return for the prisonrelease bill the Assembly Democrats agreed to a bill that would require judges who find juveniles guilty of serious crimes against people at least 62 years old to send them to secure facilities The bill would also give the judge the option of sentencing a youth convicted of the mostserious class of crimes to a secure facility for up to 18 months rather than up to 12 months as is now the case It would also double from six months to a year the maximum sentence in secure placement for lessserious crimes covered by the Juvenile Justice Reform Act The bill is slightly more lenient than it was as originally proposed by the Senate Republicans Extension Held Necessary All sides agreed earlier that an extension of the prisonrelease program was necessary if only because there was no other place to put the 3000 prisoners now in the community under these types of programs Under the bill given final approval today a prisoners temporary release would he restricted to only the most serious type of medical dental and surgical problems that could not he treated in prison and to visits to only the closest elatives who were near death Educational releases would be allowed only to institutions that kept attendance records of inmates and prisoners would be required to schedule their courses to remain out of prison for the shortest time In addition closer supervision wou be made of prisoners in workrelease programs and release privileges of prisoners who absconded from a community program would be revoked Among the other actions taken today were these SUBPOENA POWERS Both houses passed a bill urgently requested by State Attorney General Louis J Lefkowitz giving prosecutors the right to take possession of the business record they subpoenad from witnesses in investigations Two cases decided last week by the State Court of Appealsindicated that without this legislation prosecutors would have to return the records every night GUIDANCE BUREAU Over strenuous objections of two Democratic Assemblymen Jose E Serrano of the Bronx and Edward C Sullivan of Manhattan the Assembly gave final apps oval to a bill expanding the powers and financing of the Board of Educations Bureau of Child Guidance which has been accused of mismanagement waste and improper service in two recent investigations The United Federation of Teachers lobbied heavily for the measure A legislative investigation of the bureau is expected FETAL RIGHTS The Senate early this morning gave final passage to a bill requiring doctors to make all possible efforts to save the life of a baby born prematurely as the result of an abortion SOCIAL WELFARE BOARD Governor Careys bill to strip the Board of Social Welfare of all but its advisory functions and to transfer its powers to other state agencies was approved by both houses PROPRIETARY HOMES The Assembly gave final passage to a package of bills providing increased state control over profitmaking homes for the elderly and giving new protections to residents of these homes One bill provides for a 500aday fine if a home does not correct violations within 30 days Another provides that a residents own funds he accounted for separately and he used by the home only with authorization LITERARY CRIMINALS The Assembly gave final passage to a bill giving the Crime Victims

Carter's Political Dichotomy,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/16/archives/carters-political-dichotomy-beliefs-rooted-in-southern-democratic.html,WASHINGTON July 15After nearly six months Jimmy Carter remains an enigmatic figure to many people in the capital particularly to Northern Democrats who have trouble adjusting to the conservative tenor of some of his pronouncements after a cam paign marked by the compassionate rhetoric of reform And as one Senate liberal observed today he shook us again this week with his surprisingly coldeyed comments about social inequality and the limits of government responsibility in social issues as he answered a news conference question about the latest Supreme Court ruling on abortion News Analysts It is true as Jody Powell his press secretary contended that Mr Carter disclosed nothing new when he said he thought the Federal Government should not finance abortions except when the womans life was threatened or when pregnancy resulted from rape or incest The revealing test of his character and attitudes came when a woman reporter pressed him to justify his position Did he think it fair she asked for women who can afford abortions to have them while abortions for others are precluded by lack of Federal aid A Striking Shift There are many things in life that are not fair that wealthy people can afford and poor people cant the President replied But I dont believe that the Federal Government should take action to try to make these opportunities exactly equal particularly when there is a moral factor involved To reporters who had followed the President as a candidate this stark comment was a striking shift from the populist pronouncements of the Carter campaign Again and again he had emphasized the need for a Government compassionate toward those who must depend on it and when he accepted the Democratic nomination last July in New York he struck out at rule by an economic and political elite who never stand in line looking for a job [and] never do without food or clothing or a place to sleep But perhaps his most poignant evocation of populist themes was at a private gettogether with some Hollywood stars at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel last fall Graphically he described his own commitment to alleviate the burdens of poverty Give Them a Decent Life In the county where I farm we dont have a doctor we dont have a dentist we dont have a pharmacist we dont have a registered nurse and people who live there who are very poor have no access to health care he said We found in Georgia that poor women who are mostly black in rural areas have 20 times more cervical cancer than white women in urban counties just because they havent seen a doctor Theres a need for public officials to try to understand those who are dependent on government to give them a decent life That is what I hope to do But as a candidate as well as in office Mr Carter many times emphasized that government has its limits and cannot solve all our problems It is this dichotomy in the Presidents attitudes that has troubled Northern Democratic liberals It prompted outspoken criticism from Senator George McGovern of South Dakota who accused Mr Carter several weeks ago of adopting Republican economics by emphasizing balanced budgets and fighting inflation rather than priming the economy more vigorously Some columnists took to calling Mr Carter the most conservative Democratic President since Grover Cleveland The toots of Mr Carters attitudes lie in the sail of the South in the Southern Democratic tradition that puts great stock in fiscal prudence and keenly distrusts big government A Different Liberalism In Dixie politicians have often gains a liberal label because of their tolerant stand on the race issue But they are less doctrinaire than Northern liberals such as Senator Hubert H Humphrey of Minnesbta and far less inclined to espouse vigorous government intervention in the private sector for the sake of restructuring the economic order or promoting social justice Their tradition embraces a certain fatalism about social inequalities and the natural pecking order more readily than do Northern liberals with their faith in the perfectability of man and their drive to perfect society Mr Carter himself has made no secret of his impatience with Northern liberals who promise more than they can deliver and his own preference for keeping his promises modest As one senior member of the Carter Administration observed Southern governors including Mr Carter as governor of Georgia have not had to deal with the kind of largescale urban social problems that are commonplace for governors in Northern states like New York Illinois or Pennsylvania Oldstyle Southern populists such as Tom Watson or Pitchfork Ben Tillman of Georgia or Theodore Bilbo of Mississippi flayed corporate interests and sought to help rural white farm folks but rarely thought of sharing more wealth with blacks or the urban poor through government action Free schools and free textbooks found their favor but not massive social programs By their definition people were expected to help themselves Even Lyndon B Johnson in his own more modern brand of populistliberalism talked of the deserving poor meaning largely the hardworking farmers and laborers thrown out of jobs during the Depression a former Johnson Administration official noted Johnson he added had no exposure to an entire urban culture with welfare mothers and others wholly dependent on Federal aid for their living Although Mr Carter represents a new and more modern breed of Southern politician he falls in this tradition and exhibits some of those traditional attitudes His mother is politically liberal his father was conservative as are his two most natural political companions Charles Kirbo an Atlanta attorney and Bert Lance an Atlanta banker and now his budget director In his unrelenting determination to balance the Federal budget by 1981 Mr Carter has given precedence to fiscal restraint over the pleas of aides for larger programs In welfare reform he wants to hold costs to present levels even if some welfare recipients lose benefits In opposing large numbers of water projects he has pitted himself against wasteful spending In opposing the use of Federal aid for most abortions he is resisting the temptation to use Government power in dealing with a moral issue In each case the conservatism of the Southern Dethocrat is coming to the fore in a still dichotomous President

THE LITERARY VIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/17/archives/the-literary-view-nature-as-the-nunnery-literary-view.html,IN an early passage of Samuel Richardsons Clarissa the heroine laments the fact that there are no more nunneries left where she can seek refuge from an obnoxious suitor And her complaint offers an important insight into the ultrasecular nature of the literary form that Richardson was pioneering and into the consequences of this secular vision for women In the widest historical sense the 18thcentury novel reconciled the values of medieval courtly love and its complex romanticizing of female sexuality with the Puritan idealization of marriage Through this curious wedlock it participated in the demise of the monastic ideal that had prevailed in Europe until the Reformation and had suggested that womens first allegiance is to a divine order rather than to any patriarchal rule The novel in George Lukacss words is the epic of a world forsaken by God has described a society in which the theaterof salvation most particularly for women is centered exclusively in the home in Kinder and Kche One wonders whether the novels origins in this supremely worldly ethic and its courtly presentation of the female as sex object have helped to make the novel impervious to the theme of womens spiritual quests In what classical work does the heroine seek religious or mystical fulfillment with the intensity for instance of Dostoyevskys Alyosha Bernanoss country priest or even the hero Somerset Maughams The Razors Edge The rarity of such a search is all the more striking because flies directly against the reality of history The experience of mystical vision is fully as frequent among women as among men Catherine of Siena Joan Norwich Theresa of Avila Joan of Arc and in our time Simone Weil are only a few of the names that come to mind in a long history of women mystics The nature of female mysticism and its barely explored literary possibilities have recently received increased scrutiny from a new generation of feminist theologians Mary Daly and Rosemary Reuther among many others have attacked our JudeoChristian tradition for its exclusively masculine imagery And they have questioned the adequacy of such figures as Father and Son for a contemporary expressioneither liturgical or literaryof womens spiritual quest Since this new awareness the woman novelist who also happens to be a feminist and who seeks to depict a religious vision uniquely female in character is not likely to have her heroine discover the predominantly male cast of the JudeoChristian pantheon at the end of her spiritual pilgrimage She would tend to seek vision in other traditions more richly endowed with female symbols of ultimate reality She could turn for instance to Eastern models such as the malefemale pairing of YinYang in Taoism or the ShivaShakti of Tantric Buddhism she could return to prehistoric images of the Great Mother cults she could even resort to the heretic medieval tradition of Meister Eckhart which refuses to attribute to the Godhead any human charactersexual The interest in womens religious experience has become so intense that feminist historians are currently inclined to draw a distinction between what they call the novel of social quest and the novel of spiritual quest The theme of social quest which has amply endowed literature from Charlotte Bront and Colette to Lisa Alther and Marge Piercy shows heroines acquiring a heightened sense of identity purpose vocation power by risking a temporary alienation from society In the novel of spiritual quest however which up to this decade had been tackled only by Doris Leasing the protagonist undertakes a journey whose purpose to attain a new relation to cosmic power to some manifestation transcendent deity The relentless centrality of a womans search for religious vision in Margaret Atwoods Surfacing published in 1972 makes it a novel unique in our time And the singular prophetic power with which she depicts her heroines quest makes it for me one of the most important novels of the 20thcentury Atwood is in her early 30s Canadian author of seven volumes of poetry and two other novels The Edible Woman and Lady Oracle and is generally hailed a prophet in her own country as the star of Canadian letters Flow backwards to your sources sacred rivers and let the worlds great rivers be reversed  The primeval matriarchal direction of this womens chorus in Euripides is clearly the one Atwood has taken in her quest for religious symbols The protagonist of Surfacing returns to the island in the Canadian wilderness where she had lived as a child to search for her father a lone forestdweller and student of American Indian lore who has been mysteriously missing for a month The novels pervasive religious imagery makes it clear that she has also returned to search for some power of communion with nature that her father failed to teach her fully some way of contact with the primeval gods originally worshiped on her island She is accompanied on this journey by three contemporaries a woman and two men decadent urban Bohemians kneejerk Canadian nationalists who deplore the American capitalistic pigs encroachment on their wilderness yet have themselves lost Woman as visionary protector and provider Atwood reverses the Western stereotypes of male and female behavior more radically than any other novelist who comes to mind Her nameless heroine is the one who teaches her male companions to fish to hunt to split logs to build fires Her lover is totally dependent on her domestically in need of sex and household She on the contrary is only seeking vision The annoying social task of choosing a male to live with is like buying a goldfish or a potted cactus plant Identifying her body with the virgin wilderness threatened by male technology she sees sexual contact as a sacrilege a profane threat to her visionary The stages of the heroines quest are starkly archetypal Heroine of the thousand faces she descends like Persepbone into the world of the dead she tests eke Perseus the extreme limits of human endurance she finds her ultimate vision in the selfenforced solitude By plunging repeatedly into the glacial lake by the side of which she spent her childhood she reaches the first stage in her search and finds the body of her drowned father Atoning for a previous abortion she reaches the next stage of her quest through a reconciliation with nature She decides to conceive in accordance with primeval rites with the full moon over my left shoulder a child whom she will bear by herself squatting on dry leaves without the aid of male technology Ill lick it off and bite the cord it will be covered with shining fur a God I will never teach it Surfacing is laced with religious allusions And its Christian symbols handled with the cool offhand ironic collagist style that informs touch of Atwoods fiction are relegated to the dross of our technological civilization to the logic that failed The handless arm of a woman shopkeeper is miraculous like the toes of saints or the cut off pieces of early martyrs The Western ways of worship are no more use now than silver bullets or the sign of the cross The animals die that we may live hunters in the fall killing the deer that is Christ also Atwood substitutes naturalistic epiphanies of prehistoric character The Indians did not own salvation but they had once known where it lived Their signs marked the sacred places the places where you In the terrifying last stages of her transformation the protagonist dismisses her friends to remain alone in the sacred tribal space of her fathers house and loses much of her human identity She enters a stage of savage hallucination prowling through the island on all fours feeding on roots and wild berries sleeping in relays like a bobcat kicking carth over her droppings so as not to show her traces waiting to see the fur growing on her body At the books end Atwoods metaphors blur all distinction between nature and humanity The frog with goldrimmed eyes is both her ancestor and her present self It includes me it shines I lean against a tree I am a tree leaning    I am not an animal or a tree I am the thing in which move and grow Finallying out of her trance facing her matted hair in the mirror returning to socalled civilization opening a can of beans to nourish her starved body she decides to take her transformed self and her new knowledge back to the city And she marks her new selfhood with a message that must remain the common denominator of au profoundly femnist works This above all to refuse to be a victim    give up the belief that I am powerless The debate that Surfacing has provoked among contemporaty scholars is almost as fascinating as the novel itself Signs for instance the superb journal of womens studies edited by Catharine Stimpson of Barnard College has devoted part of a recent issue to an examination of Atwoods religious symbolism In its Winter 1976 number two young theologiens Carol Christ and Judith Plaskow raise the following questions Are the overwhelmingly pantheistic symbols of Atwoods vision and her archaic identification of womans body with the forces of nature a legacy of oppression or a potential source of wisdom and power Might not her symbols of female naturism with all the biological determinism they imply reinforce the dangerous stereotypes that assign earthiness and instinctualism to females and transcendence and abstract thought But Atwoods genius rises above these debates For her naturalistic epiphanies are of a strictly mythic nature and never tend to stereotyping or separatism The female religious vision that she presents in her utterly remarkable book also marks the surfacing I believe of a future tradition of religious quest in womens novels From Emily Bronts moors to Doris Lessings forbidden velds women authors have turned to nature not only in search of heightened perception but also as a refuge from the patriarchal order Atwood stands in that particular tradition For the woman who has not fully abdicated Simone de Beauvoir wrote nature represents what woman herself represents for man    a kingdom and a place of exile Until all forms of sexual dominance are abolished nature may be the only form of nunnery left to us the only sacred shelter remaining in that desacralized world which gave rise to Clarissas sorrows and to the great power
Feminism May Sink or Swim With the E.R.A.,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/17/archives/feminism-may-sink-or-swim-with-the-era-sisterhood-powerful-but-not.html,WASHINGTONFor the womens movement these are neither the best nor the worst of times there have been some victories in recent months and some perhaps more significant defeats But the most important issue for the movement remains unresolved The fate of the Equal Rights Amendment is still uncertain Since Congressional passage in 1972 35 states have ratified the amendment but 38 must approve it by 1979 if it is to become part of the Constitution In three states that had passed it legislatures have since voted to rescind though it is questionable whether they have the power to do so North Carolina and Illinois rejected the amendment this year while other legislatures have simply tabled it There is agreement within the womens movement that the amendments success is critical because its defeat would jeopardize gains already won and would raise the odds against further change If we cant get the political skills necessary to push this down their throats said Carol Burris of Womens Lobby where are we going to get the political skills necessary to pass anything else Martha Buck the executive vice president of the National Organization for Women used the word terrifying to describe the future for the womens movement if the amendment is defeated Its significance many feel may lie less in what it would do if passed than in its symbolic value its defeat would signal that women do not have enough political clout to earn the response of elected politicians Abortion is probably next highest on most movement priority lists with the Equal Rights Amendment it was the principal issue at last weeks New York State Womens Meeting to elect delegates to the National Womens Conference in Houston in November That abortion is potentially divisive among women if not within the womens movementis clear and generally acknowledged At the New York meeting an opposition slate of candidates fought both abortion and the amendment In two other states Ohio and Missouri righttolife forces dominated the delegations At NOW whose 58000 members make it the largest womens group in the country reproductive rights come second only to the amendment for Miss Buck It is also important for Womens Lobby but others may be equally so including what Anne Broderick Zill of the Womens Campaign Fund calls economic power largely sought through upgrading of womens employment Though the Labor Department reported that the gap between mens and womens wages is widening this year the Suprcme Court declared height and weight requirements that tend to discriminate against generally smaller and lighter women to be unconstitutional There have been other gains in employment Two Federally chartered banks directed by women have been given preliminary approval by the Government women will soon be serving at sea aboard Coast Guard cutters and the Episcopal Church has appointed its first woman rector But Rotary International the sort of businessoriented group that many wonten fcel they must be included in if they are to compete in the busindss world decided this year that is sitll year that it stilt wont admit them There is more disagreement within the womens movement itsel about its own effectiveness than on its objectives For Mrs Zill The trouble with the womens movement and the abortion struggle is that they are run by a series of elites dominated by educated uppermiddleclass women We do not sufficiently reach people not only of a low economic status but people whose values and sense of life purpose are completely different said Mrs Zill I dont talk enough of the time to women whose lives are different from mine I dont talk sadly to many women who are simply housewives But she is encouraged by womens increasing willingness to contribute to other womens drives to be elected92 percent of the funds raised by her group came from women this yearand by at least the start of a movement toward coalition Her group for example and the National Womens Political Caucus have recently agreed to work together in such ways as sharing mailing lists NONs Martha Buck disagrees with the charge of elitism She said she believed NOW had proportional representation of bluecollar Women although demographic studies of its membership have not been made Miss Buck thinks it is unfair to blame the womens movement for not being universally representative Its women critics she said tend to come out of very conservative backgrounds and the right wing uses issues such as the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion as an organizing tool The other group who tend to be opposed she said are women who tend to be terrified women who see the patterns of their own lives disturbed or discredited by the broadening of womens horizons Asked if there was no way that groups such as NOW could reassure them she said I dont think were in the business of reassuring and added that the goals of the womens movement if reached would bring greater happiness to everybody If the Equal Rights Amendment finally falls said one of Miss Bucks colleagues much that has been achieved will go by the board And to judge from a recent nationwide poll of 17yearolds even some young people wouldnt care Almost 30 percent of 4600 students asked to write essays on womens role in society indicated that they believe a womans place is right where its always been the honie But the poll broken down by sex showed that this was the view of 37 percent of the males and only 21 percent of the females58 percent of whom said women should be able to do whatever sort of work they wanted

Legislature in New Jerseys history is taking a couple of months off And it is the first summer in the last four that the 80 Assemblymen and 40 Senators have not been under the pressure of trying to pass a state income tax Enjoy said the Assembly Speaker William J Hamilton Jr Democrat of New Brunswick last Monday night after the Assembly had spent 10 hours Wrapping up loose ends The State Senate is scheduled to re turn to Trenton tomorrow to vote on some appointments made by the Governor and the Assembly might be called back into session in August to appropriate money to help the New York Nets a basetball team move to New Jersey Otherwise the next sessions likely will not be held until September In addition to passing the income tax the 197677 session gave New Jersey casino gambling at Atlantic City repealed a number of business taxes in an effort to improve the economy and created the nations most comprehensive Department of Energy in a move designed to try to keep New Jersey homes from being cold next winter It also Agreed to try public financing of the Governors race this year Voted approval of the concept of improving the living quality of the elderly Made a start on cleaning up slums by making it unlawful for banks and other institutions to refuse to make realestate loans in slum areas Mailed several cities out of a fiscal bind by creating a state agency to do their borrowing Adopted stricter laws covering the ethics and activities of legislators public officials and lobbyists Reformed state driving laws making it harder to get and keep drivers licenses abolished drunkeness as a crime devised a system of requiring treatment for drunken drivers and termed alcoholism a disease treatable under Blue Cross and other medical insurance plans Passed a safedrinking water act when it became known that much of New Jerseys drinking water was being poisoned by chemical and industrial waste Laid the groundwork for a program to combat cancer and made mandatory tests on newborn babies for many physical and some mental defects Created an ombudsman for the elderly ordered more state auditors to hunt out welfare cheats joined the growing national trend toward putting controls back on abortion and passed Bill of Rights for nursing home patients Outlawed once again pornography and other patently offensive sexual works Passed a death penalty for heinous murders a measure that Governor Byrne said he would sign into law if the Legislature also approved a new model penal code updating New Jerseys criminal laws Began a study toward revising New Jerseys nofault automobile insurance laws described by some Federal officials as being the worst in the nation Increased the states financial contribution toward the arts and created a state television and

the Legislature took it up in earnest in 1976 Discussion of the levy dominated 14 of the 32 days in which the Legislature met in 1976 being the only major topic taken up until the tax finally was passed on July 8 1976 The tax was fought bitterly by most Republican legislators who are now trying to make it the major issue in this falls state elections The 700 million in revenue from the 2 to 25 percent tax has enabled the Legislature to begin complying with a court order that New Jersey take over up to 40 percent of the 3 billion annual cost of the states public school system Previously about 25 billion of this has been raised locally through property taxes giving New Jersey one of the nations highest property tax rates The income tax expires June 30 1978 and discussions of whether to reenact it or to pass another tax to take its place are expected to make next years legislative sessions a replay of those of 1974 1975 and 1976 
Carey Often Seems Otherwise Engaged,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/17/archives/carey-often-seems-otherwise-engaged.html,ALBANYThis was the year Hugh L Carey had to come back down to earth With the acute public phase of the New York City fiscal crisis over with the cliffhangers of 197576 things of the past Mr Carey found himself in the third year of his term no longer the daring rescuer of agencies and savior of cities He was for the first time simply a Governor of a state with a moribund economy a Legislature in partisan stalemate and a citizenryas Mr Carey himself observed his State of the State message last Januarywho wanted nothing more from Albany than to be left alcne And so the 1977 legislative session that ended last week was in its own way a special time testing for the Governor It was businessasusual for the first time and it was a letdown A lot of the stuff he has to deal with now is a bore and he doesnt bore well says his friend and adviser Felix G Rohatyn Consequently Mr Careys Involvement with the legislative aspects of his jotroftenhad a desultory distracted quality this year His attention clearly was focused elsewhereon the New York City mayoral race where his search for an alternative to Mayor Beame was a preoccupation for months and on his fellow northeastern Governors whom he forged into a vocal advocacy group for regional interest Mr Carey did get much of what he wanted out of the Legislature bit the Carey of 1977 was a man of contradictions whose acute but undisciplined mind rarely seemed fully engaged who was as much of an enigma as ever to those who came into contact with him When he really tried he was unbeatable He gave intense personal attention to his third budget and the result was an important victory both substantive and political With a tight hold on spending he outflanked the Republican Senate on the right He placated the Democratic Assembly with timely compromises on his originally harsh welfare cuts He got the public credit for a tax cut half of which would have happened anyway and received the ultimate vindication he sought for in the nations financial markets a 451 percent borrowing rate instead of the 7 percent the state had to pay the year before But later he let the Legislatureoutdo him with a fouryear extension of the Tenant Protection Act while his own housing policy was nonexistent The threat of a orisis in the states subsidized middleincome housing program was greater at the end of the session than at the beginning  He lost a key nomination that of his Congressional friend Peter A Peyser to head the Public Service Commission The Peyser episode was symptomatic of Mr Careys legislative problems The nomination as many of his advisers warned him was certain to be controversial Not only did Mr Peyser have no experience in utility regulation but he had only switched to the Democratic Party a few months before Common sense dictated that Mr Carey at least touch base with the Democratic leadership in the Senate before going Public with the nomination But he did not The startled Democrats immediately began taking potshots at Mr Peyser with the result that the Republicans were also able to oppose him without the risk of being accused of strictly partisan motivation Carey could make it so easy for himself one Democrat said after the Peyser affair It would take so little extra effort But he doesnt care enough There is at bit of Jimmy Carter in Hugh Caseys refusal to cultivate and stroke legislators an activity at which Nelson A Rockefeller excelled Actually Governor Rockefeller did not rely on his powers of persuasion alone to get legislators to take tough votes In those days of fiscal largesse there were statefinanced projects for local districts and other goodies of the sort Governor Carey is now likely to veto let alone propose If the legislative niceties bore him there is also something of Jimmy Carter in Governor Careys obvious enjoyment of the bully pulpit aspect of his job He has spoken over the Legislatures head forcefully and directly to the people on his opposition to the death penalty I have seen too much of death says the man who has buried his wife and two oldest sons and who vetoed a capital punishment bill last week to restrictions on abortion and even to the Irish Republican Army He relishes claiming an issue and speaking out clearly What he does not like one aide says is punching pillows getting bogged down in nuance with the politically split houses He is skillful at orchestrating public opinion to force the Legislature to move when it would prefer to do nothing This was the case with amendments on court reorganization and the restructuring of the Department of Mental Hygiene On both issues public interest was narrow but deep and administration aides developed special interest constituencies that helped the Governor achieve his legislative goals A Wary Legislature These strategies ale not calculated to endear Mr Carey to the Legislature Wariness not warmth about the best he can hope for and probably about all he wants However his relations with the Assemblys Democratic leadership have rebounded from their 1976 low point He and both Democratic legislative leaders Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut and Senate Minority Leader Manfred Ohrenstein collaborated on endofsession strategy and won a substantial portion of the modest program with which he began this years session It is generally assumed that Mr Carey is a candidate for reelection next year and he would go into the race a heavy favorite But the mood now is more one of anticlimai than enthusiasm As one of his advisers says Look he knows that when history is written hell be in the books for the fiscal crisis Nothing he can do will ever top that All the rest of itits like taking a general whos won the major battle of the war and analyzing how he grooms his horse and whether hes kind to his troops Slowly the Governor is getting a grip on the sprawling state bureaucracy Some perennial trouble spots like the Division for Youth are probably better managed now than at any time in the recent past By executive action he has reorganized the unwieldy Department of Health Hes not always interested in it but he probably knows more detail about this government after two and a half years than Rockefeller did after 15 says a man who has worked for both Still having been a Congressman for 14 years Mr Carey has more of a legislative than an executive personality He relies heavily on his staff to keep the office functioning Advance planning is not one of his strengths Two of his closest aides Peter C Goldmark Jr his budget director and David W Burke secretary to the Governor are leaving this summer and a subdued power struggle is underway for the inevitable reorganization No matter what the outcome there is unlikely to be a major change in pace or tone Hugh Carey is back down on earth and the path he travels sometimes smooth sometimes bumpy is largely of his own making

the Governor requestedand in fact raised the schoolaid formula by 75 million A new formula that would increase the state share of homerelief payments for localities outside New York City also took

The Unfairness of It All,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/19/archives/the-unfairness-of-it-all.html,Just before the lights went out in New York the other evening President Carter gave us a disquisition on the innate unfairness of capitalism The moneyed classes he said enjoyed many luxuries unavailable to others but this did not oblige the Government to provide matching luxury service to the impecunious He was explaining why he opposed Medicaid abortions for the poor his point being that abortion was a luxurious form of birth control Like Scotch salmon and summer houses on Long Island he seemed to be saying abortion might be one of the rights accruing to money but the Government had no obligation to pay for it It was one of those unfairnesses that are an unfortunate byproduct of the system After this chilly exposition of the obvious one wondered whether the poor folks would take their rotten luck like good sports The answer came within a few hours when New York went dark and thousands of them started looting This is not to suggest that they needed Mr Carters lecture to learn that they had been living on the unfair side of the tracks or even to persuade them that the Government was willing to let them grow old there Very few probably even heeded the Presidents statement if indeed they heard it Most probably did not even think in terms of fairness and unfairness philosophical ideas which require a certain elegance of mind not usually found in the looting personality The point is that while it is very sturdy of comfortable men to point out that life is unfair the people it is unfair to are not apt to be morally or philosophically elevatect by the announcement If you are going to preach that unfairness is inescapable for some good sense suggests that you also accept the inevitability of beastly behavior by people who have to carry the burden Unless you are a Dickens heroine it becomes insufferable after awhile constantly having all the unfairness left on your doorstep while the Maya fair swells are eating Scotch salmon weekending in the Hamptons and enjoying exclusive membership in the Abortion Club You may not take to the streets with torch and shotgun but you are likely to find your eyes going glassy when the professor or the President talks about social obligations If the lights go out on a steamy summer nightwell life is unfair isnt it And how often does it provide a chance for a romp The trick in politics and government is to keep the lip buttoned about the unfairness of life while harping on the blessings that will soon descend equally upon all thanks to the zeal and ingenuity of the governing Mass Our recent governments have decided against extending too much hope to lifes losers but until President Carter no one has deliberately rubbed their wretched noses in the inescapability of unfairness Under Presidents Nixon and Ford economic policy required millions of them to remain unemployed as a defense against inflation A floundering educational system helped train them for future uselessness except as anti inflation tools Bankruptive welfare systems turned the malice of the taxpaying class upon them and in Congress this was transmuted into a punitive hostility toward the cities like New York where they were herded away en masse but happily out of eight It was all very unfair but as everybody knewthe economists and the Congress and Presidents Nixon and Ford and the working class that was having trouble getting together beer money what with all the taxes and having to feed the colleges to keep their children upwardly mobilelife was unfair terribly unfair and didnt do any good to Make promises you couldnt keep even if you manted to And of course life is unfair There is no getting around it It was unfair of those looters to behave as they did when the lights went out Unfair to the merchants they destroyed Unfair to New York City Unfair to call attention to the grisly fact of what is out there behind the unemployment OBSERVER figures the daily crime statistics the welfare budget figures the high school illiteracy scores the illegitimatebirth statistics Animals and scum they were called by New Yorkers shocked by the unfairness of it all Perhaps they are although many of them seemed to be just children In any case they behaved badly If you believe in President Carters unfairness doctrine you could hardly have expected much else
State Insists That Bar on Medicaid For AbortionConforms to U.S. Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/19/archives/new-jersey-pages-state-insists-that-bar-on-medicaid-for-abortion.html,TRENTON July 18The state argued in Federal District Court here today that a New Jersey law barring Medicaid payments for abortions except to preserve the womans life conformed both with the United States Constitution and Federal Social Security laws In a hearing before Judge George H Barlow the state contended also that such a policy of restricting public medical funds for elective or nontherapeutic abortions did not conflict with publiclyfinanced hospital services for childbirth It cited a recent United States Supreme Court opinion for that conclusion Judge Barlow extended an earlier ruling on a challenge to the law brought by a number of pregnant women seeking electiye abortions and by their doctors and a Planned Parenthoo s Association and he held that the law was at least temporarily in effect He postponed his final judgment however pending further study The statute being challenged by the plaintiffs who are represented by the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union was signed into law by Governor Byrne on Dec 18 1975 In March 1976 Judge Barlow issued a temporary injunction against the law pending resolution of the suit challenging its constitutionality under the 14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection and medical payment provisions of the Federal Social Security Act Supreme Court Rulings Cited Judge Barlow lifted that injunction last June 27 on the ground that constitutional challenges of the New Jersey statute appeared to have little chance of succeeding in light of three abortion rulings by the United States Supreme Court on June 20 In cases involving Connecticut and Pennsylvania state laws and a St Louis statute the high court ruled 6 to 3 that neither the Constitution nor Federal Sociat Security law required state expenditure of Medicaid funds for elective or nontherapeutic abortionsthose not considered medically necessary New Jerseys Attorney General William F Nyland promptly moved at that time for a summary judgment that would allOw the state law to go into effect immediately Acting on Judge Barlows lifting of the injunction against the law the state Department of Human Services announced last Thprsday that Medicaid payments would no longer be made for abortions after Aug 15 unless it is medically indicated to be necessary to preserve the life of the woman is so certified by the physician and is performed in a hospital Marian B Copeland cooperating lawyer for the state ACLU who has been representing the plaintiffs in the suit disputed in court today the validity of the state laws language that an abortion eligible for Medicaid funds must be medically indicated to be necessary to preserve the womans life She cited a 1973 Supreme Court decision that whether an abortion is necessary is a professional judgment that may be exercised in the light of all factorsphysical emotional psychological familial and the womans agerelevant to the wellbeing of the patient All these factors may relate to health Mrs Copeland said it was her opinion and that of her clients that the determination of medical necessity is to be made by the attending physician in each instance Erminie L Conley deputy attorney general representing the defendantswho are listed as Ann Klein State Commissioner of Human Services and others argued that the plaintiffs had sought to obtain elective or nonmedicallynecessary abortions but that having found that the state law restricted the use of Medicaid funds for asuch purposes they challenged the constitutionality and legal grounds of the law That there is no merit to either ground has been made clear by the recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States she said The spectators benches in Judge Barlows courtroom were filled with young womenrand a few young menmany of whom earlier had picketed outside the courthouse on East State Street on behalf of proabortion forces They said they represented organizations known as the Right to Choose Peoples Independent Coalition and the National Organization of WomenNew Jersey
Delegates Are Preparing for Women's Conference,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/20/archives/new-jersey-pages-delegates-are-preparing-for-womens-conference.html,NEWARK July 19Clara Allen of Union City the top votesetter among the states 40 newly elected delegates to the National Womens Conference in Houston Nov 18 to 21 expressed gratification today over the success of last months New Jersey International Womens Year meeting at Princeton University Lopes of the recommendations adopted by the 3000 women at Princeton will go out to each delegate for study well in advance said Mrs Allen who headed the states International Womens Year committee and is state director for the Communications Workers of America Citing the value of the state gathering which brought together women from all walks of life many of whom had never before expressed themselves on issues such as equal rights and other key issues Mrs Allen said in an interview I would assume that the Houston conference would enlarge on the overall nationwide viewpoint Although she believes that the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion will be the two most hotly debated issues at the Houston meeting Mrs Allen said she thought it was unfortunate that these issues overshadowed others of concern The workshop at Princeton on women over 50 was extremely popular as was the one on assertiveness and another on battered women she said I think we 3gt carried away with ERA and abortion and there was so much more underlying the conference here Following Mrs Allen in the vote totals were Mae Massie Eberhard of Newark representing Black Women United and Ming Hsu of Westfield a former member of the National Commission on the Ob servance of the International Womens Year Joy Bennett regional coordinator for the conference said 1442 delegates had been elected from the United States and its territories Four hundred delegatesatlarge will be added to insure a balanced representation Miss Bennett said Other women have already asked to come as observers she said Ive received inquiries from as far away as Alaska from women who are already planning fundraising events for the Houston conference Miss Bennett said I think there is a historical aspect to the conference as well as a number of interesting workshops that attract women Within three months after the meeting a report to President Carter and the Congress will be prepared The report is due March 1978 she said The conference grew out of the 1975 International Womens Year Meeting in Mexico when Congress approved Public Law 94167 mandating it and the following year appropriated 5 million with which to implement it While the worldwide goal was to work for womens rights in the decade following the initial meeting in Mexico an interim meeting has been scheduled for 1980 Miss Bennett said The national agenda will represent the consensus of the state meetings and the priority of concerns of many diverse viewpoints said Eileen P Thornton of Trenton who is National President of Womens Equity Action League We agree on many more issues than we disagree and the very diversity of the women represented is what gives us our strength she said Although conferences have been held on youth on the aging on drugs and a variety of other subjects this is the first time the Federal Government has held one on women Miss Thornton noted adding Once our priorities have been established we the women of this nation will have a responsibility to make sure that the Presidential recommendations are translated into legislation or whatever action is necessary to insure compliance Among the recommendations adopted by the New Jersey conference were Sup port for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment support for the series of United States Supreme Court decisions guaranteeing reproductive freedom to women a call on government at all levels to provide family planning services for teenagers to offer education programs in responsible sexuality and to reform laws discriminating against illegitimate children and their parents and support for the passage of laws prohibiting dis crimination on the basis of sexual or affectional preference in the area of civil rights

A.C.L.U FINDS CARTER LAGGING ON LIBERTIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/21/archives/aclu-finds-carter-lagging-on-liberties-asserts-that-the.html,WASHINGTONJuly 20The American Civil Liberties Union accused the Carter Administration today of compiling a poor civil liberties record in its first six months in office We are very disappointed in what has taken place to date Aryeh Neier executive director of the organization told a news conference Candidate Carter gave us the right to anticipate a better performance Over all the Administrations performance on civil liberties has been quite poor John HF Shattuck Washington director of the organization added This Administration has been ineffective or openly hostile when minority rights were under attack in Congress The Administration has been unwilling to exercise the kind of leadership that is necessary At the White House a spokesman said that there would be no comment on the charges The report that the two officials released however gave President Carter and his advisers credit for improvements in a number of areas including amnesty freedom of information school desegregation voter registration and human rights More Secrecy Held Goal Charging that the President had backed away from campaign promises to make the national security establishment accountable to American citizens the report said that Mr Carter is seeking core secrecy not less for intelligence agency operations When he was candidate Carter it was somebody elses CIA and FBI Mr Neier said Now its his CIA and FBI The report was particularly critical of Mr Carter for his opposition to the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions for the poor The Presidents statements on the issue have been extraordinarily callous it said They apparently derive from a personal religious opposition to abortion and a willingness to impose those views on others In the area of wiretapping the civil liberties union opposed the Administrations support of a bill that would allow surveillance in espionage cases of both Americans and foreigners without any judicial finding of probable criminal activity The organization said that Vice President Mondale testified against legislation authorizing such warrantless wiretapping when he was a Senator but onw served as the White House briefing officer on the merits of a legislative approach he once opposed Fundamental Protections The Carter Justice Department has opposed legislation that would give individuals notice that their bank credit card or telephone toll records were being turned over to the Government the report said This places the Administration on record as opposing the most fundamental constitutional protections against unlimited governmental search powers without which the individuals personal records will remain as they are now totally vulnerable to inspection and seizure by any Government agent the reportadded At a time when organized opposition to the exercise of constitutional rights by minority groups is increasingly strong as demonstrated by recent Congressional actions cutting back on abortion rights and desegregation efforts the Carter Administration has at worst encouraged this opposition and has often been passive in efforts to proteei minority rights Its hostility on issues such as abortion and its ineffectiveness in dealing with Congress have combined to create a poor sixmonth record for an Administration which should have a strong potential for civil rights leadership
Carter's Record Assailed by Head Of Urban League,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/22/archives/carters-record-assailed-by-head-of-urban-league.html,WASHINGTON July 21Vernon Jordan executive director of the National Urban League who is one of the black leaders closest to President Carter says that the Carter Administration has fallen short on policies programs and people In an interview yesterday in which he outlined criticism that he plans to express here Sunday night in an address opening the annual conference of the league Mr Jordan said We expected Mr Carter to be working as hard to meet the needs of minorities and the poor as he did to get our votes But so far we have been disappointed A Number of Issues The 41yearold Atlantan who is emerging as the senior civil rights spokesman took issue with the President on a number of issues ranging from his life is unfair comment on Federal abortion aid to poor women to policies on welfare voting reform and economic stimulus strategy Mr Jordans criticisms are expected to be the broadest yet delivered by a major black leader And on Monday morning the day after he speaks President Carter will address the same 8500 league delegates The rebuke by the Urban League leader may be all the more pointed coming from an agency long regarded as relatively moderate among black organizations in manner and style if not in the substance of its program Among the points that Mr Jordan said he would make were the following Despite assertions by the Administration that it has done especially well in placing blacks in significant offices appointments have fallen short of the expectation of blacks Campaign promises that Mr Carter made to blacks in churches and inner city neighborhoods are not matched yet by performance and there has been too much talk of budget balancing and too little effort to create employment especially for youths The league is sharply disappointed with the Administrations decision to give up its efforts to obtain mandatory Election Day registration procedures in national elections and also opposes Mr Carters idea of abolishing the Electoral College a mechanism that gives minorities the balance of power in Presidential elections President Carter appears in Mr Jordans view to have little understanding of the cities and the masses of the poor blacks and other groups whose needs he said were overwhelming local governments and Federal policies Although the thrust of his speech will be to stake our claim on the Administration Mr Jordan said he will also acknowledge accomplishments in the last six months Calls Carter More Approachable He praised Mr Carter for building national confidence in the institution of the Presidency and creating the image of a more approachable President in contrast with the imperial Presidency of Richard Nixon In a development that served as a prelude to his appearance at the league meeting President Carter today ordered all Government departments and agencies to enforce the law barring discrimination on grounds of race color or national origin In a statement he lauded the law Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and said There are no exceptions to this rule No matter how important a program no matter how urgent the goals they do not excuse violating any of our laws including the laws against discrimination In the interview in his suite at the Washington Hilton headquarters for the quadrennial Washington conference Mr Jordan said that Mr Carter might have appointed more blacks to office than his Republican predecessors but added Thats not the standard by which we measure him We expect much better He said that the Presidents stand against Federal aid to poor women for elective abortions in which Mr Carter observed that life is unfair ignored the view that the Government has a role in creating equity among citizens and minimizing unfairness As a lawyer who once headed the Voter Education Project in Atlanta a program that helped thousands of blacks to register for the first time Mr Jordan said he was keenly interested in election reform legislation pending in Congress The right to register on Election Day would be a real aid to potential minority and poor people and would help to enlarge the franchise he said The Administration convinced that it did not have the votes to require states to provide Election Day registration agreed last week to a change in the election bill to make such registration optional Furthermore Mr Jordan said that the Administrations opposition to the Electoral College system which provides for all of the electoral votes in a state going to the candidate who obtains a majority would cut minority voting power Without it he said Mr Carter might not have won Pennsylvania Louisiana Ohio and Texas

Carter's Record Assailed by Head Of Urban League,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/22/archives/carters-record-assailed-by-head-of-urban-league-carter.html,WASHINGTON July 21Vernon Jordan executive director of the National Urban League who is one of the black leaders closest to President Carter says that the Carter Administration has fallen short on policies programs and people In an interview yesterday in which he outlined criticism that he plans to express here Sunday night in an address opening the annual conference of the league Mr Jordan said We expected Mr Carter to be working as hard to meet the needs of minorities and the poor as he did to get our votes But so far we have been disappointed A Number of Issues The 41yearold Atlantan who is emerging as the senior civil rights spokesman took issue with the President on a number of issues ranging from his life is unfair comment on Federal abortion aid to poor women to policies on welfare voting reform and economic stimulus strategy Mr Jordans criticisms are expected to be thebroadest yet delivered by a major black leader And on Monday morning the day after he speaks President Carter will address the same 8500 league delegates The rebuke by the Urban League leader may be all the more pointed coming from an agency long regarded as relatively moderate among black organizations in manner and style if not in the substance of its program Among the points that Mr Jordan said he would make were the following Despite assertions by the Administration that it has done especially well in placing blacks in significant offices appointments have fallen short of the expectation of blacks Campaign promises that Mr Carter made to blacks in churches and inner city neighborhoods are not matched yet by performance and there has been too much talk of budget balancing and too little effort to create employment especially for youths The league is sharply disappointed with the Administrations decision to give up its efforts to obtain mandatory Election Day registration procedures in national elections and also opposes Mr Carters idea of abolishing the Electoral College a mechanism that gives minorities the balance of power in Presidential elections President Carter appears in Mr Jordans view to have little understanding of the cities and the masses of the poor blacks and other groups whose needs he said were overwhelming local governments and Federal policies Although the thrust of his speech will be to stake our claim on the Administration Mr Jordan said he will also acknowledge accomplishments in the last six months Calls Carter More Approachable He praised Mr Carter for building national confidence in the institution of the Presidency and creating the image of a more approachable President in contrast with the imperial Presidency of Richard Nixon In a development that served as a prelude to his appearance at the league meeting President Carter today ordered all Government departments and agencies to enforce the law barring discrimination on grounds of race color or national origin In a statement he lauded the law Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and said There are no exceptions to this rule No matter how important a program no matter how urgent the goals they do not excuse violating any of our laws including the laws against discrimination In the interview in his suite at the Washington Hilton headquarters for the quadrennial Washington conference Mr Jordan said that Mr Carter might have appointed more blacks to office than his Republican predecessors but added Thats not the standard by which we measure him We expect much better He said that the Presidents stand against Federal aid to poor women for elective abortions in which Mr Carter observed that life is unfair ignored the view that the Government has a role in creating equity among citizens and minimizing unfairness As a lawyer who once headed the Voter Education Project in Atlanta a program that helped thousands of blacks to register for the first time Mr Jordan said he was keenly interested in election reform legislation pending in Congress The right to register on Election Day would be a real aid to potential minority and poor people and would help to enlarge the franchise he said The Administration convinced that it did not have the votes to require states to provide Election Day registration agreed last week to a change in the election bill to make such registration optional Furthermore Mr Jordan said that the Administrations opposition to the Electoral College system which provides for all of the electoral votes in a state going to the candidate who obtains a majority would cut minority voting power Without it he said Mr Carter might not have won Pennsylvania Louisiana Ohio and Texas
"Support Waning, Women's Movement Knuckles Under in japan",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/23/archives/support-waning-womens-movement-knuckles-under-in-japan.html,TOKYO July 22Japans womens liberation movement has folded After enduring five years of frustrating struggle and ridicule which can be immensely powerful in groupconscious Japan the only major womens liberation group and its affiliates have shuttered their offices and admitted defeat at the hands of an overpowering male chauvinism and a wide generation gap among women seeking to change their social status The final straw may have been the nationwide parliamentary elections on July 10 which saw the new Japan Womens Party get only fourtenths of 1 percent of the total popular vote thus electing nobody I am afraid the cause of womens liberation in Japan is finished said Miswo Enoki Miss Enoki a 32yearold pharmacist led a fight to legalize birth control pills in 1972 that ignited the modern womens movement In this 2600yearold land where change comes slowly The drive for womens rights in Japan may be revived someday if the maturing generation of young women breaks sufficiently with strong family ties to make the social soil more fertile for change But without Miss Enold who has become a symbol to many through Japans pervasive mass media the womens liberation movement here is expected to virtually disappear for the foreseeable future She will Recuperate Miss Enoki who uses her malden name despite her marriage to a physician named Natsuo Kiuchi said that she planned to spend the next few months in a hospital principally recovering from exhaustion Then as part of a bargain she struck with her husband when he lent her 38000 to help finance her partys recent political campaign she will return to doing the housework in their suburban Tokyo apartment Her 36yearold husband who said that he had gained a new appreciation for the rigors of homemaking during his wifes absence has agreed to write off 2670 of the loan for each months housework At that Miss Enokl will be among the highest paid females in a maledominated country where women did not have the right to vote until 1946 and then only at the insistence of American occupation authorities Now they are a majority of the electorate According to Japanese magazines books television men and parents a womans place is to make tea and babiesnot a career or waves After high school and for soma college a Japanese woman typically works in an office factory or bank until perhaps her midtwenties when she comes under the most intense parental pressure to marry and have children It is a rare woman who resists for long Even the militant Miss Enoki felt compelled as a sign of respect for her elderly parents wishes to get married eight years ago at age 24 After marriage the typical womans life revolves almost totally around the home and subsequently children Only in recent years has it become less em barrassing for a husband to have a working wife but only as long as there are no children at home So confined is the average housewifes world here that even with the widespread advent of refrigerators to preserve foods women still go shop ping daily Shopping is more a social occasion to get out and that with other women than it Is an errand Japanese wives rarely go out with their husbands Vacations are often taken separately with friends of the same sex When asked if they ever share their work or worries with their wives male Japanese politicians who hold 740 of Parliaments 763 seats laugh heartily When a foreigner makes a rare visit to a Japanese home the wife stays in the background quietly serving tea and cakes When the visitor asks if the woman can join the group typically both husband and wife appear stunned Somehow it doesnt seem right one wife admitted There is Miss Enoki said In an Interview a lot of consciousness raising to be done here To do this Miss Enokis Pink Panthers women in white military style uniforms with pink helmets marched held sitins and protest rallies Womens Demands Such confrontations not normally prized in Japan focused on demands for womens rights to abortion equal hiring equal pay equitable property settlements and alimony and easier access to contraceptive pills which in Japan can Only be dispensed as medicine not as birth control aids by doctors most of whom are men Miss Enoki felt that her groups which claim 4000 members established a basic awareness of the liberation issue and showed that a woman could be a determined assertive fighter yet remain beautiful and feminine images that to the Japanese mind are contradictory And she foresees future success as the working womans economic power grows But Miss Enokis reform proposals have seemed increasingly radical to many of late calling not for female equality but for female supremacy in a future matriarchy designed to reverse the subservient role Japanese woman have held since the Confucian influence arrived from China more than 1000 years ago But this stand today split the feminine ranks between the conservative middleaged and elderly supporters and a more militant band of younger single women General support appeared to wane too and criticism of Miss Enokis leadership grew With other sympathizers she plans to continue liberation studies while patching up the strains in her marriage and relationship with her parents They dont agree with me at all Miss Enoki said standing by the packing cases outside the office of her now defunct league But I remember my father used to tell me life is too short and you shouldnt be afraid of being alone in pursuit of something you believe in
Abortion for Poor: Legal Confusion,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/24/archives/connecticut-weekly-abortion-for-poor-legal-confusion-effect-of.html,I DONT know what Id do if thought I was pregnant because everybody tells me welfare is of going to pay for any more abortions said Olivia Junes a 24yearold welfare mother in New Haven Mrs Jones is wrong The state has not eliminated abortions for poor women but as a result of last months Supreme Court decision Connecticut has decided to restrict government payments for abortions Her misunderstanding of the new state policy though is a major source of concern to many of those involved in health care for the states poor Such misunderstanding has worried lawyers physicians womensrights advocates and politicians Some doctors feel boxed in a nowin position with the new policy which forces them to certify that an abortion is medically necessary before welfare will pay the bill for an abortion Some lawyers are unsure how to proceed now that the Supreme Court has ruled but they are resolved to fight the laws and regulations they feel unconstitutionally discriminate against poor women Senator Betty Hudson Democrat of Madison is leading an effort to reverse the policy in the Legislature which she believes she will win eventually but not without a struggle since many politicians would like to avoid the controversy in this heavily Catholic state But the most immediate concern to many people is the prospect of hundreds of pregnant welfare womenperhaps poorly educated perhaps immigrants without English proficiencyfailing to understand their rights and the alternatives open to them under the new policy  There is concern amongst the welfare community that abortions will be cut off said Selma Lobel the head of the Hartford Planned Parenthood office and were afraid some women wont bother to seek help The state recently mailed a letter to thousands of welfare recipients It begins with a history of the court battle over Title 19 of the United States Code and then says that on Aug 1 payment for abortions from welfare funds will be made only upon obtaining prior authorization from the department and after receipt of a certificate from the patients physician attesting to the medical necessity Some have criticized the letter as being intimidating The Supreme Court cleared the way for this policy last month when it ruled that states are not required to spend Medicaid money for elective nontherapeutic abortions Connecticut was among the first states along with New Jersey to move to put the ruling into effect Governor Grasso announced that the state was reinstituting the regulations in effect before 1974 limiting welfare abortions to those in medical need When asked to comment on charges that the regulations discriminated against poor women the Governor who is morally opposed to abortion on demand said that she felt it was a sad commentary when the state is accused of punishing poor maple by denying them abortions I think its the ultimate cruelty to destroy the children of the poor and then say Look how much weve _saved on welfare  Governor Grasso said She added that she hoped the people would support her in her decision but said If they dont I understand but I cant change my position Phyllis Gelman a lawyer for the Connecticut Womens Education and Legal Fund is one of those with the bleakest view of the consequences of the welfare abortion policy in the state A lot of women arent going to get abortions Some will have unwanted children Some will turn to the old illegal methods or selfinduced abortions There will be a higher death rate The cycle of poverty will continue with an increase in welfare rolls she said noting that national figures show that onethird of all abortions are performed on teenagers But even for those whose doctors decide that abortion is necessary for medical needs she said the paperwork delay in seeking approval from the Department of Social Services could result in unnecessary medical risk since the procedure becomes far more compli cated in the second trimester of pregnancy A spokesman for the Department of Social Services said a week or two would be required to process paperwork for welfare abortions The spokesman Peggy OBrien said she had only one statistic for the number of abortions performed on welfare recipients between January and September of 1976 550 women on welfare received abortions in state hospitals However Carolyn Gabel the state coordinator for the National Abortion Rights Action League has gleaned more data from state resources and has done some surveys of her own In 1973 when the Connecticut restriction was in force and when there were limited number of facilities performing abortions in the state there were 6800 abortions performed on all women according to State Department of Health figures That figure jumped to an estimated 12500 in 1976 and her survey of abortion clinics and hospitals showed that about 20 percent of the 1976 total were welfare women For the moment the hospitals are officially taking the attitude of well wait and see what happens A Stamford Hospital spokesman said the welfare abortion changes are not an issue now And at YaleNew Haven Hospital Dr Fred Hyde a vice president said We have not seen the policy statement yet but he added its highly unlikely we would be turning people away Some clinics such as the New Haven Womens Health Services and Planned Parenthood are beginning to solicit funds to help pregnant welfare women who seek an abortion yet do not qualify under the state policy Dr Phillip C Dennen who heads the obstetrics section of the Connecticut State Medical Society said that many people unable to afford abortions in many cases wont get them now but he feels many doctors will be sympathetic If a patient says I cant afford it well sayOK its medically necessary for the emotional health of the patient  said Dr Dennen Dr Michael Baggish head of obstetrics at Mount Sinai Hospital in Hartford predicted a higher cost to the state as result of the new policy Some women will not receive abortions he said but the paperwork will result in delays that make abortions far more complicated requiring several days in the hospital Based on his experience when the regulations changed in 1979 Dr Bag gish also predicted a rise in the number of women who must be treated often surgically after a botched cheap abortion The new policy said Senator Hudson makes hypocrites of women doctori and psychiatrists Now poor women will have to go through the charade of saying Ill kill myself if I have a child to get public monies for an abortion The tragedy is its a double standard Senator Hudsons effort to seek a special session of the Legislature to seek to change the new policy will most likely fail when the deadlinenext Sundayarrives for legislators to sign the petition Womens groups are planning protest that day in front of the capital and Senator Hudson said she would lead an effort to overturn the new policy when the Legislature reconvenes in February 
Consumer Guide on Doctors Issued,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/24/archives/westchester-weekly-consumer-guide-on-doctors-issued.html,SCARSDALE ANEW set of pages through which your fingers can do the walking is available in Westchester A Consumers Direc tory of Physicians in Central Westchester has been compiled by the Feminist Health Research Committee the health task force of the Central Westchester Chapter of the National Organization for Women The editor and coordinator Winifred Fein of Hartsdale started work on the directory more than a year ago Mrs Fein and her assistants mailed sixpage questionnaires to doctors in Elmsford Harrison Hartsdale Port Chester Purchase Rye Scarsdale and White Plains The sources for their names were the 1976 Medical Directory of New York State and the Yellow Pages Cross references were the 197475 Directory of Medical Specialists and the 1973 American Medical Association Directory Of 523 doctors questioned 162 replied The directory describes these doctors training fees billing systems policy on accepting Medicare and Medicaid patients office hours telephone availability knowledge of languages other than English and attitudes toward contraception abortion and natural childbirth there is also a list of the doctors who did hotreply and a glossary of medical terminology A doctor should be selected by choice not chance contends Mrs tein A person looking in the profesyional directories which are available at libraries will find information about a doctors training but not about the more pragmatic things like fees and office hours Our directory can serve as liaison between physicians and the public Too often there is a halo effect  peoPe still tend to think of doctors as gods Sylvia Axelrod of White Plains consultant for the directory and coordinator of the Feminist Health Research Corn4nittee said that although the directory can be particularly useful for Womenwho during the childbearing years use doctors more frequently than menour primary purpose is to enable all prospective patients male and female to act as informed consumers  The directory arrives at a time of flux in the relationship betweendoctors and consumers Under New York State law doctors may not advertise but what constitutes advertising is not clearly delined according to Francis McKee staff attorney for the Medical Society of the State of New York A proposal to substantially open up professional advertising and permit the listing of fees and other information in consumer directories will be acted on this month at a meeting of the Regents of the University of the State of New York and at the State Education Department said Frank Abbott assistant commissioner for the professions Vincent Zingaro executive director of the Westchester County Medical Society noted that the American Medical Association recently ruled that reputable directories were among acceptable media for communicating information to the public Opinions about the new directory varied among both participating and nonparticipating doctors Its a very thin line between advertising and being in such a directory said Dr Mira C Rinzler a specialist in rehabilitation and physical medicine who practices in White Plains But I participated in it because I feel the public is entitled to know the information Dr Bernard Lapan an obstetrician and gynecologist practicing in White Plains and a participant in the directory said that he was a little reluctant to fill out the questions concerning fees and hours but maintained that he liked the idea that the directory was consumeroriented Dr Beatrice S Braun a psychiatrist affiliated with St Vincents Hospital in Harrison said she did not consider the directory in which she participated to be advertising because anyone who wanted to be in it could be but she acknowledged that the consumer guide situation could be quite controversialr A White Plains dermatologist Wilfred Minkin who declined to be included in the directory said he felt that there should be a directory of this type but that the best agency to put it out would be a professional medical society who would be better qualified to judge the correctness of the information Dr Minkin also maintained Any information in the Feminist Health Research Committees directory can easily be obtained by calling a doctor prior to a visit People often call and ask about feesthey are shopping and 4no doctor objects to it Dr Warren Seides a psychiatrist practicing in Scarsdale who chose not to be in the directory said Anyone who wants knowledge of a doctor can find in the standard professional directory Whatever information is necessary is already available there And feminism itself was criticized by Dr Caroline G Bauman a White Plains pediatrician who said I dont believe in feminism because I  dont believe in separatist groups This is a world of people A different view came from Dr Rosalind T Kaplan a Scarsdale ophthalmologist I am in favor of what womens groups are trying to do she said and I like to help them when I can I am in the directory However I can see how some of the questions they distributed might have been misunderstood by some of the doctors The fee question for instance is ambiguous she said A doctor has been spending lots of years in training Its not like buying a dress You are paying for proper care and accumulation of knowledge It isnt that people shouldnt know what a doctor charges its simply that you cant put a dollarandcents value on knowledge The consumers directory costs 350 including postage tax and handling ordered through the Feminist Health Research Committee PO Box 53H Scarsdale N Y 10583 The book is also available for 3 plus tax at Main Court Book Fair 186 Main Street White

Birth Rate Is Rising From 1976 Low,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/24/archives/birth-rate-is-rising-from-1976-low-birth-rate-is-rising-from-its.html,WASHINGTON July 23The rate at which American women bear children which plunged to a historic low last year has begun to creep up in the last few months While the rate is still phenomenally low compared with that of the baby boom after World War II the now figures are adding fuel to a quickening debate among demographers over how long the baby bust of this decade will last The question is one of considerable public concern for even a small change in the notoriously unpredictable birth and fertility rates can have a major impact on the ecnomy and on such institutions as schools and colleges for years to comeThe most likely explanation for the rise is that couples who had delayed becoming parents for various reasons are making nosy or never decisions and compensating for lost time This does not necessarily mean larger families in the long run however At the same time there are tentative signs that recent antifamily trends linked to the low birth ratedeclining marriage rates and growing divorcemay be leveling off The natioral Center for Health Statistics reports that the marriage rate was up for the  quarter of 1977 and that for the first time in years there was no increase in divorce According to the center `the recent birth rise began last September and has continued through this April the latest month for which national statistics are available In the first third of this year the birth ratethe number of children born per 1000 populationrose to 151 or six percent higher than for the same period last year If this persists for the entire year nearly 34 million babies will be born in 1977 or about 200000 more than would have been expected if the rate had remained at last years level This figure is sure to raise cries of alarm among advocates of  a stabilized population sometimes called zero population growth However fears are growing among some others that the American birth rate has fallen so low that the population will be unable to support the economy and a vigorous creative society in the future Such concerns have already become acute in Europe The Prime Minister of Luxembourg recently complained that his people who reproduce at the lowest rate in the world had developed a_suicidal attitude that threatened the nations very survival Experts are not very surprised that the American birth rate is up This is because the number of women in the childbearing ages 1544 is swollen with the ranks of girls born during the baby boom now passing through their prime years of fertility Indeed it is surprising that it has remained so low for so long Many experts have long anticipated an echo effect of the postwar baby boom But demographers have noted that the fertility ratea ratio that is independent of the number of women of reproduction ageis also up This gauge of the rate at which women in the childbearing ages give birth was computed at 684 children per 1000 women for the first third of this year This was an increase of five percent over the comparable span in 1976 Although these increases are not trivial there is nothing in them at the moment to suggest another baby boom The American fertility rate ramains one of the lowest in the world and stands at only a little over half of what it was at the height of the baby boom in 1957 The extent to which childbearing has fallen becomes dramatic when it is realized that it took only 35 million young women to produce 43 million babies in 1957 while 48 million women bore only 32 million babies in 1976 Another index of how depressed the rates remain is that the total fertility rate a statistic that corresponds roughly to the average completed family size at current fertility rates is still extremely low For the first four months of  this year it was 1835 children per woman This was about five percent higher than for the same period of 1976 but still well below the replacement level of 21 children the figure at which population will ultimately cease to grow The recent rise notwithstanding the Census Bureau this week reduced its projection of the American population in the year 2025 by about four million from 300 million to 296 million Demographic experts generally agree that the recent rises are no cause for alarm The rates bad fallen to such unimagined depths in the last two years that an adjustment was to be Axpected much the way stock prices undergo what brokers call a technical adjustment when they reach abnormally high or low levels What we are seeing now is the more normal condition said Campbell Gibson a fertility expert formerly with the Census Bureau The teal question is why it has taken so long to go up Maurice Moore of the Census Bureau agrees It had to bottom outthe question is how far back it will bounce The answer is of more than academic interest The largely unforeseen baby_bust of recent years has dashed the hopes of millions of young people who wanted to be teachers and it has left many a school official wondering what to do with new school buildings for which there were no pupils Whatever the meaning ofthe new fig uresdemographers are reluctant to proclaim a trend on the basis of a fewmonths experiencethey underscore a growing debate among experts over the future prospectS for American fertility The majority seems to believe that number of factorssuch as the Vide availability of cheap effective contraception the increasing availability of abortion later marriages easier divorce and heightened career aspirations of women have combined to cause an irreversible decline in childbearing  Unless there is some unpredictable swing in fashion I dont see anything that could lead to a big increase in fertili ty either here or anywhere ee in the world said Charles F Westoff director of the Office of Population Research at Princeton He headed the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future Indeed Prof Westoff has speculated that changed attitudes toward marriage and family will keep birth rates so low that far from  fear of overpopulation there will ultimately be alarm that there are not enough Americans to supply labor and support the Social Security system By the year 2000 he said the question may be how much are we going to have to pay women tohave kids 7 Others are less tertain Two years ago two California demographers June Sklar and Beth Berkey predicted on thehasis of California data that the decline in the nations birth rate is coming to halt and that an upturn is in the making It looks to me AS if its starting to happen Mrs Berkov who is with the California State Department of Health in Berkeley said in an interview this week Still she did not expect a return to the large families of the 1950s Nobody expects huge increases in family size But even slow rises with this large population means a lot of people The population problem is by no means licked Fertility Rate Also Higher More Normal Condition Changes In Attitudes

Mormon Turnout Overwhelms Women's Conference in Utah,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/25/archives/mormon-turnout-overwhelms-womens-conference-in-utah.html,SALT LAKE CITYWhen representatives of the International Womens Year organization here began planning their statewide convention several months ago they invited a number of Utah womens groups to participate in hopes of showing as the coordinating committee put it that diversity does nt have to divide people They kept talking about outreach trying to get as many women involved as possible recalled Esther Landa the current head of the National Council of Jewish Women who presided over the convention three weekends ago One of the groups to which an invitation was extended was the Relief Society the womens auxiliary of the Church

abortion on demand and more than a score of other womens rights proposals put forward by the IWY organizers Mormon Delegates Nearly 14000 women were ultimately registered by the Utah convention more than twice the attendance at any of the other statewide meetings and of the 14 delegates selected from an antiERA prolife slate to attend the IWYs national meeting in Houston next November 12 are members of the Mormon Church It was like a war only they had atomic weapons and we had words said Maggy Pendleton a college counselor and IWY organizer who is described by friends as the closest thing to a radical feminist as one can find in this fundamentally conservative state The Mormon women who she estimated had outnumbered nonMormons by about 10 to 1 could vote down anything they wanted to she said They ran the whole thing Ive never been so rudely treated in my life Although she and other organizers said they had had hopes of opening a dialogue with the Mormons that might begin to reverse the polarization that has existed in Utah between churchwomen and feminists for some time the acrimony that prevailed at the convention overrode nearly every attempt at a thoughtful discussion of womens issues In the middle of it all was Jan L Tyler a 34yearold former professor of child development at Brigham Young University who though an active member of the Mormon Church is also an ardent supporter of the equal rights amendment something to which her church is officially opposed A Foot in Both Camps As head of the Utah coordinating committee Miss Tyler said she had been committed to do all I could to provide this kind of forum for Utah women and had hoped that with a foot in both camps she would prove to be a bridge between them But for her the convention produced a number of unfortunate things that gave me personal pain among them her observation that many of the women who were professing a tremendous concern for life in their opposition to abortion were very abusive in their actions toward others Don LeFevre a spokesman for the Mormon Church acknowledged that the Relief Society had encouraged its membership to take part in the convention and vote for correct principles The church he said has always been concerned with threats to the stability of the family and the home We dont make any excuses for our womens participation Were proud of them Other womens groups could probably take a note from their book Although the Mormons place a heavy emphasis on early marriage and large familiesbirth control is frowned upon Mr LeFevre said and abortion viewed as one of the most revolting and sinful practices of this day its opposition to the equal rights amendment is founded more on physiology than theology We recognize men and women as equally important before the Lord the churchs leadership has declared but with differences biologically emotionally and in other ways ERA we believe does not recognize these differences Although none of the Relief Society members were given explicit instructions on what course to pursue at the convention Mr LeFevre said that church officials provided them with informational material on the mechanics of registration and copies of the churchs positions opposing the equal rights amendment abortion and other issues in case they had any questions Similar appeals for participation were sent by the Relief Society headquarters here to its representatives in several other states Mr LeFevre said after the church decided that based on the impressive turnout it had mustered in Utah its women might be able to help support correct principles at some of the I W Y conventions remaining to be held In Washington and Montana two of the states selected for action by the church resolutions supporting the ERA were rejected by conventioneers about half of whom proved in both cases to be Mormons according to IWY organizers Mary Munger the head of the Montana coordinating committee said that all 14 of that states delegates to the Houston convention had gone on record as opposing the ratification of the ERA and that the convention there had produced very little dialogue While various coalitions of conservative religious and political groups have played a role around the country in diluting the IWYs advocacy of increasing equality for women there is what Nikki Van Hightower a Houston city official serving as liaison to the national convention called a very deep concern over the involvement of the Mormon Church Mormons Started Late Nobody started out anticipating anything like this Mrs Hightower said but it has grown and grown The effect of the churchs involvement would ultimately be minimized she said only because it had not begun in earnest until after many of the state conventions had already been held But she added if they had gone on much longer    Several of the women who have worked on behalf of the IWY in Utah said they suspected the antiERA organization headed by Phyllis Schafly the conservative Republican might have had a hand in the Mormon Churchs decision to influence the outcome of the conventions in Utah and elsewhere but none of them was able to produce any evidence that such had been the case However a slate of antifeminist delegates including several women prominent in Mormon Church affairs was circulated on the floor of the Salt Palace under the auspices of the Eagle Forum the organization that Mrs Schafly heads Most of those delegates were ultimately elected to represent the state Despite their obvious disappointment at the turn of events in Utah both Mrs Landa and Miss Tyler cautioned against concluding from the IWYs experiences there that no potential existed for a discussion of womens issues between feminists and the Mormon Church Mrs Landa noted that Barbara Smith the president of the Relief Society had maintained that the churchs domination of the Utah convention should not be interpreted as a complete rejection of womens concerns and had spoken in favor of equal pay legal protection for women in divorce actions and assistance to working women with family responsibilities Some of her recent mail from Mormon women who had attended the Utah conference Mrs Lands said had contained expressions of embarrassment over the behavior of the more strident opponents of the equal rights amendment and had described the event as a positive experience that had permitted them to learn directly in some cases for the first time what the womens rights movement was really about Dealing With Issues Miss Tyler concurred saying she had concluded based on her telephone calls and letters that many Mormon women were thinking about things theyve never thought about before A lot of them are beginning to transcend their own conditions and say that there are other women in the world who find themselves in circumstances very different from mine She remained convinced she said that despite the political positions taken by the Mormon Church on such issues as the ERA it was not impossible to reconcile at least some feminist concerns with the churchs theology That doesnt mean that there isnt some pain and introspection that goes on dealing with issues you might otherwise have ignored she said That isnt to say its an easy thing One unfortunate aspect she said was the sentiment among many Mormon women that if they dont buy the whole package of womens rights issues theyre somehow shut out of the movement altogether If the womens movement is going to define itself as just another part of society thats exclusive then its really in trouble
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/25/archives/letters.html,To the Editor The letter of Arthur Burns published July 11 did two things It supported NOW [negotiated order of withdrawal] accounts even though such accounts will have corrosive effects on the earnings of banks and second even though such effects will further deteriorate Fed membership by banks in all parts of the United States Perhaps nothing better demonstrates the intellectual insolvency at the Federal Reserve currently than the support for a program that accomplishes two terrible results which require absurd solutions Worse yet instead of the much ballyhooed Fed independence what we are witnessing is another blatant political effort to win friends in high and many places no matter the cost to American banking in both the private as well as public sectors Perhaps nothing has caused so much appreciation for the tenure of William McChesney Martin as the events that have occurred at the Fed under his successor For the writer the remark of Dr Burns as to his denial of big bank bias is so poignant Tragically it is the very structure provided by law that accentuates such bias particularly in the constitution of the boards of directors of the Reserve banks in the various districts This is especially true in the Fourth District An honest candid position would show respect for banks in fair proportion to their size and responsibilities A belated attempt at some form of bureaucratic populism may go well as a political pronouncement but credibility cannot be achieved without a basis in facts and history A deeper analysis of Fed membership requires a study of the fact that when such membership is given up the banks involved do not go to a no mans land They are opting for regulation and supervision by the FDIC an agency that has remarkably escaped the Watergate miasma and the other political machinations of the NixonFord years Chairman Burns expresses concern that further erosion of Fed membership will make the management of monetary policy look less precise A year ago he denounced the statements of the young Congressman who is chairman of a subcommittee that had studied the issue for having pointed out the horrendous switch from supereasy money of 1972 to the nomoney policy of 1974 Perhaps nothing before nas been so locked in a frighteningly high inflation rate that is now an apparent fixture of the national economy Finally a word about the Fed staff both in the Reserve banks as well as in the capital There are those who are still the keepers of the flame despite the tirades and the machinations For them next January may provide a Fed chairman who will not espouse policies that affect elections but will make decisions based on sound economics in the public interest THEODORE R SAKER Columbus Ohio July 12 1977 To the Editor The prospect of Federal regulations enforcing use of automatic air bags or seat belts by 1984 purportedly for the protection of motorists is frightening Having been a victim of the deus ex machina numerous times I can envision future drivers cruising along all unsuspecting being suffocated by the sudden inflation of air bags caused by a bird or moth or a devilish malfunction such as an unpredictable short circuit activating the air bag sensors thus becoming victims of a fatal accident As for the air bags reliability as anyone who has ever owned anything inflatable knows invisible holes always develop and the material dries up even in the most expensive equipment just when the device is about to be used Likewise the automatic seat belt or shoulder harness having enveloped the hapless driver in a straitjacketed posture can fail to disengage preventing the victim from leaving the car It could happen in the parking lot of a busy shopping mall a deserted street or country lane where no help is available It could happen when a car overturns and is in danger of exploding It could happen when a car involved in a bridge accident is submerged and the occupants would be trapped and drowned The present manually operated safety belts and shoulder harnesses sometimes require the strength of a Samson the deftness of a Houdini and the suppleness of a contortionist to fasten and unfasten When such equipment is linked with the ignition system there have been many incidents where cars have been stalled by a shorted system due to rainy weather There can be no mechanical substitute for the careful driver and good sense should direct our Government to bend its efforts toward driver education and traffic regulation enforcement instead of more expensive gadgets which cannot be failsafe and whose malfunction may cause a greater loss of life or limb than they are designed to prevent HENRY S IIJIMA New York July 11 1977 To the Editor Edward Cowans discussion of the Supreme Courts recent Illinois Brick decision contains a number of misconceptions which I believe warrant correction The statement attributed to the executive director of the Consumer Federation of America that by its decision the Supreme Court is blatantly inviting price fixing is a slur on the Court that I am sure that no one having knowledge of the antitrust laws or their enforcement would endorse That would be true of lawyers who normally represent plaintiffs as well as those representing defendants It is particularly regrettable that this uninformed charge should be leveled at an opinion by Justice White whose antitrust credentials are impeccable and who in a multitude of antitrust decisions over many years has extended the frontiers of antitrust strengthened its safeguards and made it a potent instrument for protecting the public from the evils of monopolization and restrictive trade practices Contrary to the impression conveyed by Mr Cowan both of the opinions in the Illinois Brick case accept as axiomatic that the antitrust laws prohibiting price fixing should be vigorously enforced The only issue was how this goal which both the majority and dissenters shared could best be achieved It was in this context that Justice White and the five other Justices who joined in his opinion held that direct purchasers should be permitted to sue for the entire overcharge incurred by them as a result of an antitrust violation regardless of whether portions of that overcharge were subsequently passed on to others further down in the chain of distribution The contrary approach favored by the minority would allocate the right of action among all the different levels in the distribution chain The problem with this latter course is that it tends to transform antitrust suits into gigantic and very costly battles among huge classes of persons at different levels in the chain of distribution each asserting conflicting claims to the same alleged overcharge The effect is to impose unmanageable burdens on the courts and to generate large litigation costs with the result that the beneficiaries of the entire procedure are largely the lawyers Mr Cowan suggests that the Illinois Brick opinion will invite pricefixing because direct purchasers are unwilling to assert treble damage claims against their suppliers This is simply not so My own experience in a large number of cases  including those which I brought on behalf of a large number of utilities against the various electrical manufacturersis that the direct purchaser has every incentive to sue because he is the one who actually paid the overcharge It is likewise untrue that the Illinois Brick decision will thwart the prosecution of important and successful civil antitrust suits such as the Plumbing Fixtures settlement In fact had Mr Cowan consulted with knowledgeable antitrust practitioners or other expertsrather than relying on the onesided views of opponents of the Illinois Brick decisionhe would have learned that the court in the Plumbing Fixtures case arrived at precisely the same conclusions with respect to the passon issue as did Justice White in his recent opinion He also would have found that the same view has been expounded by Justice Holmes Judge Goodrich Judge Feinberg and other great jurists MILTON HANDLER New York July 20 1977 The writer a professor emeritus of law at Columbia University is a member of a New York law firm To the Editor The position of the Administration as recently expressed by Secretary Califano HEW contains both positive and negative messages for those persons interested in child welfare issues The positive aspect is that the Carter people decided to support subsidization of adoptions The negative side is that the Secretary has seen fit to label this plan an alternative to abortion Subsidization is a simple concept There are many hard to place children who are not adopted because the prospective adopterparents do not have enough money to support the special medical or educational needs of these children Subsidization whether in the form of continuing Medicaid vouchers for special schools or monthly cash payments will encourage adoption of these children Subsidization is welcomed and applauded by all in the adoption field The only alternative to abortion is the continuation of the pregnancy The products of most pregnancies about 98 percent are healthy infants The only healthy infants who can possibly be classified as hard to placetherefore being in need of a subsidy to encourage adoptionare black babies Puerto Rican babies Chicano babies Indian babies just those minority groups that will no longer have termination of pregnancy available to them as an alternative to carrying to term Perhaps Secretary Califano should consider other alternatives such as effective sex education and family planning counseling to sexually active young women establishment of centers for the early diagnosis of pregnancy and counseling for those pregnant women unsure of what course to follow and Federal funding to pay for the interruption of pregnancy if the woman chooses this course and state funds are not available With such plans in operation we should have fewer hard to place children fewer children in foster family care less child abuse less poverty and less need for subsidization S NORMAN SHERRY MD Harvard Medical School Cambridge Mass July 13 1977 The writer is a member of the Adoption and Dependent Care Committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics To the

N.Y. Delegation to Women's Conference Is Decidedly Feminist,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/26/archives/ny-delegation-to-womens-conference-is-decidedly-feminist.html,New York State will be sending strongly feminist delegation to the First National Womens Conference to be held in Houston in November The state president of the National Organization of Women said at a press conference yesterday that the entire slate of 88 delegates and five alternates is committed to three fundamental issuespassage of the equal rights amendment safe legal abortion regardless of income and civil rights for lesbians and gay men Zelle Andrews the NOW state president claimed that the New York dalelation is the largest delegation from arty state committed to those three feminist positions The Houston convention will run from Nov 18 through 21 Abortion and the ERA have become passionately debated central issues at almost every one of the meetings held so far in the 50 states and the District of Columbia In many states those in favor of abortion reform and the adoption of the ERA were in the majority The reverse was true in some Southern and Southwestern states As a result confrontation is expected at the national meeting Mary Burke Nicholas who headed the New York State Womens Meeting held in Albany the weekend of 3uly 9 and 10 agreed yesterday with Miss Andrews that the delegation was feminist She would not characterize it further however Mrs Nicholas is the director of the womens division for the executive chamber which is a cabinetlevel job with the New York Governors office The political character of the New York delegation did not become clear until yesterday with the statements by Miss Andrews and Mrs Nicholas Mrs Nicholas who is also a founder of the Coalition of 100 Black Women said in a telephone interview that this was due to the enormous confusion that surrounded the statewide meeting two weeks ago The organizers were prepared for and expected about 3000 women from all walks of life to attend Almost triple that number registered to vote and estimates of how many women actually were there ranged as high as 13000 Many participants described the meeting because of its unexpected size and diversity as chaotic and nightmarish There were continual bureaucratic breakdowns On Sunday July 10 some women stood in line for as long as eight hours to vote with the result that many of those registered drifted to cars buses planes and trains for the journey bacx to their home towns without casting a ballot The ballot sheet was three and onehalf feet long with 320 nominations on it Those nominated were not in alphabetical order nor were their affiliations given The American Arbitration Association which supervised the July 10 voting tabulated the 3600 machine and paper ballots cast and certified the results only several days ago The confusion was compounded and the delay lengthened by computer breakdowns at the association due to the New York City blackout July 13 and 14 Miss Andrews_ in the press conference held at Rosofrs Restaurant near Times Square yesterday said that she was elated and thrilled by the voting results The NOW leader added that the delegation was also concerned with other womens rights issues such as the needs of battered women and displaced homemakers who are fighting for improved legal status and rights of women who have lost their husbands through death divorce desertion or separation The New York State delegation list of names was virtually identical to that of the Coalition Slate put forward at the Albany meeting The slate was formed when representatives of a broad spectrum of womens groups joined in Albany to promote candidates who would represent their concerns Fortysix womenor more than half of the 88 elected to the delegationwere also on the official slate drawn up by the Albany meetings nominating committee Among those on the official slate who lost out in the final voting and will not go to Houston on the delegation were Betty Friedan author of The Feminine Mystique one of the founders of NOW and often called the mother of the womens movement Elinor Guggenheimer Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs Jane Small Sanford chairman of the New York State Womens Political Caucus Frances Doughty who heads the Womens Caucus of the National Gay Task Force and Alice Heyman national treasurer of the American Jewish Congress and a founding member of the First Womens Bank in New York The five biggest votegetters at the Albany convention were these Shawn Leach of White Plains 2056 votes at 16 years old the youngest member of the delegation cofounder of a youth group called Black Reality and a member of the Westchester Black Womens Caucus Goldie Chu of Manhattan 2056 votes Asian American Womens Caucus Adrienne Critchlow of Brooklyn 2044 votes member of the Communications Workers of America and the Coalition of Labor Union Women Evelyn Cunningham of Manhattan 2022 votes a founder and board member of the Coalition of 100 Black Women and Carolyn Reed of Manhattan 2009 votes SecretaryTreasurer of the Household Technicians of America When asked why these women had out polled some nationally known womens leaders such as Karen DeCrow of Syracuse a Houston delegate and past national president of NOW Mrs Nicholas said she had thought a lot about it but come to no conclusions that would satisfy her

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/29/archives/letters.html,To the Editor President Carters remarks on Medicaid funding for abortions echoed President Kennedys statement that life is unfair But in all other respects his statement yesterday is the exact antithesis of the position Mr Kennedy took on similar issues Mr Kennedy reminded the Houston Ministerial Association in 1960 that Americans held divergent views on such issues as birth control and divorce and said Whatever issue may come before me as President  will make my decision  in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be in the national interest and without regard to outside religious pressures or dictates Mr Carter chooses to impose his views on millions of welfare recipients who hold different moral views about abortion as the large number of Medicaid abortions attests If Mr Carter believes his stand is in the national interest he would have to say that forcing welfare recipients to bear children they do not want will contribute to their greater selfsufficiency and selfsupport or that it will improve the health and wellbeing of the women their children and families and of the community But he has not yet described the social economic emotional and health benefits that will accrue and to whom from his policy In 1959 Mr Kennedy told James Reston that it would not be wise for the US to withhold aid ie public funds from India if India chose birth control as national policy Mr Carter decides that to withhold public funds from a welfare recipient requesting help to obtain an abortion is reasonably fair and refers to the intense feelings on both sides of the abortion issue Mr Kennedy knew that the only tenable public policy in a pluralistic society will intense differences on moral questions is one that allows each person including the poor to follow hisher own conscience Other Catholic public officials agreed Mayor Wagner when he allowed birth control to be prescribed in New York City hospitals in 1958 Sargent Shriver when he approved antipoverty funds for birth control clinics in 1964 Governors Carey and Brown and Senator Moynihan when they support Medicaid funding of abortions today But Mr Carter calls for a public policy that imposes the moral views of a minority on the majority and that can only have the effect of creating more misery and hopelessness for poor and powerless women and their families This is both bankrupt social policy and intolerable public policy for a society which prides itself on its humanity and its pluralism and for a President who expresses concern for preservation of human rights overseas FREDERICK S JAFFE New York July 13 1977 The writer is president Alan Guttmacher Institute a division of Planned Parenthood Federation The VA Defends Its Health Care Delivery To the Editor The Timess recent editorial on the National Academy of Sciences study of Veterans Administration health care delivery made assertions that go far beyond recommendations of the study itself These extrapolations should not stand unchallenged The editorial mentioned only negative findings of the study There is in fact a great deal in the report that is positive even complimentary to the VA For example the report states categorically that VA facilities are providing adequate and in some cases outstanding patient care Serious deficiencies were perceived in only a few hospitals The NAS report does not suggest that a comprehensive national health insurance program will eliminate the need for VA hospitals and does not attribute political motivation to the Veterans Administration as its purpose in providing care as The Times stated The study also called for an imaginative demonstration project by which services provided to veterans by the VA can be improved and extended not eliminated The editorial noted that a majority of VA patients have no financial resources with which to purchase health care elsewhere The Timess suggestion that these persons be handled as welfare cases rather than as citizens to whom the nation owes a debt seems to lower the definition of social support to an indefensible level Are persons on welfare and in Veterans Administration hospitals not also citizens The Times used the term unnecessary in connection with the VA hospital construction programanother term that does not appear in the NAS report The VA has in fact cut its hospital beds by 20000 in the past ten years doubled the number of its inpatients tripled its outpatient services and cut the average length of patient stay in half cost to the taxpayers of each episode of patient care has been reduced by approximately 21 percent in 1967 dollarsthat is disregarding inflation We expect to serve even more patients in the coming years with fewer beds by good management techniques that are already in effect and to further reduce our perpatient costs Even the new eighthospital construction program approved by two Presidents will bring a net reduction of 279 beds since the new beds will replace existing ones in structures 50 to 100 years old The VA will make its response to Congress on the NAS findings in early September We will welcome whatever editorial page comment seems appropriate at that time Whats In a Name To the Editor Has anyone yet pointed out the curiously ironic fact that the two men who seem most answerable for subjecting us to the material and moral darkness of the recent blackout are named Luce and Beame THEODOR H GASTER Emeritus Professor of Religion Barnard College New York July 22 1977 Social Security and Mandatory Retirement To the Editor Before grasping at the large potential windfall to the Social Security system that Jess Altman claims will ensue from abolishing mandatory retirement Social Security The Worst Is Yet to Come OpEd July 9 Congress and your other readers should know that Mr Altman has made both a serious arithmetic error and some untenable assumptions His stated figure of 225 billion in annual savings from unclaimed Social Security benefits is almost four times the current amount It should be no more than 600 million at current prices The arithmetic error occurs after Mr Altman observes that the firstyear savings of 140 million would increase in each succeeding year by that amount This should give an annual saving after five years of 700 million However Mr Altman inexplicably states that the annual saving would be 21 billion This is indeed the total saving for the first five years but it is three times the annual amount Mr Altman also fails to allow for the facts of mortality and noncompulsory retirement He assumes that all of those who would rather work but now are forced to retire at 65 would stay alive and keep working until age 70 This makes the annual saving for each of the five age groups between 65 and 70 the same 140 million However even now Social Security is paying less than five times this amount to forced retirees between 65 and 70 simply because a significant number die with each advancing year of age We must also expect that some of those who would choose to keep working at 65 would retire before they reached 70 My own research on retirement rates of men over 65 suggests that at least 8 percent a year might retire even without mandatory retirement These retirees would then collect their Social Security benefits cutting further into the potential saving from ending mandatory retirement With a mortality rate of 4 percent a year from 65 to 70 and a retirement rate of 8 percent a year from 66 to 70 the potential annual savings after five years would be only four times the firstyear savings of 140 million The windfall from ending mandatory retirement would thus be less than 600 million a year and only a quarter of the enormous sum Mr Altman dangles before us With Social Security benefits indexed to the inflation rate annual savings would also grow at that rate One can make the windfall appear as large as one pleases simply by projecting the inflation of benefits sufficiently far into the future Since other dollar values would be inflated at the same time meaningful comparisons are best made on the basis of current prices There are of course many other considerations in the decision to permit or prohibit mandatory retirement Nevertheless when considering the potential saving to the Social Security system from benefits not claimed lets at least get the numbers right Economics and Public Affairs Princeton University Princeton NJ July 12 1977 New York Not Bush But First Class To the Editor I think that Irving Younger is a bit harsh in calling New York bush Like Mr Younger I am a transplanted New Yorker and I also visited it a couple of weeks ago My impressions of The City however are different New Yorkers are a breed of people unto themselves When I return to New York for visits I view it as a treat because the language is different the manners are like no other society and the way of life has no comparison in any other community To visit New York City is as much an adventure as travelling to Paris or Amsterdam It truly is a foreign city No New York City is

hospital conditions as Brooklyn Jewish Hospital medical personnel performed emergency surgery during the blackout In fact this hospital the major medical facility in BedfordStuyvesant had more emergency surgical cases during the blackout than any other hospital in New York City On July 18 a Times article described a controversy in Albany with respect to Brooklyn Jewish Hospitals proposed conversion of a new but as yet unopened facility from nursing care to acute or hospital care use This proposal envisages eliminating 320 nursing home beds and 62 acute care beds in line with Governor Careys policies resulting in at least 1 million of annual operating savings to the state by replacing antiquated plant with the existing new facility Not only will patient care be enhanced but the entire proposal is in keeping with the Governors program to lower health costs Recent events have again proved the necessity for the hospitals healthcare services to the BedStuy Crown Heights and Williamsburg communities Indeed the hospitals presence a stabilizing neighborhood influence as is its 2100 person work force most of whom live in the surrounding neighborhoods The hospital recently coMmenced an urban renewal program designed to revitalize its area The lowestcost deliverer of medical care the city among major teaching hospitals Brooklyn Jewish has a deserved and zealously guarded reputation quality Nevertheless bureaucratic procrastination and shortsightedness have prevented the hospital from moving into a facility which could already be enhancing patient care and community service In view of rewakened public concern for our citys deprivet areas and the proposals endorsement of official health policies we ask Why the delay President Brooklyn Jewish Hospital New York July

Federal Judge Again Bids H.E.W Continue Medicaid for Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/29/archives/federal-judge-again-bids-hew-continue-medicaid-for-abortions.html,A Federal district judge in Brooklyn told the Department of Health Education and Welfare yesterday to continue making Medicaid funds available to states that wanted to use them for elective abortions The action a temporary restraining order granted by Judge John F Dooling Jr will be effective at least until Wednesday Then the judge will hear arguments on whether he should issue an injunction ordering the HEW paypayments continued first on a temporary basis but potentially on a permanent one Judge Dooling granted the order today despite the fact that on June 29 the United States Supreme Court vacated preliminary injunction he had issued earlier which had the same nationwide effect The High Court sent the case back directing Judge Dooling to reconsider it in light of two recent decisions In those decision Maher v Roe and Beal x Doe the Supreme Court held that neither the Constitution nor the Social Security Act requires states to provide Medicaid funds for elective abortions Judge Doolings action involved the socalled Hyde Amendment which prohibits the use of Medicaid funds for such abortions His decision yesterday was regarded by some lawyers as surprising in that the Supreme Court rulings seemed to establish a clear principle for the withholding of Government funds for certain abortions But Judge Dooling said the cases cited by the High Court involved circumstances different from those before him Further he expressed concern about the potential effect of an immediate halt of Medicaid reimbursements for voluntary abortions The impact would be extraordinary and real and could well endanger the lives of the young poor who are most likely to take unwise actions and seek illegal abortions The injunction granted today had been sought by the Center for Constitutional Rights the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood of New York City on one action and by the citys Health and Hospitals Corporation in another In announcing that he would sign the temporary restraining order Judge Dooling told Edward S Rudofsky an Assistant United States Attorney representing the Government to let the Secretary in Washington know The judge had been told moments earlierlhat the Department of Health Education and Welfare was set to send notices to all its offices to have them stop providing Medicaid funds for abortions Rhonda Copelon representing the three agencies involved in a joint complaint told the court that to allow implementation of the amendment would result in irreparable harm to many women The amendment written by Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois provides for Medicaid reimbursement for abortions only when the life of the mother is in danger It is this provision that todays order nullifies temporarily and that an injunction would prohibit perhaps permanently HEW has failed so far to lay out any gdidelines for when a life is endangered Miss Copelon declared and 15 providers are telling the court they will construe the amendment as narrowly as possible to protect themselves Some she added say they will do no abortions The result according to Miss Copelon is that many women will have unwanted pregnancies some minors unable to get abortions will have to give birth by caesarian sections and others will seek clandestine abortions running a high risk of sterility The consequences are speedy Miss Copelon said A temporary restraining order was signed last year 40 minutes after the law went into effect she noted yet for two weeks afterward we had reports of kids going to hospitals for complications that had arisen as a result of illegal abortions Ellen K Sawyer the lawyer representing the citys Health and Hospitals Corporation charged that the Hyde Amendment was so vague that physicians have declared in affidavits they do not know under what circumstances abortions are reimbursable But Edward S Radofsky an Assistant United States Attorney argued in the Governments behalf that the statute was clear and did not require that HWg issue a set of guidelines He also argued that there would be no immediate irreparable harm to women in New York because the state had already committed itself to 100 percent reimbursement to be shared equally by the state and the city However in an affidavit filed yesterday Janet Benshoof an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer said that a survey taken during the last few days showed that only 10 states would try to continue to pay for legal abortions if the Hyde Amendment goes into effect Four states will not be affected because they already have similarly restricted policies But the other 36 states which now pay for abortions on a more liberal basis have indicated they will cut back to the standard of the Hyde Amendment Outside the courtroom Miss Copelon explained that the strategy of the plaintiffs was to challenge the validity of the Hyde Amendment first on procedural grounds and then on its constitutionality Mr Rudofsky called this a stalling tactic Win or lose he said they will have effectively blocked implementation of the amendment until its scheduled expiration date Sept 30 Meanwhile HEW appropriations for 197778 remain stalled in Congress reportedly because the Senate and House are sharply split over the conditions for allowing Federal reimbursement for Medicaid abortions The House wants a sharply restrictive measure along the lines of the Hyde Amendment and the Senate is favoring an amendment that would provide for payment for abortions in cases of rape and incest as well as for those endangering the life of the mother

New York Regents Vote to Allow Doctors and Dentists to Advertise,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/29/archives/new-york-regents-vote-to-allow-doctors-and-dentists-to-advertise.html,ALBANY July 28The New York State Board of Regents considerably broadening its earlier position voted unanimously today to permit physicians dentists and other professionals to advertise not only their services but also their prices in newspapers and magazines The boards action would also allow professionals to advertise their services but not their prices on television and radio stations Until now advertising by most professionals has been limited Excerpts from the decision page B2 The new guidelines will affect nearly half a million professionals in 29 fields including physicians dentists architects engineers and accountants They are part of a broad attempt to improve and consolidate professionalconduct standards adopted by the Regents today The Board of Regents which regulates all professionals except lawyers and clergymen in New York State had originally proposed that professionals be permitted to advertise their services generally but to list their prices only under certain circumstances in professional directories The relaxation of those proposed limits came in light of a Supreme Court decision in June which held that restrictions on advertising by lawyers violated the freespeech guarantees of the First Amendment to the Constitution The new guidelines which will take effect Oct 1 will also guarantee patients full access to their medical records except where this would adversely affect the patients health They would in addition specifically bar a professional from practicing outside his or her specific area of competence except in an emergency The language on advertising was described by Regent Emlyn 1 Griffith chairman of the Committee on Professional Discipline as a happy medium between unlimited advertising and the current law He said it was intended to allow factually accurate and dignified advertising Mr Griffith said that price advertising was barred from radio and television because prices were most closely identified with the problem of hucksterism and that the possibility of abuse seemed to be greater in the electronic media than in the printed media He noted that the Supreme Court decision covered printed advertising but specifically excluded the issue of the electronic media Under the new rules si professional will be permitted to advertise fixed prices or a range of prices for specified routine professional services and must state whether additional charges might be incurred for related services Thus a doctor would be able to take a newspaper advertisement stating that he or she would perform an electrocardiogram for 30 for example or a dentist would be able toadvertise in a magazine that he or she would clean and inspect teeth for 40 Some Ada Will Still Be Barred But advertising that is sensational or flamboyant Uses testimbhials guarantees results or claims superiority over another professional would continue to be barredThus a certified public accountan could not for example use baseball player to demonstrate how much a client could save on his taxes Theconeept of advertising by professionals hai had considerable support from consulter activists who feel it could spur competition and bring down prices But Mr Griffith said the Regents had received substantial opposition from some professionspartieularly doctors and dentists They chairman of the State Medical Societys Ethics Committee Dr Joseph G Zimring said the advertising provisions Would probably  conflict with the societys bar on solicitation of patients but said he was unsure of what action the society might take He asserted that no decent honest doctor would advertise andpredicted that less than 5 percent would take advantage Of the new rules Dr Zimring said he feared advertising would be damaging to the patient A doctor can advertise We do abortions for 100 he said But a cheap price doesnt say a man is capable of doing the work Who will check Current law permits limited advertising only by pharmacists optometrists nurses architects engineers land surveyors and certified shorthand reporters However many of these do not advertise because of strictures of professional societies The revisions in the advertising rules part of the major overhauling and consolidation of professional conduct guidelines for the fields that the Regents oversee has been in progress for about 20 months They broadened some rules from one or two fields to all fields rewrote some others and added several new regulations The result according to Regent Willard A Genrich chairman of the Committee on Higher and Professional Education is the first complete comprehensive set of rules on professional conduct anywhere in the nation They consist of 13 broad regulations that apply to all licensed professions two general sections for the health and design professions and more specific regulations for individual professions The complete list of professions over which the Regents have jurisdiction is as follows 
Carter Staff Prepares Memo on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/29/archives/carter-staff-prepares-memo-on-abortion.html,WASHINGTON July 28After an open display of disagreement with President Carters opposition to Federal funding for elective abortions highlevel women in the administration have muted their dissent and are quietly preparing a memorandum to the President taking issue with his Position Special to The New York Times It would be wrong to describe this as a rebellion said a woman who has watched the guarded activity of recent weeks Were tremendously pleased with President Carter We amply want to tell him this Heres how we see it Have you considered it this way The disagreement was first aired on July 18 when a contingent of about 30 women Presidential appointees and staff members gathered in the office of Margaret Costanza assistant to the President for public liaison to protest remarks the President had made at a press conference The President had concurred with a Supreme Court decision permitting states to deny Medicaid funds for abortions Asked whether this was fair to women who couldnt afford abortions the President answered Well as you know there are many things in life that are not fair that wealthy people can afford and poor people cant Deep Sensitivities This statement drew the angriest criticism in the meeting in Miss Costanzas office It touched deep sensitivities a participant remembered particularly among representatives from the antipoverty agencies There was some surprise and shock at the unfairness statemel another said Feelings were said to be virtually unanimous The women asked Miss Costanza to relay their views to the President and they resolved to draft a memorandum to him That same day an ad hoc group of seven members of Congress including five women announced they were going to request a meeting with the President to express their dissatisfaction then quickly abandoned the idea People in the White House advised us that if we came down there it might cause the President to come out even more strongly explained a spokesman for one of the Representatives in the group Another spokesman refused to comment on any message from the White House We decided we could be more effective trying to educate the members of the House than arguing with the President she explained Miss Costanza said that none of this angered the President She sent him her own dissenting memorandum the day after his press conference which she said was no surprise to him He is well acquainted with her viewpoint Im shocked she concluded that this whole thing is being treated as a rebellion A Family Quarrel In fact it has come to sound like a cordial family quarrel Actually confided a participant in the July 18 meeting a lot of us feel that the President didnt mean what he said about life being unfair He often speaks quickly and says things he doesnt quite mean Another pointed out that the women have always known where the President stood on abortion and vice versa It was no surprise that we said what we did Its just that when 30 people speak in unison it sounds worse Still another person described the meeting as casual and spontaneous an internal matter not meant for public consumption The women were dismayed she said by the splashy press coverage and their silence since the meeting does not signal a retreat Dont think this thing is collapsing she said These people are experienced highlevel sensitive to the political process They wantto communicate with the President they dont want to blow trumpets in Lafayette Park They dont want to talk about their memorandum either The author or authors are a strict secret It has not been decided how many will be asked to sign No one could be found who would admit to having read It but Jan Peterson an assistant to Miss Costanza said it was being Circulated and that people were being asked for comments Theyre looking at every word she said The memorandum will be given to Miss Constanza who will deliver it to President Carter Miss Costanza says she may sign it herself
"Public Likes Carter, Survey Finds, More for His Style Than Programs",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/29/archives/public-likes-carter-survey-finds-more-for-his-style-than-programs.html,Six months into his term of office President Carter still enjoys strong general approval from the American people but there has been a marked decline in public confidence that he can achieve such targets as significantly reducing unemployment or balancing the Federal budget A nationwide telephone survey con ducted by The New York Times and CBS News indicates that despite Mr Carters legislative initiatives in recent weeks he still wins greater favor from the public for the style of his Presidency than for the substance of his programs But the survey consisting of 1447 interviews conducted from July 20 to 25 also shows that on such delicate issues as federally financed abortions the neutron bomb and public reactions to the outspokeness of Andrew Young the chief United States representative at the United Nations Mr Carter has accurately read the nations mood and fashioned his own positions in line with prevailing sentiment Fiftyfive percent of those polled were in agreement with the Presidents position against financing of abortions while 38 percent favored such support only onethird of the public knows enough about the neutron bomb to form an opinion and that group is split evenly for and against its production About 60 percent of those questioned either were not aware of Mr Youngs statements on racism or Cuban involvement in Angola or had no firm opinion about the statements Among those who did have opinions sentiment was about evenly divided although blacks supported Mr Young by more than 5 to 1 and whites were critical by a margin of to 4 Nonetheless on the question of troop withdrawals from South Korea the President is bucking public opinion His ability to carry popular support on any offer of economic aid to Vietnam something demanded by Hanoi as part of the process of reconciliation depends on whether Mr Carter proposes humanitarian aid such as food and medicine or outright loans and credits Like such predecessors in the White House as John F Kennedy Lyndon B Johnson and Richard M Nixon Mr Car1 ter enjoys a strong approval rating on his overall performance62 percent or virtually as high a figure as in his first two weeks in office Normally such approval ratings remain high for all new Presidents during most if not all of the first year in office Similarly just over 60 percent of the public expects that the former Governor of Georgia will be able to restore trust in the Federal Government This is the same high level of expectation that existed on the eve of his inauguration and is evidently a reflectian of the effectiveness of such actions as his appearances at town meetings in Clinton Mass and Yazoo City Miss He visited Yazoo City last week Blacks Support Declines The only perceptible decline in Mr Carters overall popularity has come among blacks Surveys show that whereas 83 percent of the black community approved of Mr Carters performance three months ago that figure has dropped to 69 percent in July HoweVer this is still a better margin than among whites But generally Mr Carter has stabilized his support in the last three months all across the ideological spectrum especially among liberals even though the public has perceived him to be more conservative as President than he was as a candidate It is in dealing with specific issues that Mr Carter rates less favorably with the public than previously Just after he unveiled his energy plan in April close to 50 percent of the public believed that he would be able to handle energy problems effectively After weeks of White House haggling with Congress over energy legislation Mr Carter now gets less than a 40 percent vote of confidence on that issue Even more striking is the shift in the publics estimate of the Presidents ability to reduce unemployment to any real extent At the time he took office with nationwide unemployment at 75 percent more than half of the public thought he could bring about a significant reduction in unemployment Now with the jobless figure at 7 percent only 37 percent of the public thinks he can make a major dent in this problem Public More Skeptical Similarly in January 34 percent of the public expected him to be able to balance the Federal budget by the end of his fouryear term Now despite cuts in the defense budget a decision not to produce the B1 bomber and repeated White House assertions about balancing the budget the public is more skeptical Only 23 expect Mr Carter to achieve this goal There have been parallel though gentler declines in public confidence that Mr Carter can control inflation or streamline the Government and make it more efficient In some cases this trend may represent no more than a normal shift in public expectations as a new President begins tackling problems One reason that this skepticism does not seem to have tarnished Mr Carters overall standing with the public the fact that there is slightly more opimism and slightly less pessimism now about the economy than six months ago Possibly because of the Administrations efforts to bolster the economy with public works programs and tax reductions the proportion of those who think the economy is improving has risen from 16 percent to 22 percent The proportion of those who think it is getting worse has fallen from 27 percent to 22 percent This has benefited Mr Carter because like most White House incumbents the President is most popular among those who see the economy on the upswing and least popular among those whose economic outlook is gloomy Over all 49 percent of the population approves of the way he is dealing with the economy Benefit of the Doubt Even those whose families have been touched by unemployment in the last year are inclined to give Mr Carter the benefit of the doubt A surprisingly large 31 percent report that some adult in the immediate family has been out of work and actively job hunting in the last 12 months Nonetheless these families give Mr Carter the same general favorable rating as does the public at large Although he touched off a controversy among high women officials in his Administration and among feminists by his comments on abortion at a news conference earlier this month he seemed to reflect the prevailing public sentiment when he said that his Administration favored supporting the use of contraceptives and other health aids to women but opposed federally financed abortions except in special cases In response to questions in The New York TimesCBS News survey close to twothirds of those interviewed said that they favored Governmnent aid to women to pay the cost of contraceptives or to pay for maternity bills Only 38 percent favored Federal aid for abortions and 55 percent opposed such aid There was no significant difference of opinion on the abortion issue between men and women Carter Termed Astute According to the polls results Mr Carter has also been politically astute in reacting coolly to the controversy over Mr Youngs statements and to the debate on the neutron bomb which is a new radiation warhead fcr conventional artillery pieces and shortrange missiles Among the public at large Mr Carter encounters the same kind of opposition that he has found in Congress to his plans to withdraw Americanground forces from Korea The majority favors the status quo Fiftytwo percent assert that it is in the national interest to keep ground troops in Korea 34 percent favor withdrawal and 14 percent have no firm answer The margin in favor of keeping forces on the Korean peninsula was only slightly less than the 58 percent majority that favors keeping American ground troops in Western Europe On the issue of aid to Vietnam public opinion divided sharply depending on the kind of aid President Carter may decide to propose Seventy percent were opposed to outright financial aid and only a slight plurality of 49 percent favored industrial or farm equipment But fully twothirds supported providing food or medicine to the Hanoi Government which has been seeking aid as a concomitant to reopening diplomatic relations after the Vietnam War Thus far the Carter Administration has not taken a clearcut position on the aid issue though it has shied away from preconditions set by Hanoi and vigorously opposed by majorities in both houses of Congress The New York TimesJuly 29 1977

had restrictive laws before 1973 continued in 1975 the report said Consequently more women were getting abortions within their home states The study also showed that women obtaining legal abortions in 1975 tended to be young white unmarried and pregnant 12 weeks or less at the time of the abortion and that a trend of declining deaths because of abortions first noted in 1973 continued in 1975

December 1971 to March 1975 also involved two other codefendants brothers William and Harry W Rodgers 3d Mr Mandels basic defense against mail fraud and racketeering charges is that he never knew that

and ejected in December 1972 when the subsequent merger or Marlboro and Bowie Race Course was being uegotiated Supporting Mr Mandels earlier testimony Mr Hess said that he had called the Governor and

Iranian Women Return to Veil In a Resurgence of Spirituality,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/30/archives/iranian-women-return-to-veil-in-a-resurgence-of-spirituality.html,TEHERAN IranMore and more women are seen on the streets of this Middle Eastern capital wearing the chaddour a long enveloping veil in what looks like a womens backlash Not so says Mahnaz AtMiami Mmister of State for Womens Affairs Rather she says more women generally are on the streets and more women have come to the cities from rural areas where traditions are more rigid She also talks of a spiritual revival among young Iranians who are mostly Shiite Moslems An increasing number of Westerneducated girls are going to the shrines wearing the chaddour fasting during the daytime in the month of Ramadan and praying according to tradition she said I found it in myself the 36yearold Minister said speaking of her own experience with religion She said that last spring she had visited the Islamic holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia and shrines in Iraq The experience would have been impossible for me five years ago she said A Need for Religion There seems to be a need for religion as if we have moved too fast in a direction that is not native to us Mrs Afkhami said She calls it a revival against emptiness and compares it with spiritual trends among young Americans such as the interest in Zen Buddhism Women in Iran have achievedtol erable advancement according to Mrs Afkhami who is also secretary general of the Womens Organization of Iran She lived 15 years it the United States attended the University of San Francisco and did graduate research on 19th century English literature at the University of Colorado Its a very slow and difficult process she said in an interview in her office at the Prime Ministry She wore an elegant trim white skirt and striped silk blouse but hastened to stress that she herself regularly puts on the chaddour which is usually black when she goes to shrines Many feminist leaders in other Moslem countries consider the veil a symbol of womens backward station in life but Mrs Afkhami feels it is incidental Economic Freedom Is Sought Our main task is to make women economically independent she said pointing out that many working women were discarding the veil Many women still wear the veil as a convenience to cover old clothing she said but its difficult to work when wearing one For this reason the Womens Organization has designed a long scarf that covers the hair but leaves the arms free and is increasingly popular with young girls A recent survey of 175000 women and girls including government employees college students working women and housewives shows that 80 percent of the older women are still veiled but only 6 percent of the young generation The middle group 18 to 40 years old is split according to class lines with 79 percent of the women of the lowest income group still veiled but only 18 percent of the government employees and university students Women here are prouder of their early history than their more recent past The Womens Organization recently issued a booklet on The Iran Woman Past and Present which say that women were considered full partners of men as early as the Achaemenian Empire 540 BC to 320 BC which at its height stretched from India to Egypt Arabs Took Away Rights The women lost their rights under the Arab occupation in the 7th century AD according to the historical rsum In the centuries that followed a few women achieved national prominence but most were secondclass citizens After Reza Shah assumed power in 1926 he gradually lifted restrictions on them What is described as the most dramatic and longawaited change came in 1935 when he announced the abolition of the veil His son Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlevi took the next major step when in 1963 he gave women the right to vote hold office and own land The Minister for Womens Affairs said that other main advances for women under the present Shah involved Divorce In the past men could automatically divorce their wives and retain custody of the children Now a divorce can be granted only by court Women can ask for divorce and have the right to keep the children Abortion Under a law passed few months ago unwed women may obtain abortions upon demand A married woman must have the agreement of her husband The Womens Organization the Minister said is seeking an amendment to allow any woman who wants an abortion to have it Education Females make up 37 percent of universitylevel students including those being trained to teach More impressive the Minister said half the students who applied to enter medical school this year were women Politics As part of a wave of feminine interest in politics 400 women have been elected to local councils and 20 to parliament Employment Legislation has granted women equal opportunity and equal pay SoMe discrimination persists Mrs Afkhami said but the shortage of skilled workers makes it difficult for men to show prejudice A new law covering the civil service gives mothers with children 3 years old or younger the possibility of working half days but retaining full fringe benefits The main employment problem now the Minister said is the widespread feeling that women should not do bluecollar work They fear being an electrican would make them less desirable or who would want a plumber as a wife she said A controversial issue at present is that a wife cannot obtain a passport to leave the country without the authorization of her husband and he can revoke his authorization at any time Mrs Afkami spoke of a serious prob lem of women who work heavily on farms with no pay She said that the Minister of Agriculture had been asked to draft a plan to give women more access to cooperatives and technological advancement The most serious problem facing Iranian women today is the image they have of themselves their lack of selfconfidence said Dr Vida Davaudi 32 who holds a doctorate in political science from Southern Illinois University and is a member of Parliament She recently urged more advanced health and hygiene education in schools By this she meant sexual education but she said that this subject is still very delicate in Iran and has to be broached carefully MagnumHenrl CarierBresson The chaddour For Moslem women pride in history

Through Cancer and Pregnancy She Kept Faith—and a Journal,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/31/archives/through-cancer-and-pregnancy-she-kept-faithand-a-journal-among-the.html,PORTLAND OreLaurel Lee has Just been through what her Bible calls the Fire and Brimstone She has faced cancer death birth poverty hospitals abandonment and divorce in less than a year She went to the fourth and final stage of Hodgkins disease but then she didnt die as she was supposes to All along the way everyone expected her to falter but she never did What she did do was respond with patience cheer and a homey philosophy of love and faith in Jesus Also significantly she kept journals And now she has ended up rich healthy almost famous and ensconced in a whole new identity and career as an author and modernday teller of tales and truths and triumphs All hers Laurel Lee was among the first of her generation to smoke dope and drop acid to view hitchhiking and poverty as a way of life and in those years over a decade ago to find Jesus In the intervening years she has homesteaded in Alaska given up the drugs and the hitchhiking taken a husband and borne three children But her attitudes toward life are much the same Now 31yearold Laurel Lee who used to pay 15 a month rent to live in somebodys closet and was so unusual in the early days of hippies that her home a decorated truck appeared in a newspaper has been discovered The very moneymaking society she sought for years to avoid has found her Its all because of the lovely little book with drawings by Laurel Lee called Walking Through the Fire A Hospital Journal It tells in a sparse poetic way that St Francis of Assisi might have liked how in the sixth month of pregnancy her cancer was discovered She refused an abortion and postponed radiation Then after the birth of MaryElisabeth a total of seven hospitalizations a number of operations extensive chemotherapy and radiation and facing imminent death her husband suddenly left her for the babysitter The book however is not depressing If anything it is inspirational and Laurel Lee wrote it a year ago for no one but four doctor friends to read Instead last fall the E P Dutton Publishing Company bought it for 4000 and rushed it into print so it would appear before she died Then to everyones amazement several months later the disease passed into a rare stage of reinission This means it could recur in 50 years or in one week The book went on to become an alternate selection of the Literary Guild Bantam Paperbacks bought it for over 300000as much as Bantam has ever spent on a bookand now Laurel Lee goes to book conventions and appears on television She is about to embark on a second national publicity tour and the book will be published in England Japan and Germany She gets letters from people she has never met and is the subject of an upcoming television documentary She has established trust funds for her children and bought her first car She hired a housekeeper and for the first time ever allowed the heat to stay on at night Laurel Lee is tall and thin with fragile arms and light blue eyes She wears embroidered clothes denim and garments from the thrift stores where she used to look for bargains The children arent allowed to watch television and they go to special Christian schools Their father rarely sees them I never dreamed of publication and I never thought about success Sometimes I wonder what it is doing to me as a person I really value being good she said I dont know where all this will go now When I was hitchhiking I didnt feel isolated but when I had children and settled down I found a rut Its too early to tell the whole effect it will have on me The companys coming in the door The changes are still on their way in Theres a story she tells about 7yearold Matthew her oldest child but it tells about Laurel Lee too When my agent called to tell me Bantani had bought the book for all that money she said Matthew was with me and I told him God just sold our book for lots of dollars  And Matthew said But will we have any cents And thats the cosmic question Laurel explained Will we have any sense Laurel Lee wasborn in Chicago but spent most of her life in Fremont Calif near San Francisco and Berkeley She came to Portland when she and her husband Richard Lee decided to settle down with their baby Matthew Her own family was affluent her father worked as a budget analyst with the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation and Laurel Lee was among the first of her generation to rebel against the old traditions She went to Berkeley but dropped out even before opposition to the Vietnam War had really begun and with her husband she went to Alaska to homestead We were looking for enlightenment another kind of consciousness she said They found it in Jesus Later the strength and joy as she calls her dedication to Jesus influenced her attitude toward dying This attitude amazed her doctors she said just as it has since intrigued her readers To Laurel Lee though it all seems simple Like everything it is because of Jesus and her faith Laurel Lee has no doubts She knows nothing of ambivalence I sever want to believe in something that isnt true she said If I have to he in a firing squad of circumstances to find out if my beliefs are true Im Among the First to Rebel glad God apparently had survived Laurel Lees test and she His Though her book is as sparse about her beliefs as it is about details of her life Laurel Lee herself is very open and loquacious about her prolonged experience with illness and hardship There were magical things I discovered in dying she said If my body is just a car I drive around inside of as it begins to fall apart as outward man begins to perish the inward man is renewed day to day If you really believe in the Bible where it says All things work together for good for those that have God then no matter how terrible things May appear to be you can rely on the fact that somehow it is working for your good too she said thats what I felt about dying she explained I had so much joy I had a peace that was beyond anything I could understand even though so many difficult things were happening And sometimes I tried to imitate the miserable sad expressions of the other patients around me so the doctors and everyone wouldnt think I was bananas Laurel Lee is pleased that she has lived but not exceedingly I got to a place where it didnt matter if I lived or died she said Except for the children I saw glimpses of heaven and they were pretty nice I wouldnt have minded going on at all It is precisely these attitudes of Laurels her faith and how she has applied it to what she calls adversity that have intrigued so many peoplefrom her doctors to her editors to the public at large She flits back and forth like a speeding fly between something close to arch naivet and real wisdom She barely reads newspapers and admits she knows little about the outside world Also shes clearly very bright and all this is as apparent in her twostory old wooden house here in Portland as it is in her little book The doctors who possibly had something to do with saving her life were enchanted by her and they gave her book to an editor friend in New York The editor was enchanted too but couldnt publish it so she gave the journal to Harriet Wasserman one of New Yorks literary agents And thats how it happened Asked why she wanted this journal to be read by her four straight doctors who are her very close friends when no one had read her works before she said For them to look up a little higher I wanted to accomplish that for them I was so absolutely happy and felt I had stumbled on a real secret when everything was so hard I knew they couldnt hear it if I told them so I had to write it down And did they understand it then she was asked No Two of the drawings at left and below that Laurel Lee did for her book Walking Through the Fire At right Laurel Lee with her

The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/31/archives/the-nation-in-summary-for-lance-it-all-turns-out-milk-and-honey.html,In Summary For Lance it All Turns Out Milk and Honey Skeptical members of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee who only two weeks ago held Budget Director Bert Lance at arms length have wound up hugging him Some went even further and said they were sorry for all the trouble We can just imagine what this has done to you and your family Connecticuts Abraham Ribicoff said apologetically as the committee decided last week not to investigate the budget directors personal or business finances for possible conflict of interest Consolation also came in more material terms Mr Lance found someone who says he will buy at a good price the 34 million purchase price worth of bank stock that caused his temporary embarrassment in the first place It began with President Carters fiscal advisers request to be released from a pledge he had madegoing further than the requirements of the Presidents new conflict of interest rulesto sell his National Bank of Georgia stock by Dec 31 he left the hank for the Government Before the committee had abandoned the investigation anxiety over possible conflict stemming from Mr Lances assets had shifted to concern about the potential of conflict in his debts notably a 34 million personal loan he received from the First National Bank of Chicago Just after being nominated to his present position Mr Lances pledge to sell the stock was made because his official duties can affect banks He asked to be released because he says the market value of the stock has dropped so much that he could lose over 1 milif he had to sell The prospective buyer a fellow Atlantan David N Smith who sells educational materials abroad would pay roughly 17 a share the old market price and because he has said he wants to buy the stock the committee need not rule on Mr Lances request The loan taken to repay another Joan with which Mr Lance purchased most of the stock became an issue because of its size and the interest Mr Lance has to pay What he does in office can affect the interest rate His financial trustee says the proceeds from the sale of the stock will be used to pay off the loan Park Chung Hee must be feeling little sorry for himself After all the Money and effort his Government spent to  preserve the United States presence in South Korea what did he get First the allegations that the Ko reans had spent lavishly and perhaps illegally to influence votes in Congress Then came the Carter Administrations decision to withdraw all United States ground troops from South Korea over the next five years Last week while the investigation into the Korean lobby widened the Administration tried to soften the strategic and psychological blow of the troop withdrawal Dispatched to Seoul Harold Brown the Secretary of Defense gave a pep talk to American soldiers handed President Park a letter from President Carter affirming Washingtons commitment to Korean defense andmost important to Seoulannounced that twothirds of the 33000 soldiers scheduled to leave would remain until the last months of the withdrawal Most South Koreans even those opposed to the repressive policies of the Park Government have expressed concern that the North Koreans will take advantage of the troop pullback to step up antiPark propaganda and perhaps invade the south North Koreas desire not to jeopardize the withdrawal was evident earlier this month when after shooting down a United States helicopter that had strayed across the border it speedily returned the bodies of three dead crewmen and released a wounded fourth Absent was the usual propaganda about imperialist warmongers Another factor in deferring the withdrawal was Mr Carter and Mr Parks anxiety that Congress embarrassed at the disclosures of its role in the Korean lobby scandal might obstruct Administration plans to provide the Park regime with 2 billion in military sales Credits and gifts as a sort of farewell present Back in Washington disclosures about Seouls influencebuying continued and yet another inquiry was announced this one by the Pentagon into whether present or former Defense Department officials improperly enjoyed largesse from South Korea The new information disclosed that the Korean lobby activities did not stop as previously thought in mid4975 when investigation of it began Kim Han Cho a naturalized United States citizen known in this country as Hancho C Kim is said to have distributed 200000 in cash gifts and favors to American officials until mid1978 Softening the Blow to Seoul Washington Probe Widens Mr Kim like Park Tong Sun allegedly Seouls chief agent of influence in Washington is a subject of the Justice Department investigation Mr Park however fled to London At an unusual meeting between representatives of the Justice Departmentincluding Attorney General Griffin B Belland 100 members of the House of Representatives it was reported that the department is seeking at the highest levels translation through the actions unspecified of the President to get Mr Park back The briefing was arranged through the House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr to reassure Congressmen critical of the Justice inquiry that it is in fact proceeding Some Congressmen dissatisfied with the Justice investigation as well as with their own ethics committee inquiry have been pressing for the appointment of a special prosecutor Just before midnight last Thursday 3812 days after it had started its journey the first oil from Alaskas North Slope poured out of the southern end of the Alaska pipeline into storage tanks at Valdez Normally the journey should take 7 days but the first oil had encountered a myriad mishaps some deliberate some accidental on its way to the sea The line is capable of moving up to 12 million barrels of oil a day and it is expected to take 25 years to drain the 97 billion barrels from the Prudhoe Bay oil fields North Americas largest From the time it was first proposed the line has been criticized by environmentalists and even now that it is complete it is not immune From Valdez the oil is to be shipped by tanker to ports in the southern states and critics say that the possibility of shipwreck still poses a great environmental hazard Given the emotional and moral pull on both sides of the question perhaps it is not so surprising that Congress is having great difficulty breaking stalemate over an abortion bill Last week House and Senate conferees gave up after a month of trying to agree on language that would reconcile the chambers differing abortion measures and sent the legislation back to the respective houses for another vote Another conference will probably be called for As it stands the House bill would ban the use of Federal funds for all abortions the Senate less restrictive would permit Medicaid to pay for the operation under three conditions when the mothers life is in danger in the case of rape or incest or where medically necessary House conferees gave a little in agreeing only to payment for abortions where the mothers life is endangered A judge was unyielding last week as well Federal District Court Judge John F Dooling Jr of Brooklyn who last year invalidated a bill that barred Medicaid abortions ruled that Federal payments should continue temporarily at least The United States Supreme Court had ordered him to reconsider in June when it ruled that government state or local is not required to provide public funds for abortions though it may choose to do so The potential for conflict between business ethics and the pressure for growth and profit in the highflying world of an industrial conglomerate has been illustrated in a series of articles in The New York Times Three articles by Seymour M Hersh with Jeff Gerth dealt with the financial reporting practices of the Gulf and Western Corporation its relationship with banks and its tax accounting methods These matters are now the subject of an investigation by the Se curities and Exchange Commission an investigation that is considered likely to lead to new guidelines on corporate morality The Government is attempting to determine whether there has been a pattern of transactions both within the company and with other companies intended to hide Gulf and Westerns true financial condition from the stockholders and from the public Former company officials told The Times that the company president Charles G Bluhdorn had decided in the early 1970s that the company should show a steady 15 percent growth rate to impress Wall Street analysts and encourage investment in Gulf and Western To meet that goal the former sfficials said the company distorted its profit and loss figures Gulf and Western said that the allegations in ThO Times series were riddled with falsehoods RVDenenberg and Caroline Rand Herron Thar She Flows Through Pipeline No Compromise Over Abortion GW How Things Work The NationContinued Inscrutable Americans In Major Asian Strategy Shift TOKYOYankee come home Although theslogan has not yet surfaced on walls in Tokyo Seoul Bangkok and elsewhere in the area the words vividly underscore the mood of Asian officials watching with nervousness the evolvement of United States defense policy in the Pacific The policy is now in transition Although the United States adhered to a policy of containment and forward defense in the early 1950sinvolving American troop deployments and mutual defense agreements to thwart aggression and in a sense show theflagthe foundations of the policy crumbled in the sixties and seventies The Vietnam war the RussiaChina conflict nationalist movements in Asia and the steady expansion of the conventional and nuclear military power of the Warsaw Pact countries has spurred the Carter Administrations reassessment of American military strategy in Asia Clearly the shift in military posture is made evident in the reduction of American troops in Asia and the decision to withdraw more than 30000 ground troops from South Korea over the next four to five The reason for the withdrawal is quite simply that when another country can manage we shouldnt be around said one of the highest officials in the Pentagon who helped plan Defense Secretary Harold Browns visit to Korea last week to cement plans for the withdrawal South Koreas growth rate last year in real terms was 15 percent They have double the population of the North Theyre in a strong position to defend themselves Theres a basic belief that as long as a country can handle its military situation they should handle it he said Certainly the Vietnam debacle serves as the main impulse for the ground troop withdrawal from Korea and reduction of troops in Thailand the Philippines Okinawa Japan Taiwan and Guam The specter of American troops fighting another ground war in Asia haunts Administration officials a surprising number of them having served as early policymakers in the war At the height of the Vietnam war in 1968 the United States based 841000 servicemen and women from Japan to Thailand Today only 139000 American service personnel are based in the Pacific and aboard warships of the Seventh Fleet By 1981 the figure is expected to decline to 100000 Within the Pacific Command there are two army divisions two marine divisions with their attached aircraft nine air force fighter squadrons and six aircraft carriershalf the navys carrier forcecarrying 12 fighter squadrons and 18 tactical bomber squadrons There are 20 planes in a squadron The command also includes 10 Poseidon missilelaunching submarines based at Guam Troop reductions have taken place across the entire region In Guam there were 15000 troops in 1968 today there are 9000 In Japan the number has dropped from 38000 to 18000 In Okinawa from 43000 to 28000 In Taiwan from 9000 to 1000 In the Philippines from 27000 to 16000 Perhaps the most dramatic reduction in forces has taken place in Thailand During the war the United States based nearly 48000 troops there Now only about 120 United States military personnel are in Thailand partly because of American policy but largely because the popularly elected Government in Bangkok which lasted three years until a military coup in 1976 demanded that American forces leave Now the Thais like others are saying that the United States seems to be abandoning its responsibilities retreating into a semiisolationist posture ignoring the Communise threat in Asia There are other reasons for the retreat from Asia In Western Europe the presence of Soviet armed divisions in East Germanycoupled with the rough equality of nuclear strength between the Soviet Union and the Westserves as a significant military challenge In contrast the Soviet Unions 40 divisions in East Asia pose a threat less to the United States than to Moscows former ally China Only 30 percent of the Soviet Navy is in the Pacific fleet The Chinese more intent on shaping a relationship with the United States than playing an aggressive military role in Asia have lent a certain stability to the area In fact the Chinese are more worried about United States reductions in the Pacific than some allies The United States pivotal ally in Asia remains Japan whose leaders fear instability on the Korean peninsula would spill over and undermine Japanese security Although Japan is the richest nation in Asia its defenses are fairly skimpy the result of emotional opposition to rearmament after the humiliation of World War II and a lack of public perception of a security threat The Japanese are plainly aware too of the bitterness that persists in numerous Asian countries including China over wartime Japanese aggression Tokyo has acknowledged that Washington which keeps troops on the Japanese mainland and on Okinawa under a sec ity treaty has provided it with a free ride in defense The United States has urged Japan to do more especially in antisubmarine warfare and air defense but the country which spends only one percent of its gross national product on defense is reluctant to increase its modest capability of 240000 military personnel The troop withdrawal from Korea is a reaffirmation of the socalled Nixon Doctrine in which the United States vowed continued support of its allies but expected them to do their own fighting on the ground A nonmilitary reason for the decision in Korea could well be the Administrations yearning to place some distance between itself and the regime of President Park Chung Hee So far the overall impact of the withdrawalsand the planned pullout of ground troops from Koreahas been a deepening concern that the United States will somehow leave the Pacific to the mercies of the Soviet Union and China And underlying the concern is confusion The United States is our biggest enigma Foreign Minister Sinnathamby Rajaratnam of Singapore has observed We used to think of the inscrutable Chinese and the inscrutable Russians Now were not precisely sure about the intensity of the American commitment to this part of the world Bernard Weinraub is a correspondent for The

Therapy Is Elusive for Stubborn Inflation Psychology,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/31/archives/therapy-is-elusive-for-stubborn-inflation-psychology-the.html,WASHINGTONFrom the staff of Congress and from the economists at the Brookings Institution have recently come sober assessments about inflation It is they say a deeply entrenched force in the American economy and they maintain the Carter Administration has not come up with an antiinflation policy that is likely to make much of a difference The outlook for inflation is not encouraging Brookings a liberal research organization said earlier this month The deepest and longest recession since 1938 has not reduced the underlying inflation rate of 56 percent a year The general rate of inflation will not be greatly moderated by the policies proposed by the new Administration Few in government would disagree with that assessment of the underlying rate The stubborn persistence of that rate is one reason Federal Reserve chairman Arthur F Burns expressed concern about last weeks slide in the dollar provoked by the release of Junes record trade deficit figure A weak dollar Mr Burns noted generates inflation by increasing prices for imported goods Why is inflation so persistent What is the Carter Administration doing to combat it what is it not doing and why The answer to the first question sheds some light on the next two Despite the existence of idle resources and labor costs and prices defy the laws of economics and chase each other up That is in large part because expectations of inflation tend to be selffulfilling As the Congressional Budget Office put it in its recent report During the last decade inflation has become embedded strongly in our economic machinery The rapid spread of costoflivingadjusted labor contracts the reflection of inflationary expectations in a broad spectrum of interest rates and the automatic linking of major Federal entitlement programs to consumer price increases are a few important examples In 1976 Jimmy Carter gave indications that he would actively seek to break inflationary psychology As a candidate from the South wooing the liberal northern wing of the Democratic party Jimmy Carter said he was for standby wageprice controls as President he has proved to be anything as an activist on the wageprice front On his advisers perception that requesting the authority to impose controls might well trigger anticipatory wage and price increases he renounced them It soon became clear that he would not follow the KennedyJohnson practice of announcing numerical guideposts for wage and price rises either Those within the Administration who opposed the guideposts route on economic grounds argued that any realistic number would be embarrassingly high and that in an era of entrenched inflation such figures would prove to be floors rather than ceilings the Administration also wanted to win the confidence of big business which traditionally has been wary of Democratic Presidents A related but more political reason was that organized labor vehemently opposed guideposts And without guidelines of some kind White House jawboning or the use of disapproving rhetoric and appeals to public opinion to moderate wage and price increases has no point of departure It soon became apparent to everyone that Mr Carter supported by Treasury Secretary W Michael Blumenthal and Budget Director Bert Lance wanted to avoid anything that might smack of confrontation politics In fact the President backed so much away from activism that he refused to seek legislation to require prenotification of important price boosts with the possibility of public hearings and evaluation With controls standby authority prenotification guidelines hearings and systematic jawboning all excluded what does the Administrations antiinflation policy amount to The key elements are a fouryear push towards a balanced budget a few highly selective attempts at cost containment and more competition as in hospital charges and airfares resistance to protectionist proposals to limit imports and tax proposalsto be announcedto encourage business investment in newer more efficient equipment To this list might be added the Administrations tenta tive relationship with an informal labormanagement coinmittee coordinated by John T Dunlop the professor of economics from Harvard University who ran the Republicans pricewage program in 19734 Secretary Blumenthal Barry P Bosworth the new director of the Council on Wage and Price Stability and Charles L Schultze the Brookings economist who is Mr Carters chief economic adviser hope to get around to talking wageprice restraint with the Dunlop group But first the Administration hopes to use the group to build broad support for Administration policies generally Ultimately the Administrations lowkey and limited approach to combating inflation stems from its conviction that the basic trend is toward a slower rate of inflation The rate in fact has been slowing But it also stems from a belief that a show of activism may produce headlines but has little effect on the myriad economic decisions that add up to the trend of costs and prices As for the council the Administration has dropped a proposal to expand the councils staff but still hopes to make the small agency more effective in early spotting of incipient shortages and costprice pressures So just ten days ago Mr Schultze as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers denounced as inconsistent with reasonable efforts to control inflationprice increases announced by United States Steel Corp the largest steelmaker Mr Schultzes statement was the Adminstrations first broadside attack on any price increase But within 24 hours of this venture into jawboning Bethlehem Steel number two in the industry announced increases identical to US Steels Bethlehems haste suggested that the company was lining up with its big brother in a show of solidarity meant to inhibit White House interventionism both companies also reported profits down from the spring quarter by 36 percent Given Mr Carters desire to avoid anything that smacks of governmentbusiness conflict it was unlikely even before Bethlehems announcement that the Administration was moving towards more general activismat least for now Whether it does shift in that direction or whether it hews to its present passive policy is likely ultimately to depend on whether the rate of inflation moves up or down A change of mind is not without precedent Indeed it was a Republican President Richard M Nixon who in 1971 imposed controls after having repeatedly disavowed them Edward Cowan is a reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times Robert Neubecker The NationContinued Legal Services Now Thrive On Success Not Controversy By WARREN WEAVER Jr WASHINGTONConceived in the manic social optimism of the Great Society battered and nearly beaten the hostile climate of the Nixon Administration the Governmentfinanced program of legal services for the poor finally achieving a level of stability and acceptance that Li heartening if a little unsettling to its sponsors Legal services have survived a perilous transition from a muchcriticized division of the Office of Economic Opportunitythe high command of Lyndon Johnsons War on Povertyto a nonprofit corporation with a budget that exceeds 200 million and is still growing Although Congressional conservatives still regard the program as subsidized radicalism the number and fervor of the critics have dedined over the past halfdozen years in the face of broad public agreement that the Government should help those with legal difficulties who cannot afford a lawyer The Legal Services Corporation is so sure of support among lawyers for the concept of helping the poor that its president Thomas Ehrlich will propose to the American Bar Association in Chicago this week that association members devote 5 percent of their working hours to providing such assistance The corporation headquartered in a seedy office building three blocks from the White House employs 3200 lawyers in about 700 offices throughout the country They handle more than one million legal matters a year for people who would otherwise have gone unassisted The majority of this advice concerns the most routine sort of personal troubles disputes with the landlord family friction consumer complaints and the administration of government benefit programs like welfare and Social Security Most of the work involves negotiating on behalf of clients only one case In seven ever goes to court But from time to time these poverty lawyers have also brought lawsuits that were upsetting to put it mildly to the professional and political establishment legal challenges to the system that had deprived their clients of the advantages enjoyed by all other Ameri Governors mayors and prison wardens found themselves in court answering charges lodged by a lawyer whose services were paid for by tax dollars Consumer classaction suits threatened prosperous businessmen Suits were filed to protect the rights of heretofore silent and passive groups Indians children inmates of mental institutions Poverty lawyers provided some legal advice to the United Farm Workers Union notably in connection with a recall petition against Gov Jack Williams of Arizona in 1973 In California they forced the Department of Labor to enforce its prohibition against hiring illegal aliens In New York they upset residence requirements for welfare recipients In Minnesota they made divorce proceedings cheaper for the poor Even more disturbing to some was the open political activity organized by some legal services lawyers such as lobbying demonstrations at state capitols and boycotts They mobilized the poor in causes that appeared distinctly radical to the rich The volume of this activity compared with routine legal advice was never high but it attracted a good deal of public attention When legislation creating the corporation staggered through Congress in 197374 it included a ban on the use of legal services funds to support political activity demonstrations picketing and strikes The legislation also prohibited giving legal advice and representation in cases involving abortion school desegregation the draft and military desertion Partially as a result of the legislated restrictions the program has become less controversial Mr Ehrlich who left his post as dean of Stanford Law School to head the corporation says that poverty lawyers have also become more sensitive about bringing suits that might jeopardize the program as a whole but he does not regard that the main reason for the cooling of the legal services issue The big thing has been the passage of time Mr Ehrlich said This program has really worked In the beginning all the shopkeepers and landlords and lawyers were afraid of us The lawyers thought we would steal their clients but the people we help would never have gone to a private lawyer anyway Now the bar associations realize that In fact the American Bar Association has been a stout supporter of the legal servioes program even in its stormiest days The associations members among the elite of the profession were able to stand on principle with the comfortable assurance that subsidized poverty lawyers would divert no income from their firms Indeed when the underprivileged were able to sue the privileged it undoubtedly provided more work for the lawyers who represented the privileged The bill extending the corporations life for two years came up on the House floor late in June and carried by a majority of 164 votes compared with 84 three years ago However a further restriction was imposed an amendment prohibited legal activity on homosexual rights The debate included a rather typical incident One member the House accused a legal services attorney of promoting a study that quoted Mao Tsetung Both houses of Congresss have agreed on an appropriation of 205 million for the corporation for 1978 a substantial increase over its current 125 million budget and only 12 million less than the organization requested Next year if the corporation reaches its announced goal that figure will rise to between 275 and 300 million The goal a simple one Providing two lawyers for every 10000 the 24 million poor persons in the country by 1979 The rest of the population which is not eligible for legal services enjoys a ratio of 14 lawyers for each 10000 a ratio that rises with every law school graduation I think our prospects are very good Mr Ehrlich said We have a group of extraordinary men and women with overall ootnmitment to our goal Its exhilarating Were really on

`Working for Love of the Law’,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/01/archives/working-for-love-of-the-law.html,When John Francis Dooling Jr was a partner in the worldly Wall Street law firm of Sullivan  Cromwell in the 1940s a rare quality about him caught the eye of Louis Auchincloss a perceptive colleague who went on Man in the news to fame as a novelist The success ethic and money absolutely didnt exist for the him Mr Auchincloss re called last week Im sure he was well compensated and he had a great many children to educate but there was less personal ambition behind his drive than Ive seen in almost any other lawyer with him it was a case of working for the love of the law In the years that followed the love of the law impelled Mr Dooling to give up his lucrative law practicehad he continued it he would be earning about 200000 a year todayfor a 55000 a year Federal judgeship in the Eastern District which takes in Brooklyn Queens and Nassau and Suffolk Counties And over the years Judge Doolings love of the law has occasionally placed him in the limelight as last week when he issued a restraining order that had the nationwide effect of continuing Federal reimbursement for abortions under Medicaid In doing so the judge was sticking by what he saw as legal principle even though the Department of Health Education and Welfare was about to send notices to all of its offices to stop providing Medicaid funds for abortions The judge also stirred a controversy last week with remarks from the bench during a hearing in a desegration trial that could eventually lead to the busing of school children across the QueensNassau line Taking a legal purists view he jolted traditionalists by saying that where education was concerned the border was an accident of high political irrelevancy Perfect Judicial Mind He tries to do his duty in a very fair way Edward R Korman chief assistant United States attorney for the Eastern District commented last week And Mr Auchincloss author of The Dark Lady and other books observed that even as a lawyer when he put his mind to the law there were absolie specialized in litigation the process the has the perfect judicial mind Mr Dooling told an interviewer last week that he was originally drawn to the law simply because it was a new field of knowledge He chose it as his career when he was in his senior year at St Francis College in Brooklyn which is his native heath Mr Dooling was born on June 13 1908 the son of a Brooklyn doctor The younger Mr Dooling married a Brooklyn girl Dorothea Bernard and the couple practicing Roman Catholics were later to send their four daughters to parochial elementary and secondary schools in the parish of St Saviour Churchin Brooklyns Park Slope sectionwhere they were married Yet love of the law had lured Mr Dooling to Manhattan While studying law at night at St Johns University he went to work as a clerk at Sullivan  Cromwell There he impressed a senior partner David Hawkins who suggested that he switch to Harvard Law School Mr Dooling did so was made an editor of the Harvard Law Review was hired as a lawyer by Sullivan  Cromwell and became a partner in the firm all in fairly quick order As a lawyer he specialized in litigation the process of carrying on lawsuits It was after 27 years with the firm that Mr Dooling accepted his judicial appointment from President John F Kennedy in 1961 I guess that was pretty selfish of me perhaps I did not think as much as I should have what it meant to my wife and children he told the interviewer in his vast chambers in the United States Courthouse on Brooklyns Cadmen Plaza A Durable Brilliance On the bench Judge Dooling has expressed his love of the law by giving decisions with what is widely regarded as a durable brilliance Hes very able indeed one of the citys most influential judges remarked privately last week calling Judge Dooling an intellectual force And Mr Korman the chief assistant United States attorney said hes obviously one of the most intelligent judges on the bench in this district or anywhere else Judge Doolings love of the law also expresses itself in extreme diligence He takes notes tirelessly in court and he relies relatively little on law clerks writing his opinions entirely himself in longhand It also expresses itself in some foibles his opinions are often written in a convoluted legal prose that less gifted minds find difficult An amiable softspoken man he sometimes grows angry with witnesses or lawyers whose courtroom behavior displeases him and he has been known to shout He works so hard that some courthouse regulars are afraid that he is neglecting his health Outside the law the judges only hobby is reading which he does on the bus rides to and from the Park Slope brownstone where he and his wife live Their five childrenthe four daughters and a sonare grown The judge sometimes startles onlookers by reading novels as he walks from the bus stop to the courthouse Explaining this habit he said with a smile Its hard to fit in the reading you want to do outside the law because theres so much to read in it

Ruling on Existing Law Complicates Debate on New H.E.W. Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/02/archives/abortion-aid-barred-by-bell-in-rape-cases-ruling-on-existing-law.html,WASHINGTON Aug 1The Carter Administration has ruled that existing legislation barring Federal funds for abortions makes no exceptions for victims of rape or incest The law passed last year has never been enforced because of court injunctions against any Federal ban on Medicaid abortions Many senators believed they had called for such exceptions by writing them into a conference report accompanying the compromise appropriations bill that included the ban But the Administration ruled that the language of the bill itself clearly prohibited such aid Attorney General Griffin B Bell made the ruling dated last Wednesday at the request of Joseph A Califano Jr Secretary of Health Education and Welfare Senator Birch Bayh Democrat of Indiana said last night that the Administrations ruling served as a clear warning that Congress should spell out any intended exceptions in a new ban which is scheduled for a House vote tomorrow He said it showed that legislators would I be making a mistake if they counted on the Administration to go by more liberal language in any conference report A spokesman for Mr Califano said the Secretary had sought the ruling July 21 in preparing to advise state Medicaid agencies on how to enforce the law The opinion was released today by the Department of Health Education and Wel fare The House is scheduled to vote tomorrow night on whether to reenact the same strict ban providing Federal funds for an abortion only when the mothers life is in danger Last years law which expires Sept 30 has never been enforced because Federal Judge John F Dooling Jr issued an injunction against it 40 minutes after it went into effect The United States Supreme Court ordered the injunction vacated June 29 returning the case to Judge Dooling for reconsideration but Judge Dooling reinstituted his temporary restraining order on Thursday permitting the payments to continue For this reason the ruling will have no immediate effect except perhaps on Congressional voting on the new bill Legislators had been expected to try again to use conference report language fo provide abortion aid for rape and incest victims as well as for mothers whose lives were in danger But the Administration ruling said that last years exceptions to the ban written into a conference report accompanying a compromise appropriations bill were not valid because the language of the bill itself was a clear prohibition not affected by language in the report Mr Bell did not dismiss the report Ianeuaee as irrelevant though he did quote Supreme Court opinions emphasizing that the plain meaning of a statute could be sufficient guide to its interpretation But he held that the ambiguous language of the report could be as easily interpreted as merely saying that Medicaid funds could be used for treatment of rape or incest victims short of abortions He sad it would he improper to read the conference report in a way which disregards the language of the statute itself It is my opinion that the Hyde amendment prohibits except where the victims life is endangered the funding of abortions for victims of rape and incest but does not prohibit contemporaneous medical treatment of such victims which may prevent fertilization or implantation Mr Bell wrote Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois was the author of the amendment in last years bill and again this year The amendment had been only rarely enforced because it was being appealed through the courts The rules of construction are too well known to admit of much debate Mr Bell wrote When the House votes tomorrow it will be deciding between an absolute ban on Federal money for abortions and one with an exception for the life of the mother After that vote the result of a HouseSenate conference that ended in disagreement the Senate will vote again on whether  to insist on its version of the ban This years Senate language not too strongly supported by senators in the conference specifies the rape or incest exception and adds another for cases in which an abortion is considered medically necessary If the Senate refuses to accept the House language another conference will have to be called The abortion issue is the only remaining disagreement blocking final passage of the 602 billion appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare for the fiscal year beginning Oct 1

also a mover and shaker in the Westchester Black Womens Political Caucus and a supervisor of skills training at the Westchester County Womens Center She told of how Shawn came to her after the race

ABORTION AID BARRED BY BELL IN RAPE CASES,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/02/archives/abortion-aid-barred-by-bell-in-rape-cases-he-rules-that-current-law.html,WASHINGTON Aug 1The Carter Administration has ruled that existing legislation barring Federal funds for abortions makes no exceptions for victims of rape or incest Many senators felt they had created such an exception last year by writing it into a conference report accompanying a compromise appropriations bill But the Administration ruled that the language of the bill itself was a clear prohibition not affected by language in the report In the bills language exceptions to the ban on Federal funding were permitted only where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term The House is scheduled to vote tomorrow night on the same provision in a new bill and an effort to reenact the same liberalizing conference report language was expected to follow Califano Requested Ruling Senator Birch Bayh Democrat of Indiana said last night that the Administrations rulingan opinion issued by Attorney General Griffin B Bellserved as a clear warning that Congress should spell out any intended exceptions in the bill itself He said it showed that Congressmen would be making a mistake they counted on the Administration to go by the more liberal language of any accompanying report Atorney General Bell made the ruling last Wednesday in an opinion requested partment of Health Education and Wel fare The House is scheduled to vote tomorrow night on whether to reenact the same strict ban providing Federal funds for an abortion only when the mothers life is in danger Last years law which expires Sept 30 has never been enforced because Federal Judge John F Dooling Jr issued an injunction against it 40 minutes after it went into effect The United States Supreme Court ordered the injunction vacated June 29 returning the case to Judge Dooling for reconsideration but Judge Dooling reinstituted his temporary restraining order on Thursday permitting the payments to continue For this reason the ruling will have no immediate effect except perhaps on Congressional voting on the new bill Legislators had been expected to try again to use conference report language fo provide abortion aid for rape and incest victims as well as for mothers whose lives were in danger But the Administration ruling said that last years exceptions to the ban written into a conference report accompanying a compromise appropriations bill were not valid because the language of the bill itself was a clear prohibition not affected by language in the report Mr Bell did not dismiss the report Ianeuaee as irrelevant though he did quote Supreme Court opinions emphasizing that the plain meaning of a statute could be sufficient guide to its interpretation But he held that the ambiguous language of the report could be as easily interpreted as merely saying that Medicaid funds could be used for treatment of rape or incest victims short of abortions He sad it would he improper to read the conference report in a way which disregards the language of the statute itself It is my opinion that the Hyde amendment prohibits except where the victims life is endangered the funding of abortions for victims of rape and incest but does not prohibit contemporaneous medical treatment of such victims which may prevent fertilization or implantation Mr Bell wrote Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois was the author of the amendment in last years bill and again this year The amendment had been only rarely enforced because it was being appealed through the courts The rules of construction are too well known to admit of much debate Mr Bell wrote When the House votes tomorrow it will be deciding between an absolute ban on Federal money for abortions and one j with an exception for the life of the mother After that vote the result of a HouseSenate conference that ended in disagree I ment the Senate will vote again on whether  to insist on its version of the ban This years Senate language not too strongly supported by senators in the conference specifies the rape or incest exception and adds another for cases in which an abortion is considered medically necessary If the Senate refuses to accept the House language another conference will have to be called The abortion issue is the only remaining disagreement blocking final passage of the 602 billion appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare for the fiscal year beginning Oct 1

The Limits of Loyal Dissent,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/02/archives/the-limits-of-loyal-dissent.html,The questions raised recently when some 25 Carter appointees met to protest the Presidents views on abortion are hardly limited to abortion To a country much torn in recent years by dissent and to a President who campaigned on a pledge for open government a far broader question is exposed how much internal dissent canAnd shouldan Administration tolerate The outcry arose after Mr Carters public comments opposing Federal payment for abortions for poor women and especially his assertion that many things in life are not fair The protesters won a twohour meeting with Presidential assistant Midge Costanza It may be followed by a memorandum to the President from the troubled officials President Carter could hardly have been pleased by such stirring but took no action to stop them He reportedly told his Cabinet that he was puzzled by the hostile reaction and was somewhat annoyed when the protest meeting attracted press attention He said he expected senior Cabinet officers to support his Administrations positions in public When Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Patricia Harris responded that she could not support his position against Federally financed abortions for the poor and would say so publicly if asked Mr Carter let the matter rest He neither forbade future protest meetings nor rebuked Miss Costanza for holding the first one As these events suggest the Administration has been put to a test of its campaign pledge of openness Despite Mr Carters unease he seems willing to have his officials speak up By so doing he and thedissenters aremaking  a healthy break with Washington practice Traditionally battles over Administration policy are fought before it is set The losers often leak their unhappiness anonymously to the press What is new and honorable about the abortion dissenters is that they are groping for a way to express themselves in a way that is open without being disloyal The issue here is one of importance not only to the dissenters and the President but the public as well The line between dissent and disloyalty is easy to draw for officials who oppose policies under their jurisdiction They are entitled to argue their case during policy debate once a decision is taken the President must demand their obedience or their resignation But what of officials who are not involved in administering a particular policy Must they invariably by goodthat is silent  soldiers Noand a President especially one like Mr Carter who has successfully drawn to government so many representatives of public interest and minority groups should be able to find room for dissent from his officials without risking his ability to govern Internal dissent would inevitably find its way into the press but so what That his officials could openly express their dis sent should be a source of pride not concern to the President of a truly open Administration Were not sure how much or this reasoning President Carter accepts but the signs are promising We mark it progress that Washington is now peopled with officials bold enough to express disagreement and a President who may be secure enough not to stifle it

CALIFANO THEN ACTS TO BAR AID Court in Brooklyn Rules After Determining That the Law Was Not Proved Vague,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/05/archives/federal-judge-lifts-order-requiring-us-to-pay-for-abortions.html,A Federal district judge in Brooklyn yesterday withdrew his order requiring Federal reimbursement for elective abortions for the poor and Joseph A Califano Jr Secretary of Health Education and Welfare acted immediately to ban all Federal subsidies for abortions except when a womans life was in daneer Judge John F Dooling vacated a temporary restraining order he had issued last week commenting that attorneys for proabortion groups had not shown that the Congressional act prohibiting funding of most abortions was vague and ambiguous The judge also said that the Supreme Court had redefined the fundamental issues in the case thus making it difficult for the question to be resolved in district court In Washington Mr Califano issued a statement declaring that his department would now provide funds for abortions only when the attending physicians had certified that the abortion was necessary because the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus was carried to term Most Paid by Medicaid Under the Califano ruling states will no longer receive Federal reimbursement for abortions for the poor in cases where the womans life is not found to be in danger Nearly all of such reimbursements for the estimated 250000 to 300000 federally funded abortions last year Were Paid under Medicaid While Judge Doolings action dealt with the remaining eight weeks of the current fiscal year the Senate refused again last night to apply a similarly restrictive ban to Federal spending for the fiscal year beginning Oct 1 [Page 9] By a 59to34 vote the Senate refused to go along with a House decision to permit Medicaid abortions for poor women only when the life of the mother was endangered The Senate held firm to its position that makes further exemptions in cases of rape or incest and the much broader exception of medical necessity The Dooling decision is not expected to have much impact in New York State Carmen Shang acting commissioner of the Department of Social Services said yesterday that the state would continue to reimburse hospitals and doctors while it continues to follow the court actions and the HEW actions However he said it was too early to tell what action the state would take if the Federal Government and the courts should over the long run decide to maintain the ban on abortion funding Carey Opposes Action Governor Carey told reporters recently that although he was personally opposed to abortion he was against denying state funds to poor women since limiting abortion only to those who could afford would constitute discrimination and force the poor into the hands of the alley practitioners The current legal battle began last fall when Congress passed an amendment htraduced by Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois to the Health Education and Welfare Departments appropriation bill The amendment prohibited the Department from using Federal funds for abortions unless womans life was in danger The ban was never enforced because Judge Dooling issued an order against it on the day it became effective The Supreme Court vacated the injunction on June 29 nine days after it ruled that states could deny Medicaid funds for abortions The high court returned the case to Judge Dooling for reconsideration Despite the high courts ruling Judge Dooling issued another temporary restraining order against the ban last Thursday It was this order he vacated yesterday Since the amendment against abortions is tied to an appropriation bill it must be renewed every year by Congress The House and Senate have passed different versions of an abortion ban The House proposal is the more stringent of the two Under an opinion issued earlier this week by Attorney General Griffin B Bell the existing legislation bans reimbursement for all abortions even in cases of rpe aand incest Mr Califano repeated this ban in his statement which was sent all state Medicaid agencies HEW regional offices United States Public Health Service hospitals and state medical societies However he noted that Federal funds could be allowed for certain medical procedures used for the treatment of rape and incest including the use of drugs or devices to prevent the implantation of the fertilized ovum Daniel Marcus the departments Deputy General Counsel said last night that in effect this meant that the law did not ban funding for surgical operations similar to abortions performed in rape or incest cases as long as these took

FEDERAL JUDGE LIFTS ORDER REQUIRING U.S. TO PAY FOR ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/05/archives/new-jersey-pages-federal-judge-lifts-order-requiring-us-to-pay-for.html,A Federal district judge in Brooklyn yesterday withdrew his order requiring Fedreal reimbursement for elective abortions for the poor and Joseph A Califano Jr Secretary of Health Education and Welfare acted immediately to ban all Federal subsidies for abortions except when a wbmans life was in danger Judge John F Dooling vacated a temporary restraining order he had issued last week ruling that attorneys for proabortion groups had not shown that the Congressional act prohibiting funding of most abortions was vague and ambiguous The judge also said that the Supreme Court had redefined the fundamental issues in the case thus making it difficult for the question to be resolved in district court In Washington Mr Califano issued a statement declaring that his department would now provide funds for abortions only when the attending physicians had certified that the abortion was necessary because the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus was carried to term Most Paid by Medicaid Under the Califano ruling states will no longer receive Federal reimbursement for abortions for the poor 41 cases where the womans life is not found to be in danger Nearly all of such \ reimbursements for the estimated 250000 to 300000 federally funded abortions last year were paid under Medicaid While Judge Doolings action dealt With the remaining eight weeks of the current fiscal year the Senate refused again last night to apply a similarly restrictive ban to Federal spending for the fiscal year beginning Oct I [Page 9] By a 59to34 vote the Senate refused to go along with a House decision to permit Medicaid abortions for poor women only when the life of the mother was endangered The Senate held firm to its position that makes further exemptions in cases of rape or incest and the much broader exception of medical necessity The Dooling decision is not expected to have much impact in New York State Carmen Shang acting commissioner of the Department of Social Services said yesterday that the state would continue to reimburse hospitals and doctors while it continues to follow the court actions and the HEW actions However he said it was too early to tell what action the state wguld take the Federal Government and the courts should over the long run decide to maintain the ban on abortion funding Carey Opposes Action Governor Carey told reporters recently that although he was personally opposed to abortion he was against denying state funds to poor women since limiting abortion only to those who could afford would constitute disdrimination and force the poor into  the hands of the alley practitioners The current legal battle began last fall when Congress passed an amendment hitroduced by Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois to the Health Education and Welfare Departments appropriation bill The amendment prohibited the Department from using Federal funds for abortions unless womans life was in danger The ban was never enforced because Judge Dooling issued an order against on the day it was passed The Supreme Court vacated the injunction on June 29 nine days after it ruled that states could deny Medicaid funds for abortions The abortions The high court returned the case to Judge Dooling for reconsideration Despite the high courts ruling Judge Dooling issued another temporary restraining order against the ban last Thursday It was this order he vacated yesterday Since the amendment against abortions is tied to an appropriation bill it must be renewed every year by Congress The House and Senate have passed different versions of an abortion ban The House proposal is the more stringent of the two Under an opinion issued earlier this week by Attorney General Griffin B Bell the existing legislation bans reimbursement for all abortions even in cases of rpe aand incest Mr Califano repeated this ban in his statement which was sent all state Medicaid agencies HEW regional offices United States Public Health Service hospitals and state medical societies However he noted that Federal funds could be allowed for certain medical procedures used for the treatment of rape and incest including the use of drugs or devices to prevent the implantation of the fertilized ovum Daniel Marcus the departments Deputy General Counsel said last night that in effect this meant that the law did not ban funding for surgical operations similar to abortions performed in rape or incest cases as long as these took place soon after the rape or incest and before pregnancy was established Judge Dooling agreed to hear further arguments from the proabortion groups that brought the case including Planned Parenthood Inc the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights However there was no indication that the judge would reverse yesterdays decision In the arguments in court the judge said that he saw no alternative to relying on an individual doctors judgment as to whether a womans life was in danger In court the attorney for HEW Edward S Rudofsky said that HEW would accept a doctors certification of the need for an abortion at face value
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/06/archives/letters.html,Of Abortion Medicaid and Carters Stand To the Editor Many of us were unprepared for President Carters coldly offhand comment that life is unfair when discussing his support for the Supreme Courts action on Medicaid funds for abortion As a doctor I find it outrageous to be forced to check the patients pocketbook before advising her on what is best for her within her and my conscience The Medicaid patient may be referred without hindrance for openheart surgery or organ transplant or any other procedure that is in the patients best interest regardless of cost But if that procedure happens to be an abortion then moral considerations come into play for the poor but not for the rich The Supreme Court in 1973 said that a woman is in charge of her own body To support a position now that says the Government will not pay for means to safeguard that control of her body if she is poor is not just unfair it is in President Carter would not deny the poor any other type of medical or surgical treatment To deny them abortion is to allow the morality of a few to supersede the overriding constitutional principle of privacy I must believe that on reflection he will recoil from denying the frightened 14earold ghetto child or the poor rural mother with too many children the choice of terminating an unwanted or even dreaded pregnancy JAMES S BERNSTEIN MD Rockville Centre LI July 30 1977  To the Editor After Frederick S Jaffe read his prominently displayed letter in The Times of July 29 in which he avers that Mr Carter on the subject of Medicaid and abortions calls for a public policy that imposes the moral views of a minority on the majority I wonder if he noticed that on page 1 a New York TimesCBS poll reported 55 percent of those polled were in agreement with the Presidents position against financing of abortions while 38 percent favored such support DANIEL V DUFF Garden City L I July 29 1977  To the Editor Now that we know Public Likes Carter  news story July 29 that The Entrepreneurs To the Editor I read with regret about the recommendation of the New York Board of Regents that doctors and other professionals be allowed to advertise in the press and on television My father who was first a physician and then a dental surgeon spent a great amount of energy during his early years  to eradicate the dental parlors in New York and also eventually the advertising which enabled these places to exist We seem to be marching backward in time demanding increased professional standards on the one hand requiring physicians to police each other and on the other hand permitting some among us to optimize their talents as entrepreneurs rather than physicians Toms River NJ July 29 1977 Omen of the End of Western Civilization To the Editor Sufficiently removed in time now from the first impact of the New York blackout we can pause to reflect on its historical significance Civilized man is loath to accept the endurance of barbarism among the core people of society If we define the barbarian as one who wants something for nothing then the gutting of New York becomes understandable Historians have long been aware of Clios Catch 22 Can any civilization endure unless it shares its culture with its internal barbarians The historical answer is no Can any civilization endure if it does share its culture with the internal barbarians who invariably corrupt it repudiating what they cannot tolerate or absorb from an alien mind set Again the answer is no The problem then is how much acculturation can occur to assimilate internal barbarians into the culture of our civilization and how rapidly this can take place in a dynamic rather than static society while at the same time warding off threats from the external barbarians eg the Russians Have we the capacity to present our version of culture however altered from its European origins in such a manner as to render it attractive to the latest generation in a long series of internal barbarians And will they in turn be willing to adopt it without mangling distorting and corroding it beyond recognition The double negative to historys most challenging questions seems to indicate not Whenever a civilization has been attacked in conjunction by both internal and external barbarians it has shattered while giving birth dialectically to a more reactionary restricted culture and environment Predictably however symbolically the New York blackout along with other signs presages the end of Western civilization and the beginning of the Black Ages SIDNEY HALPERN Philadelphia July 29 1977 To Store Oxygen Tanks To the Editor Julius Raskins recent letter suggesting portable oxygen tanks be carried in all police cars ignores several real hazards that would be created First of all oxygen is potentially combustible and must be stored and secured properly This would be difficult in a police car that has multiple uses including transport of criminal suspects in its cramped interior In addition the tanks would have to be checked on each tour every day to insure they contain the proper level of oxygen This is an additional burden for the police Last but not least there is the danger of theft especially if oneman patrol cars are increased There are other liabilities as well I would suggest oxygen tanks together with other firstaid supplies be stored in strategically located public buildings with the proper staff and physical facilities such as schools and libraries More important however would be to encourage widespread training in resuscitation as is done in Seattle and other cities I am afraid the solution is more complicated than Mr Raskin realizes HERBERT FREILICH MD Brooklyn July 28 1977 On Enhancing a Bomb To the Editor Donald G Brennan of the Hudson Institute [letter July 271 says that the neutron bomb puts out less neutrons fallout everything than an ordinary nuclear weapon If that is so why does he call it the enhanced radiation ER warhead What is enhanced about it Compassion The right to live STEWART MEACHAM Philadelphia July 27 1977 55 percent of all persons polled over the telephone have said that they are in agreement with the Presidents position against the financing of abortions we would be grateful to the takers of the polls if they would tell us what percentage of destitute andor semiliterate women have telephones in their homes assuming they do have something to which they on refer as home IVAN BRYCHTA Lancaster Pa July 29 1977 Shadows on the Park To the Editor As important in preserving Central Park as preventing physical encroachments on the park is the prevention of encroachments on its light The construction now in progress a 33story behemoth on 61st Street and Fifth Avenue points out this threat The increasing canyonization of the lower end of the Central Park reduces substantially the number of hours each day that parts of the park are in direct sunlight reducing hours the park can be enjoyed The prevention of the construction of any more lightblocking buildings bordering the park would be a worthwhile contribution to its future and would help to preserve the neighborhoods adjoining the park JOHN C MICHAELSON New York July 29 1977 Con Ed Alternative Tc the Editor Oh no Now some politicians are crying for a public takeover of Consolidated Edison The catch is it wont be the public that will take over the bungling utility but the same wonderful folks that gave us welfare scandals civic bankruptcy corruption and potholes and made New York an international symbol for massive urban mismanagement Imagine what they could do to and with Con Ed Lets not trade one set of incompetents for another set of greater incom petents D A C McGILL New York July 31 1977 To the Editor The recent abortion controversy has led to an oftenstated sentiment Any woman rich or poor who doesnt want to have a child has ample means of prevention these days and any woman who allows herself to get pregnant and doesnt want that child should be forced to go through with the pregnancy There is some truth in the first part of this statement Yes there are a number of means of contraception available today But each of our modern means of contraception has failures  even birthcontrol pills when taken exactly on schedule About three women out of every 1000 who take pills without error for a year become pregnant The failure rates for perfect users of all other methods of birth control are even higher with the exception of male or female sterilization But some failures do occur after sterilization There is no perfect method of birth control There simply is no perfect method After working fulltime in family planning for 11 years I have learned that one sentence best characterizes unplanned pregnancies Infinite are the pathways to contraceptive failure It is perfectly clear to me that voluntary abortion must remain available to all couples in our society and throughout the world if unwanted deliveries are to be avoided The exclusion of abortion from Medicaid coverage is discriminatory to the poor and a disgrace to our society ROBERT A HATCHER MD Atlanta July 27 1977 Loaded Reporting To the Editor I read and listened in disbelief and horror as newspapers and radio and television relentlessly played up the anniversary of the first Son of Sam murder Responsible newsmen manufactured a news story from the rewrite of yesterdays tragedies and then described new tragedies that might occur to mark such an ominous date in headline history They have their perfect followup story in todays double shooting Isnt it possible that the kind of loaded reporting the media have indulged in this past weekend might trigger a deranged killer who must exult in the news coverage hes already received If so couldnt the relentless reporters be considered accessories to these latest headlines Giving odds or running box scores on murder seems a conscienceless thing to do and very stupid JANE FENNELLY DETMOLD Stonington Conn July 31 1977 Adviser Ronan To the Editor Dr William R Ronans rebuttal [July 29J of a recent inquiry into the Port Authoritys expenditures was the choicest satire in The Times in some weeks I doubt that William Safire or Russell Baker could have improved on such Ronanisms as To compare a Port Authority commissioner with a Federal employee or a state employee is simply not appropriate   commissioners should be equated more with Cabinetlevel United States Government personnel than with employees    equation with corporate board chairmen is more appropriate Have we had in recent memory a comparable example of hubris One remembers a line from an Offenbach operetta What a silly thing it Is when functionaries give themselves the airs of ministers Dr Ronan may be pained to hear it but he is only an adviser to an agency that has authority over a port and owns real estate It is a responsible position but one many levels below corporate board chairmen His Cabinet equation is hysterically funny One wishes that the time energy and wit that Dr Ronan expended on his rebuttal had been applied to the Concorde ROBERT MOTTLEY New York July 29 1977
High‐Court Silence,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/06/archives/highcourt-silence.html,Back in the days before John Marshall each Justice of the United States Supreme Court expressed his individual opinion in each case following the English practice the tradition was abandoned in part because Chief Justice Marshall felt that it defeated the great purpose of lawto enunciate clear and abiding principles Although no one would dream of requesting or demanding reinstatement of that abandoned practice given the heavy caseload of the present Court the great silence that results when some Justices merely add their names to a document portentously called The Opinion of the Court has had some puzzling consequences Since the Burger Court is in reality three courtsa conservativeactivist duo consisting of the Chief Justice Warren E Burger and Justice William H Rehnquist a liberalactivist grouping of Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J Brennan Jr and an intellectually diffuse some say Incoherent group of five mediating between the activistsit becomes particularly distressing when some vital decisions depend upon the silence of the silent majority Take the famousor depending on how you look at it infamous or notorious  abortion decisions of June 20 The Courts majority speaking through Justice Lewis F Powell Jr found that governmental financial limitations on Medicaid payments for elective abortions did not unduly and unconstitutionally burden a womans fundamental right to choose whether or not to bear a child also it was found no such undue burden existed when public hospitals refused to permit abortions In one of the cases Chief Justice Burger wrote a concurring opinion that was brief and added nothing to Justice Powells views Justices Brennan Marshall and Harry A Blackmun the author of the original 1973 landmark decision holding abortion to be a womans fundamental right dissented in separate opinions they also concurred in each others dissents The remaining four Justices were totally silent thus presumably indicating that they accepted Justice Powells analysis of just what kind of restrictions on elective abortions amounted to burdensome ones OK fairor unfafirenough Yet less than two weeks before the June 20 bombshells Justice Brennan wrote the Courts opinion for a 72 majority in a major New York contraceptive case in a manner that was completely at odds with Justice Powells later opinion The portion of Justice Brennans opinion striking down a pro vision of New Yorks law limiting distribution of all contraceptive deyices to registered pharmacists received the silent support of five confreres including Justices John Paul Stevens Byron R White and Potter Stewart Justice Brennan in retrospect ironically relied on a string of previous highcourt rulings in abortion cases to find that restrictions on the distribution of contraceptives clearly burden the freedom to make [fundamental] decisions and applied the same test to contraception as he believed had been previously applied to abortionhe reasoned that the regulation did substantially limit  access to the means of effectuating that decision Despite the general availability and distribution of licensed pharmacists throughout the state more of them than either doctors willing to perform abortions or public hospitals with abortion facilities it might be thought Justice Brennan found the limitation to he too restrictive and too burdensome It should be noted that Justice Powell wrote a concurring opinion which explicitly forecast the direction of his thought two weeks later however five brethren agreed not with Justice Powells but with Justice Brennans formulation of the issue as well as its application to the facts of the case Three of the five inexplicably changed their minds between June and June 20 Since the Burger Court in general writes fewer opinions than did its predecessor since the great burden of opinion writing falls upon the four Justices who constitute the opposed activist wings of the Court they write the vast bulk of majority concurring or dissenting opinions in almost every major case since few members of the public seem to understand just what animates the remaining Justices and since apart from considerations of merit and validity a certain amount of contradiction seems to have set in perhaps the Court should voluntarily return to individual opinions While this may be burdensome it certainly cannot be any more confusing than what happened this June It would be nice to hear just what the silent majority has to say about both the apparent contradictions and about the merits of some vital issues Isidore Silver is professor of constitutional law and history at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice of The City University of New York

The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/07/archives/the-nation-in-summary-the-energy-plan-he-got-what-he-wanted-mostly.html,There was much solemn nodding of agreement 3 months ago when President Carter invoked the moral equivalent of war in presenting his energy program to Congress Winning public support and by the deadline of Congressional recess meant steering the plan through the shoals of yawning apathy and hard opposition Two previous Administrations had foundered the Senate remains a serious obstacle But last week despite some earlier errors in political maneuvering the energy program was adopted by the support and by the deadline of ConHouse largely intact It passed by 244 to 177 the Presidents package or measures to reduce consumption and created a new Department of Energy The package was approved by the House of Representatives in essentially the form that the President recommended except for the omission of a 50centspergallon tax on gasoline Provisions to tax gas guzzlers and encourage industrial conversion to coal burning passed easily but the Administration had a much more difficult time persuading the legislators to approve an extension of natural gas price regulation A coalition of Republicans and oilstate Democrats urged the House to deregulate gas arguing that lifting the price ceilings would encourage producers to find more reserves The Administration insisted however that little new gas was left to be discovcred and that deregulating prices would only cause consumers to pay ore The Administration backed its arguments with heavy lobbying  the President even offered a Republican legislators daughter a visit with Amy in her tree house  and strategic maneuvers It had compromised in the Ad Hoc Energy committee to allow more gas to qualify for relatively high prices thereby enlisting the support of key Texas Representatives And it persuaded the Rules Committee to allow only one floor vote on the deregulation issue When it came the Administration won 227 to 199 The full House killed the fourcentagallon gasoline tax that the Energy Committee wanted and that the Carter Administration had reluctantly agreed to A similar proposal for a five cent tax also died Either tax would have provided funds for public transportation and energy research The President preferred a larger tax linked to consumption levels that would have been rebated Mr Carter also had the satisfaction of signing into law the Cabinetlevel department that he proposed to oversee the energy plan when it emerges from Congress One element was missing Congress decided to empower an independent commission rather than the Energy Secretary to set natural gas prices The Senate did however move promptly to confirm Mr Carters choice to fill the post Presidential energy adviser James R Schlesinger The Energy Committee approved him unanimously without debate within an hour of his formal nomination and he was sworn in shortly after the full Senate concurred The President had one other important piece of legislation to sign a bill to regulate the environmental consequences of strip mining as the nations coal production expands See Page 18 Upping Ante For Welfare President Carter delaying no longer last week submitted his welfarereform package essentially it reflects a concession to political and social realities For months the dollarminded Mr Carter had insisted he would not accept any reform that might add to overall welfare costs and possibly undermine his pledge of a balanced Federal budget by 1981 In effect he now acknowledged he could not stick to his original plankeep welfare costs from rising as well as satisfy the liberalurban coalition that is the natural constituency of a Democratic President Thus Mr Carter proposed welfare and job programs totalling 307 billion or 28 billion more than the current level The President also yielded to the wishes of many governors and bigcity mayorsthough perhaps not as much as they wantedby altering Federal formulas to guarantee a 10 percent reduction in state welfare costs The Presidents proposals were not quite the complete and clean break with the past that he perceived Some programs are Merely consolidated and a large bloc of welfare recipientsthe elderly the disabled parents with small childrenare largely unaffected But the underlying concept of the Carter plan differs significantly from policies that evolved piecemeal over decades It is what he had promised a program encouraging work and family unity The plan would consist of a twotiered system that give full benefits to those who cannot work and smaller benefitsin some cases nothingto those who can work For example fulltime jobs would be mandatory for the head of a household in a twoparent family single people and single parents with children over 6 To help find work 14 million publicservice jobs would be created And payments would be structured so that no one on welfare without work gets more money than someone with a job Guiding the program through Congress will be difficult Conservatives are likely to be unhappy with the extra costs some may feel his work requirements are not tough enough while many liberals probably Will think they are too tough In any case the plan is not due to go into effect for three years plenty of time for changes Second Try on Abortion Bill Representatives of the Senate and House will meet again in September trying for a second time to compromise their differences over a new abortion bill The House in its second vote on the issue last week banned Federal spending on all abortions except where the life of the mother is in danger The vote was 238 to 182 But the Senate by a vote of 59 to 34 again insisted on exceptions for rape incest andmuch more broadlycases where abortion is medically necessary as well The new SenateHouse conference is unlikely to grant all the Senates exceptions But the rape and incest provision might survive and that would be a step beyond list years abortion measure called the Hyde amendment which allowed an exception only in cases of danger to the mothers life The Hyde amendments ban applied to Medicaid spending for the current fiscal year which ends Sept 30 But it is being enforced only as of last week Judge John F Dooling in Brooklyn Federal District Court had issued an injunction against enforcement of the ban on constitutional grounds last week he withdrew it after considering as the United States Supreme Court had ordered him to the High Courts June ruling that states could deny Medicaid funds for abortions Vote Financing Maybe Next Year Legislation to provide public financing for Congressional elections was expected to have a hard time again this year but not quite so hard as it eventually encountered After a Senate filibUster last week the legislation is dead The Senate was considering a bill strongly supported by President Carter to give Democratic and Republican candidates as well as thirdparty or independent entries under certain con ditions up to 62 percent of their campaign costs in taxpayers dollars provided that the candidates accepted Federally imposed spending limits for campaigns in their states The bill applied only to general elections because members of Congress are reluctant to help finance primary challenges against themselves and was defeated on a similar ground by a coalition of Republicans and SoutheinDeinocmta Many of the latter hold their seats because their opponents are poorly financed and many of the former because they outspend their opposition But the main reason was old fashtoned political The Republicans united as they have on a number of issues this years and defeated a less solid Democratic majority Contributory factors included the diversion of Congressional energies for reform such as they are into consideration of a new ethics code and identification of the measure as a Presidential package of electionlaw changes The final straw for the Senate measure this time around was apparently resentment at Mr Carters pressure to have it passed A similar proposal was defeated in the House 18 months ago and and is dormant in that chamber now Never thelese supporters plan to press the matter in the next session

tally of 1500 responses from about 10000 received from his fivecounty South Jersey area he got the following results Sixtyeight percent are opposed to a constitutional amendment that would prohibit abortions In fact 75 percent of those responding from Cape May County said no to such an amendment A solid majority 56 percent believes that the United States should maintain complete control over the Panama Canal Thirtynine percent said they favored negotiating a new treaty with the Panamanians Fiftyeight percent want to extend naturalgas price controls to include gas that is produced and consumed in the same state At present only the gas piped from one state to another is subject to Federal price controls  If the constituents were against the big companies on the question of lifting price controls they were with them at least narrowly on another hot issue By a count of 49 percent to 46 percent the Congressmans constituents opposed legislation to keep major oil companies from expanding into other types of energy production such as coal mining solar or nuclear plants Five percent were undecided Only 14 Percent would rule out capital punishment altogether Seventynine percent said that capital punishment should be an option open to judges in cases of firstdegree murder 59 percent favored it in kidnapping cases 55 percent would permit it to be applied to skyjackers and 51 percent to rapists Representative Hughess district consists of Atlantic Cape May Cumberland and Salem Counties and substantial parts of Ocean County the states fastestgrowing county It includes extensive rural areas some manufacturing towns retirement communities resorts and the special hopes and problems of Atlantic City where the powersthatbe hope to see casino gambling reverse long years of economic decline Yet on such emotional issues as abortion Ocean County with its resort areas and fastgrowing communities had the same reaction as Atlantic County including Atlantic City In both counties 68 percent were against passing a constitutional amendment to prohibit abortions Mr Hughes now in his second term has been a consistent opponent of deregulating naturalgas prices Thus he was pleased that only 26 percent of his constituents favored lifting all Federal price controls on gas  The war of the outer continental shelf may be heating up again and New Jersey being a coastal state is part of this frontier struggle The big oil companies especially are girding to head off a new attempt by Congress to approve legislation overhauling the 24yearold laws governing offshore oil drilling and to open the field to more and smaller companies The major oil companies contend that the new regulations will actually create long delays in developing offshore resources and they look with alarm and suspicion on provisions that can give the Federal Government a major role not only in leasing but also in exploration Once again there is talk of Fogco the derogatory name dreamed up by those who fear that the Government wants to step in and compete with Exxon Texaco and Arco Fogco is short for a mythical Federal oil and gas company that presumably might make futures foggy for big oil companies The Federal Government denies such aspirations Representative Hughes is one of the chief cosponsors of the new offshore oildrilling bill approved in late July by the House Select Committee on the Outer Continental Shelf The Senate has passed similar legislation A year ago majorities in both houses appeared to favor such a measure but the threat of a veto by President Gerald R Ford stalled any such action This time Mr Hughes notes that the legislation has the full support of the Carter Administration but he worries that the oil companies will be fighting a tough delaying action He says that the new House committee action was a tremendous victory for the frontier states which are about to move into the offshore drilling era And he contends that the bill addresses every major concern ever expressed by coastal states dealing with safety and fair play The bill includes a 200 million oilspill liability fund to pay cleanup costs The small businessman whose livelihood is disrupted by an oil spill will not face a legal entanglement in order to recover damages Mr Hughes said What is more he added cleanup operations will not be detained until the spiller is identified and proven guilty Other major features of the offshore bill includes these provisions Greater participation by state and local governments in decisions on offshore drilling A change in the Federal method of awarding leases so as to give greater opportunities to smaller companies that would not first have to assemble a massive pool of capital An inventory of estimated oil and gas reserves to be conducted by the Interior Department in order to eliminate dependence on data from the oil companies Greater Government involvement in test drilling A prohibition against Interior Department regulators going to work for oil companies they regulated until two years after leaving Government service Mr Hughes sponsored amendments that provided for the Government inventory of reserves and for the twoyear ban on employment of Interior Department regulators However he was disappointed that another of his amendmentsone to provide additional revenuesharing for the stateswas not accepted Instead more modest allotment to the states was agreed on The big oil companies are opposed to most key provisions of the billexcept for the oilspill fundbecause as a Hughes staff member put it This is the worlds largest floating crap game and they dont want anybody else in 
THE MAKE‐BELIEVE WORLD OF TEEN‐AGE MATERNITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/07/archives/the-makebelieve-world-of-teenage-maternity-adolescent-mothersand.html,SAN FRANCISCO One night my parents were talking about someone her dad works with my dad  and they were saying how dumb she was ruining her life and all and she was even older than me She was 16 and I knew they were thinking My daughter she wouldnt ever do that I thought theyd kick me out of the house when they found out They didnt expect me to be that kind of person They wouldnt think I was bad or anything just stupid But all along I knew I was going to keep the baby It was mine all mine Not theirs or my brothers just mine And if they didnt ever really pay attention to me my baby would I knew he would He would love me and hold me and ask me questions and what I thought about stuff Besides I knew if I really tried hard I could take care of him all by myself even if they did kick me out At 14 Sara Springer has a 3monthold baby boy He has dark hair and he looks more like his mother than his father a highschool junior Sara met when she went on vacation last year with her parents then never saw again Sara and Jonathan live at home now and Mrs Springer takes care of the baby Sara is in the ninth grade but she is thinking of dropping out of school next year to get a job so she and Jonathan can he on our own The names in this case are not Sara and Jonathan and the names throughout are changed too In the months before the baby arrived Saras parents asked her often if shed thought any more about adoption and she always said no They said they thought itd he better all around but Sara said she didnt think so If I was going to do that she said I should have had an abortion I wasnt going to kick my baby out and have it live its whole life knowing its own mama didnt want it I wanted my baby More than one million adolescent girls get pregnant every year the Planned Parent hood Federation of America says Of these about 60 percent have babies About 600000 of these babies are born every year  21 percent of all births in the country  and their mothers range in age from 12 to 19 Some 94 percent do not give up their babies for adoption They decide instead to keep the infants even though about half are still unmarried by the time of birth Government statistics reveal that while the birthrate in the country has significantly declined in all other age groups it has remained constant among girls aged 14 to 17 and actually gone up a bit among those who are 14 years oId and younger It is Planned Parenthood said in a report on the subject an epidemic Everyone was popping up pregnant and so it was no big thing said 16yearold Carol Schaeffer who used to live in a vast middleclass area of western Los Angeles She is now sixmonths pregnant and staying at San Franciscos Florence Crittenton treatment center for single women who are pregnant or who have babies Youd leave to go on vacation and come back and it was all Soandsos pregnant Soandso had a baby Soandsos had an abrtion The only question was Whos next Then my turn came Its like I let it happen I never used any birth control I heard you can get cancer from the pill and I didnt like the other stuff and so when it happened I wasnt all that surprised My mother said I should get an abortion I said I didnt want to I didnt want to put my body through all that hardship She wasnt really pleased with my decision but shes accepted it now She told me I could come home after the baby was horn but she didnt want to see me with my stomach sticking out now I dont know about my father I havent heard from him He lives in Alaska Virtually all studies on teenage sexuality show that young women are far more active sexually now than ever before that they are more knowledgeable but not necessarily more concerned about birth control and far less scandalized by pregnancy than earlier generations The social dictum that good girls have to be virgins has largely disappeared and now the taboo against unwed mothers is also losing ground Just as it is becoming an acceptable proposition for a single woman in her 20s and 30s to have a baby his new attitude of permissiveness experts maintain is beginning to show up among teenagers anal their parents Significantly however psychiatric and medical experts are virtually unanimous in their observation that young mothers are ill prepared for parenthood All available information upholds this conclusion they say and shows that the girls economic and emotional situation is grim This holds true reportedly even for those girls who rush into unsound marriages Such marriages tend to break up quickly statistics show or at least he unstable and only inflict further hardship Experts often see a girls decision not to get married as a positive step because she wisely avoids another trap In those cases where the girl remains single the father rarely if ever contributes to the support of the child Usually whatever relationship there was prior to conception  often minimal  breaks down quickly under the pressure of pregnancy As to the girls themselves whether married or unmarried their motherhood leads them into total dependence on their families or the welfare system and ends up denying them a solid chance of finishing school getting at meaningful job or extricating themselves from a cycle of dependency and distress Their future prospects experts maintain are singularly bleak I dont know about my father Carol was saying I havent heard from him He lives in Alaska But the thing is youre in Ibis situation where you have to make a decision Thats what makes it difficult You have to decide between having an abortion or keeping it Some of your friends are happy about it or all jealous and some are worried How are you going to take care of it  and that brings a lot of confusion and heartache You dont know what to do You find yourself going in your room and crying saying Its already there I got to make some decision before its too late You feel so lonely and lost and you dont know what to do I was always thinking about it up until it was almost too late and then I finally decided to keep it I felt better after that and now its gotten so Im really close to my baby I feel it moving and sometimes I think Its just me and my baby Thats it Sometimes I also feel that nobody cares What did I get when I was back home Nothing but negativeness Its my mother I dont want to he like her Nobody knows it but she drinks a lot My fathers great He sends me letters They were divorced when I was 6 months old She works in an office and gets sick a lot My father wrote me that he sends her money for child support but there were lots of times when we didnt have any food Shed take us over to one of her friends right at dinner time so we could have something to eat The way I was raised and everything I didnt like it I went through my stages drugs running away and getting into this and that and a lot of it had to do with her I dont like to talk about it but there were times when she beat us with her fists When we were younger she used straps but it got so bad we had to learn how to protect ourselves and so when my mother hit me Id hit her back Im going to try to be a really good mother Carol said I find with the babies here in the daycare center I never beat any of them Im really nice to them Dr Adele D Hofmann director of the adolescent care unit at New York UniversityBellevue Medical Center maintains she has never seen a girl from a strong loving family actually have a baby Such a girl she said knows she has a meaningful role in life and she would either use birth control or get an abortion Many different factors contribute to making a 14or 15yearold decide to have a baby experts say The question of whether a girl comes from a relatively poor or wealthy background no longer seems to have much pertinence they point out The assumption that only the poor and black make up these statistics is unfounded today they say Instead the determining issues range from fundamental psychological considerations true of all adolescent girls  such as idealism and their nascent sense of femaleness  to sociological conditions These include the breakdown of the nuclear family and the widespread failure  or absence  of other rule models besides a parent to provide guidance through these of They feel helpless and hopeless Dr Hofmann said They have no real sense of community or home They have no sense of their role in life and they suspect nobody really cares about them In their floundering they turn to a baby as a source of identity That translates into instant adulthood an instant role and instant femininity She also points out that when a girl finds out she is pregnant this is almost certainly the first time she has ever been faced with a real decision What this ends up meaning she said is that its far more difficult to decide to have an abortion  to take the step to intercede  than simply to let the pregnancy continue and in effect do nothing What Planned Parenthood calls the epidemic of young girls having babies is according to Dr Hofmann and other experts but one of many symptoms showing up among teenagers in general that reflect massive societal changes Adolescence is a no mans land Dr Hofmann said Teenagers are hopeless pawns of fate They are the inheritors of the confusions and misdirections of the American dream which said among other things that each successive generation had to be better than the previous one But today in the middle class at least that has little validity anymore How are kids supposed to be better she asked They have all the prosperity other generations wanted Theyre grappling with new ways to create an identity and society is giving them little help Margaret Katrinsky lives at home with her mother and stepfather sisters brothers and stepbrothers She lives in one of those sprawling California cities that did not exist a few years ago but now spread for mile after mile pink and yellow stucco in among factories and warehouses manufacturing plants and gas stations The tracts go up and over the hills where once there were walnut groves and wild sheep Margaret says she likes it here but there isnt much to do Her father a foreman at an automobile plant lives someplace nearby She says Hes between marriages and he hasnt settled down again yet She herself has lived in eight different towns in northern California since she was born 15 years ago She wishes she were more mature because she knows there is a lot she cant do yet For example she knows shes not mature enough to get married She is however eightandahalf months pregnant Margaret has a heavy air of guilt about her She is very unhappy Her teachers maintain that she cant keep up with her work at school because she daydreams all the time She doesnt listen they say and she always seems to be in a world by herself Margaret says she is trying to figure things out My babys going to be hardest of all on my mom she said My mom has a lot to do and the last thing she really needs is a baby to take care of She was really upset with me because she thought I was too young to have a baby and she wanted me to do something with me life She always wanted me to he more than she was but I think if I try really hard this wont have to be the end I think I can still do something But I really did sort of want to get pregnant in a way she went on curling her long hair in her fingers as she sat on the school lawn She had a few pimples on her pretty face and she said shed stopped wearing a retainer on her teeth after she decided to keep her baby She had to try to grow up as quickly as possible she said and braces didnt make sense anymore I always wanted a baby she said I dont know why I just wanted it I guess For company Ive got a little brother but hes not mine Hes my mothers I wanted something of my own Among the key things in a girls decision to have a baby is not only her own expectations  or lack of them  but her mothers needs According to Dr Hofmann often no matter if the mother urges her daughter to have an abortion another subtler force is at work This is the mothers confusion about her own identity now that her daughter is growing up and she the mother is well into middle age and often without a husband or a strong home herself The mother sees her own youth and fertility disappearing Dr Hofmann said and if her daughter does have a baby this is a way fur her to hold on to her childrearing role It offers her a way not to resolve her own conflict Margaret Katrinsky went on talking about tier baby and the fantasies took over Her eyes lit up she looked lovely and young and fulfilled as if her very own perfect destiny really had her by the hand Im going to live at home for a while she was saying My babys going to be in the room with me because the house is crowded and all My mum may get divorced though and then the baby would have the room next to me As soon as I can Im going to get welfare to help out and after I graduate from high school Im going to get a job and save lots of money and then Ill get an apartment of my own just fur me and my baby I want us to be close she added as an afterthought so we can sit and talk about things and not be hushhush about everything the way me and my mom are She stopped talking and was quiet for a while Shed seen a flash of reality somewhere Right now though she said finally in a despondent tone I dont have a lot to give my baby really All I got I guess is love They have a myth about the perfect baby and another myth about the perfect mother said Roberta Cooper director of an alternative classroom for pregnant girls Another myth is that a babys total dependence on its mother means total love Mrs Cooper is in charge of a special program for 20 pregnant girls aged 14 to 18 in a densely populated suburban area outside San Francisco Whereas in the old days a teenager who was pregnant was forced to leave school in shame if nothing else nowadays more and more public schools are providing facilities designed to meet the particular needs of pregnant girls In Mrs Coopers program for example they congregate and study in one classroomgirls whose parents include teachers mechanics clerks salesmen and one doctor In addition to the regular subjects they are taught how to cook and handle babies and there are special discussion periods set aside for topics like how to handle stress and tension After the baby is born the girl can bring it to school Sometimes I think Im in a world of makebelieve Mrs Cooper continued as she looked out at a room of teenage girls in maternity clothes Everything has this air of unreality about it They have all these wishes one misplaced idea after another and then the baby is born and Im afraid it all comes crashing down One of the first things that happens she said is that in the family setting they often find they end up competing with their baby to get attention Emotionally its as if theyve been robbed again Said Ann Pinkness People always say to me Look at you youre nothing but a baby yourself Or Look at that babies making babies But I guess its true I really dont look my age Ann is 14 years old and her son Michael Mark is 11 months old She lives at home with her father and stepmother She talks holding Michael Mark asleep in her lap with his right hand curled around one of her fingers When I got pregnant my parents wanted me to have an abortion but Im an only child she said and its a lonely feeling when youre an only child I just said Well Im going to keep the baby because now Ill have somebody Ill feel close to instead of being lonely all the time My stepmother and I we get along soso My mother died when I was 7 and the way I see it the baby makes it two against two My stepmother was upset but my father he understood We sat down and talked about it and he said Well youre not a baby anymore I guess You have to make your own decision Daddys almost 70 now and hes not going to be here by your side all the time and neither is your stepmommy and so you know make up your own mind Even if you are only 13 youre not a baby anymore I didnt feel like a grownup yet but I said Im going to keep it I need somebody My stepmother wouldnt let me go outside to play and I was in the house all the time by myself I just didnt have anything to do or anyone to play with and I said to myself If I had a baby it would give me plenty to do and I wouldnt feel so bad The other girls I know they have brothers and sisters They do have something to look forward to and someone they know will always love them I havent got anybody to look after or love or to look after me I dont have anybody but my baby When I was small my mother she needed to put me up somewhere because she was an alcoholic and I guess I had fallen off the bed or something and she didnt notice After a while the neighbors called the police but no one wanted to take care of me My aunts and uncles said I wasnt their responsibility and my father was still an alcoholic then too and they said he couldnt have me until he got himself together So for a while I lived in foster homes It wasnt bad They treated me well and then I went to live with my father My mother had died Now hes an alcoholic again He says he cant face the responsibilities of life Me Im just trying to maintain Im not saying Im doing good with my baby she said as Michael Mark started to squirm and come awake Im just saying Im trying I know the worlds going to be hard for me she went on brushing the babys hair off his face with the palm of her hand but I want to go out there and see for myself I like everything about my baby she said looking at him Its just like another sun came into my life It just got brighter when he came Michael Mark started to cry and she picked him up in her arms and held him against her shoulder He looked very tiny Its all right she said to him Mommy sorry Mommy make it all better 
British Are Widening Debate About Sexual Mores,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/07/archives/british-are-widening-debate-about-sexual-mores.html,LONDON Aug 6A new ferment over issues involving sexual mores has emerged in Britain with conflicts developing between those who take permissive attitudes toward laws regulating sexual behavior and those demanding a tougher line Among other things London this summer has witnessed a blasphemy trial in which a homosexual editor was convicted for publishing a poem linking Jesus and homosexuality and there was an intensive effort in Parliament to tighten the lenient laws regulating abortions Public anger also has been stirred by an indecent assault case involving a 19yearold member of the Coldstream Guards Tom Holdsworth who was convicted in March of having attacked a 17yearold girl outside a nightclub ripping off her earrings and breaking her ribs He was sentenced to a threeyear term but an appeals panel overturned the verdict We have to bear in mind the sense of outrage to the public if we interfere with this sentence said Mr Justice Wien one of the panel members On the other hand we have a man of previous good chafacter whose army career could be completely destroyed A Sense of Outrage The judges freed the guardsman and there was indeed a public sense of outrage Women stormed into the court to protest Members of Parliament of all parties called the decision disgraceful the newspapers denounced the court and the victim of the assault Carol Maggs who had not been named in court spoke out She said she still suffered from migraine headaches and from depression and had little hope for the future Im afraid to think of marrying and raising a family she said How can you do that when you have this mistrust of all men which you cannot shake off Mr Holdsworth was discharged from the army a day or two later Ruth Hall leader of an organization called Women Against Rape said in an interview that Rape is something that men seem allowed to get away with while women suffer The underlying attitude in the courts she suggested was that women would be better off simply to submit Jack Ashley a Labor Member of Parliament cited figures that he said showed the odds in court were heavily stacked in favor of the rapist Of those found guilty of rape in 1975 Mr Ashley reported only 11 percent were sent to prison for more than five years and four were sentenced to less than six months The campaigners wish more judges would follow the example of Judge Alan KingHamilton who last month sentenced three teenage boys to long terms in detention The 72yearold judge also presided at the blasphemy trial in which Denis Lemon editor of a publication called Gay News was convicted last month Judge KingHamilton attacked this era of obscenity and added that by this verdict the pendulum of public opinion is beginning to swing back to a more healthy climate Mr Lemon was given a ninemonth suspended sentence and fined 850 in the nations first blasphemy trial in 56 years His offense was having published a poem by Prof James Kirkup The Love That Dares to Speak Its Name in his bimonthly tabloid which was also fined Professor Kirkup a wellknown poet novelist and playwright pictured in the poem a Roman centurion who became aroused upon seeing the body of Christ lowered from the cross The verdict was a great victory for Mary Whitehouse the antipornography crusader who brought the suit last December But others were not so pleased In its editorial for example The Times of London agreed that the poem was repugnant to many Christians But it noted that the longdiscussed blasphemy law was discriminatory protecting only the Church of England It argued that if blasphemy is to remain a crime adherents of the main nonChristian religions should also be entitled to its protection Those seven days in court said Mr Lemon who plans to appeal were like being in a time machine I couldnt believe that it was the 20th century Battle in Commons The fight over abortions which have traditionally been relatively easy to obtain in Britain took place not in the courts but in the House of Commons William Benyon a Conservative backbencher put forward a bill to tighten administrative procedures and to restrict abortions to the first 20 weeks of pregnancy rather than the first 28 as the present law does It was in a sense a symbolic fight According to one set of Government statistics only 1 per cent of all abortions in Britain in 1975 took place after the 20th week even though the law sets the limit at 28 weeks But the womens movement in the person of five Labor Party backbenchers all of them women was determined to permit no amendments to pass the house Because the leaders of the Commons were opposed to his amendment Mr Benyon had to fight through a complex committee process The women used a wide variety of parliamentary tacticsincluding filibusters with allusions to the story of Abraham and Isaacto delay In the end they succeeded in bottling up the bill long enough to prevent passage during this session But the antiabortionists many of whom saw the Benyon bill as only a first step toward further restrictions won a moral victory in getting it through the committee stage They almost did better a Governmentinspired compomise that would have set the cutoff date at 22 weeks nearly succeeded The prospect is that the fight will be resumed in the fall Members of Parliament have been bdried under an avalanche of letters from antiabortion constituents One rural Tory reported he received more than 1500 letters which is unheard of for Britain For Labor members with substantial Roman Catholic populations in their constituencies the issue may become particularly troublesome one as the next election draws closer
Abortion Aid Gets a Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/07/archives/connecticut-weekly-abortion-aid-gets-a-vote.html,ON THE evening of June 8 the 1977 session of the Connecticut General Assembly was officially adjourned and the states 187 legislators headed for the doors Most of us were pleased to see the final pounding of the gavel because meant that after more than five grueling months we could again devote some attention to our fulltime jobs and again spend some time with our families But this temporary tranquility was shattered by a call for a special session of the Legislature The call came from State Senator Betty Hudson and others who felt we had an obligation to return to the Capitol and vote favorably on legislation that would require the state to make funds available to women seeking abortions under government medicalassistance programs The petition effort for a special session failed A majority of the members of each house were unwilling to return for anything other than the constitutionally mandated trailer session of July 25 to act on bills vetoed by the Governor This means that the Legislature must make the question of providing medical assistance for elective abortions a priority issue when it reconvenes in February To leave the decision open to us the Congress must not close the door on this use of Medicaid money Although many legislators decry what they perceive to be the tendency of the courts to overstep their jurisdictions and dictate policy to the other branches of government no such outcry has been heard when it comes to the question of abortion With supporters of prochoice and prolife movements ready to fill the galleries and hallways of the Capitol the moment any question related to abortion comes up the traditional politics of crisis avoidance have dictated that the Legislature steer clear of the subject by leaning on prevailing court opinions On June 20 however the United States Supreme Court took away this crutch and forced my colleagues and me in the Connecticut Legislature and in state legislatures around the nation to look at a question of equality that is a direct spinoff of the abortion controversy On that day the Court ruled in related cases stemming from Connecticut and Pennsylvania that each state had right to determine if it would allow funds received under the Federal Medicaid program to be used for nontherapeutic abortions In its opinion the majority said When an issue involves policy choices as sensitive as those implicated by public funding of nontherapeutic abortions the appropriate forum for their resolution in democracy is the Legislature It is ironic that the Court should recommend the Legislature as the appropriate forum for resolving the question In Connecticut at least it is a question the Legislature has never touched The policy of preventing the Department of Social Services from making Medicaid funds available for elective abortions was first instituted by former Gov Thomas Meskill When Governor Grasso took office she reinstituted the policy until it was declared unconstitutional by a threejudge United States District Court panel in December 1975 The policy was held in abeyance while the state took an appeal to the United States Supreme Court which was one of the cases decided on June 20 After the Courts decision the Governor announced plans to return to the policy as of Aug 1 I do not consider myself an abortion advocate An abortion is an act that raises serious moral questions  That is why this country must allow women to avoid the dilemma of an unwanted child by improving public awareness of contraceptive methods and presenting realistic alternatives to those women who are carrying a child that they are not certain they can adequately care for Yet as The New Republic said in a recent editorial It is too facile to say that human life is always sacred obviously it is not and the social cost of preserving against the mothers will the lives of fetuses who are not yet selfconscious is simply too great This sentiment was expanded upon by Justice Thurgood Marshall in his dissenting opinion in the Pennsylvania case decided on June 20 Justice Marshall wrote that the majority opinion would brutally coerce poor women to bear children who society will scorn for every day of their lives   I am appalled at the ethical bankruptcy of those who preach a right to life that means under present social policies a bare existence in utter misery for so many poor women and children I do consider myself an advocate of equal rights It is for this reason that I cannot support the Governors policy to use the Supreme Court decision as grounds to deny again the use of medical assistance funds for elective abortions In 1973 the United states Supreme Court ruled in the case of Roe v Wade that in general the Government does not have a right to prevent a woman from terminating a pregnancy during the first six months The Court is now telling us that this right belongs only to those who can afford to exercise it Implicit in the Courts ruling is the fact that while rich women will continue to be able to afford safe abortions poor women in states where they are denied medical assistance will either have to give birth to children they are unable to provide for or risk injury or death in backroom operations It is as if the Berger Court based its decision on the cynical observation of Anatole France the author and Nobel Prize winner who once noted The law in its majestic equality forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges to beg in the streets and to steal bread During a press conference on July 12 President Carter was asked if he thought the Supreme Court decision concerning the use of Medicaid funds was fair one in view of the fact that it tends to discriminate against poor women Well the President responded there are many things in life that are not fair that wealthy people can afford and poor people cant The poor are often left to make do without many of the necessities and luxuries of life the rich are able to obtain easily because our Governments authority and ability to redistribute wealth is limited As a legislator however I see it as my responsibility to correct all unreasonable and unwarranted inequities and would place the limitations being imposed on the use of Medicaid funds in this category If the Legislature fails to exercise the authority granted to it by the highest court in the land to reverse the states policy in this area it will be condoning the type of double standard that is the source of growing social tension in our country today  I consider myself an advocate of equal rights Sanford Cloud Jr is serving his first term as a Democratic State Senator from Hartfords Second District
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/09/archives/letters.html,To the Editor The report on July 31 to the effect that the Carter Administration is considering withholding full Social Security benefits until age 68 presents a rather frightening prospect If the Census Bureau were to count all the people covered by individual pension plans and those not so covered I am sure it would find that the majority of the currently working population is not covered This means these people must rely on savings and Social Security to see them through the years from the time they are often made to retire early until the time they are entitled to full Social Security benefits As it is we all know that these benefits if one were to have to rely on them alone would mean living at poverty levels or below We are all also aware of the financial plight of the system After all those of us working have felt the constantly increasing taxes for this program What would happen to those of us who not yet eligible for Social Security yet taxed for it reach 65 or even 68 only to find that theres nothing there for us And what about those now working who are asked to take an early retirement in order to meet President Carters promise of a decrease in unemployment Even those people covered by private pension plans are penalized if they are forced to take an early retirement since they have fewer credits and therefore a reduced pension To couple that with an increased wait of even three years for full benefits is adding insult to injury It is obvious that Mrs Kreps when she opines that retirement age could be extended past 65 is tilting at windmills and hasnt listened to the Presidents various proposals to increase employment There must be some other way to raise the funds necessary to support Social Security It might not be a bad idea to rethink its structure and possibly use a graduated tax that would be higher for highlevel income as well as for those covered by private pensions YVONNE FREUND New York Aug 1 1977  To the Editor Commerce Secretary Juanita Kreps says if you were to not start Social Security benefits until age 68 you would reduce enormously the Social Security burden Why stop there It Social Security benefits would not start until age 85 you would probably have enough of a surplus to refund to me the huge chunk that is removed from my paycheck every week and let me make my own investments for my golden years WILLY SWITKES New York Aug 2 1977  To the Editor So the Secretary of Commerce Mrs Juanita Kreps and other top Administration officials are openly discussing delaying Social Security until age 68 in order to ease the financial strain on the system They blithely talk about this without acknowledging that such an action would constitute another massive breach of promise to pay by the United States Government a promise to pay that has survived intact for 30 years My generation has performed upon that promise and had every reason to believe that its successors also would Moreover typically we who will pay the real price for such an action are not even consulted Administrative convenience is the main criterion Mrs Kreps is well aware of the distinction between money costs and real costs and her position convinces me that she wishes the future beneficiaries of the Social Security system to pay the real costs so that Government officials may appear wise by solving the problem of money costs Once again a fiscal crisis would be solved by sleightofhand that makes the vast majority of citizens the shocb absorbers The insensitivity and crasswess that permitted Watergate has not disappeared It has been institutionalized ALBERT K STEIGERWALT Ann Arbor Mich July 31 1977 Of Abortion Birth Control and Divorce To the Editor Frederick S Jaffes July 29 letter purporting to establish that President Carters statement on abortion funding life is unfair was the exact antithesis of President Kennedys position on similar issues is misleading because the two Presidents were dealing with crucially dissimilar issues The propriety of birth control and divorce are not only different issues from that of abortion they are different kinds of issues While birth control and divorce need not violate anyones rights abortion arguably does if a human fetus is regarded as a living stage of a person That distinction makes abortion a proper subject for legal consideration Mr Jaffe contends that in a pluralistic society the only tenable policy on moral questions is to leave them to the individual conscience Although that is an admirable principle it cannot be extended to behavior that may justify legal sanctions because of the degree to which it adversely affects others The propriety of divorce birth control or excessive drinking presents in most situations only moral or religious issues Murder robbery and drunken driving however are not only morally offensive they violate the rights of others and should not be left to the individual conscience Not every act with consequences adverse to others should be made illegal Whether abortion should be illegalized or to the contrary statesubsidized depends in part on the gravity of its adverse effects Whatever their beliefs about the morality of abortion such public figures as Governors Carey and Brown and Senator Moynihan who are cited by Mr Jaffe as supporting abortion funding have probably concluded that the effects of abortion on the rights of others do not merit illegalization Whatever our religious beliefs we may surely be permitted to differ Mr Jaffe accuses Mr Carter of imposing his views on millions of welfare recipients with different moral views without describing the benefits that will accrue and to whom from his policy It would appear selfevident that for the child it is better to be born than to be killed in the womb For many of us whether a womans right to control her body should legally transcend the right of a child to be born remains agonizingly complex Mr Jaffes ad hominem letter sheds no light on that problem ROBERT D HUGHES New York Aug 1 1977 Moral Commitments To the Editor Mayor Beames recent comments about President Carter falling to keep his campaign promise of Federal relief for local welfare burdens seem naive Perhaps the Mayor has forgotten that in his last campaign he promised us 3000 additional policemen and no one is too upset about his failure to deliver on this promise We all realize that in these times of fiscal responsibility commitments are moral and need not be financial After all the only people who insist on financial commitments are bankers RAYMOND CARROLL New York July 27 1977 Carters Message To the Editor President Carter seems to be suffering from what is commonly known as the double message He seems to want to encourage feedback on his policies through for example his visits to small American towns Conversely when somebody criticizes his actions he says it is bad for morale I fear the next three years if this is how Mr Carter has learned to handle criticism JASON SCHWARTZMAN New York July 30 1977 The NBomb Will Create More Problems Than It Will Eliminate To the Editor As an informed layman mildly interested in the odds of my own survival over the next 50 or so years of my projected life span the development of the neutron bomb has put a slight psychological crimp in my plans Listening to the eminent persons discussing the pros and cons of such a device in these and other pages over the last month has provided little solace In cases like this I suppose the pen is not exactly mightier than the sword Defense matters transcend clichs After all nobody really condones the development of a device that brings Armageddon closer unless hes totally insane or very insecure about personal safety and security Perhaps that personal threat to security is warranted As a New York City resident trying to stay abreast of dtente I do not feel so threatened I more imagine a threat from terrorists who accidentally get their hands on an atomic device than a blitzkrieg from our friends the Russians Perhaps this is just layman naivetIm sure thats what the proponents of the atomic escalation through development of the Nbomb believe I however do not The neutron bomb will not only put our shaky position with the atomic powers on even more brittle terms but will through its eventual proliferation into the NATO forces in Europe as an eightinch artillery shell make the odds on one of those devices getting stolen much greater I was at one time of the opinion that we were a largely indestructible power However the oil crisis of three years ago has forced me to reconsider our vulnerability It seems that in our haste to protect ourselves against the most obvious most complete danger that of total nuclear war we have left open a vast area of pitfalls loopholes and unexpected cliffs The Nbomb makes terrorism into a The Times welcomes letters from readers Letters for publication must include the writers name address and telephone number Because of the large volume of mail received we regret that we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters game that far outpaces any threat to detente Because there is no accountability no place to strike back no possible alternative to the extortion threats of a terrorist with a neutron bomb than to comply we will become the slaves of our own technology As we have become addicted to cars and television as we have become intractably rooted in atomic defense so will we become trapped by our own inability to find more reasonable permanent solutions to the constant problem of guaranteeing our own survival The Nbomb will create more problems than it will eliminate Shouldnt that be the criterion by which we judge the usefulness of our elaborate weapons systems Dtente with Russia already exists it only has to be expanded Dtente with the other unpredictable forces around the world today is also something to consider It would be wise to remember when thinking defense that an enemy is anyone nor just any superpower who attacks JEFFREY BEERNew York Aug I 1977  Poison Gas Analogy To the Editor Dorit Noether opposes the neutron bomb letters July 27 by comparing it to poison gas gas is described as being impractical and since repudiateda curious statement since the impractical should have little need of repudiation As with the neutron bomb the chief offense of gas was its novelty Anti war forces and vested military interests united in a basically emotional opposition in spite of the fact that in World War I both death and serious disability were about onethird as likely to occur to gas casualties as to other casualties The popular view of gas was formed ironically because of the relative humaneness of gas serious gas casualties survived to lead fairly normal if circumscribed lives cough cough gassed in the war you know Equivalent nongas casualties could not excite similar awareness since they had either died on the spot or hung in baskets far removed from public sensibilities Current potential advances in warfare such as chemicals or the neutron bomb would require dispersed forces reducing casualties and generally lessening the need for large expensive ground forces These new types of warfare would probably reduce the chances of war beginning through calculation and would in any event favor the nonagressor since the chance of a stalemate would be high People like Noether believe that by opposing changes in the techniques of war that war itself is less likely to occur or will at least be less severe Unfortunately not only does history argue otherwise but generally the side with obsolescent technology witness the unfair longbow against the tra ditional knight is gravely handicapped as well THOMAS OFLAHERTY New York July 28 1977
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/10/archives/letters.html,New York Citys second blackout in 11 years has antitechnology elements of our society calling for a change in our way of life Our problem lies in our past not in our technology To the Editor U S power systems developed wherever large populations existed in this huge country System interconnections are affairs of convenience virtually unregulated Utilities are privately owned profitoriented operating for the purpose of selling as much electricity as possible to the largest concentrated market Formerly Consolidated Edisons location was the envy of the industry Now the tables are turned Peter Kihsss July 18 news article describes Con Eds distribution system so well that the readers should clearly understand its philosophy of operation While it is true that it has tried to give a sufficient and growing supply of electricity to New Yorkers it is also apparent that profit is its only motivation We are told that the standby reserves of power were inadequate because the gas turbine plants were too expensive to repair or operate Furthermore we are told that much of Consolidated Edisons power comes from outside the system because it is cheaper Then there is the matter of the circuit protection system which Consolidated Edison seems to have chosen to protect its equipment but not to prevent blackouts Because power can be produced cheaper outside the system Consolidated Edison will continue to buy power and once again the producers can shed their loads leaving Consolidated Edison at the mercy of an expensive standby system A model for a better system exists in Britains Central Electricity Generation Board The British have the good fortune from an electrical distribution point of view to have a small island with large concentrations of population thus permitting a national grid system to have developed naturally since 1930 Todays Central Electricity Generation Board has 137 power plants feeding into a massive ring main Blackouts are no threat to London or other English cities In the British system automatic reclosing devices and circuit breakers that automatically reclose after the surge is dissipated protect circuits from lightning damage Lights will flicker motors will falter but the power stays on These devices are enormously expensive but in order to protect the health and safety of the public it would seem that the Consolidated Edison system should be made comparable Exponents of our capitalistic freemarket concepts say Consolidated Edison acted in behalf of its stockholders in adhering to the profit motive by opting for a less expensive alternative but in the light of the human misery and suffering that temporary losses of electrical power bring New York Americans have a right to seek a better answer An integrated regional system under the firm control of a politically free authority could regulate and control the system Unfortunately this concept could now only be installed by political action As with other aspects of the good life today technology has not broken down Our political system is at fault Engineers and managers have not failed but it is the politicians who do not understand their responsibilities and duties to their constituents A E SNYDER Essex Conn Aug 2 1977 The writer is head of Snyder Associates international business development consultants  What the City Must Do To the Editor Now that the rhetoric of anger frustration and politics is simmering down there is a need to examine the range of action the city can take to avoid the recurrence of the disastrous consequences of electric blackouts and institute a corrective program as quickly as possible The catastrophic consequences of the blackout demand that this be a matter of highest priority There is no need for extensive studies to prove that Con Edisons system is neither technologically nor humanly infallible The welfare of the worlds center of activity must not depend upon the timeliness and accuracy with which Con Edisons controller twists the dials In the interest of economy and efficiency utilities have installed increasingly larger generators and now Con Edison is dependent on each of its power plants to provide a significant amount of its electrical supply A defect in the operation of any one of these generators causes operational problems A few years ago we were exposed to the ills of Big Allis Lately we have learned that the vaunted nuclear plants at Indian Point can produce a cheaper kilowatt but they have rarely been operable Con Edison must therefore rely heavily on the purchase of power from other utilities and in a pinch on obsolete plants and on gas turbine generators that are expensive to operate There is therefore a need for the development of supplemental and alternate sources of electricity in the city This can best be achieved by having all major building developments include their own electric generators whose hot water discharge would be used to provide needed heat The City Planning Commissions decision to permit Battery Park City to have its buildings heated by electricity from Con Edison should be reversed Instead the current appeal for Federal assistance should include plans for a generator that would both provide electricity and make use of the waste heat as proposed by President Carter The Convention Center must have its own generator Coop Citys facilities for an electric generator should be utilized These and many other similar sources of electricity would add to the total supply help conserve energy and provide some protection from total blackouts The city must reinstate a hot line with Con Edison and have an emergency plan to put into operation upon notice of an imminent brownout that may lead to blackouts The city must monitor Con Edisons available generating capacity and its programs of maintenance and improvement This cannot be left to Albany or Washington All that is needed as a basis for action has long been known There is no need to waste time in rhetoric MILTON MUSICUS Albany Aug 4 1977 The writer is former chairman of the Mayors Public Utilities Committee in New York City Before We Give More Arms to Seoul To the Editor Your Aug 2 editorial proposes to substitute one piece of bad decisionmaking for another in adding another 18 billion arms for Seoul To cut arms because of influencepeddling is unacceptable But giving Seoul arms just to substitute for our withdrawal is little better Are arms a sop or a need The probability is they will serve less to block invasion than to scare a basically weaker North Korea into getting those most modern powerful Soviet weapons which Moscow has so far not allowed her Seoul will then scream anew for our best Such buildup in an already armssodden peninsula without US tactical control over ROK forces means more danger less restraint Such course hardly opens a door for diplomacy to defuse [Korean] tensions Before we give arms we need a lot less SeoulPyongyangWashington mis perception of whether the arms are legitimate need or augmented threat Since Pyongyang will talk to us but not to Seoul we should talk to reinstitute the armscontrol provisions of the 1953 Armistice Agreement or reasonable substitutes therefor Provision must be made for Seoul to attend in some capacity as soon as possible But we must take responsibility for the agreement our generals not Seouls signed SeoulPyongyang talks are theoretically preferable Since they appear impossible WashingtonPyongyang talks are better than a third or fourth round of a mindless peninsular arms race Seoul must understand such talks will benefit her as our ally Pyongyang must understand that if no progress is made we will reconsider our troop withdrawal Adj Assoc Prof GREGORY HENDERSON Fletcher School Tufts University Medford Mass Aug 2 1977 Penny Message To the Editor One point important and unique to the lowly penny was not mentioned in your Aug 2 Editorial Notebook A Penny Saved A penny dug up thousands of years from now will tell a great deal about the people in the year the penny was minted It was a civilization that believed in one God In God We Trust It worked with metals copper It had a calendar an alphabet a number system It was a democracy Liberty with a leader Lincoln It had a coinage system One Cent It was made up of many small states that were able to live in harmony with one another and it was educated enough to use the ancient language of the Romans E Pluribus Unum It modeled its official buildings on the architecture of the ancient Greeks Perhaps some university thousands of years from now will have studies on an ancient civilization that existed in what was once the United States of America MARTHA SCHWARTZ New York Aug 2 1977 To Identify Handguns To the Editor Identification of handguns and rifles would be made easier if Federal and state legislation were enacted which required all manufacturers of guns to testfire each gun and microfilm the bullet markings which would then be sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for indexing and filing Guns which are already in the possession of licensed persons would be required to be testfired at the next renewal of license or permit ROLAND KAHAN Briarwood NY Al 2 1977 Jaworskis Rescue To the Editor As though to suggest we would be goners without him The Times while admitting he denied us aboveboard solutions as Watergate special prosecutor acclaimed Leon Jaworskis appointment as special counsel for the House Ethics Committees Korea investigation in an editorial July 22 felicitously captioned Jaworski to the Rescue In a pigs eye The only one he rescued was Nixon JACOB S HURWITZ Woodmere L L July 29 1977 Kent Compromise To the Editor Perhaps if the new gym at Kent State would be named in honor of the students killed the protestors would accept the building MOLLIE TARTER Tupper Lake NY Aug 2 1977 The House vs the Most Basic Human Right To the Editor The House of Representatives in the past has been called the Peoples House By its action this week in voting against abortion aid for victims of rape and incest it has lost its right to that great title When I was working on antirape legislation and the establishment of a rapeprevention center in the last Congress I had occasion to talk with several young women who had been victims of rape and who became pregnant I wish every member of the House who voted against this help would take the time to see what happens to these young people and what will happen to them and the babies they bear as a result of rape if they cannot afford abortions This is striking at the most basic human right Can it be that my former colleagues are willing to turn their backs on a few women who have no political punch in order to please a highly organized group Its my hope that the House will find a way to give these unfortunate violated young women another chance For those of us who love the dignity of all people this has been a terrible blow PETER A PEYSER Irvington NY Aug 3 1977 Of Peddlers and Taxes To the Editor Isnt it surprising that New York City and New York State authorities continue to ignore the salestax revenues they are losing when merchandise is purchased from streetcorner peddlers and weekend flea markets rather than legitimate retail establishments It is a situation that can be corrected with either more vigorous enforcement of present regulations or new legislation that will plug up the loophole BURTON K ADELMAN President M H

Minnesota Will Help Poor Get Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/11/archives/minnesota-will-help-poor-get-abortions.html,ST PAUL Aug 10 APThe Minnesota Department of Public Welfare said today that it would continue to reimburse welfare recipients for elective abortions The acting welfare commissioner Ed Dirkswager said that payments would continue to be made pending the outcome of several cases now before the Minnesota Supreme Court or further action by the Minnesota Legislature The United States Supreme Court recently held that states could determine whether elective abortions could be funded with state money Mr Dirkswager said it was the Welfare Departments position that current state law required payment for abortions On Aug 4 the United States Secretary of Health Education and Welfare Joseph A Califano Jr ended Federal Medicaid funding for about 300000 abortions sought annually by poor women
Primary Roundup,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/12/archives/primary-roundup-mrs-abzug-protests-the-cutoff-of-medicaid-in.html,A protest meeting against the cutoff of Medicaid money for abortions was joined yesterday by Bella S Abzug Mrs Abzug benefited from the protesters decision to hear in alphabetical order from the people who were sitting around a table in the office of Elwood Taub deputy regional director of the Department of Health Education and Welfare and got to speak early It is a bitter irony she said that although the Federal Government will no longer pay its share for abortion procedures it will continue to pay 90 percent toward the cost of a sterilization performed an a poor woman Mrs Abzug joined the meeting at regional headquarters 26 Federal Plaza as part of her day of campaigning for the Democratic nomination for Mayor of New York City The abortionsforthePoor question produced unanimity among the seven New York City candidates Three of themRepresentative Herman Badillo Representative Edward I Koch and Percy E Sutton Manhattan Borough Presidentsent messages of support according to sponsors of the protest The three othersMayor Beame Mario M Cuomo New York Secretary of State and Joel Harnettalso support the idea their spokesmen said For the most part is was a lackadaisical day for mayoral politicking Mr Beame canceled a Brooklyn rally to go to Police Headquarters for the jammed news conference about the Son of Sam case Mr Cuomo spent the whole day in private fundraising appeals Mr Sutton and other black politicians complained at a news conference about lack of news coverage of the campaign Mr Badillo and Mr Koch did some street campaigning Mr Harnett did a radio interview Reviving a theme from his 1969 campaign for the Democratic mayoral nomination Mr Badillo proposed to let each of the citys 59 community boards have discretion to determine how it will spend 10 percent of the budget allocated for each communitys own priorities He distributed the paper describing the proposal at the site of the former Womens House of Detention at Ninth Street and Greenwich Avenue a building he noted that was demolished after a long campaign by the local board Mr Badillo said when he declared for Mayor that a lot of the ideas he discussed four years ago had stood the test of time This appeared to be one of them it resembled proposals he had discussed at length in 1969 These boards must be the key to citizen participation in New Yorks government he said He charged that he Beanie administration has attempted to erode their power In both choice of sites for capital projects and as an expression of their priorities on the services their districts will receive from the city expense budget he said the boards powers diould be increased  A campaign to rouse black voters in support of Mr Sutton for Mayor and David N Dinkins for Borough President of Manhattan was pledged by the Rev Jesse L Jackson president of the Chicagobased PUSH a black selfhelp orgainization Mr Jackson said New York clergymen had told him at a conference in Atlanta that the media have tried to destroy Percy with indifference and make a nonentity out of Dave Dinkins He said that in the 1973 campaign Mr Sutton picked Abe Beanie up on his shoulders and walked him across this communityhe was speaking at a news conference at The New York Amsterdam News off 125th Street in Harlembut that in the current campaign the Jewish community has turned its back on Percy Sutton Mr Sutton said blacks all over town were asking him if he thought it was racist that he was getting so little coverage in his campaign If I answer that it is he said ruefully it will be said for the rest of the campaign that Percy Sutton is too sensitive to govern I am treated as Ralph Ellisons Invisible Man As to suggestions that running as the candidate of the black community might lead to antagonism he recalled that Mr Beame had campaigned to be the first Jewish Mayor Mr Sutton traveled later to a center for the elderly in Queens where he suggested that volunteers who help old people should be given city incometax deductions  In a position paper on budgeting Mr Koch called for zerobased calculations in which even ongoing programs and agencies would have to justify their continuation and he said the capital budget must aim at maintenance and repair rather than at new construction He also criticized the longstanding practicewhich is being phased out of diverting some annualexpense items into the capital budget  A plan to build the proposed convention center with 50 million from Albany 50 million from Washington and 84 million from the public sale of Industrial Development Corporation bonds was proposed by Mr Cuomo He said the state money could come from the bond issue that would be on the ballot as a referendum in November and the Washington money from a Title I grant While others only talked about building a convention center I developed a financing plan that will make the whole thing feasible Mr Cuomo said in a press release He said the receipt of the Federal money would be contingent upon the designation of the conventioncenter neighborhood as a redevelopment area and he blamed Mr Beame Mrs Abzug a former Representative and Mr Sutton in their official roles as Mayor the areas representative in Congress and as the Borough President for failure to have submitted a development plan and sought designation previously
Issue and Debate: Should the Media Accept Contraceptive Ads?,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/12/archives/issue-and-debateshould-the-media-accept-contraceptive-ads.html,The television commercial in slow motion shows a young married couple on a beach and embracing tenderly But it takes the copy to explain that what is being sold is a contraceptive device and not a shampoo or an automobile Reciting from the familiar passage of Ecclesiastes the voiceover actor reads To every thing there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven    a time to weep a time to laugh a time to mourn a time to dance The makers of Trojan condoms believe there is a time for children The right time When they are wanted And Trojans have helped people for over half a century safely practice responsible parenthood According to population authorities birth control advocates and many social welfare organizations the time has come to lift the restrictions that keep such advertisements off many television screens and radio microphones Increasing sexual activity among adolescents and a series of recent court decisions may force the issue The Supreme Court ruled last June that it is unconstitutional to prohibit advertising or display of any form of contraception The ruling does not appear to compel the media to accept the ads but it has certainly opened the door In the same decision the court also granted minors under the age of 16 the right to purchase contraceptives on their own In a separate decision the court deermined that neither the Constitution nor current Federal law requires states to allocate Medicaid funds for elective abortions a ruling that is expected to make abortion prohibitive for the lower socioeconomic groups and less accessible to teenagers As a result there are those who say that it is more crucial than ever to provide contraceptive information even as others contend that such information will only lead to increases in unwanted conception and invasion of privacy The Background The prohibition against advertising Overthecounter contraceptive devices through electronic media was not ordered by any Government agency but rather by a trade association the National Association of Broadcasters NAB and its Code Authority It is not practice to advertise prescription medications of any sort so the controversy does not involve the pill the diaphragm or the IUD According to Jerome Lansner vice president of the association and general manager of the Code Authority 65 percent of all commercial television stations and 36 percent of all radio stations abide by the code and contribute to its fiancial support But he speculated that many more may adhere to it without formal membership The point at which the NAB decided to ban the commercials is lost in time Mr Lansner said The issue didnt even arise until about five years ago and the two boards [there is a television code board and a radio code board] decided not to allow it It was a matter of taste the strong conflict of opinion in the public and the nature of the products themselves But pressure for change began to be applied by a variety of groups The Population Institute a private nonprofit agency for example has been agitating since 1971 It encouraged contraceptive manufacturers to band together in an informal task force and in 1975 published a report entitled The Right to Know The Need for Removal of Advertising Restrictions on Nonprescription Contraceptives As a result the NAB has begun to reconsider its policies although it it making decisions with what some consider painful slowness While efforts are aimed primarily at the electronic media the Population Institutes report also called on magazine and newspaper publishers to open their pages up to the advertising No statistics are available but magazines have tended to be more receptive to the ads especially those for contraceptive foams and creams A few newspapers are also said to have accepted ads Robert P Smith manager of advertising acceptability for The New York Times explained We dont accept advertising for contraception in any form We find it to be of questionable taste in a family newspaper Frank Ludwig who holds the same position at The Daily News said It might offend some portion of the readership Actually the few advertisements that have been made have generated relatively little adverse reaction where shown or played over noncode subscribing stations When KNTV a San Jose Calif ABC affiliate ran a Trojan ad two summers ago there was some flack and some phone calls saying it was disgusting Dawn Lawton an executive secretary there recalled We had the newscaster explain the situation to the audience and he asked viewers to write in and let us know if they wanted us to run it or not The mail for it was five times greater than that against Radio station WMCA here broadcast a Trojan spot last winter that was actually the sound track from the beach sceneThe phone calls ran 60 percent against 40 percent for and among the letters there were 15 negative and five positive Dennis R Israel vice president and general manager said At this point the NAB Code Authority is planning to conduct discussions with various organizations on how to formulate guidelines and designresearch programs for test market commercials But only when those guidelines are actually drawn up will the board decide whether or not to authorize test ads and only after research has been conducted on the impact of those ads will mass market commercials be considered As of now according to Mr Lansner no meetings have been scheduled The Arguments For As the Rev David Poindexter director of the Population Institutes communications center put it Why not use one of the most powerful sources for dissemination of information to get the word out Were withholding information because of some outmoded view of morality In the adolescent sector only we have roughly 400000 abortions a year And when 500000 adolescents a year keep their babies were sowing a wind that will return as a whirlwind What kind of a mother will a 15yearold girl make That whirlwind will visit us in our judicial systems in crime in the streets in mental hospitals in welfare systems he said Dr Sol Gordon director of the Institute for Family Research and Education at Syracuse University said Virtually all opposition to sex education of any kind is based on the assumption that if you tell kids about it theyll do it Research shows just the opposite to be true Asserting that teenagers are poorly informed about sex Dr Gordon said Less than 20 percent of parents are viewed as sex educators by their children And the schools offer little or no sex education Where can teenagers get information he asked The best place is the media and theres no one better suited to tackle the condom and foam than Madison Avenue If General Motors is willing to spend 100000 a minute then advertising must be cost effective The Arguments Against The hierarchy of the Roman Catholic church is strongly opposed to broadcasting commercials for contraceptives Last February Bishop James S Rausch then genral secretary of the United States Catholic Conference issued a policy statement that called the potential appearance of the ads a gross violation of the rights of parents to guide the moral and social development of their children It would be unrealistic unfair and unacceptable to burden concerned parents with the task of monitoring the home telvision screen for commrcial solicitations on behalf of contraceptives Dr Harry Hollis director of family and special moral concerns for the Christian Life Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention said By all means I support sex education but it is a very delicate matter in which timing relates to the particular needs of the individual child If contraceptives are advertised on television then children may receive information sooner than is conducive to their healthy understanding of sex The dissemination of information on contraception is also extremely important but we dont have to buy the idea that if its not on radio or television it wont get out he continued The information needs to come in the context of guidance a clinic say or the home rather than just being thrown out at children Morality in Media is a national citizens organization founded 12 years ago to combat pornography When it was polled by the Code Board it responded Such advertising would have the effect of encouraging and even promoting promiscuity among the young thus eating away at the moral fiber of our society The Outlook Nobody has any clear picture of what the future will bring The NAB hasnt even set a timetable for its own actions Robin Elliot director of public information for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America who helped write The Right to Know report said If there is no action soon the courts are giving us more and more reason to consider direct action through the judicial system itself
Abortion Cases Under Medicaid Reported Rising,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/13/archives/abortion-cases-under-medicaid-reported-rising.html,Several hospitals in major New Jersey cities have reported unmanageable increases in requests by Medicaid patients for abortions before Monday the stateimposed cutoff for further Medicaid payments for the procedure according to United Press International The surge of applicants has forced some hospitals including Martland Medical Center in Newark and Newark Beth Israel Medical Center to turn away Medicaid patients trying to schedule abortions Judge George Barlow of Federal District Court ruled last month in Trenton that the state could refuse to pay for abortions by Medicaid patients unless the womans health was in danger His ruling followed a June decision by the United States Supreme Court that although a woman has the right to an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy the Federal Constitution did not require that states pay for the procedures A spokesman for Beth Israel said the hospital began receiving about 25 requests a day for abortions after notices of Mondays deadline were included in Aug 1 welfare checks Patients Turned Away The hospital began turning away Medicaid patients seeking abortions last week after already scheduling as many abortions as possible for Monday the spokesman said A spokesman for Cooper Medical Center in Camden said that although hospital personnel had performed more abortions than usual this week they had not been forced to turn away any Medicaid patient who wanted an abortion She said operatingroom records showed an increase of about 3 perent in the number of abortions performed in recent days The heavy schedule of abortions will continue through Monday she said Norman Harris director of the Hudson Health Center in Jersey City said the demand there was not great perhaps because many women were not aware of the deadline At Greater Paterson General Hospital in Wayne a hospital spokesman reporte41 no noticeable change in the number of abortions being performed The hospital has never had a heavy schedule of abortions she said Other hospitals in Perth Amboy Plainfield and Rahway also reported no noticeable increase in the number of requests for lastminute Medicaid abortions
Lobbyists on Women's Rights Pressure Congress for Action,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/13/archives/lobbyists-on-womens-rights-pressure-congress-for-action.html,Special to The New York Times WASHINGTONThe advertisements say Youve come a long way baby but the way does not necessarily reach the summit of Capitol Hill More than 100 bills and resolutions which would affect women have been introduced in the 95th Congress ranging from Social Security to tax reform tom pregnancy disability to parttime employment Few however have come to a vote The lobbying efforts for many issues have been intensive but the techniques have varied Some womens groups have focused their efforts on the grass roots level and others have concentrated on their contacts on the Hill And although Congress recessed last week the lobbying continues The abortion issue is still the most controversial Attached to the bulky LaborHEW Appropriations Act Which involves 601 billion is an amendment to ban the use of Medicaid funds for abortion The House and donate versions of the bill would make different exceptions to the ban The House has agreed to the use of Medicaid to fund abortions when the mothers life is endangered The Senate also excepts cases of rape and incest and instances when abortions are considered medically necessary The differences between the versions must be ironed out in conference cornmittee before the bill is passed The divergence however has already stumped one conference committee and when Congress recessed last week for a monthlong period the bill was again referred to conference The issue has been subject to intensive lobbying efforts by many womens organizations The National Organization for Women whose 58000 members make it the largest feminist group in the country has made a strong effort to attract support for the prochoice movement which argues that to deny Medicaid funds for abortion denies only poor women their right to choose an abortion Theres nothing I can do said Nina L Heagstedt a NOW lobbyist Every member knows the pros and cons on the [abortion] issue She agreed with other prochoice lobbyists Many lobbyists say that the abortion issue is exaggerated that the significance of the issue has become exaggerated in the eyes of Washington legislators Karen Mulhausser a lobbyist with the National Abortion Rights Action League a coalition formed in 1969 to oppose the thenrestrictive abortion laws termed the controversy a political issue To the politician she said the antiabortion movement seems to be a great threat The House members are always up for reelection she said They see that two or three percentage points might make a difference in their next election fight she added explaining that these points could be the margin controlled by antiabortion forces A typical Representative believes that as long as he votes correctly on other issues she theorized his prochoice constituents will let this one slip through Citing last years election statistics she observed that nine of 13 House incumbents who opposed abortion were not reelected These figures she contended prove that the righttolife forces were weaker at the polls than legislators believed You dont know that when they meet you at the airport she observed The antiabortion movement has formed a strong grassroots organization which is the backbone of its success Judie A Brown public relations director for the National Right to Life Comrnititee an umbrella organization of many groups termed the committee a citizens lobby She said that the people in each state do all the lobbying by mail telegram and telephone She described the urgent form of pressurebuilding as a legislative alert which informs legislative contacts in each state of the fact that action is needed immediately Mrs Brown said that the groups will urge the House to stand firm adding that they were making an effort to stop discrimination against the poor William J Cox director of the National Committee for Human Life a group he said was funded by individual Catholic Bishops of the United States said It has taken some time to turn the movement around and to get it to project its influence on a national level Attention is now focused on the conference committee The righttolife groups intend just to continue as weve been said Dr Mildred F Jefferson a surgeon who is president of the National Right to Life Committee Groups Rope to Expand The prochoice groups hope to expand their political base with civil rights organizations to reassert their lobbying efforts in the corridors of the Capitol to organize greater constitur ent pressure on the House conferees and to organize what Carol A Werner legislative director of the National Abortion Rights Action League termed an intrahouse lobbying force to get Representatives to lobby on their behalf While many womens organizations have focused their lobbying efforts on the abortion issue they are supporting other major legislation and look forward to the fall when they may concentrate on less controversial issues The Pregnancy Disability Act which would prohibit discrimination on the basis of pregnancy would overturn the effects of a December Supreme Court ruling which termed pregnancy unique condition that employers are not obliged to treat as an insured disability The bill would require employers to cover pregnant workers under temporary disability and health insurance plans and would prohibit discrimination against pregnant women in all other aspects of pregnancy That bill is supported by lobbyists on both sides of the abortion oonflict According to Frederica W Wechsler political action coordinator for the National Womens Political Caucus lobbying efforts have been in the areas of information gathering alerting local and state members that the legislation is pending and organizing their constituents in mail and telephone campaigns to pressure their representatives in Congress Focus Is on Washington Womens Lobby is also supporting the bill In this and other issues they support they have concentrated their efforts in Washington We start in on the subcommittee level and start to talk to people said Carol Burris president of the organization Weve been doing this since 1970 so we know the cast of characters Similar lobbying tactics are being organized behind the displaced homemakers bill The bill would allocate funds to establish service centers for widowed or divorced spouses The center would provide counseling training and referral services for employment Mrs Wechsler believes that both the displaced homemakers bill and the Pregnancy Disability Act have the best chance of passage this session She is however less optimistic about the chances for other bills which the National Womens Political Caucus supports among them the parttime employment and flexible hours bills which would encourage the employment of workers on a parttime basis and would authorize Federal agencies to experiment with flexible work hours and compressed work schedules It is generally acknowledged that these bills would have the greatest impact on homemakers particularly those with young children and on the elderly However it just doesnt seem to be moving she said Its an idea whose time hasnt come Caucus Organized Fifteen of the 18 female members of the House have formed the Congresswomans Caucus in an effort to secure what amounts to equal status for the women of this country stated Representative Margaret M Heckler Massachusetts Republican and cochairman of the caucus Representative Elizabeth Holtzman the other leader and a Democrat of Brooklyn said that in the future the caucus will work to support legislation and to date it has concentrated its efforts to upgrade the status of women in the Federal agencies What may be the most important development for women lobbyists however has resulted from the success of the antiabortion movement which has proved the impact of a strong grassroots organization And both NOW and the National Womens Political Caucus have started to reorganize What we need asserted Ellen M McGovern of the latter organization is a skilled and informed constituency so that they can build the pressure at the polls
An Irish‐American Political Shibboleth Is Laid to Rest,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/13/archives/an-irishamerican-political-shibboleth-is-laid-to-rest.html,WASHINGTONBehind the disclosures that the United States plans to offer economic aid to Northern Ireland to help heal its political wounds is an even more monumental development a major shift in political philosophy by the leaders of a substantial segment of the United States electorate The last time that a major political shibboleth was laid to rest the services were held in a wellfocused spotlight of publicity That was when Senator John F Kennedy went in 1960 to Houston to tell a meeting of Protestant ministersand the nationthat Roman Catholic could too be an untrammeled President This time by comparison the moves carefully planned though they were seemed almost secretive as the four most popular and powerful IrishAmerican politicians gave decent burial to the notion that all members of their ethnic community somehow owed allegiance and support to the cause of Northern Irish freedom from Britain no matter how bloody the means Early in June after several months of joint and separate public declarations House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr and Senator Edward M Kennedy both of Massachusetts and Gov Hugh L Carey and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan both of New York assured Secretary of State Cyrus Vance that they fully supported the position of the Carter Administration on Northern Irelanda position that calls for choking off the flow of illegal arms to both Protestants and Catholics for a negotiated settlement and for complete neutrality on the terms of such a settlement The policy moreover is not only that of the Carter Administration it was analogous to the positions held by the British and Irish Governments Even more important the statements which began last St Patricks Day with a joint declaration denouncing terror by either side did not come because of pressure from the IrishAmerican community Rather the per suasion came largely from diplomatic moves originating in Dublin and to lesser but still vital extent in London and In Ulsters Catholic community In April Mr Carey for example said in Dublin that Irish Republican Army terrorists included assassins in May Mr Kennedy was confident enough to tell an Ireland Fund dinner in New York While the killing in Northern Ireland goes on let no American have it on his conscience that his efforts or his dollars helped to make the violence worse In recent years most students of politics have come to understand that only a tiny minority of the estimated 15 million IrishAmericans have any real emotional commitment to the Ulster struggle But for all their reputation for pugnacity and political sensitivity IrishAmerican politicians tend to be a fairly conservative lot Besides when the ProtestantCatholic fighting reerupted in Northern Ireland at the beginning of this decade the British were taking a hard and often brutal line not only with the IRA but with the Catholic minority in general Fearful of offending Irish America the way it had done in 1916 with the wave of executions that followed the Easter Rising Britain undertook to establish a policy that would defuse extremists on both sides in Ulster that would be acceptable to Dublin and that would help cut off supplies of arms and money to the IRA terrorists The moderate policy seemed to work In 1973 said one highly placed Republic of Ireland official not long ago Kennedy and his friends began to shut up Envoys such as Liam Cosgrave then Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Garret FitzGerald worked on the four IrishAmerican tribal chieftains all of whom are Catholic and Democrats So did John Hume the persuasive Ulster Catholic political and labor leader who preaches peace and reason from a dangerous Derry base The effect was a shift in ethnic political thinking about as momentous as any that has happened in recent memory There is a shrinking part of the IrishAmerican community that still purposes to paint Britain as the redcoat bully The old ones remember the Troubles and a land that never really was the young some of them crowd pseudoIrish pubs in American cities and try to remember all the words to Kevin Barry For most however the Irish issues are those of similar heritage groups abortion busing swollen welfare rolls crime and punishment and preservation of the Great American Automobile Nearly a century and a half away from the coffin ships the onceholy cause of a united Ireland seems in the words Derrymans sog gone up the long ladder and down the short rope
"Carey, Citing Court Action, Vetoes Bills to Restore Some Blue Laws",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/13/archives/carey-citing-court-action-vetoes-bills-to-restore-some-blue-laws.html,ALBANYAug 12Governor Carey citing constitutional questions and a possibly adverse effect on the states economy announced today his veto of the legislatures efforts to restore a partial ban on Sunday sales in New York State His action which had been expected allows the continuation of unrestricted retail sales seven days a week which have been permitted since the states highest court the Court of Appeals unanimously struck down in June 1976 the portion of the states blue laws dealing with Sunday sales The veto brought an immediate denunciation from the states Council of Retail Merchants whose executive director Gary J Perkinson called it bitter blow to the tens of thousands of retailers and retail employees The councilalong with the state AFLCIO and many other labor groups associated with the retail sales industryhad favored the measures largely because many members do not like schedules that include weekends The measures were favored strongly by several large food chains and by number of major retailers as well as by many members of the public In an effort to overcome the Court of Appeals objection that a gallimaufry of exceptions had obliterated the connection between the existing provision and the salutory purpose of the Sabbath laws and led to inconsistent enforcement each house of the Legislature developed its own approach to a new blue law The Senate listed explicitly the items to be banned and permitted food sales only by small merchants and added energy conservation as a new rationale for Sabbath closing the Assembly banned sales of all but a specific list of goods including food pharmaceuticals and recreational equipment But the two houses could not agree on a compromise so each passed the others bill and both were sent to the Governor for action Mr Carey also acted on two automobilerelated bills approving one and vetoing another The bill he signed would provide refunds to drivers who paid double or triple the normal license renewal fees last year I and early this year because of speeding or other movingviolation convictions His office announced that about 300000 drivers would receive 16 million in refunds However a spokesman for the Department of Motor Vehicles said a refund procedure had yet to be worked out Mr Careys office also announced that he had vetoed a measure that in most cases would have barred automobile insurance companies from raising rates solely because of a traffic infraction other than drunken driving He said that the Insurance Department had recently completed public hearings on the merit ratings that determine the cost of an insurance policy and that action is this area should await the Insurance Departments study of the subject The doubling and tripling of license fees in most cases from 4 to 8 or 12 was instituted last September after the Legislature ended financing for the Department of Motor Vehicles Driver Safety Unit the division that processes conviction notices and issues suspensions and revocations The department ended the licensefee increases in April when funds were restored and the practice was eventually barred by the courts following lawsuits by several irate motorists The same bill would raise the surcharge for special license platesknown as vanity platesto 15 from 5 in most cases and would drop the restriction on issuing these plates to persons with recent traffic offenses Mr Carey said that despite his approval of the bill he would like to see this restriction reinstated These other actions also were announced by Mr Careys office today Mr Carey approved a bill that would require doctors to make the same lifesaving effort to a fetus born alive during an abortion as they would to an infant born spontaneously The Governor vetoed a measure that would have allowed persons over 60 years old to attend courses at state community colleges for credit without charge stating it would cost the State Univeersity at least 250000 a year Elderly persons are currently able to audit courses for free but without credit Mr Carey signed a bill that would allow New York City to impose a new tax on stores in the Nassau Street Mall the area of Nassau Street between Liberty and Spruce Streets in lower Manhattan to provide special services and maintenance to the area
"Black Kids, White Homes",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/14/archives/black-kids-white-homes-black-kids.html,FOR a few innocent years back in the 1960s social forces converged to produce an odd spectacle Thousands of young white married couples descended upon the nations childwelfare agencies asking to expand their families by adopting babies who were black or racially mixed They were responding to a shortage of white infants free for adoption to publicity about hard to place children and to rising concern about overpopulation In many cities the agencies ever eager to move their surpluses of minorityrace children out of foster homes and into adoptive families responded with enthusiasm But before too long these forces were overcome by others Liberalized abortion laws caused a general decline in adoption activity and black social workers in militant pursuit of their professional identities mounted a rhetorical campaign against interracial adoption The militant social workers did not provide any real alternative for the black children who needed adoptive homes but their attack chilled the enthusiasm of the agencies and the brief proliferation of multiracial families became a curious footnote to our social history instead of a sweeping new trend The footnote however cannot be dismissed lightly Some 10000 black and partblack children were adopted by white people with whom they remain to this day They are no longer the cuddlesome tykes who could charm smiles out of the most bigoted grandparent they are boys and girls whom American society calls black whatever racial formulas may describe their ancestry and they are coming up fast on adolescence How are they faring in this more cynical decade a harsh season for the nuclear family in any case To find some answers black sociologist Joyce Ladner conducted interviews with 136 adoptive families in six states Her book offers few surprisessome of the families justify the early enthusiasm for interracial adoption others vindicate the black social workers angry response In the end Miss Ladner asserts there are many whites who are capable of rearing emotionally healthy black children but she adds the task requires courage commitment and Sensitivity focused especially on the black childs need to develop a strong identity Parents like Gloria and Melwho say they dont understand much about all this black identity stuff and innocently attribute their sons musicality and sense of rhythm to his blankness obviously dont measure up Vicky and Haroldwho are raising their four children in an integrated suburb and talk about the need to avoid raising little brown kids who think they are whitesurely do But these conclusions while sound and somewhat reassuring are not an adequate response to the more trenchant questions Are the good intentions of sensitive white parents enough to help a black child ride out the emotional storms of adolescence And can they give him the selfassurance the good sense the strength of soul he will need to survive as a black in a society that now shows few signs of realizing the old ideals that caused him to be raised by whites To these questions there can be no final answers for another several years but the enterprising Miss Ladner hints at some anyway by tracking down older black children and some of the few black adults who have grown up in white homes These case histories make up the most interesting chapter of her book Here among others we meet Ray who at the age of 13 was catapulted from the poverty of his disintegrating biological family in New York City to a life of comfort and advantage with the white minister who adopted him The experience has left him a successful if somewhat perplexed person In his adolescent years he thought of himself as a human being rather than as a black but during the 1960s civilrights movement when he was in his 20S he became acutely conscious of his racial identity and went through a period when he rejected his parents because they were white Today at the age of 36 he is a college professor a husband and a father of two daughters He admits that I would have preferred being adopted by blacks but he maintains a good relationship with his white parents Rather wistfully he says When I talk to black men his age  I wonder what it would have been like if I had been able to talk to my father this way or if he could relate to me the same way But he adds at the time I was growing up we related to each other in a way that was fair Then there is the remarkable Jennifer now 27 who was taken in at the age of 5 by the wealthy Southern white woman who had employed her biological mother as a maid For 11 years Jennifer led a life of enormous affluence and sophistication in the company of her guardian traveling to Europe cavorting with the children of royalty learning many languages and upon her return to the United States enrolling in finishing school When Jennifer was 18 she and her guardian had a falling out Jennifer moved away married twice divorced twice had a son and somehow managed to put herself through law school Today she runs her own business identifies herself as an assured black woman and has patched up her relationship with her guardian She says It doesnt really matter who loves the child so long as the child gets affection and feels secure  If I was considering adopting I might give a white child such a break One cannot generalize from such lives of course but by their functioning Ray and Jennifer do affirm the deep belief of many white couples who choose to raise black children Relations between parent and child arent supposed to be perfect instead they are richly complicated molded by Imponderable forces great and small Our task as parents is only to manage the complexity as best we can 
THE ECONOMIC SCENE,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/14/archives/the-economic-scene-paying-for-health-care.html,WHEN it comes to healthcare costswhich Joseph A Califano Jr Secretary of Health Education and Welfare warns may reach 230 billion by 1980top Government and Private policymakers seem to show signs of schizophrenia In an abstract discussion all agree that the skyrocketing costs must be brought under control In fact one of the first concrete proposals of the Carter Administration was a bill sent to Congress to put an overall cap on hospital revenues Similarly corporate clients are pressuring Blue CrossBlue Shield and other private health insurers to keep down premiums for the group health plans paid for by the employers But attitudes change abruptly when it comes to specifics when an influential person becomes ill Then only the best care Is acceptable regardless of cost Take the scare the Presidents wife had last April 28 Mrs Carter arrived at Bethesda Naval Medical Center for a checkup at about 2 PM Shortly thereafter a lump was found in one breast She was immediately taken to surgery a biopsy sample of the lump was removed and a pathologist promptly examined the specimen painstakingly That same night Mrs Carter returned to the White House with the happy news that the lump was nonmalignant In the national wave of relief after the incident apparently nobody thought it polite to ask what would cost to give the same fast individualized service to every American woman who finds a lump in her breast Nor was it mentioned that the Governments favorite measures for medical economy usually entail cutting down on resources and making people wait longer for medical attention Similarly Senator Hubert H Humphrey Democrat of Minnesota in his fight against cancer last October went to Dr Willet F Whitmore a leading bladder surgeon at Memorial Hospital here which many consider the nations best cancer hospital But neither Dr Whitmore nor Memorial Hospital has ever competed for patients on the basis of low prices Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts several years ago flew 10 top specialists from California Minnesota and Texas to Washington DC to help fight his teenage sons cancer Former President Gerald R Ford and former Vice President Nelson A Rockefeller both sought the best possible care for their wives when they were found to have breast cancers The need for economy does not seem to have played a role in these personal calculations nor did any of these people turn for treatment to Health Maintenance Organizations the prepaid group healthcare organizations that Washington has been recommending to ordinary citizens in recent years The currently fashionable rhetoric which has been heard from both major political parties is that every American has a right to firstclass medical care but after 11 years of Medicare and Medicaid costs politicians are seeking ways to reduce medical costs not to provide for care of the quality received by Mrs Carter Senator Humphrey or Edward M Kennedy Jr An amazing disclosure of the extent to which some in the Government would go to reduce medical costs came in a June 4 memorandum from Robert Derzon head of the HEWs Health Care Financing Administration Mr Derzon who was hired to cut costs spelled out some ideas to Mr Califano that he might take up with the President Mr Derzon likes euthanasia for example and his memorandum suggests that Californias living will law ought to apply to the entire country A living will permits a patient to authorize his doctor to terminate lifesupport systems when case becomes hopeless Mr Derzon even suggested withholding Federal funds from states to force them to pass such laws The costsaving from a nationwide push toward Living Wills is likely to be enormous he ex plained Over onefifth of Medicare expenditure are for persons in their last year of life In the 197f fiscal year he estimated more than Si billion could be saved by living will laws The memorandum also favors Medicaid financing for abortions for welfare mothers and wishes President Carter would drop his opposition to them The calculation is simple    every unwanted birth prevented saves about 1000 annually in welfare payments and another 100 in Medicaid funds When the memorandum was leaked early this summer and opposition ensued an effort was made to repudiate it It was merely an idea paper Mr Derzon announced It did not nor does it now represent formal or even informal recommendations to the Secretary But what is irrefutable Is that these and related ideas have recently been actively discussed at the highest policy levels of HEW Ironically the Derzon memorandum also speculates about the possibility of cutting back on training new physicians For years vast Federal sums have been spent to Increase medical school enrollments on the assumption there is an acute shortage of doctors Now the memorandum notes with horror that by 1980 there will be 85000 more physicians than there are today generating about 5 billion in annual income and even more in hospital costs This increase the memorandum argues is counterproductive since we do not need to increase our physician supply adding that the American Medical Association might not resist a new Government program to limit the number of new physicians But many private corporations are also caught in a web of contradictions in health care Take Eastman Kodak and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company for example Both have gained reputations for being particularly hardnosed on medical costs and being in the forefront of those backing HMOs and other devices intended to cut costs of health care for their employes Yet in advertisements in hospitalindustry magazines Eastman Kodak exhorts executives to buy its Xray films and ATT pushes its communications systems The CIT Corporations manager of employee benefits is on the board of directors of the National Association of Employers for Health Maintenance Organizations the group seeking to stimulate industrys backing of HMOs But the large and frequent CIT ads in the hospital magazines promote CIT CAT for computerized axial tomographic scanners which cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each and urge hospitals to use CIT financing services to expand But HMOs are designed to reduce use of hospitals and to cut down the purchase of such expensive equipment as CAT scanners which are basically computerassisted Xray devices In a recent speech Secretary Califano pinpointed the International Business Machines Corporation as a prime example of the giants of corporate America that have moved in to obtain their share of the health industry in IBMs case through sales of computers copiers and electric typewriters Yet for years top IBM executives have been among the most acid critics of healthcost escalation Finally there is President Carters new welfare program which aims to put more ablebodied relief recipients to work Hospital expansion in the last decade has involved hiring lowskilled semiliterate people many of them from minority groups in service jobs and Federal policymakers seeking jobs for welfare recipients might well think in terms of expanding hospital and nursing home employment not contracting it as present goals seek Of course there is waste in the medical care system and many moneysaving improvements can be made But it is strange that so little attention paid to the chief cause of waste in medical care large proportion of Americans who enter a hospital or see a doctor pay little or nothing immediately because they are covered by private or Government insurance programs as specialists know It would seem evident that a program to reduce waste would start by giving patients potent new incentives for saving moneyby having them pay more of the bill Instead the Carter Administration is preparing its national health insurance program for Congress But nobody wants to discuss how health care will be rationed under national health insuranceor to put it more bluntly to decide how long Mrs John Q Public will have to wait for a biopsy and pathologists verdict when she finds a future lump in her breast
LETTERS TO THE NEW JERSEY EDITOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/14/archives/new-jersey-weekly-letters-to-the-new-jersey-editor.html,I do not presume to speak for all 95000 communicants of the Episcopal Diocese of Newark nonetheless President Carters endorsement of the Supreme Courts decision allowing states to withhold Medicaid payments for elective abortions is disappointing to those of us who believe in equality of persons before the law The same Court has upheld the principle that women may within the first trimester of pregnancy elect to have terminated an unwanted pregnancy Now it appears that only those who can pay for safe and competent medical care for such an abortion are entitled to receive it Others must either carry their unwanted children to full term or suffer the indignity and danger of submitting to the butchery of the alley abortionist President Carter would approve of Medicaid assistance in cases where the womans life is threatened or when pregnancy was the result of rape or incest What if the womans mental and emotional health are in jeopardy if the child is liable to be born mentally or physically deficient if the child is unlikely because of the mothers immaturity to receive proper nurture or if there are already more children in the family than it can support A point that Right to Lifers consistently overlook is that every child has a right to be wanted The Episcopal Church at its 1976 General Convention stopped short of endorsing abortion on demand and spoke out against abortion as a means of birth control It recognized however the right of those concerned to make free and informed decisions in the matter opposing any governmental abridgement or denial of that right and recommending that such decisions be reached in consultation with the persons spiritual advisor and pastor The Supreme Courts decision if followed by states in denying Medicaid for elective abortion would seem to abrogate that right to the women who may need it most and be at least able to afford it GEORGE E RATH Bishop Diocese of Newark Episcopal The grant of 308000 to Greenwich Township in Cumberland County by the Federal Economic Development Administration for the purpose of adding five new classrooms is a remarkable one particularly in view of the fact that the school enrollment will be dropping The township has two schoolsone with six classrooms and the other with fourand a total enrollment of 162 students for an average of 162 students per classroom With the suggested addition of five more classrooms the average number of students per class would be nine Local citizens are actually discouraging the appearance of newcomers to take up residence and or build new homes in the township and the township has rejected proposals for a tank farm a deepwater port and a nuclear plant Greenwich Township is definitely a historical site but the few farmers left have found out that they cannot eat history Many of the small farmers have found it necessary to seek regular employment elsewhere as well as trying to run their farms to help pay their taxes All residents of the township look to Bridgeton Milleville and Vineland for their shopping needs There are no malls supermarkets clothing stores or chain stores in the township This Federal money could be used far better to purchase new fire equipment and correct the poor maintenance of the existing roads not reconstruct them If not this then the money should be turned over to the abovementioned municipalities as the residents of Greenwich Township would indirectly receive the benefits thereof the same as the residents of the three cities CONCERNED CITIZENS OF GREENWICH TOWNSHIP The New Jersey Weekly recently published a letter suggesting that Newark International Airport be renamed Woodrow Wilson International Airport Thats not a bad idea but I think I have a better one There was a great man who was raised and educated in New Jersey and New York He went to schools in Princeton New Brunswick Westfield and New York City  He was an AllAmerican football player and an outstanding scholar He trained in the law but left it to become an internationally famous actor and singer He traveled the entire world championing the cause of the downtrodden A legend in his time and someone wtto should never be forgottenrhis name was Paul Robeson Call it Robeson International Airport Is there any better name PHILLIP ZEIDENBERG Teaneck

Personal Health,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/17/archives/personal-health.html,AT A TIME when better birth control legal abortion rising costs and population consciousness have prompted and enabled millions of American couples to precisely control their family size a growing proportion of couples are finding themselves faced with the opposite problemhow to have the children they want Infertility never a problem that one discussed openly can be even more embarrassing these days when the societal emphasis is on declining birth rates Yet for a variety of reasons more and more couples today are seeking medical help to have children First there has been an increase in the direct and indirect causes of infertility which had traditionally afflicted about one couple in six A major factor has been the growing tendency to marry later or at least to delay childbearing often into the 30s Fertility in both men and women declines with age A woman reaches her peak fertility at age 18 or 19 with little change into the mid20s Then fertility begins a slow decline to age 35 a sharper one to age 49 and a precipitous drop as the woman nears menopause A mans fertility decline is neither as rapid nor as definite since there is no clearcut end to it but a man of 50 is likely to be less fertile than he was at 25 or 30 According to one way of measuring the decline of fertility with age Dr Robert Kistner of Harvard Medical School describes the likelihood of a man impregnating his wife within six months of trying to conceive At age 25 this chance is 75 percent in the late 20s it drops to 47 percent in the early 30s to 38 percent the late 30s to 25 percent and after 40 22 percent A contributing factor to this declining fertility is no doubt the usual decline in the frequency of intercourse with advancing age The epidemic rise in venereal diseases particularly gonorrhea among all social classes and age groups is contributing importantly to the increase in both male and female infertility Gonorrhea that is not promptly and thoroughly treated can permanently damage the tubes that carry eggs and sperm Women are especially at risk of suffering irreversible fertility damage because three out of four women with gonorrhea dont even know they have it Ironically the pill and the IUD popular methods of preventing unwanted births can sometimes stand in the way of wanted births later on Some women upon stopping the pill find that their periods dont return or come very irregularly indicating a disruption of normal ovulation Most of these women it turns out had irregular menstrual cycles to begin with and the cycle irregularity apparently was further aggravated by the pill Such women are advised to avoid taking the pill if they expect to want children later Even women who had a normal menstrual cycle before starting the pill might stop the pill for a month every two years to see if they ovulate and menstruate normally The IUD increases a womans chances of suffering a pelvic infection that may damage the tubes and infertility experts recommend that women who have a history of pelvic infection should avoid using the IUD if they value their future fertility To reduce the chances of tubal damage all pelvie infections should be promptly treated with antibiotics Abortozztoo may result in later infertility although the chances of this happening following a legal abortion are far less than when pregnancies were terminated in back alleys Between one and five percent of women develop infections following abortion Multiple abortions or ones done late in the first three months of pregnancy may weaken the cervix the mouth of the womb and result in miscarriages of future pregnancies The vasectomy revolution of the early 70s has now begun to produce a conterrevolution among some men who following their vasectomy lost one or more of their children or divorced the mother of their children and married a younger woman who wants her own Reversing a vasectomy involves delicate surgery that ultimately results in pregnancy in about 40 percent of cases The precipitous decline in healthy infants available for adoption has also prompted more couples to seek the aid of infertility specialists Couples who in the past might have adopted a baby if they failed to conceive after several years of trying today must pursue other routes if they desire a family Many infertile couples have been encouraged to seek help as a result of the tremendous and wellpublicized progress made during the last decade or so in treating infertility problems Couples who in the past would have been told its hopeless or that nothing wrong can be found yet their infertility persisted today can have their fertility problem correctly diagnosed and successfully treated by appropriate specialists More than half of couples with infertility problems can now be helped to achieve pregnancy and childbirth Drugs to stimulate ovulation surgery under magnification to repair damaged tubes and reconnect the sperm ducts and an operation to correct a vein disorder that can impair sperm production are among the recently developed techniques to restore fertility Although many people think of infertility as a womans problem in approximately 40 percent of cases a problem in the husband is the main or a contributing cause A couples fertility is really a combination of the fertility of the individuals Thus as Dr Richard Amelar a New York specialist in male infertility points out a superfertile woman often can make up for a subfertile man a compensation which tends to be lost as the woman ages and her own fertility drops off Therefore when exploring the reasons for a couples inability to conceive it is crucial to examine the husband as well as the wife In fact since a semen analysis is relatively simple and inexpensive compared to the tests done to assess a womans fertility is advisable to have it done within the first weeks of an infertility workup The semen analysis must be done by a laboratory that specializes in the procedure and two or three analyses should be done before a final pronouncement is made on a mans fertility status Dr Amelar advises An obstetriciangynecologist or a urologist who specializes in the treatment of infertility is your best source of referral to a competent lab and your best bet for an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment of an infertility problem If you need help in locating an infertility specialist write to the American Fertility Society 1608 13th Avenue South Birmingham Ala 35205 phone 2059337222 which

Letter,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/17/archives/letter-on-cargo-preference-legislation.html,To the Editor If the economic consequences of cargo preference legislation were to be in fact as horrendous as The Times predicts The Great Ship Robbery editorial Aug 6 there would indeed be cause to reject the proposal But there is no rational reason to believe that cargo preference would raise oil prices for the American consumer indeed a strong case can be made that by shipping at least a part of our oil Imports in Americanflag tankers price saving could result The Times estimates the increased cost to the consumer at between 200 and 800 million per year That is a very wide spread and one wonders pow The Times decided upon this bracket of figures Ever since American maritime unions began to urge some form of cargo preference to prevent the American merchant marine from disappearing from the Seven Seas the oil companies which control or use the foreignflag shipsmostly under Liberian registration if that is indeed what may be calledhave gone to the public with the plea that to fly the Ameri can flag would cost the consumer dearly While they have been making this argument the price of gasoline has risen from about 35 cents to about 70 cents a gallonbut the propaganda continues as if nothing had taken place Reputable economists who have studied the way the oil companies use sophisticated accounting practices on their overseas drilling refining and transportation have come to a conclusion far different from that of the oil companies They argue that the bringing of at least a portion of the tanker fleet back to the American flag would close an important tax loophole that would more than offset in savings for the American public the slightly higher cost of using Americanflag tankers The oil companies transfer operations have permitted them to charge themselves just about whatever price they want for oil transportation with the internal price set at a level calculated best to provide optimum tax avoidance and highest overseas profits The closing of this loophole according the studies I have seen could lead to a net savings of about one cent per gallon on this imported oil In recent years I have testified before appropriate Congressional committees about this aspect of cargo preference and if the oil companies have been able to refute the estimateexcept by blanket denial and strident propagandaI have yet to see it There is another argument which The Times brushes aside the desirabilof a great commercial nation like United States with a proud history a skilled and effective merchant marine taking steps to maintain at minimum a comparatively small fleet modern cargo ships and tankers The members of the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association and other maritime unions do not believe that the creation of Liberian and Panamanian fleets many of them clearly in the sweatship category was ordered in heaven J M CALHOON To the Editor Rogers and Blendons case for increased public and private expenditures for medical care services presented in a recent OpEd article is illfounded  Such increased expenditures do not ipso facto result in increased services half of the increase in spending since 1950 has gone for higher prices not more services this has been exacerbated in recent years by demandpull inflation due to increased Federal health spending for the aged and poor  The authors themselves concede that the evidential links between increased spending and enhanced access and improved health status are at best tenuous as Gordon stated OpEd June 26 medical expenditures now have a negligible impact on health The real gains In American health in recent decades were and will continue to be achieved through prevention better nutrition reduced cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption high blood pressure control reduced speeds and safer roads use of seat belts or air bags reduced unnecessary hospitalizations and surgical procedures etc The authors cite declines in maternal and infant mortality as prime examples of the benefits of increased access to medical care services but these gains basically result from preand postnatal prevention servicesnot treatment As Victor Fuchs has stated the efficacy of medical care has been established only in highrisk pregnancies contraception and abortion have contributed more by reducing unwanted and unstable pregnancies The gains against infant mortality were greater in the 1940s than in the first decade of Medicaid The decade 1965 to 1975 saw a decrease in ageadjusted mortality of 13 percent Again the substantial declines of the 1940s 22 percent and 1950s 10 percent place that of the first MedicareMedicaid decade in proper perspective The correlation of this decline with increased medical expenditures is not unique for this decade One of the largest declines in mortality has been for components of ischemic heart disease related to hypertension the proportion of hypertension brought under control in the US roughly doubled between 1965 and 1975 to around 45 percent  During the same period the percentage of present cigarette smokers among adult men has declined from 510 to 388 percent exsmokers rose from 192 to 247 percent The American Cancer Society reports that the percentage of women ever to have had a Pap test for cervical cancer rose from 53 to 85 percent between 1972 and late 1976 Studies by Stamler Hammond Wald and others have related improved mortality statistics to these and other developments in prevention A recent endorsement of the key role of changing life style in reducing vascular mortality in this country is found in W J Walkers forceful editorial in the July 21 New England Journal of Medicine He sees iwo crucial events the 1964 Surgeon Generals report on smoking and the American Heart Associations report urging a more prudent diet both have had significant impact on our life style While not eschewing modern advances in treatment Walker closes with Blackburns suggestion that such preventive changes might largely bypass The [coronary artery Bypass These sample indices of wider adoption of preventive practices dramatically point to the medical and economic value of investing in a prevention oriented medical care system Suburbs Were Running Out of Prime Land    lb the Editor Time and again The Times has reported the death of the cities of the Northeast concurrently with a story in the exclusion from the suburbs of the low and moderateincome family Yet to be seen is an anlysis of these social phenomena that relates them to the reduction of our energy resources And agricultural potential Reality is defined by the media and its usage The suburbs were the farms and the Eastern suburbs were the source of the cities foodseldom subject these Eastern onefamily farms to drought or their produce to unconscionable transportation costs And the cities were the land of opportunity and the location of efficient systems of industrial production The major cities were also the home of culture and innovation which they exported to the rest of the nation Now through fulminating suburbanization the cities are killing themseives and the farmland on which theyve depended City and country are fated to survive together or die Imperiled Mankind To the Editor I agree with Sidney Halperns letter Aug 6 placing what happened during the recent blackout into the broader context of declines of civilizations I disagree on two major points First I would define barbarians whom with Arnold Toynbee we should rather call the internal and external proletariat not as those who want something for nothing the vast majority of humans want to do meaningful workthere are no innate barbarians but as those who as slaves or serfs or industrial proletarians have been exploited or neglected in and by all civilizations Second Western civilization ours has by now covered the globe Those external barbarians I would look at the third world rather than the Russians are now part and parcel of a global Western civilization It follows that the Black Ages that might follow its downfall would not as in previous instances presage the rise of a new civilization but mark the demise of mankind Question Can we act quickly and radically to reverse the situation Aristotle had the vision of slaves the then proletariat being replaced by machines We now have technology but have used it primarily to benefit the few and neglect internal and external masses who because they are exploited or wanting skills are unemployable threaten to shatter our civilization The bearers of civilization have been unable andor unwilling to make the necessary sacrifices to acculturate or absorb the barbarians The third world through wrong though profitable investments and technology transfers is being developed in such a way that glittering modern cities for the ruling few are surrounded by shantytowns where millions of barbarians languish without hope of participation in the good life As for our own war against poverty the less said the better Mans inability to learnin the face of multiplying warning signalsbodes ill for his future JOHN H HERZ together Out here in the disappearing farmlands there are small but tenacious groups that are neither exclusionary nor allied with the developers who promise homes for all economic strata but buildpreferably on flat welldrained farmlandonly for the middle and upper classes Until recently we sat by and watched it all happen Wellmeaning Federal legislation on urban renewal that has driven the middle class from the cities equally wellintentioned housing policies that have promoted urban sprawl collusion between development interests and local governmentperhaps the most important unwritten story of the last 30 years Can anyone hear our witness Now were scared In our minds these are survival questions Were running out of prime land out of water and out of money to pay the costs of development Can anyone hear PAUL SILVER Vice President Bucks County Land Use Task Force 1977 Carter and McGovern To the Editor I would like to compliment you and your editorial staff on your recent editorial What New York Can Do for Mr Carter It was incisive and I believe articulated the concern of millions of thoughtful Americans For me it offered an additional value For more than six years I have attempted to explain why I believe George McGovern would make a great President of the United States He possesses the intelligence the sense of history the compassion and concern our country most desperately needs in its chief executive Unfortunately neither I nor those others who worked on behalf of his candidacy in 1972 were successful in convincing the majority of the American public of our belief It is probably fair to state that I was only moderately successful in convincing even my closest friends and business associates Your editorial confirms my conviction that George McGovern would have been one of the great Presidents of this country President Carter has many of the qualities required of a great President He has a keen intellect integrity and a commitment to the Presidency If he accepts your editorial in a constructive fashion he will provide the kind of compassionate and caring leadership so critically needed at this time HENRY L KIMELMAN St Thomas VI July 28 1977 The New Minister To the Editor The news of the selection of William Sloan Coffin Jr as senior minister by the Riverside Church is cause to rejoice for the clergy of all faiths in the metropolitan area When most rabbis priests and ministers devote themselves almost exclusively to parochial institutional and doctrinal issues Mr Coffin is certain to remind us of authentic religions fundamental concern with the human needs of our time Mr Coffin comes to us when the current image of the clergy isfre quently that of one who pompously presides over the status quo or one who preaches withdrawal from Societys problems through blind faith or cultic escape Mr coffin will surely help us open our eyes to this worlds needs In addition his presence here may encourage young men and women seeking careers of substance and meaning to realize that religious leadership can be one of the most valuable and challenging professions to which to dedicate their lives Rabbi JEROME K DAVIDSON Great Neck LI Aug 11 1977 ACLU Intrigue To the Editor The Times has rendered an important service by exposing the closeand improper ties between the American Civil Liberties Union and the Federal Bureau of Investigation As a member of the board of directors of the ACLU I myself was caught in this web of intrigue because officers of the organization were worried aboutthe absurd rumor that I was a member of the Communist Party So it was that in the early 1950s Patrick Malin then executive director of the ACLU reported to a full meeting of the board I was down in Washington a couple of days ago and dropped in on J Edgar Hoover at the FBI I asked him whether Corliss Lamont was a member of the Communist Party and he said No I protested Mr Malins little interview as clearly violating the ACLUs principle of functioning on an entirely independent political basis But no other member of the board present raised the slightest objection CORLISS LAMONT New York Aug 7 1977 A Priority for OSHA To the Editor The Occupational Safety and Health Administration could have a major impact on improving the wellbeing of American workers if it would focus on the problem of jobrelated diseases editorial Aug 8 Far more critical than the spacing of ladder rungs are the health hazards unknowingly incurred by workers exposed to toxic substances The priority of OSHA should be to help companies monitor the work environment and provide diagnostic services and health care

The Diaphragm Is Regaining Acceptance Among Some Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/19/archives/the-diaphragm-is-regaining-acceptance-among-some-women.html,The oldfashioned diaphragm which was relegated to thousands of handKerchief drawers with the advent of the birthcontrol pill in the 1960s is staging a modest renaissance these days  The rubber barrier and its accompanying ointments seem particularly popular among young single welleducated women according to various experts in the field This trend is good news to Barbara Seaman who is regarded by some as the Ralph Nader of contraception because she has goaded the government the drug industry and doctors into higher standards for contraceptive usage Mrs Seaman has just published her latest book Women and the Crisis in Sex Hormones Rawson Associates with her husband Gideon a psychiatrist as coauthor She takes another slam at big medicine in chapters like Recovering from the Pill and deals with the diaphragm in a chapter titled The Queen of Contraception  Partly because of writers like Mrs Seaman Yes I am an advocate I do have a point of view she admits many women are now conscious of the complications that may come from the pill or intrauterine device I U D the specific risks the naggne health problems Many are now looking for more natural ways to avoid pregnancy Dislike of Chemicals Many women just dont want to put chemicals or metal in their bodies said Susan Fox coordinator of Princeton Universitys program for Sexuality Education Contraception and Health Also many single women tend to have sex irregularly If their male friend is off at graduate school why bother taking the pill when all theyre doing that month is writing their junior paper she added The return of the diaphragm was not reflected in the most recent national study by Dr Charles F Westoff and Elise F Jones for the Office of Population Research Their 1975 figures for white continuously married couples indicated use of the bill by 34 3 percent sterilization 31 3 condom 10 9 I U D 8 7 diaphragm 3 9 foam 3 6 rhythm 2 8 and others 2 6 But Dr Westoff adds Ive heard a lot of cocktail talk that diaphragms are being used more in the past year or two  Apparently it is more than talk Dr Robert W Kifstner of Boston Hospital for Women a longtime proponent of the pill says his patients have shifted from an 85 percent reliance on the pi to around 3540 percent in 10 years He says lots more women are requesting the diaphragm I get women who tell me that under no circumstances wilt they take the pill because it causes cancer Dr Kifstner said Yet there is no evidence to back it up There have been too many scare tactics in recent years  This is partly a reference to Mrs Seaman who began her writing career by blasting hospital officials who gave her a laxative while she was breastfeeding her first child and I almost lost him  Later as an editor at several magazines she charged that the pill was more dangerous than women were being told In her latest book she gives a history of the hormone drug diethylstilbestrol D E S  which has prcduced cancer in some of the daughters of some of the women who took it She also discusses the dangers of birth control pills and the and criticizes the use of estrogen in many menopause drugs However few people have read the latest book so there was little specific reaction to it While many praise her for prodding the Federal government into requiring warning labels on birthcontrol packages others feel she overreacts Jane Johnson associate executive director of Planned Parenthood of New York City spoke of Mrs Seamans and added If the risk of the pill were 10 timcs higher than it is women would still be betier off on the pill than getting pregnant  Dr Christopher Tcitzc a biostatistitian for the Population Council estimated the pill as 99 5 effective and resulting in only one death from pregnancy for every million years of usage But another 13 women would die from pillrelated complications he said The I U D which is about 97 percent effective would produce nine deaths per million years of usagetwo from the method and seven from pregnancies Dr Teitze rated the diaphragm as 88 percent effective because women failed to use it properly and predicted 27 deaths from pregnancy but no deaths from usage If used effectvely Dr Teitze added the diaphragm is 98 percent effective producinf only five deaths from pregnancy The condom also produces no Carnage from usage but women cannot always rely on the male to use the condom properly  The HollandRantos Co of Piscataway N J which manufactures only diaphragms has doubled production in the past two years The 11centimeter size is the one most in demand indicating usage by young women who have not yet given birth The Ortho Pharmaceutical Company of Raritan N J which produces a full line of contraceptives has seen pill aria I U D sales drop in recent years while diaphragm salesalthough considerably lower in 1have risen steadily The diaphragm commanded over 10 percent of the market until 1965 when many women gladly gave it up because of the availability of the pill and because they had not enjoyed using it Risk of Pelvic Infection Dr David H Sherman a gynecologist on New Yorks Fifth Avenue says he will prescribe the pill or I U D for any woman who wants it but expresses concern over both methods The I U D can perforate and produce severe pelvic infection he says a pregnancy with an I U D in place produces three times the risk of ectopic pregnancy The pill can produce phlebitis sudden death from clotting cerebral vascuiar accidents Sure the percentages are small but youve got to watch them If we were talking about a million women in Biafra or Pakistan the dangers of pregnancy would tip the bqlance But does a middleclass East Side woman need to take chances Tile availability of abortions has decreased reliance on the pill and I U D also he said Some young women in the New York area insist they do not know a single friend using the pill these days According to Dr Westoffs 1975 figures di phragm users were highest among colloge women 5 5 percent and on the East Coast 5 3 percent Even if those figures have jumped considerably the pill is obviously still the most popular nonpermanent method in the U S This was shown in the popularity of a countrymusic song The Pill by Loretta Lynn about a woman who feels emancipated from pregnancy and even from monogamy by the latest contribution of modern science Our ladies are just happy not getting pregnant said Susan Harris a familyplanning supervisor at Frontier Nursing Service in Hyden Ky deep in the Appalachian Mountains They dont have the same concept of health priorities as women in Cleveland where I used to work Miss Harris continued Of course if our ladies get headaches we take them off the pill or when they get to be 40 Most of the people who ask fcr diaphragms here are people who come from the outside to get beck to nature  Woman can be taught to use a diaphrient It just takes more time than passing out pills For a poor woman who cant always get to a clinic or a drug store the diaphragm is probably better than the pill or the I U D anyway They just have to be taught  Mrs Seaman charges that any of course considerable information is already available to the women who are concerned enough to reach out At one clinic the Margaret Sanger Center at 380 Second Avenue over 12000 people a year mostly women seek advice Whether they are visiting for an abortion a pregnancy test or counseling they are given a highly graphic lecture on the cafeteria approach to contraceptionget all the information then choose what is best for you Many of the women who come to the Center express a sadness that the perfect nonpermanent contraception has not yet arrived They seem aware that contraception experts are making no more Utopian predictions not after the panacea of the pill proved to be as imperfect as anything else human beings have created The main thing they are doing with the pill today is lowering the dosage of estrogen says Gabriel Bialy chief of contraceptive development for the Federal Center for Population Research But what would happen if we could slow down the absorption rate instead Nobody really knows In the last few years there has been relatively little research  Dr Bialy talked briefly about a gelatin sponge that would take the place of a diaphragm but he added I dont think there will ever be one method to satisfy all people  TM New York TimesD Gorlan The New York TimesChester

4 Russians Coming to Study U. S.  End Up Explaining Soviet Life,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/20/archives/4-russians-coming-to-study-us-end-up-explaining-soviet-life.html,They came to the City Universitys Graduate Center on West 42d Street to compare educational systems these four Russians on an exchange program but by the time the morning was out they had been questioned about the dissident writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn the opportunity structure of the Soviet Union and the Russian attitudes on marriage sex and abortion The four visitorsan Olympic gold medalist an English teacher a camp counselor and a dancerrefrained from subjecting their hosts to a similar barrage though they did take up the challenge and in the process even managed a few lowkey barbs at the United States The only question that seemed to throw them was the one on abortion As soon as the word was mentioned Tatyana Kaftina the English teacher who served as the groups translator grimaced She exchanged whspered words with her comrades and then nervously declined comment saying We are not specialists in this subject  The question on Mr Solzhenitsyn was posed in Russian by Dina Konilewiska who is of Ukranian descent She wanted to know why it was impossible in the Soviet Union to purchase books by the Nobel Prizewinning author Unruffled by Question The four Russians were unruffled by the question We just didnt like the pessimistic spirit of this author Miss Kaftkina replied Through Miss Kaftkina Yuri Erevyagin the dancer asked if it was necessary to read such authors when there are so many others  There followed a loud but not acrimonious exchange on the subject between the guests and their questioner Unfortunately for the rest of the group mostly students or staff members from the universitys discovery and development program the brief but lively exchange was carried on in Russian leaving everyone else left behind in a state of mystification Finally Judith Burke who chaired the meeting asked that the conversation turn to other subjects and return to the English language This everyone politely agreed to do The morning was largely taken up by a relatively uncontroversial discussion of the American and Soviet educational systems Throughout the conversations each side repeatedly commented on the friendliness and graciousness of the other Comparisons between the Soviet Union and the United States however were never entirely out of the picture One student asked two questions one about attending a university had on the type of job a person held and the other about unemployment We Have No Unemployment The second is easiest replied Miss Kaftkina in polite tones We have no unemployment  The visiting Russians said they were pleasantly surprised that all America was not as highly industrialized as New York City but that they believed Russians knew more about America than Americans did about Russia As an example Miss Kaftkina said that when she mentioned that an American delegation visiting the Soviet Union was staying in Siberia her announcement was greeted with laughter The view of Russia behind that laughter she insisted was based on an old understanding one going back to the days of the Czars A truly annoying misunderstanding she said was that there appeared to be a widespread American belief that we didnt live in houses we lived in huts  Russians she assured her hosts have all the modern conveniences
"THE PRESS, PRIVACY AND THE CONSTITUTION",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/21/archives/the-press-privacy-and-the-constitution-privacy.html,Aswift move jostles wouldbe assassins arm The shot misses President Gerald Ford Sara Jane Moore receives life sentence But what of Oliver Sipple the exMarine who deflected her aim He becomes an instant hero but national publicity also reveals that he is a member of San Franciscos gay community Now almost two years after the assassination attempt Sipples suit against several newspapers for invading his privacy proceeds through the California courts The Sipple case has broad implications It is one of a growing number brought against the press by people who claim that even true statements about themselves may not be published And it exemplifies what has become the single most ominous threat to the First Amendments guarantee of press freedom  the explosion of privacy law For the press recent years have seen a general easing of a variety of legal threats When it appeared that skyhigh libel judgments against national newspapers and magazines by local juries might inhibit  and ultimately prohibit  coverage of the civilrights movement of the 1950s libel law was all but rewritten by the Supreme Court The press was provided with constitutional protection even for the publication of false statements about public officials so long as the press had not deliberately falsified or printed the statements with serious doubts as to their truth Oliver Sipple wearing light jacket extreme left seconds after spoiling Sara Jane Moores shot at President Ford in San Francisco A plainclothesman grapples with Moore center  The bright flare of a heros publicity revealed facts Sipple is suing about  When an effort was made to prohibit publication of the Pentagon Papers the Supreme Court speedily rejected it When lower court judges issued a flood of gag orders against publication of material about pending criminal cases the Supreme Court made it all but impossible for any such orders to be entered in the future And when a state attempted to force newspapers to publish material they chose not to print the Supreme Court unanimously rebuffed that effort Not all recent decisions involving the press have been in its favor In the case of New York Times reporter Earl Caldwell the Supreme Court declined to grant journalists a right to refuse to testify with respect to their confidential sources And in cases involving the presss right to enter prisons to interview inmates the Court rejected the argument that the First Amendment provided special rights of access for the press But neither of these areas important as they are approach that of privacy in terms of the risks they pose Discussions of those risks have become the staple of conversation at gatherings of editors and those of lawyers familiar with the field When editors of newspapers meet to discuss the current state of the American press the growth of privacy law is invariably high on the agenda And at an American Bar Association meeting of a committee on free speech and free press held earlier this month all the lawyers present agreed that the expansion of privacy law posed more of a threat to the press than any other One threat involves the possible substitution of an official governmental view  of legislators or judges  for the judgment of editors as to what is newsworthy  Another is that the more privacy cases are decided against the press the more the press will be inhibited in gathering news as a consequence much important newsgathering may become all but impossible In the end the press is the surrogate for the American public Because that public today absorbs more news than ever before its dependence on journalists and broadcasters is unprecedented Thus any balancing of the right of privacy against the right of the press to report  and the publics need to know  is not merely a journalistic dilemma but an American dilemma Before 1890 there was no such concept in American jurisprudence as privacy law In that year two young Boston lawyers who had been roommates at the Harvard Law School and then law partners published an article on privacy in The Harvard Law Review One was Louis Brandeis whose lustrous career on the United States Supreme Court began 26 years later the other was Samuel Warren a wealthy and socially prominent Bostonian The background of the article probably the single most important one in all American legal history  is remarkable for its pettiness Warren not Brandeis spurred its drafting Married in 1883 to the daughter of a Massachusetts senator Warren had become increasingly irritated by the descriptions in the Boston yellow press of parties given by the socially prominent couple The article faithfully reflects the irritation of the upper classes at their social inferiors Gossip is published so the article says to occupy the indolent  One effect of gossip is to belittle by inverting the relative importance of things thus dwarfing the thoughts and aspirations of a people  Since the very publication of gossip crowds the space available for matters of real interest to the community what wonder that the ignorant and thoughtless mistake its relative importance Easy of comprehension appealing to that weak side of human nature which is never wholly cast down by the misfortunes and frailties of our neighbors no one can be surprised that it usurps the place of interest in brains capable of other things  Out of such 19thcentury condescension the law of privacy was born But what specifically would it protect against Brandeis and Warren had complained of the obvious bounds of propriety and decency being overstepped and of idle or prurient curiosity being served They had urged that individuals be permitted to recover money damages for such publications that injunctions be issued in some cases and that it would doubtless be desirable for criminal statutes to be adopted to punish invasions of privacy But what is propriety And how is one to tell idle curiosity from news The law was slow in its efforts to answer these questions Brandeis and Warren had published their article in 1890 By 1941 only eight states had recognized a right to sue for what was characterized as invasion of privacy by 1964 the number of states was 31 now it is 47 excluding only Rhode Island Nebraska and Wisconsin After television news showed his act Human Cannonball Hugo Zacchini sued to establish his right of selfpromotion  In the name of privacy we risk having officialsnot editorstell us what is newsworthy and how journalists should gather news The effect would be to deprive the public of needed information Some privacy claims are quite literally laughable There is the suit by former boxer against Groucho Marx Groucho during a You Bet Your Life show of the late 1940s had said 1 once managed a fighter named Canvasback Cohen I brought him here he got knocked out and I made him walk back to Cleveland  The real Cohen sued alleging that Grouchos joke was an invasion of his privacy Like Groucho the court sent Cohen walking Other claims however raise more serious questions as to the scope and nature of privacy protection Four types of privacy cases have arisen through the years One relates to the truthful disclosure of private facts this is illustrated by the example of Oliver Sipple the exMarine who saved President Ford Another involves what are claimed to be physical intrusions or trespasses by the press in the course of its newsgathering this is exemplified by the case of a medical quack named A A Dietemann who sued Life Magazine for the manner in which it gathered facts in order to expose him The third type of privacy action has to do with the right to sell ones own name or likeness an example of this is that of Human Cannonball Hugo Zacchini who sued a television station for broadcasting his act The fourth category arises when the press is said to have placed someone in a false light in the course of describing him this is illustrated by the socalled Desperate Hours case in which James Hill claimed a magazine article misrepresented his familys experience while being held hosby criminals PRIVATE FACTS The day after the assassination attempt on President Ford members of San Franciscos gay community mentioned to San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen that they were proud  maybe this will help break the stereotype  Caens article of Sept 24 1975 contained such a reference to Sipple Then when Sipple was pressed on the subject he disclosed that he had been one of the court of an elected emperor of the gay community Believing that reporting on Sipples activities in San Franciscos thriving gay community was newsworthy California newspapers published articles referring to those activities Sipples suit in turn claims that because of the articles about him his parents and brothers and sisters in Ohio learned for the first time of his homosexual affiliations and as a result abandoned him Sipples lawyer John Eshleman Wahl has rhetorically inquired whether if Sipple had known that saving the life of the President would subject his sex life to the speculation and scrutiny have chosen to save the Presidents life at all How in the name of logic and justice Wahl has urged does a discussion of Mr Sipples private sexual orientation have anything to do with his saving of the Presidents life Obviously and clearly it does not  but it sells papers  In reply to this Los Angeles Times attorney Robert S Warren and journalists on that newspaper have pointed to the newsworthiness of Sipples affiliation with San Franciscos gay community both because Sipples act was so contrary to the stereotyped now Anita Bryantized view of homosexuals and because it seemed for a time that President Ford might not publicly thank Sipple because he was gay Ford did  Warren also points to Sipples own disclosures of his participation in San Franciscos gay community discisures Sipple claims were made on some kind of offtherecord basis As the law has thus far developed is difficult to envisage The Los Angeles Times losing the Sipple suit A recent case involving yet another Californian who had asserted a privacy claim arising out of an article about him in Sports Illustrated seems to assure this result That case was brought by a champion body surfer named Michael Virgil whose hobbies which he disclosed to Sports Illustrated reporter included eating spiders putting out lighted cigarettes in his mouth and diving down flights of stairs to impress women When Sports Illustrated published an article containing that information Virgil sued And lost In its opinion the United States Court of Appeals spelled out its view as to the law a view which appears to reflect that of most other lower courts but which the United States Supreme Court has not yet ruled upon So long as truthful description of private facts about a person in the news is newsworthy the Court of Appeals said newspaper may not be found liable for publishing them What is not newsworthy According to the court the line is to be drawn when the publicity ceases to be the giving of information to which the public is entitled and becomes morbid and sensational prying into private lives for its own sake with which reasonable member of the public with decent standards would say that he had no concern  Concluding that the disclosures published in Sports Illusrated about Virgil could not meet such a test the District Court to which the case was returned dismissed Virgils suit As will happen one may guess to Sipples suit because of the newsworthiness  whatever the taste  of the revelations about him But the dismissal of the Sipple suit even if it occurs will not diminish the risks posed by other such privacy suits and other findings by other judges or jurors as W what isand what is notnewsworthy The Sipple suit like that of Virgil before it raises a more critical issue than that of what is newsworthy It is who should decide what is newsworthy There are some in the press and the bar who consider the victory of Sports Illustrated in the Virgil case a major one precisely because of its conclusion that the revelations about Virgil were newsworthy But it is far from that For one thing the test set forth by the court in the Virgil case contains language so vague morbid and sensational prying su openenged a reasonable member of the public and so subjective decent standards that it makes it all but impossible to determine in advance what may be published and what nut What would a member of the public with decent standards say for example about publishing information about President Kennedys amorous meanderings Or about Margaret Trudeaus walks on the wild side Or about the fact that Frank Hogan when he ran fur District Attorney of New York County had cancer and was likely not to live out the entirety of his term Or even about accurate reports of Samuel Warrens 19thcentury cocktail parties PRIVACY Historically decisions as to what is and is not newsworthy are precisely the ones made by editors not judges They are not always made well or responsibly But as Chief Justice Warren E Burger whose record in First Amendment cases involving the press is far more supportive than is generally recognized has written For better or worse editing is what editors are for and editing is the selection and choice of material That editors  newspaper or broadcast  can and do abuse this power is beyond doubt but  calculated risks of abuse are taken in order to preserve higher values  Judges are as well government officials and it is generally taken as one of the great gifts of the First Amendment that it puts all such officials out of the newsrooms not in them One New York columnist fur example while denouncing a Federal judge for a widely publicized recent deci sion affecting middleand lowerincome people men Tioned the judges Park Avenue address As a result the judge received a torrent of angry and sometimes threatening mail Should the journalist have printed the judges address The argument against printing it is strong But should a judge any judge be permitted to make such a decision In libel law  that body of law relating to the publication of defamatory falsehoods  it has historically and constitutionally been the case that so long as what was published was true there could be no recovery against the press for its publication But in the branch of privacy law involved in Sipples case what the offended party in effect says is not that false things have been said about him but that true things have been said which should have gone unsaid To a high degree all such claims thus involve delicate and difficult questions of taste an area in which journalists hardly can claim to have any better judgment than the rest of us and in which they sometimes have far worse Yet to permit judicial tastes  or those of other governmental officials with decent standards  to determine what may be printed is surely far more dangerous That if anything is the lesson of our historyPHYSICAL INTRUSIONS A A Dietemann was a disabled veteran who  as a court would later phrase it  was engaged in the practice of dealing with clay minerals and herbs  simple quackery  On Sept 20 1963 two Life magazine reporters visited Dietemann in his home  which was also the office for his quackery One of the reporters acting as if she were a patient described imaginary cancer symptoms to Dietemann who promptly responded by advising that the reporter had eaten some rancid butter 11 years 9 months and 7 days prior to the examination While Dietemann who carried a wandlike object in his hand spoke with his patient  his words were carried by a small radio transmitter in the reporters purse to a parked car outside the Dietemann home where another Life reporter an assistant disi trict attorney and an investigator for the California Department of Public Health listened The second reporter in Dietemanns house also took photographs without Dietemanns knowledge As a result of this journalistic effort Dietemann was arrested for practicing medicine without a license Life photographers took pictures of the arrest and two weeks later Life published an article entitled Crackdown on Quackery containing a photograph surreptitiously taken at Dietemanns home Dietemann pleaded nolo contendere to the charge He then sued Life for invasion of privacy Course raised far different problems from Sipples The legal result in the case was written in 1971 by the distinguished Federal judge Shirley Hufstedler Her opinion for herself and other members of the United States Court of Appeals concluded that Dietemann could recover for the invasion of his house by the Life reporters and that a 1000 verdict rendered in his favor by a Dietemanns claims of jury for injury to his feelings and peace of mind was constitutionally permissible According to the Court Dietemaims den was a sphere from which he could reasonably expect to exclude eavesdropping newsmen  As for the argument of Life that the First Amendment protected its kind of investigative journalism Judge Hufstedler sharply responded that the First Amendment has never been construed to accord newsmen immunity from torts [civil wrongs] or crimes committed during the course of newsgathering  Yet the result in the case remains troubling It is one thing to say that as a general matter ones home is sacrosanct from invasion by outsiders and that journalists are as responsible as the rest of us for illegal or improper eavesdropping just as they are for speeding or even jaywalking It is quite another to conclude that when a person passes himself off as a doctor and uses his home as his office journalists may not act as prospective patients and record the illegal activities that occur there  Prof Alfred Hill of Columbia Law School has recently highlighted the difficulty raised by the Dietemann verdict with the following hypothetical question Suppose that reporters infiltrate the highest Mafia councils employ hidden cameras and other surreptitious devices and as a result obtain and publish conclusive proof of major criminal activity of the Mafia the police prosecutors and other officials at the highest government levels If all that were so Hill asks can it be that the exposed Mafiosi could recover for breach of their privacy One solution to this issue might be for American law to borrow one aspect of British law and permit a jury to conclude that even though a physical intrusion by the press had occurred the publication so benefited the public that no recovery should be permitted This would permit newspapers willing to do so to risk some physical intrusion or deception of quacks or of Mafiosi while knowing that a jury might well reject the defense Most newspapers in fact do not engage as a journalistic matter in the kind of deception involved in the Dietemann case  This is hardly a tidy solution since it leaves open the possibility of different jury verdicts in all but identical cases and jury decisions based on the success or failure of the alleged intrusion by the press But if cases such as Dietemanns are to continue to be heard at all such an approach seems to strike a better balance than did the court in the Dietemann case itself SELFPROAIMON At the county fair in Burton Ohio on Sept 1 1972 the audience saw a renewed version of an old American tradition a human cannonball who was projected out of a cannonlike object into a net 200 feet away A local television station filmed the 15second spectacle and broadcast it on its 11 P M news program While the film was being shown the newscaster described the act as follows This  now  is the story of a true spectator sport the sport of human cannonballing In fact the great Zacchini is about the only human cannonball around these days Believe me although its not a long act its a thriller  and you really need to see itin person  to appreciate it  Ten months later Hugo Zacchini  the cannonball himself  filed suit in the Ohio courts He alleged that the right to show the film of his act belonged to him and that the television station by showing the film had invaded his privacy The kind of privacy law involved in Zacchinis case protects an entirely different interest from that involved in both the Sipple and Dietemann cases  the right of selfpromotion or publicity of selling ones own talent Yet Zacchinis act was broadcast on a regularly scheduled news program with no effort by the station at any commercial exploitation of the act Who wins So far Zacchini In a 5to4 decision rendered on June 28 1977 the Supreme Court in an opinion written by Justice Byron R White concluded that the First Amendment does not immunize the media when they broadcast a performers entire act without his consent  Although states may decline to permit recovery in such cases if they wish the White opinion concluded that there is no constitutional compulsion that they do so The case was thus returned to the Ohio courts for them to decide whether Zacchini should recover anything Like so many decisions in the field of privacy the Zacchini ruling raises about as many questions as it answers As Justice Lewis F Powells dissent inquires what is an entire act anyway Just the shooting of Zacchini through the air Or the fanfare possibly stretching over several minutes all accompanied by suitably ominous commentary from the master of ceremonies What will the effect of the opinion be Powell asks on the reporting on television of events at local fairs of sports competitions such as a winning ski jump or of showing a short  but whole  skit from a theatrical revue More broadly Justice Powells dissent contends that far from focusing on whether an entire act was broadcast the appropriate question is what use the station made of the film footage If the use is for a routine portion of a regular news program Powell urges that the First Amendment should protect a broadcaster from a Zacchinitype of suit in the absence of proof by the plaintiff that the broadcast was a subterfuge or cover for private or commercial exploitation  Otherwise he argues the public will simply be left uninformed about information it is entitled to know Justice Powells dissent highlights the difficulty now posed with respect to the broadcasting of certain newsworthy events It is true that entire acts have rarely been broadcast as news anyway they rarely are newsworthy and to that extent the Zacchini decision may have limited future effect But the question remains whether the public is well served by any notion of privacy that prevents them from observing events as newsworthy if trivial as that of Hugo Zacchinis flights Did this story portray the Hill family in a false light FALSE LIGHT In September 1952 three escaped convicts entered the suburban Pennsylvania home of Mr and Mrs James J Hill and their five children For the 19 much publicized hours that followed the Hills were held captive in their own home They were treated courteously and not molested or otherwise treated violently Two of the three convicts were killed a few days later by the police in a wild shootout Based on the experiences of the Hills Joseph Hayes wrote a bestselling novel The Desperate Hours  The book added to the actual tribulations of the Hills certain incidents which had not occurred It told of beatings of the father and son by the convicts and a verbal sexual insult to the daughter When The Desperate Hours was made into a play Life magazine transported some of the actors to the home where the Hills had been held hostage to take pictures One was of the son being manhandled by a convict it was captioned Brutish Convict  Another was of the daughter biting the hand of one of the convicts to force him to drop a gun it was captioned Daring Daughter  A third showed the father throwing his gun through the door after his brave try to free his family failed Hill represented in the Supreme Court by Richard Nixon sued Life under a New York privacy statute claiming that the Life article had given the impression that the play mirrored the Hills experience something Life knew waslalse and untrue  In its opinion written by Justice William J Brennan Jr the Supreme Court rejected the argument that liability for this kind of invasion of privacy could ever be imposed even for false statements unless actual malice  knowledge that the statements are false or in reckless disregard of the truth  is alleged and proved  It was a major press victory but it appears to be one which will be limited to cases  like Hills  in which individuals were portrayed in a false light and not to cases such as that of Sipple Dietemann or Zacchini Cases such as those described illustrate some but hardly all of the mileposts which privacy has passed But the risks of the rapid growth of privacy law are not limited to such cases They include as well a wide range of state statutes adopted to protect privacy These also directly threaten the ability of the public to learn significant facts which even Brandeis and Warren would have agreed do not constitute gossip  In Rhode Island for example a statute has been adopted permitting destruction of misdemeanor records after completion of a sentence or probation and following a specified period of time with no convictions In California and New Jersey records of marijuanalaw violators may be destroyed In New York and Missouri authorities will not release information about arrests that do not result in conviction And in South Carolina a bill is now under consideration which would require destruction of records when a person found All these laws are well intended They reflect serious societal judgments that in many cases criminal records should be destroyed in order to avoid further harming those accused and not convicted those convicted of minor crimes or those whose convictions have been expunged by pardons These laws are supported by organizations usually sensitive to First Amendment concerns such as the American Civil Liberties Union But the rapid spread of such laws is among the most troublesome developments of the privacy explosion Not the least problem posed by such statutes is their interference with any ability of the press to scrutinize criminal justice agencies Cases which are not pursued by the prosecution for political reasons or dismissed by the courts  either because of corruption or incompetence  could not be followed if arrest records were not available Exposes in the press such as the 1972 St Louis GlobeDemocrat series which disclosed trafficticket fixing in the city courts and which led to the removal of two judges and the chief clerk and to criminal indictments would be all but impossible to develop Similarly scrutiny of a multiple arrest record of an individual who was not later convicted of any crimes may lead to the conclusion that he had been unjustly persecuted or perhaps that some kind of favoritism had led to a failure to convict an obviously culpable party In either event society would benefit from exposure of the very information such statutes seek to destroy The case against destruction of conviction records is if anything even stronger Courtrooms after all are public property trials as the Supreme Court has observed are public events and convictions are matters of the greatest public consequence The notion that an individual may be duly accused tried and convicted of a crime and that no record may lawfully be kept on his conviction is Orwellian in its implications It involves the destruction of history of truth in the name of privacy It would even prohibit citizens from learning if a candidate for schoolboard president or United States President had committed crimes which bear directly on his capacity to serve in office In Britain the situation is even more forbidding There it is a crime to publish the fact of a prior conviction if an individual has not served more than 30 months in prison and has not been arrested again within seven years Thus if an English equivalent of Spiro Agnew if that can be imagined should run for Parliament eight years after his felony conviction no mention could be made of the conviction in the British press A striking example of the differences between the British and American legal systems may be seen in the fact that because of its references to the Sipple case this very article would under British law constitute a contempt of court thus subjecting its author and the editor and publisher of this newspaper to fines or jail sentences Under British law all such references would have been illegal since that case is still before the courts  where it may remain for years Through American eyes it surely seems a strange way for a free nation to function  There is another side to the rapid development of privacy law in recent years one that is far more appealing and surely less threatening than that involving the press It stems from the conclusion of the Supreme Court that against abuses by the government itself the Constitution affords significant privacy protection Once again Brandeis is most to be credited  this time more affirmatively with the development of this body of law In a stirring and subsequently much quoted 1928 dissenting opinion in a case involving government wiretapping he observed that the makers of our Constitution had conferred as against the government the right to be let  alone  the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men  The Constitution itself was later held to afford privacy not only from direct government surveillance and intrusion but from governmental intrusions into a wide range of deeply personal decisions These included the right to marry regardless of the race of ones spouse the right to purchase contraceptives the right to an abortion and other decisions relating to family relationships and child rearing In one recent decision of this type Justice Brennan concluded If the right of privacy means anything it is the right of the individual married or single to be free from unwanted governmental intrusions into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child  In other areas it is surprising that protection against government interference into deeply private decisions has not been extended still further It remains inexplicable that the courts can continue to rule as they have that homosexuals may be subjected to criminal prosecution for sexual practices in private beif anything expansion Frather than contraction of privacy law may be expected in the future To the extent any such expansion relates to the protection of the individual from the government Brandeiss eloquent 1928 formulation remains the last word To protect the right to be left alone he wrote every unjustifiable intrusion by the government upon the privacy of the individual whatever the means employed must be deemed a violation of the [Constitution]  To the extent privacy law is expanded so as to make it still riskier or more difficult for the press to publish the truth a quite different conclusion may be drawn It is now 87 years  four score and seven  since Brandeis and Warren drafted their article Is it too late to say they were 
Panama Gives The Senate Its Big Chance,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/21/archives/panama-gives-the-senate-its-big-chance.html,WASHINGTONAside from a few participating hearings in the capital the members of the United States Senate are away touring tobacco auctions or senior citizens centers or visiting Cuba But in September it will be the Senates turn to reassert itself in a city that has become unusually fascinated with the House and its Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr For many years the Senate has been accustomed being regarded as the upper chamber but the combination of this years issues the Senates new leaders and the changing character of the House has altered that at least for the time being Many domestic issues on the Congressional agendaenergy welfare Social Securityhave been related to taxation and the Constitution requires tax bills to originate in the House That requirement has been one reason why Senator Russell B Long of Louisiana and his Finance Committee have taken a back seat The Senates traditional leading role on foreign affairs has been asserted occasionally in demanding Presidential consultation with Congress on Korean troop withdrawals and in diluting House restrictions on foreign aid But on most issues there has been an obvious deference to a new Administration getting its act in shape President Carters proposed Panama Canal treaty changes all that The Senate must ratify or reject treaties Whether it is put off until January or formally taken up in a fall session already crowded by the energy legislation the canal treaty and the issues it raises are certain claim a large share of the Senates attention The treaty poses great difficulties for the Majority Leader Robert C Byrd of West Virginia He has withdrawn the opposition he expressed in 1975 to any reduction United States control over the canal and now professes an open mind  The treaty is also a delicate matter for Senate Republicans They and their leader Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee have thrived this year by picking their fights carefully and standing their ground where they could expect unity But this conflict with the Administration is forced upon them for the canal issue rouses party conservatives and may become a litmus test for those with Presidential ambitions like Mr Baker There are also other issues that may bring the Senate to the fore in the months ahead The new Congressional concern for ethics has touched the Senate less than the House it voted to rescind its own ban on using outside money for office accounts but it is beginning to worry about the possible involvement of Senators in the alleged influencebuying by Korean Government agents It may that Senators are simply less corrupt but they also lack an effective noisy claque of junior members raising clamor on the issue That lack may explain why the House investigated Florida Representative Robert Sikess banking deals much harder than the Senate looked at Senator Hugh Scotts Gulf Oil connection On some issues the Senate has already left its stamp The standards for auto and other emissions adopted by the conference committee considering amendments to the Clean Air Act were closer to the Senate than the House version On water projects it was the Senates narrower list that was approved for funding On abortions the Senate is still insisting on a more liberal policy than the House although the issue has not been settled But substance may be overlooked for substance with style and Mr ONeills dramatic leadership of a House that has gone without leadership for some years has helped put the Senate in the shade Inevitably Mr ONeill is compared with Senator Byrd Some of the conclusions drawn from these comparisons are significant Mr ONeill seems more at ease with President Carter and has seized opportunities to make himself useful Mr ONeill also seems more interested personally in issues getting involved either directly or indirectly in far more of them than does the West Virginian But some of the apparent differences between the two men result from differences in the institutions they lead The House is too big to work without strong leadership In contrast Senators are individually too important or think they are to work with heavyhanded leadership Mr Byrd got to be leader because he understood that understood the importance of catering to Senators and of working things out Mr Byrd appears to be considerably more effective at this type of leadership than his predecessor Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana But Mr Mansfield focussed his attentionand the Senatesmore on issues especially foreign policy Because of his long tenure in the office moreover Mr Mansfield became a Washington fixture man whose speeches were covered and whose views were sought Mr Byrd shows little likelihood of becoming a fixture but he manages the Senates time effectively so that the Senate is ready to tackle energy the canal issue and a few more chores this fall Mr ONeill has said that for him to make an imposing record as a Speaker and for Mr Carter to succeed as a President they must be able to cooperate and avoid vetoes In the Senate however where prerogatives mean so much more and where institutional rivalries with the executive branch have dominated events for many years Mr Byrd is far less prepared to carry Mr Carters burdens He describes himself as Mr Carters friend but not his man and he is constantly alert to Administration slights of the Senate He also confronts a proportionately bigger Republican minority than Mr ONeill facesa minority that can thwart action when it is determined to do so On energy however that determination is not evident  With these dfficulties Mr Byrd and the Senate Democrats cannot deliver for the Administration as easily their House counterparts but they too have promised important achievements this year Mr Byrd is singularly proud of having the Senate keep to a schedule so that he can keep his commitments Congressional leaders ONeill of the House and Byrd of the Senate
"Again, Back‐Alley and Self‐Induced Abortions’",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/22/archives/again-backalley-and-selfinduced-abortions.html,WASHINGTONIn 1973 the United States Supreme Court ruled that an abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy is a matter to be decided on by a woman and her physician It is therefore particularly disappointing that recent Congressional action would deny the realization of that decision for poor women by prohibiting Medicaid funding for elective abortions Since welltodo and middleclass women are not dependent on Medicaid funds the effect will be to condemn indigent women to backalley and selfinduced abortions On the basis of past statistics 250 women will die annually and some 25000 others will suffer serious medical complications or infections from such abortions Abortion is sometimes characterized as a womens issue and many would say that not all women are in agreement about it This is true yet it is also true that if the Congress was truly representative so that the percentage of women in Congress was 513 percent as we are in the population the Hyde Amendment never would have passed The real reason for having more women in government is not just to provide increased earning power for women but rather to allow for representation of a viewpoint that for too long has been excluded The facts of Medicaid abortions have not been accurately presented to the American people Usually the question is posed this way Do you believe Federal funds should be used to pay for abortions The mental picture evoked is one of women on welfare getting abortion after abortion at taxpayers expense The facts are that of all those receiving Medicaid abor tionsand regrettably there were znn Ann of them last vearonethird were teenagers and some 15000 girls under the age of 14 Teenagers usually deny their pregnancy until late in the term These teenagers according to a study by Dr Nicholas E Wright of the Population Council are highrisk mothers who have a significantly higher maternal and infantmortality rate than do mothers over 20 In many instances the physical and emotional wellbeing of the mother is best served by termination of the pregnancy How many young girls are doomed to early motherhood A life on welfare established before the age of 20 often dooms a young girl before she has any chance to make an attempt at life I wish that these women could have had the benefit of family planning because I for one do not encourage abortion and I definitely do not favor abortion as a familyplanning technique However until not long ago social workers were prohibited from providing familyplanning information to indigent women and even today they are restricted in many states We haVe not even discussed the special problems of the woman who is raped the victim of incest or the woman with serious health problems The basic premise which we cannot overlook is that if the Government will not pay for an indigent womans abortion she cannot afford to go elsewhere We are establishing one law for those who can afford to pay while saying to the indigent that they must abide by another Yvonne Brathwaite Burke a Democrat represents Californias 28th District in the House The facts of Medicaid abortions have not been accurately presented to the American people

Government were billed 79 million for 23800 abortions between 1975 and last week when the state stopped subsidizing the procedure NonMedicaid abortions would have cost 395 million less statistics

condemning the march have recently been circulating in Pamplona raising fears that rightists would try to break up the rally The Interior Ministry reported last night that the presence of terrorist groups had been detected in the Basque country but did not elaborate This week there have been sporadic clashes in San Sebastian between the police and demonstrators protesting the arrest in France of an alleged Basque guerrilla leader Miguel Angel Apalategui who is wanted in Spain on charges of murder and kidnapping Queen Names Mediator In Dutch Political Crisis THE HAGUE Aug 27 ReuterA mediator

demand were rejected by the Chistian Democrat leader Andreas van Agt a staunch Roman Catholic Queen Juliana has given Dr Veringa more scope than Mr den Uyl had asking him to study possibilities of forming a cabinet that could have a sufficient measure of support in Parliament Mr den Uyl had been asked to form a majority cabinet in Parliament
Sexual Bias In Medicine,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/28/archives/sexual-bias-in-medicine.html,DURING a protracted wait in my gynecolo gists inner office not long ago I picked up a book from his desk called Search the Scriptures Modem Medicine and Biblical Personages by Dr Robert B Greenblatt Lippincott Noting that the first edition 1963 had sold 100000 copies and that this was the sixth printing of the second edition 1968 I was curious to see what new doors to the Bible can be flung open in the light of modern scientific knowledge and curious to see what my own doctor reads in his spare time Here are a few of the passages I jotted down The way of a man with a maid despite the awe of Proverbs is an open book It is basic and physiologic and wonderful for all men worthy of the name man But the way of a maid with a man is frequently beyond comprehension    Most men are easily aroused sexually most women accept or reject passively The frigid female refuses to accept a subordinate position to the stronger sex and does not enjoy marital relations The nymphomaniac has an insatiable sex drive she constantly pursues gratification however elusive and fleeting An overwhelming sexual urge in other women is the expression of either an overabundance of certain hormones  or extreme endorgan sensitivity Menstruation is truly Natures curse on Eve If this is the kind of wisdom modern gynecologists dispense and consume in the introduction Dr Walter Alvarez hails Greenblatt as fine friendly and full of understanding one can perhaps appreciate the urgency and anger that inform the following two books A massively researched feminist attack on the medical professions approach to women and femalerelated diseases Womens Health Care The Hidden Malpractice is a disturbing at times irritating enormously impressive work Its author Gene Corea is an investigative reporter and former author of the syndicated column Frankly Female She begins by reviewing the history of the systematic elimination women from medical practice in the United States Although most of the colonies original healers were women a tradition that had existed in England and Europe until the execution of some four million witches from 1479 to 1735 effectively decimated the ranks of female health practitioners at the end of the Revolutionary War a male medical elite began to band against women through a complex campaign of licensing legislation harassment restrictive medical school admissions policies propaganda about the biological frailty and emotional instability of women and a repeatedly asserted belief that womens proper sphere was home and hearth Members of minority groups and the poor were also kept out of the growing profession Except for a brief resurgence of women healers irregular doctors during the Popular Health Movement in the second half of the 19th century women were all but excluded from the field through the early 1900s Even today only 9 percent of the countrys doctors are women although due to the womens movement the percentage of female medical students is now rising but as of 1974 their median income was about twofifths that of equivalently educated male doctors Its of interest that although 75 percent of all health workers are women they are among the lowest paid groups in the nation Moreover 95 percent of all gynecologists are men which brings us to the second and major section of the book Do sex stereotypes and hidden biases rather than pure science affect the health care women receive Would an almost entirely male medical professionfree to define female health and diseasehave something to do with femalefocused contraceptive research with unnecessary female surgery with the inaccessibility of abortions aria sterilizations and with the lack of attention to menstrual and menopausal disorders Would it have something to do with the notion that most female health problems are psychogenic Men describe symptoms women complain Is that why moodaltering drugs are prescribed for more than twice the percentage of women than men Is that why hysterectomies are now the second most frequently performed operation in the country despite the high rate of complications Corea notes that gynecologists often give a hard sell approach stating that removing the uterusif one plans to have no more childrenwill save you from the risk of developing cancer in it later I once received the same advice myself and was not told that the death rate from uterine cancer is less than the mortality rate from hysterectomy Is it really so radical for women to propose that men be barred from gynecology It for example the medical profession were femalecontrolled wouldnt men demand male urologists In fact there were only 9 female urologists in the United States in 1974 Corea looks closest at the health issues that affect women most venereal diseaselittle or no instruction given by gynecologists to women on available methods of prophylaxis and detection although venereal disease is often asymptomatic in women and therefore more likely to go untreated than in men the Pillinsufficient testing of its side effects and consequences prior to FDA approval and insufficient warning to female consumers of the risks now discovered the usual justification being that population control particularly among the indigent is more important than the possible effects on the individual IUDs DepoProvera and tubal ligationsthe latter sometimes performed without the womans permission or knowledge during abortions and Caesarian sections childbearingways in which the professions intervention in and scientizing of the process may contribute to the fact that we are 14th in infant and 10th in mortality rates among the industrial nations The most distressing chapter concerns the administration of Diethylstilbestrol to pregnant women to avert miscarriage It has now been found that the 21 million daughters born to those who received DES are much more likely to develop vaginal cancer than the rest of the female population To date no government or medical agency or drug company has made a nationwide effort to locate and inform DES mothers and daughters of the need for close medical observation whats worse most DES daughters are now of college age and the morningafter pill which is also composed of DES is frequently prescribed on campuses as a postcoital contraceptive If the estimated risk of pregnancy for a single unprotected coitus is only 4 percent the risk such medication to DES daughters in particular but also to the female population in general is incalculably greater than the risk of conception Corea concludes chat knowledge and control of our bodies is the most urgent priority facing women today Even it you arent able to share delight in the new feminist rituals of selfexamination it does pay to have an informed overview of your condition as you wait your turn in the doctors officereading about the wonderful ways of a man with a maid A somewhat different but compatible historical perspective emerges from Doctors Wanted No Women Need Apply which offers a subtle and sophisticated analysis of an area largely bypassed Coreas nook In the late 19th century as medical training and practice were increasingly professionalized and irregular doctors and schools disappeared regular medical schools began to admit women students under the pressure of feminist demands and feminist financial and psychological support At Tufts for example women accounted for 42 percent of the graduates by 1900 and 6 percent of the nations physicians were women in 1910 Such remarkable gains proved temporary however and Mary Roth Walsh an associate professor of psychology and American studies at the University of Lowell Mass demonstrates the way in which the medical establishment successfully reversed the trend of womens expansion into the profession in this century and certainly prevented women doctors from attaining positions of power Not only were quota systems instituted at medical schools Harvard didnt admit its first female medical student until 1945 but more important those women who did squeeze through the barriers were denied access to financial aid to internships to state medical societies to hospital appointments to the command of medical institutions and to the critical old boy network of professional patronage In addition every effort was made by the medical fraternity to publicly discredit women physicians because of their unwomanly ambition their monthly infirmity their excessive sexuality their conflicting domestic and career responsibilities the real fear was that the feminization of the profession would lower its status and reduce fees since the majority of health care consumers are women there was also considerable worry that women patients might prefer women doctors altogether Walshs concern expressed in her concluding chapters is that the current resurgence of female medical students and physicians may stimulate a similar backlash and that radical feminist energies which are now channeled into the womens health collective movement will divert attention and support away from women entering the medical mainstreamleaving them isolated and politically powerless to affect reforms Although both these books share a feminist orientation they have the kind of polemical brilliance and documentation that make them fascinating to readanti not for women only  WOMENS HEALTH CARE The Hidden Malpractice By Gena Corea 316 pp New

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/29/archives/letters.html,To the Editor The editorial on Aug 17 The Cruel Cost of the Minimum Wage states that a 265 minimum wage will destroy the jobs of those at the very bottom This assertion is not supported by past experiences with minimum wage increases No reviewand there have been statutoryrequired annual reviewsof the effects of minimum wage by either a Republican or a Democratic Administration has ever shown the disemployment effects asserted by the editorial And employment has in fact increased immediately following every minimum wage adjustment since 1938 The editorial correctly points out that a subminimum wage for youth would be an incentive to hire the young at the expense of others As you aptly point out many studies indicate that a subminimum for youth may displace adult workers who support families Raising the minimum wage assures that the lowest paid keep pace with changes in the economy and also assures that consumer purchasing power is enhanced Thus increases in the minimum wage have positive stimulative effects on the economy generally and on employment specifically in this way countering negative effects of higher costs to employers The editorial states that business hires workers only if their labor produces earnings at least equal to their wages But the editorial assumes that all employers currently pay wages equal to the value of a workers output that such productivity is easily measured and that over time the productivity of workers is decreasing in real terms None of these assump tions are true But this minimum wage bill guarantees that an hours labor is recompensed by a floor of at least 265 per hour worked You also propose in effect that taxpayers subsidize employers Who are unwilling to pay a decent minimum wage A basic concept in our society is that a persons labor should be rewarded with a wage sufficient for selfsupport without resorting to welfare That concept requires an up dating of the minimum wage as proposed in HR 3744 and S 1871 in order to maintain the real worth of an hours labor As to the closing comment that Minimum wage legislation has no place in a strategy to eliminate poverty I call to your attention a statement by then Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz in one of the aforementioned annual reports The Fair Labor Standards Act is an effective weapon in the war onpoverty RUDY OSWALD Director Department of Research AFLCIO Washington Aug 18 1977 To the Editor By your logic if the minimum wage is increased thousands of jobs will be lost thereby creating intense competition among the unskilled for those jobs that remain Following this reasoning if we were to abandon the minimum wage altogether there would be happily lots more jobs Great What this country needs is more people working even further below the poverty level than there are already But why penalize the unskilled just to keep profits up and prices down What we really need is a higher minimum wage covering all laborers Then let consumers decide whether to pay the resulting higher prices for goods and services they now enjoy at the expense of underpaid workers at artificially low prices So we need more jobs Why shouldnt industry take a hand After all more effective consumers means more profits Wouldnt it be more economical to provide business with tax incentives for creating meaningful jobs and jobtraining programs than to subsidize people holding jobs at substandard pay levels In any event the concept of maintaining one category of substandard pay for unskilled workers supporting families and another for unskilled teenagers doing the same jobs cannot be sustained no matter how we attempt to distort justicesocial constitutional or otherwise THOMAS P MEGAN New York Aug 18 1977  To the Editor Your Aug 17 editorial seems to argue that if a raise in the minimum wage cant provide a weekend barbecue or a firstrun movie its not worth the increase Try telling minimum wage workers theres no difference between 84784 and 5512 a year Then tell them their 40 hours a week 52weeksayear job isnt worth a 728 annual increase this year when their Congressional representatives voted themselves a 12900 annual increase The history of FLSA clearly belies the contention that an increase in the minimum wage causes unemployment All that exists is questionable data which suggest that some new jobs might not be created that might have been if the minimum were not increased Hardly the kind of data on which to base any kind of conclusions Indeed Secretary Marshall sent a clarification of his testimony on S 1S71 when he was misquoted about 90 000 jobs being lost by the increase What the Secretary said was Utilizing [Edward] Gramlichs data the Council of Economic Advisers estimated the potential disemployment effect of a 265 an hour minimum wage to be 90000 jobs This `disemployment effect does not relate to jobs which will be lost as a result of a higher minimum wage Rather the effect relates to jobs which may not come into existence in the private economy with a higher minimum wage standard And he concluded Finally since minimum wage increases benefit low wage workers with a high propensity to consume there is a stimulus to the economy Product demand increases and this in turn may lead to some increased employment We agree with your statement that a subminimum wage for youth will not help the young people in Harlem But for example it will fatten the coffers of the fast food chains The Timess call for job creation is welcome Both the public service jobs bill and the youth employment measure passed by Congress this year are desirable starts in addressing these problems of unemployment But even there we must pay wages adjusted to current standards so that workers in these new jobs can manage in todays economy CLARENCE MITCHELL Chairman Coalition for a Fair Minimum Wage Washington Aug 19 1977 Cost of Punishment To the Editor One of your readers Mr Rohrberg presented you [letter Aug 22] with a computation of the costs of keeping a murderer or terrorist in jail for 35 years Starting with the only correct figure in his computation the daily maintenance cost of 2482 he arrives at a total maintenance cost for a prisoner of 818145 Since such figures have a way of reappearing in public debate especially if catchily headed the 818145 factor you might care tb note that assuming an interest rate of 6 percent a 35year daily annuity of 2482 can be bought for about 132000 This would be the maintenance amount saved by execution Inflation is beside the point If prices rise the value of money falls Still a considerable amount but less than onesixth of Mr Rohrbergs faulty amount Assuming that we continue the execution rate of the last five years prior to the temporary suspension of the death penalty we shall execute on the average two persons per year and the country will thereby save maintenance expense of about 264000 Deduct from this amount the value of the services the prisoner might produce during these 35 years deduct the extravagant extra costs of capital trials and their review in the higher courts many of which would not take place because a guilty plea would replace themand you arrive at an even smaller figure Perhaps Mr Rohrbergs arithmetic was carried astray by his Hitlerian vision of thousands of such criminals whose execution would save perhaps more than a billion dollars  and make us all happy and rich HANS ZEISEL Professor Emeritus University of Chicago Law School Chicago Aug 23 1977 On Abortion and a Constitutional Convention To the Editor A pageone news story in the Aug 17 issue of The Times Catholics Beginning an Extended Drive Against Abortion reported that nine states have sanctioned a constitutional bar against the practice In point of fact nine states have taken the unprecedented action of petitioning Congress to call a constitutional convention for the purpose of framing an amendment that would make it a crime for any woman to have an abortion On July 12 the Pennsylvania House voted 127 to 64 for such a bill and Senate hearings are to be held this session To date at the behest of the right to life forces such bills have been passed in Arkansas Indiana Louisiana Missouri Massachusetts New Jersey Rhode Island South Dakota and Utah In each of a dozen or so other states a bill is either still pending as in Pennsylvania has been defeated or did not come before both houses prior to adjournment In New York the Senate passed a petitioning bill shortly before adjournment Doubtless in states that have not yet voted decisively the legislation will be reintroduced in 1978 and predictably in still others If and when 34 states the necessary twothirds call for a constitutional convention could such a convention be expected to confine its deliberations to the abortion issue Prof Charles Black of the Yale Law School holds that given the wording of Article V a new convention could propose whatever amendments it might choose Yale Law Journal 82 189 199 1972 Prof Laurence Tribe of the Harvard Law School when testifying before the Judiciary Committee of the Massachusetts House and Senate on April 4 pointed to the inevitably great risks and uncertainties that the first convention since 1787 would entail He declared It should be reserved for an occasion on which Congress itself seems to present an intolerable threat to the states Yet the Massachusetts Legislature voted in due course for the convention petition The holding of a new convention could precipitate a nationwide convulsion Article V does not specify how delegates would be selected or paid Attempts could be made to rewrite the Constitution in whole or in part At this juncture it would be helpful if the national press were to become more alert to what is transpiring in the state legislatures DOROTHY DUNBAR BROMLEY Kennett Square Pa Aug 24 1977 LIRR Sufferers To the Editor Long Island Rail Road commuters should be inured to the many excuses offered for train delays faulty airconditioning or heating standing room only and assorted other indignities for which we pay a high price But now theres a new excuse For over a year the escalator on tracks 1516 has been out of order Last week we decided to find out why After numerous calls and after being shunted between the LIRR and Penn Station authorities we finally found a helpful soul at Amtrak which now owns the property It seems that responsibility for tracks 1516 is shared by MTA and Amtrak and because they still havent worked out who pays for what on those tracks neither will issue the order for the necessary repair work In the meantime the escalator remains inoperative and guess which already overburdened and longsuffering group has to endure another inconvenience albeit minor in this instance One solution would be to repair the escalator now and allocate such interim costs retroactively when an agreement is worked out That might also demonstrate an unusual concept ie the public interest comes first LOUIS KRUH Merrick Li Aug 22 1977 Parking and Pollution To the Editor The Mayor the parking authorities the President the Washington committees and the Federal courts can go on and on about seeking a way to control traffic flow and correct our environment The solution of course is to provide the proper guidance and funds for safe clean rapid mass transportation all of which is available if put into proper priorities On the one hand we are being presented with Westway and other ways of buying storing and driving more and more automobiles On the other after we take the bait we are being punished for doing so Its called a double message Charlie Wilson said it first Whats good

CARTER AIDES FAVOR SHIFT IN PRIMARY RULE,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/31/archives/carter-aides-favor-shift-in-primary-rule-seek-to-raise-minimum-vote.html,KNOXVILLE Tenn Aug 30White House political aides are trying to smooth the way for President Carters renomination in 1980 by making it harder for minor candidates to win delegates and Democratic Party liberals today accused them of trying to stifle opposition At issue is a proposal pushed by White House officials to raise the minimum vote required for a candidate to win delegates to 25 percent from 15 percent Under it candidates getting less than a quarter of the vote in a Congressional district would get none of its delegates in the primary The change would not only reduce the number of delegates won by trailing candidates but would also increase the value of coming in first already a major media prize In a crowded early primary a candidate with 26 percent of the vote could easily win all of the delegates elected in a Congressional district The issue is expected to be hotly debated next month in Detroit when the partys Commission on Presidential Nomination and Party Structure the current instrument for the Democrats rewriting of their rules meets to make recommendations for the party hierarchy for the rules for 1980 Liberals Are Critical Mark Siegel deputy assistant to the President for policy analysis defended the change as a necessary mechanism to build consensus He said in a telephone interview that it had substantial support in the 58member commission and that he expected that an even higher level perhaps 30 percent might be proposed at the meeting on Sept 10 and 11 But several liberals were openly critical One of them Torn Whitney the former Iowa state Democratic chairman angrily disputed this view He said the move represents art effort to stifle dissent in the party Mr Whitney said to a telephone interview that the plan was intended to exclude candidates who might become serious contenders later and to prevent candidates who may be offering a single issue campaign like the antiabortion candidate Ellen McCormack last year from running I think she ought to be heard too he said The 25 percent idea was suggested at the commissions August meeting in Washington by political scientists who contended it would be helpful by excluding fringe candidacies And Rick Hutcheson staff secretary at the White House who was Mr Carters chief nonprimary delegate hunter in 1976 called it a valuable cohesion building mechanism clearly implying that it had Carter Administration support Mr Siegel until this year executive director of the Democratic National Committee defended the 25 percent plan further by saying it was required to overcome the splintering effects of a rules change voted at the Democratic National Convention last year That move required proportional representation insuring minority representation in all state delegations In past years states with delegates elected separately from the socalled beauty contest primaries provided major portions of the voting strength far beyond the beauty contest percentages that was necessary to build up a convention majority For example in 1976 Mr Carter got 523 percent of the Ohio primary vote and won 126 of the states 152 Demoratic delegates One feature of proportional representation that a 25 percent rule would damage is the likelihood that in a year with three or more fairly solid candidates proportional representation with a 15 percent cutoff could split up delegations so thoroughly that no one would come into a convention with a commanding position Another opponent Richard G Stearns who is a commission member like Mr Siegel Mr Whitney and Mr Hutcheson said the proposal had an unrecognized potential to infuriate people Mr Stearns Senator George McGoverns delegate hunter in 1972 said If a candidate in an early primary finishes second with 23 percent of the vote and gets no delegates his followers will have to be reckoned with

One Day In a City's Life,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/02/archives/one-day-in-a-citys-life.html,WASHINGTON Sept 1 For the people who have to govern this country and even for those who have to report and analyze the news the events of the last day of August 1977 around here were almost enough to make you think that life is a little complicated For example on this one day Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall announced that unemployment among black young people in the United States this summernearly 35 percent was the highest ever recorded by his department Over all white and black youth unemployment was 153 percent The same day a Federal judge in Virginia ordered Secretary Marshall and the Labor Department to approve the importation of about 5000 foreign workers to pick apples in nine Border and Northeastern states because it seems we wont do our own work Mr Marshall called it an alarming precedent Also on the same day the Department of Human Resources of the District of Columbia announced that last year there were onethird more legal abortions in Washington than live births12945 abortions to 9635 births 57 percent of the abortions paid for by the Federal Medicaid program which stopped financing such abortions last month And on the last day of August 1977 Amtrak the Governments latest experiment in public transportation announced that it was cutting its services in the WashingtonPhiladelphiaNew YorkBoston corridor and increasing its fares because while the American people were calling for public transportation they werent using it enough to avoid a 50millionayear operating deficit James Schlesinger the new energy chief has the same problem Like President Carter he keeps insisting that there is a critical energy crisis in this country which threatens the nations freedom and that we have to conserve and slow down But the evidence so far is that most people are not listening or slowing down and the imports of gas and oil are going up at an alarming rate Secretary Marshalls dilemma dramatizes the problem Faced with a court order to bring in 5000 foreign workers to pick apples while he is trying to put millions of unemployed Americans to work he defied the court order I am deeply concerned he said that the importation of this large number of foreign workers will deprive about 3000 American workers of needed jobs I know the growers prefer foreign workers because they find them more docile than domestic workers But with unemployment at 69 percentalmost seven million Americans out of workthis is not a valid consideration    We intend Secretary Marshall said to take every legal and administrative step at our disposal to prevent this unfortunate order from taking effect But of course Secretary Marshall who is one of the most reflective and underestimated members of the Carter Cabinet is going to lose For by the time he took every legal and administrative step the apples would have rotted on the trees The problem is that the Administration has no effective policy to put our own unemployed to work in the orchards and in the end will have to import workers from Mexico Jamaica and elsewhere many of whom will remain in the country Is illegal aliens against the policy of the Carter Government The basic problem which the Administration has grappled with seriously but hasnt yet solved is how to train and put young unemployed Americans black and white to work on the jobs that clearly have to be done And beyond thisa harder but maybe more important problemhow to help Mexico and our neighbors in the Caribbean to improve their economies so as to provide work and keep their people at home Wayne A Cornelius associate pro fessor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has pointed out after many years of careful study of this problem that the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on policing the border and catching the illegal aliens might be more effective if they were spent on improving the economy of Mexico and providing jobs to keep their unemployed from going north The Carter Administration is working on all this at home and abroad but it is a devilish tangle What to do about the alarming rate of young people out of work in America What to do about the work that has to be done but that our own people wont do How to face up to more abortions than births in the capital of the Republic with or without Federal abortion funds These questions obviously baffle the policymakers and even the scribblers have to sympathize with their problems It was just an accident that so many dilemmas surfaced on Aug 31 I977 At any other time you could probably have found the same catalogue of bewildering dilemmas WASHINGTON
NOW's President: ‘I Definitely See the Movement Coming of Age’,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/02/archives/nows-president-i-definitely-see-the-movement-coming-of-age.html,WASHINGTONLife is full of small awakenings some more rude and vivid than others and here are a few of Eleanor Cutri Smeals keeping score for her fathers boys baseball team when she was a girl and realizing years later how much she had yearned to play instead watching her Neopolitan mother hit a boiling point when people would ask why good money was being wasted on sending a girl child to college making Phi Beta Kappa at Duke and being dissuaded from attending law school spending a year bedridden after the birth of her second child and mulling over the reasons why so many women have chronic illnesses going to a bridge party one night to discover that every young suburban matron in the room was on tranquilizers except her And somewhere at the end of all those tiny turning points came another whose moment and circumstances Ellie Smeal cannot exactly pinpoint but which gives her the pleasure of sharp memory She says with a grin There isnt anybody including myself who when they first said it could really believe what they were saying and that they were saying it but at some point I said to myself I am a feminist Now of course Mrs Smeal is a feminist cum laude the first housewife to be elected president of the National Organization for Women which with some 700 chapters and 65000 members is the largest organization devoted to feminism in America But sitting in the rather bare NOW offices in the Pennsylvania Building here the 38yearold woman with the thatch of black hair wants to stress that she was elected to a twoyear term in April not because she is someone special but because she is someone ordinary A Housewife and a Mother I am representative of the membership of this organization Mrs Smeal said smacking her open hand down on a conference table I am a housewife and I am a mother and I am interested in homemakers issues because they are things that have happened in my life Now people will have to realize that the caricature is myth that feminists are people like me who did stay home who do have husbands who are not in it for any political gain They want to kill the messenger who brings the bad news because its what were saying that really upsets them not usthat we are going to bring about profound changes that will transform the way half the people treat the other half  So in pursuit of that Ellie Smeal has given up a good half of her lifemuch of her time in a suburb of Pittsburgh with her husband Charles a metallurgist and their children Tod 13 and Lori 9to pursue the half that began in 1970 when she and her husband attended their first NOW meeting She dearly loves both parts but it is crucial time for her cause The equal rights amendment is stalled three states from ratification Government funds for abortion have been stoppered by a Supreme Court decision and with antifeminist groups growing increasingly vocal there is some public skepticism about whether the movement is still well or even alive I definitely see the movement coming of age especially among women like me said Mrs Smeal without hesitation We are really just beginning to touch our potential Epitaphs are written for us every year and lets be honest75 and 76 were times of regrouping especially for us here It was controversial and there was fighting and we aired our linen but now I think there is a real sense of renewed purpose despite or maybe because of some of these setbacks Unhappy With Carter Obviously with the abortion decisionand President Carters response to it condoning itIm more than disappointed Im horrified she said I havent given up on him yet although I dont think theres a feminist organization in this country that is happy with the President on that count or with his level of participation in the ERA He has a unique position in history to free his people and we hope hell take it This is a unique time for all of us and thats why I agreed to do this Mrs Smeal continued I would have rather not If they could have found anyone who could have broughtwell there were people who thought I brought something special to the job and that my background as a homemaker would change some images Otherwise I would not have wanted to spend so much time away from home Still her family fends wellactually theyve decided Im the one who has it harderwhile she roams the country works here on administrative tasks and helps formulate plans for the National Womens Conference to be held in Houston in November Last weekend while women all over the country were walking to show their support of the ERA Mrs Szneal was walking all over the country marching in walkathons in Los Angeles on Thursday Washington on Friday and New York on Saturday On Sunday she restedor came as close to that as she ever does One male political figure asked me if I ever took a vacation from this she said and I said no I didnt because there was no place to go nowhere I could be where I was not confronted with sex discrimination And so for seven years I have eaten slept lived and breathed feminism and after Im not president of NOW I still will until there is no more discrimination And even I admit that will take some time The little victories no one notices therefore come first and the attempts to recast the misconceptions There is not a feminist leader in this country Mrs Smeal said who has not had to explain that there is no burning of bras and that unisex toilets are not the issue The distortions are huge and Ill give you an example In Floridanaturally the state where it would most prey on the fears of elderly peoplethe Stop ERA forces said that the amendment would take away homemakers benefits and destroy the Social Security system No Benefits Mrs Smeal inhaled marshaling her breath and her facts and continued Now this is a big lie of the worst sort because one there are no homemakers benefits there are only survivors benefits for widows as I found out when I was sick and couldnt afford the price of child care Two Social Security already discriminates against women in a way it could not continue with the ERA But three it will not destroy Social Securitythats ridiculous Mr Califano [Joseph A Califano Jr Secretary of Health Education and Welfare] has said that is not true And last of all who was saying all this Women from the right wing who are politically opposed to Social Security to begin with I get very excited about these invented issues ince the question of the draft and the ERA she said I really wish we hada world where there were no wars and military service was unnecessary I always say that first But lets face itwomen have always been involved in wars The civilian casualties are women children old people On the streets violent crime is directed against women If the Congress wanted to draft women they could there are no special protections And if the ERA were passed Congress could exempt women from military service too if they saw fit Mrs Smeal shook her head So many distortions from people who have so much to lose because the poor and the disenfranchised would finally get their rights Mrs Smeal finds herself right now on the front lines of battle facing nationwide conference that some consider a likely field for fulfillment of every misogynists dream of a good oldfashioned female fracas Although she tried to stress the positive side of the Houston gathering the agenda to be devised Mrs Smeal eventually addressed herself to the rumors of conflict She exhibited several posters allegedly exhibited at one state conference by the Missouri Ku Klux Klan belittling gay rights fags ERA and NOW I have to laugh at myself she said because Im not so sure I thought these things still happened Next Stop Houston So Ellie Smeal armed with the spiral notebook she carries into an interview and then never refers to because all the statistics and percentages were long ago committed to memory looks toward Houston with a couple of stops in Pittsburgh along the way to draw little solace from her egalitarian home life But even though Charlie and I have what I consider an egalitarian relationship and both of us believe our income is equally ours if something should happen to our union the law does not recognize that And though we try to give our children equal opportunityboth of them by the way are mathematically inclined  theres no question that Lori will eventually have more of an uphill struggle in that field The progress we make has to be larger than the individual It has to be larger than the continuing series of small awakenings some more rude and vivid than others that are still Ellie Smears the parents of a girl permitted to play Little League ball because of a NOW suit who say But were no Womens Lib or the professional woman who says that she is certainly glad to be a doctor lawyer Indian chief but she has no time for that feminist nonsense We fought for her to be that said Ellie Smeal and I wont be happy until I hear her say I believe in the full rights of women under the law and I will fight to the death for the right of another woman to take my place when I am through
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/02/archives/letters.html,To the Editor The implementation of womens right to decide whether to bear children has been addressed by the Federal Government in the past few months With complete unanimity all three branches held that Medicaid funds need not or should not be available for abortions These actions are but part of a recent series which restrict womens rights The Medicaid decisions have been discussed for their impact on poor women and on American morality The incongruence between these determinations and the requirements of representative democracy have gone unremarked though not unnoticed Representative democracy relies for its legitimacy on the fair representation of interests within the polity Women are not given fair representation in any forum of national government The Supreme Court has not now nor has it ever had even one woman Similarly the US Senate is an allmale institution For me there was a painful poignancy in following the debate in that bodya debate in which not one womans voice was heardas to whether women must risk death or be permitted to choose abortion as to whether women victimized by rape and female children victimized by incest must bear the consequences of those heinous actions The 18thcentury American complaint against British rule was taxation without representation How much more substantial the complaint of lifes termination without representation In the House there are 18 women3 percent of the House membership to speak for 513 percent of the population In the executive branch HEW Secretary Joseph Califano Attorney General Griffin Bell and President Jimmy Carter have steadfastly opposed public funds for abortion despite organized criticism of this policy from key women in the Carter Administration They seem to feel no need to seek womens views let alone listen to them when they are expressed unsolicited For the position expressed by President Carters women appointees to be dismissed as disloyalty rather than to have been sought in the first place is a painful reminder that womens interests are not now adequately represented Women in all states and territories have gotten together to discuss abortion and other public policy matters where their interests are primary and where their interests have been bypassed The state meetings will culminate in Houston in a national meeting of women representing women These meetings were stimulated in part by our countrys Bicentennial celebrations when women vowedan oath reinforced by the recent Federal abortion decisionsNow must be the time as this nation begins its third century for us to become firstclass citizens RUTH B COWAN Chairperson NYC Commission on the Status of Women New York Aug 19 1977 To the Editor While the debate about responsibility for last months blackout continues to be in the news no mention is being made of Con Eds announcement of rate increases retroactive to late July The price rise is applied to summer rates effective May 15 to Oct 15 This timing it would appear is a gross anomaly The seasons duration is three months not five and October can hardly be called summer On more than one occasion in the past did October bring nearfreezing weather Moreover justification for higher rates in warmer months seems questionable and arbitrary Were this criterion applied generally ice cream vendors could fix their prices to be synchronized with rising temperatures or sellers of hot chestnuts could ask for more money as the windchill factor worsens The main point however is With such a long record of unsatisfactory service and with New York rates higher than those anywhere else in the country why are there no reported expressions of protest against this most recent rate increase by Con Edison MONICA GERAN New York Aug 18 1977 To the Editor I was one of those who thought that President Carters idea to combat pollution and waste of energy by levying taxes on trespassers of the law was unwise Not any more since I found out that Richard III of England 14521485 already heavily taxed the use of coal which produced noxious smoke And why did he choose the way of taxation Probably because Edward ls edict of 1273 which only prohibited the use of such coal proved ineffective I was not able though to find out whether the hanging of a London businessman for using prohibited coal occurred before or after the imposition of Richard IIIs antipollution tax Whatever it may be let us be grateful that President Carters program although built solidly upon a precedent case does not contain such severe retribution ALEXANDER BACZEWSKI Jamaica NY Aug 16 1977 To the Editor Really it is a shame that we do not have Nixon in the White House now Just think what happiness what virulence there would be on the Democratic side of the Congress with Senator Ribicoff and his associates going after some Nixon appointee of the same calmer as Lance Just think of all the fire and brimstone they would have been able to pour on Nixons head and someone in the position of Lance Too bad that we have to be deprived of this righteous indignation against such conduct that instead we have to have someone leaning over the bench to console such as Lance for the manner in which he was being crucified And our President Carter justifying as did Nixon the conduct of his friend and appointee HENRY L BURKITT Jamaica NY Aug 25 1977 To the Editor The Arab rulers appear to regard the advent of Mr Begin to power in Israel as an unwelcome surprise If so they have only themselves to blame Indeed their handling of the problem of Israel suggests they could do much worse than deal now with Mr Begin since they are unlikely to get another chance If King Hussein had had the good sense and courage to stay out of the SixDay Warand the Israelis gave him every chance to do sohe would not now need to lament the loss of Jerusalem and the West Bank If the acquisition of territory by war is no longer recognized what exactly is the basis for the Hashemite claim to the West Bank and Jerusalem If the Arab rulers could have brought themselves to negotiate with Israel after the SixDay War they could have had peace in 1968and this was the dearest wish of all Israelis if not their greatest expectation It was not the Israelis who coined the slogan No peace no war no negotiation If the Arab rulers had not rejected the UN Resolutions in 1947 and 1949 which legitimized the state of Israel they would not have lost four wars and turned a million or more Palestinians into refugees If all the talk about the Arab nation meant anything these refugees would not be destitute derelict and desperate nearly 30 years later If Arab land owners had not sold their land in Palestine to the Jewish Agency thousands of Palestinians would not be homeless today If the Arab leadership in Palestine during the Mandate had accepted either of the offers of a Consultative Assembly they would have been in an unassailable position to control the flow of Jewish immigration to contain the Jewish homeland and to prevent the creation of the Jewish state by constitutional democratic means instead of attempting and failing to do so by gun and bomb The Arab rulers now mourn the passing of the Labor Alignment yet the Alignment was in power for nearly 30 years during which no Arab ruler would accept the invitation of any Israeli Prime Minister to meet and talk peace Now they have Mr Begin If the Arab rulers were to take note of these ifs they might find it makes sense to talk with Mr Begin while they still can For 30 years they have declared an extreme position precon ditions They are still doing so For 30 years the Labor Alignment refused to show its hand before meeting at the conference tableNo preconditions Now in contrast Mr Begin has countered with an extreme position This surely is the principle of bazaar haggling If the Arab rulers were to meet Mr Begin they might find he understands them better than they realized They would at least be doing belated justice to their Arab brothers the Palestinians whose cause they claim to uphold while spurning them To the Editor The combination of Israeli intransigence and US support of Israel renders impossible any progress toward the establishment of a stable and lasting peace in the Middle East Israel will continue to be inflexible so long as she feels confident of unconditional American support Bolstered by our repeated assurances of support the Israeli Government moves rapidly toward de facto annexation of the West Bank The Secretary of the Israeli Cabinet recently stated This is not annexation You cannot annex the land of Israel for the people of Israel because it already belongs to them In other words the annexation has already taken place Menahem Begin refrains from repudiating the Secretarys statement but insists that the settlements on the West Bank do not pose any obstacle to peace negotiations It is hard to imagine that Begin himself believes his statement is true The Israeli Government maintains that it will never negotiate with the PLO not even if the PLO should recognize the state of Israel by accepting UN Resolution 242 and at the same time it states that all subjects are open to negotiation Obviously recognition of the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people which is the position of the Arab states is not open to negotiation The words of the Israeli Government are not used to state truths and to enlighten but rather to deceive and to soothe During the past few months there have been numerous indications of moderation and willingness to compromise on the part of various Arab governments and of the PLO During the same period the Israeli Government has engaged in such provocative acts as the establishment of settlements on the West Bank which the US Government has characterized as illegal military intervention in the fighting in Lebanon and the extension of public services to the Arabs of the West Bank The only effect produced by our restrained expressions of disapproval has been the issuance by Israel of patently false statements which are designed to reassure There can be no stable peace in the Middle East until the Palestinian people achieve their legitimate aspirations for a homeland It is not enough for President Carter to endorse that goal and respond only by mild expressions of disappointment to demarches by Israel which clearly make its achievement far more difficult By continuing to guarantee Israels security in the face of such illegal acts the US becomes g ty along with Israel of blocking the establishment of a stable peace We should abandon our onesided policies We should open negotiations with the PLO We should notify Israel that unless she shows some willingness to compromise and some recognition of legitimate Palestinian rights then she must be prepared to defend herself without any help direct or indirect from us Such steps Might force Israel to recognize the dangers of her provoca tive acts and of her inflexible and uncompromising attitudes At the least the US would be rescued from a position of supporting an unjust government which has no other significant support among the nations of the world ABRAM V MARTIN Grand Rapids Mich Aug 23 1977
GOODMAN TROUBLED BY FARBER'S EFFORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/04/archives/goodman-troubled-by-farbers-effort-aides-say-he-is-running-scared.html,In the final week of the Republican mayoral primary State Senator Roy M Goodman one of the citys leading Republican officeholders and the party organizations designee for Mayor is running scared according to his aides against a challenge by a conservative political amateur Barry Farber Overshadowed by the Democratic mayoral contest and shortened by Mr Goodmans unsuccessful effort to get Mr Farber off the ballot in the courts the Republican primary campaign has become a hardfought contest in the last week after Mr Farbers candidacy was upheld by the courts Republican politicians have not ruled out the possibility of an upset victory by Mr Farber in what is clearly an ideological contest Senator Goodmans actions indicate he is also deeply concerned about the possibility of an upset John Steele Mr Goodmans director of operations said the Senator was running scared and added We believe we have almost everything going for us but primaries are funny and unpredictable Mr Farber who is the nominee of the Conservative Party is pitching his campaign to the theme that Mr Goodman is a Lindsay liberal and that liberals have brought the city to its present state A Dilemma for Goodman The liberal politicians have almost destroyed New Yorklooters run wildneighborhoods become jungles  businesses closecitizens live in fearlets take New York back for the decent lawabiding majority reads a headline of a Farber brochure The Farber candidacy which Senator Goodman had hoped to avoid has presented the East Side Republican with a classic dilemma of trying to win the primary with a basically conservative Republican electorate without crippling his candidacy in the general election when he would be appealing to Democrats and independents Democrats outnumber Republicans in the city by a 5toI margin Mr Goodman has emphasized his wide experience as a businessman as Finance Administrator in the Lindsay administration and as a State Senator for nine years He its considered one of the fiscal experts in the Legislature In contrast Mr Farber has no governmental experience and ran only once before a losing campaign against Bella S Abzug on the West Side for a seat in the House of Repreeentatives Senator Goodman has also leaned heavily on endorsements by Republican organization politicians who are usually kept in the background in political campaignsthe national chairman William Brock the state chairman Dr Bernard Kilbourn and the citys five Republican county leaders One piece of Goodman literature includes an endorsement by Malcolm Wilson the former Governor who is a conservative Republican but does not list two liberal Republicans who Mr Goodman says have endorsed him United States Senator Jacob K Javits and Attorney General Louis J Lefkowitz Goodman aides said they were unable to explain the omission or the lack of a formalendorsement news conference but Senator Goodman later asserted that he had included the Lefkowitz and Javits endorsements in a new radio commercial and wanted to shout it from the rooftops Senator Javits in particular is not popular among conservative Republicans A favorite target of Republican conservatives and the Conservative Party is former Vice President Nelson A Rockefeller Mr Rockefeller who also is a former Governor of New York State and who has a city residence was not asked for his endorsement Mr Goodman said because he informs us that he is completely retired from politics The Senator said he would be pleased to have the Rockefeller endorsement but had not asked for it Against that lineup Mr Farbers only name endorsement is William F Buckley Jr the conservative columnist In addition Farber aides said that Ellen McCormack of Nassau County who ran for President last year on an antiabortion ticket would endorse Mr Farber before the primary Mr Farber has attempted to make an issue of Mr Goodmans votes in the Legislature against the death penalty and for liberalized abortion laws and of hi sponsorship of the GoodmanStavisky Bill which would have mandated increased spending for education during the citys fiscal crisis Mr Goodman has reacted to that line by putting out literature headlined Senator Roy Goodman cracked down on welfarecheats and Sen Roy Goodman put more cops on the street The Senator has also decried Conservative Party influence on the Farber campaign including pressure on Republican legislators not to support Mr Goodmanpressure that has largely succeeded because only two of 15 city Republican legislators have endorsed their colleague so far In addition the Conservatives have provided almost half of the 54000 raised by Mr Farber as of last month and Conservative county chairman Michael Long of Brooklyn is serving as the Farber campaign coordinator Mr Goodman has raised slightly more than 200000 four times the Barber campaign contribution Farber Answers Accusations As the Conservative nominee Mr Farber will be on the ballot in November even if he loses in the Republican primary Thursday The Senator is widely distributing handbill featuring Mr Farbers production of a sex show three years ago and is also questioning asserted tax delinquencies by Mr Farber Mr Farber has described the show as psychodramatic and a Farber spokesman said yesterday that the candidate had filed his returns on time but had delayed actual payments of taxes because of personal financial difficulties The spokesman said that all the taxes had now been paid with interest The problem of Senator Goodman who is moderate to liberal ideologically is pointed up by the experience of his onetime friend Mr Lindsay who although he was an incumbent Mayor was defeated by State Senator John J Marchi in the 1969 Republican primary In addition a Goodman poll shows that half of the Republican primary electorate considers itself Conservative and that tvickhirds are more than 40 years old with 20 percent more than 65 and another 20 percent in the 5565 age group The party enrollees are also 92 percent white 45 percent Catholic 27 percent Protestant and 19 percent Jewish according to the survey Another problem for Senator Goodman is that the Republican organization is al most nonexitent in many of the areas of the city and is thus ofli mited help to him Morton D Lawrence Mr Goodmans press secretary said that because of all these problems Were running scared
"In Recess, Legislators Hear About Issues That Hit Home",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/04/archives/in-recess-legislators-hear-about-issues-that-hit-home.html,DENVER Sept 3Congress returns to Washington next week with one clear message from home The public cares a lot more about whether the Federal Government makes it harder or easier to earn a living than it cares about such headline issues as abortion or Korean payoffs or even Bert Lance And the public seems to worry much less about such big economic subjects as energy unemployment or budget deficits than it does about Federal water resource policies new tobacco grading standards Japanese steel imports or the banning of an effective pesticide In Washington the press the Carter Administration and the Congressional leadership concentrate on the big issues treating them like waves and currents and tides But in Dillon S C or Chicago or Gunnison Colo the issues that matter come in isolated cloudbursts As a reporter accompanied 10 geographically and politically scattered Representatives and Senators for a day or two each over the last four weeks their constituents brought up frequently only one issue that counts as big news in Washington Everywhere they told their legislators not to give away the Panama Canal The questioners were demonstrably more interested in government than most people are They had bothered to find a member of Congress and talk to him even if the topic was often a state law or a property tax problem he could not change Troubled by Social Security Plan But they were far less interested in President Carters energy legislation for example than they were troubled by an idea floated in July by Juanita M Kreps Secretary of Commerce to raise the age for getting Social Security benefits from 65 to 68 That came up from Dunkirk N Y to Seattle A packing house worker in East Dubuque Ill meeting Republican Representative John B Anderson complained that work in his plant had already been speeded up so much youre lucky if you can hack it until youre 65 Mr Anderson like his colleague elsewhere sought to eassure the man that Congress would never pass a law raising the age to 68 But when constituents asked about how the executive branch administered laws already passed by Congress no such reassurance was possible Tobacco farmers in Dillon S C complained to Republican Senator Strom Thurmond about this years stiffer tobacco grading standards He could only promise to look into it And when they complained that the Environmental Protection Agency was banning necessary pesticides We need help in keeping those chemicals he could not promise anything One day early in the recess Representative Morgan Murphy Democrat of Illinois toured major factories in Chicago where his constituents work At each the complaint was the same that Washington ignored foreign imports subsidized by foreign governments and did not care about the jobs that were lost at home through this unfair competition Japan Is Termed a Problem At United States Steels South Chicago plant managers conceded that plant productivity was not great But they insisted their real problem was the assistance given by the Japanese Government to its steel companies when they dumped their product in the United States They said the State Department was afraid to do anything trying to buy friends at the expense of American jobs At a Zenith television factory the corporations board chairman John Nevin told Mr Murphy Trade decisions are being made by people who have no understanding of the domestic impacts especially of how the layoffs caused by imports affect newly hired Chicanos blacks and women most severely Even Government workers complained about the Government In Watsonville Calif Democratic Representative Leon E Panetta visited a Social Security office and heard a string of complaints about Washingtons remoteness The people who write the regs have no idea whats going on out here one civil servant said adding that the regulations make it need lessly difficult to help people These immediate concerns and dozens more dominated summer discussions between Congressmen and their constituents though not to the complete exclusion of other issues Questions about Korean influence buying were asked of Mr Panetta who brought the issue up and Senator John G Tower Republican of Texas and a member of the Senate Ethics Committee And as the recess ended questions about Mr Lance the director of the Office of Management and Budget whose banking practices were investigated began to be raised Abortion Issue Raised Mr Anderson and Senator Howard H Baker Jr Republican of Tennessee were asked occasionally about Federal spending on Medicaid abortions and defended their votes against absolute bans on such expenditures Mr Baker was also confronted by charges that lesbians and proabortionists had used Federal money to dominate a federally funded womens conference in Clarksville Tenn He promised to look into it Many subjects that are really national problems came up irregularly mentioned only by the sort of people or in the part of the country where they pinched most Questions about proposed new Federal minimum wage levels for example were heard at Chamber of Commerce breakfasts whether the guest was Mr Tower in Beaumont or Democratic Representative Stanley N Lundine in Jamestown N Y Out of the news by now in Washington last winters dispute over water projects lingers in South Carolina and remains intense in Colorado At meetings in Gunnison Democratic Senator Floyd K Haskell was asked about water projects and promised to fight to restore the Colorado dams Mr Carter killed But he would not promise much The President he explained doesnt realize what water is in the West In Seattle newly elected Representative Jack Cunningham Republican of Washington was told that the Carter policy on dams showed environmentalists are more interested in the fish getting through the turbines than the workers getting power to keep their jobs He agreed Pressure on Corn Prices Farm legislation was a frequent topic in droughtridden Iowa where anxious constituents pressed Democratic Senator Dick Clark for assurance that Mr Carter would sign the new farm bill and thus firm up the price of what corn they have harvested And while crops have been bountiful in Mr Andersons district he too was pressed about the price levels Energy came up occasionally here and there but it was a constant topic when Mr Tower visited Texas Gulf Coast oil and gas areas He  was asked whether the Government would take natural gas produced in Texas and force us to ship it up North and whether legislation to break up the oil companies was going anywhere He was asked about natural gas price deregulation and about legislation that would force Texas election utilities to use coal instead of natural gas The Government was the most frequently identified villain during the Congressional recess but it was not the only one Sometimes contituents sought its aid against another enemy At a Jamestown older citizens center Mr Lundine was told of gouging druggists In Monterey Calif Mr Panetta breakfasted with service station operators and heard one denunciation of the oil companies after another more than he usually hears in Congress in a week Their message was that they were jerked around branded and pressured and that the Justice Department should sue somebody Except for the Panama Canal and an occasional general question about how Mr Carter was handling foreign policy international issues almost never came up At home this summer the view was very much inward
The Treaty Will Be Signed This Week,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/04/archives/the-treaty-will-be-signed-this-week-panama-arouses-emotion-out-of.html,WASHINGTONOn his first campaign trip of 1976 on the snowy slopes of New Hampshire Ronald Reagan brought up an issue that was new to most of his listeners The prospective giveaway of the Panama Canal The voters were puzzled by the mention of the remote and unlikely issue and reporters tended to regard it largely as a joke Today the canal is the subject of the most extensive and intensive lobbying effort that the Carter Administration has yet organized a highstakes gamble And the immediate future of the waterway once regarded as only modestly significant on the scale of world events has escalated into a national issue of imponderable political potential On its face the Panama Canal issue seems unmomentous The amounts of land to be surrendered about 500 square miles and money to be provided to Panama 60 to 70 million a year from toll revenue are not impressive The canal itself too small to accommodate todays aircraft carriers and supertankers has already lost much of its strategic importance Yet the campaign against the proposed treaty with Panama which President Carter plans to sign at ceremonies here this week has evoked a response widespread and emotional that appears to many dispassionate observers to be out of all proportion to the facts In the occasional way of politics the Panama Canal has taken on symbolic value far more consequential than its intrinsic value Emotionalism is a major feature of the campaign to block the canal treaty There is no Panama Canal reads an advertisement of the American Conservative Union There is an American canal at Panama Dont let President Carter give it away Beneath such slogans lies a strong undercurrent of jingoistic appeal to national pride Senator Strom Thurmond the South Carolina Republican who is a major critic of the treaty likes to tell his audiences that the waterway is the United States Canal adjacent to Panamanian territory rather than identify it as a 10milewide strip that completely bisects the country the United States helped establish in 1903 Gradually transferring ownership and operation of the canal to President Omar Torrijos Herrera of Panama a military dictator who has veered from left to right during his eight years of rule would be like turning it over to the Communists Senator Thurmond charged in a recent speech Rhetoric With an Eerie Ring The Reagan rhetoric on the issue while somewhat more restrained has an eerie quality reflecting the shift from isolationism to a sort of militant internationalism that the conservative movement experienced when it embraced the Vietnam war as liberal support ftir it deteriorated Will turning over the canal be seen by others as yet another sign of Americas longing to draw inward Mr Reagan inquired in a speech a week ago What does this say to our allies around the world about our leadership intentions our international role about our own view of our national defense capacity Throughout the propaganda attack on the proposed treaty runs the theme of national retreat even surrender Some political analysts believe that this represents an unhappy legacy from the war in Vietnam They theorize that many Americans feel an unconscious sense of shame over the United States defeat before the eyes of the world and are unwilling to accept what they regard as another retreat With such voters the argument goes President Theodore Roosevelt who took the Canal Zone from Colombia in 1903 remains a popular hero They tend to have no sense of guilt about the historical fact that the United States obtained its rights in the canal zone in the first place by a combination of international adventurism and thinly veiled blackmail Indeed from its highly dubious beginning the Panama Canal has been a source of national pride The fact that the United States encouraged the revolt against Colombia that created Panama and then cozened that insecure infant nation into a onesided treaty did not seem to concern Americans at the turn of the century still basking in the warm glow of the doctrine of manifest destiny Moreover construction of the canal was regarded as a triumph of American engineering genius despite a high toll in Panamanian lives Military flexibility was a major motivating force behind the canal from the inception of the idea it took the Navy days to get the battleship Oregon from San Francisco to Cuba in 1898 and it almost missed the SpanishAmerican War altogether The canals World War II role in speeding the Atlantic Fleet to the Pacific after VE Day impressed thousands of servicemen who are now members of the electorate Some social historians believe Americans tend to exhibit a highlydeveloped sense of the territorial imperative the psychological need to control property once acquired even though that property is in Central America or Southeast Asia together with a corresponding deepseated reluctance to withdraw on any front Who Could Forget Quemoy and Matsu Issues that acquire a political momentum of their own are not new to American politics In their 1960 debates John F Kennedy and Richard M Nixon became embroiled over the degree of protection to be accorded the tiny islands of Quemoy and Matsu between Formosa and the Chinese mainland another matter of symbolic rather than real importance In the last quarter of the 19th Century free silver became an important national cause a simplistic Symbol of widespread economic distress and political unrest The issue was far more complex than the question of reliance on or rejection of the gold standard Some politicians feel that current issues like abortion and gun control have taken on political meaning far beyond their intrinsic importance particularly when the partisans contend that voters decisions should be governed solely by the candidates positions on those questions disregarding all other issues experience and competence Similarly the recent dispute over a Miami ordinance guaranteeing the civil rights of homosexuals rapidly acquired such political momentum that a measure affecting a relatively small minority in one city escalated into a national conttoversy of considerable bitterness In the foreign policy field the QuemoyMatsu issue never came to a head The Communists did not militarily challenge Nationalist control of the islands and the controversy became academic No such convenient outcome now seems possible for the Panama issue Either President Carter wins Senate ratification of the treaty or he loses and takes the political consequences Warren Weaver Jr is a reporter in the Washington

"Mexicans, Trusting in Tradition, Take Herbs for Their Ailments",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/09/archives/mexicans-trusting-in-tradition-take-herbs-for-their-ailments.html,MEXICO CITY Sept 8  The herb salesman kept up his soft patter as he deftly scraped the skin off a huge radish This is the part with the medicinal properties he told a score of enchanted Mexicans surrounding his stand You soak it in alcohol for two hours then its ready for use Nearby a group of Indian women arranged huge bundles of plants herbs and flowers along the ground and settled down in front of stalls displaying sackloads of oddcolored stalks and leaves all of them identified by the particular ailments they are intended to cure Even in the heart of Mexico City herbal medicine is still flourishing Every morning at dawn trucks arrive at the vast La Merced market with medicinal plants from all parts of Mexico Within hours the plants are sorted and dispatched to yerberos or herb experts throughout this city of 12 pillion inhabitants Most buyers are poor Mexicans who have little faith in government clinics and cannot afford private doctors or who have recently migrated here from the countryside and prefer treatment by herbs But increasingly there are signs that even middleand upperclass Mexicans are beginning to recognize the merits of traditional medicine A Fixture at Lunchtime Every day at lunchtime Francisco Sanchez Negrete sets up his stall behind Woolworths on the capitals elegant Paseo de la Reforma 1workers come to consult the 11old yerbero about their problems or passersby simply stop to peruse the little packages with their handwritten signs Altered nerves Obesity Ache of the brain Impotence Irritable character and so on A tot of people are attracted to medicinal plants said Mr Sanchez whose father was also a yerbero Sometimes theyre a bit shy about consulting me but theyre very good aboutfollowing my recommendations Many affluent Mexicans were in fact brought up taking chamomile and mint teas for upset stomachs eucalyptus tea for colds and garlic cloves for insect bites although their new interest in herbal medicine is probably a result as much of the 11nature fad in the United States and other Western nations Purveyor to the Prominent Blending indefinably with the new interest in psychic powers and even witchcraft upperclass men and particularly women are increasingly seeking out Indian curanderos or healers who combine herbs with occult rituals to deal with everything from organic malfunctions to bewitchment by the evil eye One wellknown woman healer in Mexico City for example has a clientele comprised almost entirely of prominent artists politicians and businessmen But while even in the countryside the curandero often plays a semireligious role in each community the survival of the preHispanic traditions of herbal medicine reflects the basic health needs of millions of rural inhabitants According to official figures about half of Mexicos 63 million people do not have regular access to medical attention Government hospitals and socialsecurity clinics are generally available in urban areas but in remote towns and villages the curandero offers the only medical service The isolation of many peasant regions is such that centuriesold knowledge and experience in herbal medicine are still available Different plants are used in different ways by the surviving Indian and mestizo communities but it is rare for a curandero not to believe he has the answer Plants From All Regions Because Mexico City is a melting pot of migrants from throughout the country plants from all regions must be brought here And the yerberos at La Merced market must know the sometimes 10 different native names by which one plant is known In urban are slumdwellers turn to medicinal plants simply because they cannot efface to buy at a pharmacy where locally made pharmaceutical products often cost more than identical medicines available In the United States We close our eyes to what we have the herb salesman told his listeners at La Merced Foreigners come and buy our plants and turn them into pills and then sell them back to us at a huge profit But we have the medicine right here in our plants so we must use them Mexicos medical profession modeled after that of developed countries is hostile to traditional medicine Young doctors doing their obligatory years social service in the countryside are often angered by the power of curanderos in rural communities while other doctors prefer to dismiss yerberos as charlatans Scientific Study Under Way Researchers at the Mexican Institute for the Study of Medicinal Plants however feel strongly that modern and traditional forms of medicine are entirely complementary and in the hope of winning over the medical profession they have begun a scientific study of the most widely used herbs Through our study we hope to undermine the arguments of doctors who are hostile explained Dr Xavier Lozaya Legorreta the director of the institute Lets face it We cant afford to provide proper medical attention for the entire population so there is no need to draw a line between traditional and modern medicine Id like to see herbal medicine taught in medical schools here The instutute has begun by identifying the 2000 medicinal plants available in Mexico and has selected about 100 of them for immediate analysis by team of anthropologists botanists chemists and pharmocologists Its amazingly complex Dr Lozoya said because we have to study how the plants are prepared and taken when by whom what side effects they have and so on Then we have to see how we can communicate our results both to doctors and to the rural population One plant studied by the institute was the white iapote which since the time of the Aztecs has been used for lowering arterial pressure The researchers found that its leaves contained chemical substances that do lower blood pressure but they found that in women it also produced uterine contractions that could bring on abortions Our priority is to look for plants that resolve Mexicos most serious health problems Dr Lozaya said If we can prove that herbs cure parasites diabetes heart and lung ailments and problems of the reproductive organsthen they can be safely recommended by doctors and yerberosio lowincome families This would be a major breakthrough

Chemical Contamination of Breast Milk Is Viewed With Concern,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/09/archives/chemical-contamination-of-breast-milk-is-viewed-with-concern.html,Discovery of contamination of human breast milk with dangerous chemicals uch as DDT and PCBs has raised questions about the wisdom of 1feeding particularly for women living in certain parts of the country The contamination has been confirmed through tests of breast milk samples taken from 1400 women in 46 states in 1976 by the Environmental Protection Agency and by still incomplete tests conducted by that agency and the New York State Department of Health Based on a preliminary report of some of these findings last fall Dr David Rahl Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health sciences said I dont think Id tell nursing mothers to make any changes Lin their breastfeeding now But were ring to have to get more EPA and independent data so we can have a better idea what to advise But Benefits Stressed There has been no further official Word from the government and proponents of breastfeeding such as La leche League continue to stress the many proven benefits of breastfeeding over bottle feeding It is clearly cheaper to breastfeed than to buy formula for example and nursing mothers enthusiastically describe the emotional and psychological joys of doing so For babies of parents with allergies and Who might be allergic to formula or cows milk breastfeeding is also clearly superior in the opinion of medical authorities Most medical studies have also shown that the breastfed baby is more resistant to disease and recent research on the composition of breast milk has shown that it contains amino acids and fats different from those found in cows milk and formula If you weigh the known immunological nutritional and psychological benefits of breastfeeding we believe they far outweigh the risks which at this point are theoretical said Edwina Froehlich executive secretary of La Leche League Miss Froehlich pointed out that Food and Drug Administration tests have also found contaminants in formula among them lead Also the water supply m many parts of the country is far from pure and the water is mixed with powdered formula It is true that there have been no studies to show whether there is an effect on human babies of ingestingcontaminated breast milk said Joseph Hyland of the Environmental Defense Fund but we do have animal data and a background of biological knowledge that gives us reason for concern There should not be an automatic decision to breastfeed The Fund which has been campaigning for years for the banning of many pesticides is among those who view the EPA research findings with concern The 1976 EPA tests found average levels of pesticides in the women tested that all exceeded the Acceptable Daily Intake levels established by the World Health Organiztion for adults There are no such levels for infants Among these pesticides were DDE the form in which DDT is stored in the body fat Dieldrin and Heptachlor epoxide all of which have been shown to cause cancer in animals The EPA has not yet completed its analysis of breast milk samples of PCBs an industrial chemical used for years to make such things as electronic products and carbonless copy paper and discharged by manufacturers into rivers and lakes including the Hudson and Lake Ontario But preliminary results for 80 women showed average levels 10 times higher than the daily intake recommended by the Food and Drug Administration for infants In addition preliminary tests by the New York State Department of Health found levels five to 10 times higher than the EPA averages in women who regularly eat Lake Ontario fish These findings have been viewed by the department with particular alarm because of experiments conducted at the University of Wisconsin by Dr James Allen a pathologist In the experiments thesus monkeys were fed PCBs for six months and then bred In a telephone interview Dr Allen said it was difficult for the monkeys to get pregnant and about half of them had spontaneous abortions within the first two months of pregnancy The infants that were born were fed by their mothers who no longer were receiving PCBs in their diets and within four months he said half of the infants were dead The survivors showed signs of hyperactive behavior and learning difficulties and were very susceptible to infections If I were a physician who had women under my surveillance who were living along the Great Lakes or the Hudson River area where they were eating fish four or five times a week I would suggest they put their infants on formula said Dr Allen The New York State Health Department has not gone as far as Dr Allen in making such a recommendation but a study of 500 women is under way to try to identify a population of women who have high levels of PCBs in their milk and are likely to be placing their infants at risk according to Dr David Axelrod Director of the Departmens Division of Laboratories and Research He said a recommendation against nursing would be made to womans physician if levels of PCBs were found which were equivalent to those which caused harm in the Wisconsin tests Its true that this allows for no safety margin said Dr Axelrod Standards for human intake are usually set at onehundredth the level that causes no harm in animals Preliminary results of the New York State tests also showed evidence of breast milk contamination by Mirex a pesticide used to control fire ants Also a carcinogen in animals this substance has been shown to produce nonreversible cataracts in the offsprings of rats and mice who were fed Mirex while nursing their babies New Survey Planned According to Jerome Blondell health statistician with the EPA the agency will soon begin sending questionnaires to the 1400 mothers it tested in 1976 to try to get an answer to the most urgent question raised by the findings of contamination Have babies of mothers with high chemical levels suffered shortterm ill effects The agency also plans to do a new survey of more women Until further information is forthcoming Dr Jean Pakter head of Maternity Services at the New York City Department of Health urges women not to be sidetracked from breastfeeding I think its unfortunate that this hysteria is being worked up she said The amounts of contaminants being found are small and unless woman has an unusual diet or lives in certain areas she need not be concerned The Environment Defense Fund for its part has published a booklet called Birthright Denied The Risks and Benefits of BreastFeeding and concludes in it The ultimate decision on whether to breastfeed must reside with each set of parents no expert can dictate the right course to take 
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/10/archives/letters.html,To the Editor Dorothy Dunbar Bromley in her Aug 29 letter objects to the calling of constitutional convention for the purpose of recommending to the states for ratification an amendment to the United States Constitution to protect the unborn She quotes two professors who express opinions in opposition to a constitutional convention as her principal authority for this opposition In 1974 a unanimous report of the Special Constitutional Study Committee of the American Bar Association said Our twoyear study of the subject has led us to conclude that a national constitutional convention can be channeled  to be an orderly mechanism of effecting constitutional change when circumstances require its use The charge of radicalism does disservice to the ability of the states and people to act responsibly when dealing with the Constitution A future constitutional convention can make no change in the Constitution it can destroy no right nor infringe any liberty Anything that a constitutional convention proposes for ratification by the states must be ratified by 76 legislative bodies in 38 states before it becomes a part of the Constitution In short a constitutional convention cannot amend the Constitution it can merely propose an amendment for ratification and nothing more Not a comma or a period can be inserted in the Constitution until threefourths of the states have solemnly ratified the proposal The fact that we have not had a national constitutional convention since 1787 does not diminish the peoples right guaranteed by the United States Constitution to have a constitutional convention if they wish There is nothing new or startling in an application for a constitutional convention there have been over 400 in our nations history with at least one emanating from each of the 50 states As I have traveled from state legislature to state legislature all across America I have observed that the principal opposition to an application for a constitutional convention comes from a mixture of political activists of the right and of the leftthe ADA the ACLU NOW and the John Birch Society Although these groups are noisy in their opposition they in fact represent an insignificant spectrum of public opinion As James Madison said [A constitutional convention] guards equally against that extreme facility which would render the Constitution too mutable and that extreme difficulty which might perpetuate its discovered faults DAN BUCK LEY Chairman Americans for a Constitutional Convention New York Aug 29 1977 To the Editor In her Aug 29 letter Ms Dorothy Dunbar Bromley attributes to me the view that given the wording of Article V a new [constitutional] eonvention could propose whatever amendments it might choose Though I agree with much in Ms Bromleys letter I have to correct this attribution I have never as far as I know expressed a view on this question Certainly I did not do so in my article in Volume 82 of the Yale Law Journal at p 189 which Ms Bromley cites My view expressed and defended in that article is that a states application for a subjectlimited convention is entirely void on the ground that such a limited convention is not what Article V authorizes the states to petition for If I am right in this then since 34 times zero is zero 34 such applications are each and all void and Congress is not obligated to call any convention at all because the applications from the 34 states are not applications for the thing Article V authorizes them to apply for On this view of course the question of a runaway convention ought never to arise since Congress need not call any convention whatever when applied to by the states far a subjectlimited convention The view that states may under Article V force the call of a subjectlimited convention is the product so far as I can discover of the imagination of state legislatures in the twentieth century But for space reasons I must refer those interested to my article referred to above To the Editor In your Aug 31 editorial OutofCourt Environment you said that to settle environmental disputes by mediation rather than through the courts should by all means be encouraged but that there is good reason to doubt that the proposal will become reality on a major scale Your conclusion is overpessimistic because it ignores recent developments in dispute settlement techniques Mediation has traditionally been used after a deadlock has occurred and the positions of the parties have become frozen In environmental disputes where there are often many parties and where the issues are exceedingly complex impartial procedures including but not limited to mediation must be introduced early in the problemsolving cycle to be effective The rational management of natural resources is a problem to be solved not a pie to be cut Modern dispute settlers have a battery of tools each to be used in sequence and with skills that are being developed For several years the American Arbitration Association a national institution devoted to settling disputes has recognized that energyenvironmental controversies are a new breed of conflict requiring new approaches The procedures we are now using have these ingredients 1 Early detection of controversial decisions that must be made 2 Early identification and involvement of the parties who must participate in making and in accepting the decision 3 Gathering the basic facts and assumptions employing mediation we call it datamediation to achieve consensus on what data are valid 4 Finally the use of more traditional mediation techniques after the previous steps have been followed to seek consensus of the solution to be chosen When set in this sequence one can be more optimistic that a successful mediation of environmental disputes may indeed become a reality on major scale DONALD B STRAUS President Research Institute American Arbitration Association New York Sept 1 1977 To the Editor Your Aug 25 editorial Promises Promises in Manila indicates you may not have been aware of what President Marcos said in his address during Memorial Day services at the American Cemetery in Greater Manila on May 30 1977 Our commitment to human rights and the welfare of our people like our commitment to our sovereignty and territorial integrity is an irrevocable one It is a commitment that has led us into making hard and controversial decisions in the ordering of our national priorities and the restructuring of our institutions Yet we shudder less at the thought that we would not always be understood and more at the possibility that without a will our best means might ultimately fail Some of the things we have to do today particularly when seen to be new and unfamiliar by those who do not share either our faith or our conviction will tend to disturb even those who sympathize with our conditions Let not hasty or ignoble judgment condemn Rather as we reach out to you for the secret of your progress and achievements reach out also for the secret of our torment For we have been stunted by weakness hobbled by underdevelopment Our paths may sometimes separate but I am sure they shall converge again for our final destination is the same the full rendering of human dignity and human welfare ERNESTO C PINEDA Consul General of the Philippines New York Aug 25 1977 To the Editor I was a resident of New York for 33 years and for the past 16 years have been working in the Times Square section I walk to Penn Station 34th Street from 45th Street and Seventh Avenue every working day The deterioration of this city is appalling The filth in the streets is disgrace I remember New York City when it was clean That doesnt go back too far10 years or so Why cant we have street cleaners like we used to There is nothing demeaning about a pay job well done Years ago if a storekeeper didnt keep the sidewalk in front of his store swept every day an inspector would give him a summons He would then pay a fine That surely would be good source of revenue for this city I have listened to all the wonderful things the mayoralty hopefuls are promising No one talks about the filthy streets and a simple plan to clean thembrooms and fines for not wielding them Actually if they start with cleaning up physically this city we might have some psychological incentive for everyone to feel good about living in a clean place I cant think of a better way to make people come to New York and like it The filth here now is repelling and deters everyone Unless we get after the Sanitation Department and get some people assigned physically to clean up small sections at a time we are doomed to filth and to people hating and leaving New York LILLIAN FREYER Great Neck LI Sept 1 1977 To the Editor I salute your moderation in regard to opposing violence with violence but doubt your facts and logic You say categorically the death penalty is no deterrent to crime I say equally bluntly no one yet knows That you should know When a convicted murderer knows that life sentence may be anything from a month to several years and he is told that the death sentence will not be sought if he is psychopathic has not most of the deterrent been removed from murder Throw in the fact that often some legal or police technical error may impede the course of justice and there isnt much left Will law and protection of the public depend forever on the judgment of court psychiatrists unable to make a decision on any truly scientific basis I hope nut IRVINE H PAGE MD Cleveland Clinic Cleveland Aug 30 1977 To the Editor The recent overturning of the Port Authoritys ban on the Concorde SST will inundate New York City with painful Concorde noise and vibration The Federal Government long ago preempted authority to issue SST noise standards so no authority or obligation exists for the Port Authority to do so Earlier decisions in Concorde litigation in Washington DC exonorated the Federal Government for over five years delay in issuing SST noise standards Why is the Port Authoritys delay of only seventeen months excessive and unjustified The Concorde tests at Dulles are incompletetherefore that ban to avoid exposing 100 times more people to excessive Concorde noise and pain is only humane and just That is protection of public health not disregard of public health as practiced by the Federal Government The only discrimination and unfairness lie in the Federal tactics Is Washington playing the devils advocate The Federal Government said these tests could be stopped in one hour dangerous to the public health That danger was proven at Dulles in the first two weeks of SST operation but its still flying over a year later with increased flights FAA monitoring reports show complaints of pain ear head heart and chest from Concorde noise on almost 100 separate days through May 1977 But FAA omits the quantity of such complaints Over 1300 total Concorde complaints in yearaveraging more than two complaints each SST operation compared to one complaint every 540 flights of other aircraft SST arrivals can equal or exceed takeoffs in severity Police arrest burglers but when Concorde noise invades a home and assaults those inside to unconsciousness FAA ignores even the complaints In the first 1000 complaints FAA admitted investigating none involving pain or injury and have no procedure to do so FAA downplays complaints in its reports omits almost all noise readings where most people live where most complaints originate and where Concorde noise can be four to five times worse than any other plane far worse than even EPA predictions 30 miles away after takeoff As one of thousands around Dulles Airport forced by Federal thoughtlessness to suffer this Concorde noise for over a year I have personally witnessed repeatedly the pain it causes but the Federal Government ignores our human rights to freedom from this torture One hopes the Appellate Court will have wisdom toward humanity and restore the ban on the SST ROBERT D THURSTON Herndon Va Sept 2 1977
THE PLIGHT OF DISCARD D'ESTANG,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/11/archives/the-plight-of-giscard-destang-giscard.html,PARIS The honeymoon was short and the marriage is on the rocks Things simply have not worked out between France and her young President the French Kennedy Valery Giscard dEstaing Unless the situation changes rapidly the French will win the Western European sweepstakes on where the Communists finally win a solid share of power Portugal took the early lead only to be passed by Italy which has now given way to the new frontrunner France It took only three years for the French to turn their backs on Giscard Young graceful stimulating he had the French dancing in the streets at his 1974 election to the presidency The French had surprised themselves that time Finally France had shown common sense pulled back from the magnetism of the two extremes  the collectivism of the left and the nationalism of the right Giscard had beaten the lefts veteran campaigner Francois Mitterrand As for the right the new President summed it up in a conversation The French are sick of Gaullism A new era begins the headlines said A heady era he promised just give my programs a chance to catch on His center would drive a wedge between the extremes France would build an advanced liberal society a mixture of private enterprise and social justice France would not fall into the British abyss with nationalized companies foundering under a socialism that provided everything but the will to work Today with the 1978 parliamentary elections six months away Giscard is buffeted from side to side by a nation that seems out for his scalp His cherished center is nowhere to be found The ministers representing it have been discredited disgraced and even exiled from Paris Only Prime Minister Raymond Barre who is visiting Washington this week to rally support for Giscards faltering troops retains some public appeal in a Government that otherwise is faceless and undistinguished It is the first American visit by French Prime Minister since the beginning of the Gaullist era and it is a measure of the trouble Giscard is in at home The French Government is in bad need of bolstering and though ordinarily you do not win votes in France by going to Washington anything that Barre can get will help be it public sympathy from President Carter on the Concorde or strong statements of solidarity on economic and energy problems by Secretaries Blumenthal and Schlesinger The Barre visit was smoothed when Mitterrand who had planned to visit Washington himself later this month decided not to in the absence of assurances that Carter would see him The State Department had recommended against receiving the French Socialist chieftain There was to be no doubt about which side the United States is on Which is fine so long as your side goes on winning But that may be the problem France in the process of rejecting the former suitor has turned her affections to a new one The audience sits amazed for if the first young man seemed perfect right down to his chin and the cut of his tweeds the new one for whom the girl seems stricken has a darker image mustache and a leer James O Goldsborough is chief European correspondent for The International Herald Tribune The left The word alone rings of other times of the 19th century of bombs and beards railroads and riots Engels and Kautsky Debs and the Haymarket But the left in France has done what it has not done in any other country It has patched itself together Socialists Communists Radicals all the main currents of the left have composed their differences and signed pact It is as though the schism in the socialist movement caused in 1921 by the Russian Bolsheviks and their Comintern never happened The left in France is united for the first time around a common program and since the French are known to have their hearts if not their pocketbooks on the left the left is set to run the young man out of town What has gone askew for Giscard Everything had seemed so right The idea had been to put a firm new hand on the helm of a meandering and divided nation paralyzed by its eternal leftright split  us against them moi ou to chaos Gen Charles de Gaulle had served well for a while a historical giant to restore the dreams Under Georges Pompidou gruff and practical France returned to earth but by the time he died in 1974 Pompidou was a tired and sick man Giscard represented the future the new hope the postwar man the pedigreed egghead who would lead France into the industrial future sell the Concorde resist the Americans catch the Germans dazzle the European Community FrancoGerman relations had suffered under Pompidou and Willy Brandt two peasanty types steeped in suspicion Giscard could handle the Germans handle Helmut Schmidt Together these two exfinance ministers would forge the new technocratic Europe perhaps even convince decadent Britain it should follow along Giscard hailed as a wonder worker after being elected President in 1974 visits the French overseas possession of Reunion Giscard could do all this because though born into wealth and privilege he was not afraid to be a traitor to his class tax the rich help the poor He was not afraid to put down the Gaullists attack traditions head on pass abortion and divorce laws in a Catholic country impose a capitalgains tax the French will accept any kind of indirect sales tax but hate to have their incomes taxed Giscards answer to his critics was that they were oldfashioned Wait and see he said The trouble with the French was that they werent AngloSaxon enough Changer to society was the theme of the new reign Changing France suggests changing Frenchmen and Giscard might have done well to reflect on those who have made that attempt The French Revolution cost 5000 heads and resulted in a society 200 years later that has the most inequitable income distribution of any country in the West The record of Frances more modest reformers has been meager The great utopians SaintSimon Fourier Proudhon and Rousseau left little behind but their ideas The most recent attempt was made in 197072 by Porupidous first Prime Minister Jacques ChabanDelmas who was dismissed for his pains As Pompidou who did the dismissing explained later to Alain Peyrefitte the current Justice Minister and author of the bestselling book Le Mal Francais You cant pretend France is an AngloSaxon country it isnt it would never have gone for ChabanDelmass ridiculous fantasies On reformism in general Pompidous views were firm You think that the French have changed Theyve changed their styles perhaps but not their mentality They instinctively understand the dangers of change That if you introduce one kind of change it brings with it all kinds of secondary changes that werent foreseen The order of things is upset Above all the French are conservative They have an instinct for conservation that I regard as healthy Strong tides for any reformer to buck but Giscard was game for a try France he reasoned had gone beyond the provincial analysis of a Pompidou the problems of the 1970s were different to solve them required evolution on several fronts Politically it meant weakening the Communists and attracting the Socialists at least some of them to his side through popular reforms It meant moving toward some version of the AngloAmerican system  an alternative between the centerright and the centerleft with the President governtug more or less successfully with either Economically it meant a sound franc moderate inflation and increases in investment and exports  all relatively unusual for France This unfortunately would also mean austerity arid high unemployment which historically have been fatal for French rulers but Giscard thought that modern programs lib retraining and unemployment benefits would help Diplomatically Giscard followed a goodneighbor poliEuropt and sought to put France in the avantgarde in western dealings with the lord world Equally important he tried to end the eternal Gaullist quarrel with the United States over such things is NA and the Common ket lit recognised that no understanding with West Gerin111Y Vis possible so lung as France tried to force Bonn to house between Washington and Paris Giscard in short had a modern coherent original vision fur his country ro achieve tt in a nal ion stir France a President would have needed great charisma sound lieutenants boundless energy and practically subliminal powers of persuasion to get people to do what they dont want to do  forget their chauvinism accept unemployment and become a moral leader of a group of poor countries they would rather forget A man like de Gaulle might have managed it There are two main strains in the French  the egocentric and vainglorious which the Gaullists have exploited and the idealistic and systematic which is the stuff of the left If you dont vibrate one of these two chords as Giscard didnt you are it a disadvantage and you had better have a slick bag of tricks For Giscard that Witold have meant a series of tactical successes to prove that his vision was right and all the critics were wrong Instead he came under steady personal attack for his distant manners and desultory ways his Governments careered from misfortune to misfortune in the most amateurish of fashions and certain political facts refused to go away High unemployment asserted its historic role as the undoer of French rulers Unemployment in France selfrespect means a days work not a days dole Incometax reform did not come across as a social benefit a means of ending the countrys wide income differentials because in France the poor as well as the rich hate the income tax Things began logo seriously wrong when Jacques Chirac the etene loop bent on resurrecting the Gaullism that many thought interred with Giscards election made his move in August 1976 It is no secret that Chirac plans to run for President when Discards term is up in 19k1 by naming him Prime Minister three years ago Giscard had hoped to keep him in line until hen In vain Closely advised by two of Pompidims former advisers Pierre Juillet and MarieFrance Ga raud  mysterious Frenchstyle counerzues gs never seen in  Chirac came to believe that Giscards ineffectual reformism was exasperating the French to such a degree that they Wilold votethe left into power Ile urged Giscard to call early elections and run on a strong antiCommunist plat form  that is dramatize the very divisions Giscard had pledged to end When the President refused Chirac resigned and began organizing his Gaullist into a new Peoples Rally a name steeped in the nostalgia of de Gaulles original French Peoples Rally of 191850 Chiracs new RPR as it is called while nominally intikft is actually antiGiscard And the hard troth is that without the Gaullists Giscard is a general Step by step the Government played into Chiracs hands through a series of blunders At the center of all of them was Giscards own righthand man Michel Poniatoski the Interior Minister a rich fat titled Giscardian with a taste for irritating his Gaullist allies and a penchant for political error Poniatoski had Abu Daum a Palestinian activist arrested and held for extradition to West Germany where he was wanted by the police in connection with the massacre of the Israeli Olympic team at Munich in 1972 But the German Government reasoning that Palestinian terrorism had subsided and that could lead to more Lufthansa hijackings decided it didnt want him The French in the most humiliating circumstances were forced to free him About the same time another rich fat titled Giscardian named Jean de Broglie was murdered by the Paris underworld with which he was apparently involved Poniatowski an associate of de Broglie promptly declared the case solved  a clear case of obstruction of justice for it wasnt and still isnt The worst was yet to come One of Discards earliest reforms had been to give the city of Paris autonomous status with a mayor removing the capital from its historic government tutelage The decision consistent with Giscards notion of a modern decentralized nation was disasimus politically As high rents shoved the workers to suburban apartments Paris became a bourgeois Gaullist fief The consequences showed up in the nationwide municipal elections last March Chirac entered the Paris mayoral race against Giscards own candidate  another rich titled though only stout  Giscardian named Michel dOrnano  and over the Presidents fervent pleas This was the open split Chirac ran an effective campaign against lackluster opposition kissing babies drinking red wine at cafe counters and promising safer and cleaner streets He won Paris as any Gaullist would have but the left won sweeping victories in provincial cities and towns reaching 53 percent of the vote This [governing[ majority is doomed pronounced Mister rand All that is left for it is to decide the date of the parliamentary elections when it will hand power over to us But it was more than blunders that led Giscard to his present pass more even than the bad luck to have an economic recession the worst since the MOs strike just as he became President A more basic question has to do with the nature of his mandate Chirac the conservative sees it as follows If the French had wanted change they would have voted for Mitterrand Giscard was elected to do nothing His problem is not to have understood that If traditionally the left and the right each commands 40 percent of the vote in any French election it is the floating 20 percent that matters Giscard went after that 20 percent with his reforms Instead of winning it he confused it and a good part of his own 40 percent as well You cannot make politics that alienate your own clientele Mitterrand It is fatal And there was from the outset yet another and perhaps even more fundamental problem Why doesnt Giscard like France an interviewer asked Pompidou shortly before his death It isnt that he doesnt like France replied the gravelvoiced Auvergne schoolmaster it is that he thinks he is better than France He doesnt think that France is up to his size and intelligence There ought to he a bond between the people and their leader in any democracy The government to be legitimate must reflect the aspirations of the people De Gaulle had captured that consensus and had lost it Giscards election had been followed by an outflow of enthusiasm Everything was possible for him in the beginning says Peyrefitte Today nothing is possible The Government lacks legitimacy says Chirac There is something in France that doesnt like Giscards center that sees it as a bloodless neutral place to he like white it is the absence of pigment The French love their ideology and even as they leave their farms for the industrial cities there is something in them that wants to bring the old doctrines along The Socialists and Communists have understood this which helps explain why their position is so strong today The Socialists reek of musty Frenchness a blend of tobacco and earth cities and villages ideas and roots They range from crisp technocratic minds like Michel Rocard a kind of Giscard without pedigree to the feisty bossism of Gaston Defferre in Marseilles from the stumpworn sloganeering of Pierre Mauroy Mayor of Lille in the north to the brittle intellect of Mitterrand a kind of Clemenceau of the left steeped in history and literature not sure whether he has been cast for the role of a Rastignac or a Julien Sorel or an Alexander Kerensky The Socialists only match on the left are the Communists who under Georges Marchais have been led away from the underworld of Stalinism to a new image of a brash tough totally French workers party with a solid 20 percent of the vote The Communists today rival the Gaulusts in chauvinism The word internationalism is never heard Marx if he returned today would get the same treatment as Jesus in Dostoyevskys tale of the Grand Inquisitor  the bums rush Giscard on the other hand is likened by both the left and the right to Hamlet  too vacillating too conciliatory too compromising too leery of the kind of confrontation that the Gaullists and Communists relish Chirac criticizes Giscard for wanting to be every bodys good neighbor Where else but in France could wanting to be a good neighbor possibly give offense Yet in France such notions are considered a sign of weakness To get along with people is a sign of giving in if not selling out One either shuns others or dominates them Even so there is something inherently crazy about the French going left How can a nation with 348 kinds of cheese be collectivized What people is more conservative more individualistic more ungovernable Yet the left has made a spectacular comeback perhaps because the French are a nation of paradoxes unsynthesizable  and they love it The left  Rendered all but extinct by Gaullism internal divisions and the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia held down to only 25 percent of the vote when Pompidou was swept into the Presidency in 1969 the left today is the dominant force in French politics with a 12 percent lead in the polls It still may not come to power for the French often find reasons for voting right in spite of how they feel about it in their hearts but it is in better shape to do so than at any time in the past France has approached a watershed and it may well be the same for the other nations of Latin Europe No longer can majority coalitions whether calling themselves conservatives centrists national movements or Christian Democrats hang on to power despite incompetence and corruption simply by invoking the Red menace They must prove that they have the better policies and cleaner hands that they can solve the problems For 90 years France has not known what it is to have a normal democratic alternation in power  majorities replaced by oppositions Italy Spain and Portugal havent known it for even longer periods or have missed the experience altogether But times are changing and the Communist parties in large part responsible for this state of affairs are also The French Communist Party for example has come out in support of direct elections to the European Parliament espoused the force de frappe backed the concepts of Eurocommunism and stepped up its criticism of the Soviet Union Just as each of these steps has made life with the French Socialistsand the alliance between the two parties  more credible so it has made the Communist Partys relations with the Soviet Union more difficult With those four decisions the party showed that it had finally accepted the European Community that it was nationalist in matters of defense that it no longer conceived of Communism in France as resembling the Russian model and that it was no longer unconditionally proSoviet Cynics still dismiss change and strife among the Communists as cosmetic in nature but it seems undeniable that the Communist parties of Western Europe are not on good terms with Moscow and that part of their sucBoth the Communists and the Socialists are being crafty in this preelectoral period They may peck away at each other to show that they are rivals as well as allies but they avoid the bitter personal attacks exchanged by the Gaullists and the Giscardian centrists Each of the two leftist parties wants to come out ahead each knows that its real troubles will begin afterward With its sweeping nationalizations workers control trade protectionism and price freeze enough is known of the lefts Common Program of Government It would be unprecedented in France The Popular Front of 1936 which ended in failure is not comparable The front had no common program nor did the Communists participate in the front Governments There were Communists in the postwar Governments of 194447 prior to the outbreak of the cold war but they held only minor posts in coalitions representing all major French parties not just the left The likely consequences of a leftist assumption of power today can be easily imagined Some of them like a flight of capital a drop in investments and a collapse on the Paris Bourse are already under way But there would be more  a falling franc import barriers difficulties in the Common Market and the Atlantic Alliance and much business failure Some lessons can be learned from the severe economic dislocation that occurred in Portugal though admittedly Portugal a nonindustrial country cannot be the perfect example The French Socialists dismiss most of these fears as exaggerated and illintentioned They claim that they have thought of everything  that they will control the Communists excesses that there will be an initial period of difficult transition and that an economic takeoff will follow Above all they try to calm the fears of the United States They are making repeated trips to Washington these days with the same message Dont worry and above all dont interfere France is not Chile The French people would not tolerate American interference in their democratic Though things certainly would not go as smoothly as the Socialists like to think there is no reason to believe that utter chaos would follow a victory by the left It is unlikely that the Communists who have waited so long to come out of their ghetto and try their hand at government would destroy it all through impossible demands The party does not want to be pushed back 20 years by a strong rightist reaction under Jacques Chirac A leftist victory next March would expose the hole in the Constitution of the Fifth Republic tailored in 1958 for the majestic figure of General de Gaulle The opposition never came close to winning during the de GaullePompidou years and so the Constitution has never been tested by having a President of One ideology and a Prime Minister and Cabinet of another Even with Mitterrand as Prime Minister of a Government of Socialists and Communists Giscard under constitutional provisions would still serve Out the rest of his term with the considerable powers his office enjoys He says he will not resign but stay on hand for another three years to try to restrain the left In practice however he would be quickly transformed into a lame duck He would have several weapons at his disposal if the going got rough including dissolution of Parliament but what would there be to keep the French from deciding that he hadnt given the left a chance and voting it right hack in If that happened or if Giscard against expectations chose to resign it would mark the end turn to government by Parliament the symbol of the Third and Fourth Republics going hack to 1870 A demonstration outside the French Embassy in Tel Aviv protesting the release in Paris of o Palestinian terrorist suspect one of a series of recent blunders ht the Discard Government It is probably only fair that a nation that turns aside from the traditional way and is unwilling to try a middle way should take on something completely new The French have done that in t he past and their history unlike that of Britain has been one of abrupt shocks and great exuberance followed by a return to the natural order of things They seem to need periods of collective catharsis which accomplish little from a historical point of view but feel so good Valery Giscard dEstaing doesnt need the catharsis doesnt like the shocks and doesnt understand the need A foreigner may sympathize with him and shake his head at the French But as Georges Pompidou pointed out they are notAngloSaxsons

CARTER SAID TO BACK BAR TO RACE QUOTAS,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/12/archives/carter-said-to-back-bar-to-race-quotas.html,WASHINGTON Sept 11President Carter will not alter the general themes of the JusticeDepartments proposed legal brief in a landmark civil rights case although he may suggest some substantive changes in the wording according to White House officials In the draft of a brief to be filed with the Supreme Court this week the department argued that a university admissions system that reserves a specific number of places in each class for members of minority groups should be found unconstitutional because affirmative action programs must use race as a way of eliminating unfairness not perpetuating it It is both desirable and constitutional to consider race as part of the multitude of pertinent factors that bear on an applicants qualifications for admission the department stated But precise racial quotas it declared amount to using race as a tool of exclusion against whites The amicus curiae or friend of the court brief was drafted by the Solicitor General Wade H McCree Jr and was considered by the President over the weekend It is unusual although not unheard of for a President to concern himself with the legal stance taken by the Government in a case before the Supreme Court It would be even rarer according to Justice Department officials if the President were to overrule the position of his Solicitor General Copies of the controversial brief were sent to several Government officials last week and one of them made it available to The New York Times today The gist of the brief but not the nature of the arguments was reported by The Times last week The brief was prepared in the case of Allan Bakke a white who says that he was unconstitutionally discriminated against when he was denied admission to the medical school at the University of California at Davis and a number of lessqualified blacks Chicanos and AsianAmericans were admitted under a special quota system Mr Bakkes suit has generated one of the most important civil rights cases in decades The Supreme Court which is scheduled to hear arguments on the case in October and issue a decision later in the term may decide the constitutionality not only of admissions quotas but also of a variety of programs in other areas that give special preference to members of racial minorities The Carter Administrations position important both because its brief could have some influence on the Courts decision and because it clarifies the Administrations overall civil rights policy A number of ranking Government officials including Joseph A Califano Jr Secretary of Health Education and Welfare and Eleanor Holmes Norton chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission are known to have expressed opposition to the Justice Departments position They along with most civil rights activists believe that a Court decision outlawing the use of racial quotas would deny blacks and members of other minority groups access to university placemant jobs and other advantages from which those people have been excluded in the past Black Caucus Acts Last Friday the Congressional Black Caucus in a letter to President Carer declared that the Justice Departments position if upheld by the Court would have the effect of irretrievably undermining the affirmative action programs of public and private entities Officials at the Justice Department said that Mr McCree who is black based his brief on legal considerations Other officials said however that the Administrations civil rights policy was reflected in the document The department urged the Court to decide the Bakke case narrowly and not rule on the constitutionality of the many other Federal and state programs that take race into account in various ways and for various purposes There was enough evidence the brief asserted to indicate that Mr Bakke was unconstitutionally discriminated against anti should he admitted to the medical school But the brief added that the evidence presented in the lower court the only factual record that the Supreme Court is allowed to consider was insufficient as a basis for a sweeping decision However in case the Court shoul cide to make a broad ruling the Justice Department laid out its position in detail in the 88page document Distinction Is Drawn The department drew a distinction between on the one hand affirmative action programs that considered race along with other factors in judging a candidates qualifications for admission and on the other hand systems such as that at the University of California at Davis that excluded everyone but minority applicants for certain spots The California school reserved 16 of 100 positions in each class for blacks Chicanos and AsianAmericans First in its argument the brief detailed at length how blacks and members of other minority groups had suffered from past discrimination and needed special consideration if they were to compete on an equal footing with whites But the special privilege the hrief de clared should be applied only to the extent necessary to make the competition fair Race may he useful to provide more complete information about the meaning of credentials that standing by them selves do not fully reveal the applicants abilities and potential the document stated An Example Given It would obviously be reasonable for the faculty to conclude that a particular disadvantaged black applicant with a 35 [grade] average has shown more motivation and determination to succeed than has a middleclass white applicant with the same average and is therefore more deserving of admission it continued The difficulty with the University of California system the brief stated was that white men and women could not be considered for certain spots in each class Race the brief asserted should be used in making admissions decisions only to assist in promoting the fairness of an evaluation that is otherwise racially neutral We doubt that i14 is ever proper to use race to close any Abortion of the class for competition by members of all races the argument continued It is one thing to give a minority applicant the sort of consideration that will assist him in competing fairly against other applicants is quite another to set aside a number of slots for which interracial competition is precluded

Push as Parley Ends,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/12/archives/feminist-group-cites-backlash-vows-era-push-as-parley-ends.html,SAN JOSE Calif Sept 11After hearing repeated warnings of a growing rightwing backlash against their cause hundreds of women political activists meeting here vowed with cheers and applause today to push for ratification of the troubled equal rights amendment The plang for a final drive for the pro posed constitutional amendment came at the end of a threeday convention of the National Womens Political Caucus and several feminist leaders said that the session marked the first time that the issue of such a backlash has been addressed at a national womens group The leadership at the convention which was attended by 1250 feminists warned that the chances of approval of the equal rights amendment the keystone goal of the womens movement before a March 22 1979 deadline were increasingly dim A Genuine Threat In addition to the drive for ratification the delegates citing what they see as growing opposition to their goals by conservative groups ranging from rightwing Republicans to the Mormon Church to the Ku Klux Klan girded for what they expected to be a stormy confrontation with such opponents at the International Womens Year meeting in Houston in November The reason we now have all this opposition is that we are now considered a genuine threat before no one took us seriously said Jane McMichael executive director of the national caucus Speaking to the delegates last night Gloria Steinem the editor of Ms magazine and an early leader of the womens movement began optimistically noting that the womens movement appears to be in extremely good shape all things considered She cited gains in jobs and political offices But echoing a point made by others she said that success had brought probleas Because we have become a majority and have been taken seriously we have a backlash from the radical right which she said is rooted in business interests that have something to lose as women gain equality Despite a succession of speeches at the meeting in which business political conservatives anti some religious groups were accused 01 sapping the momentum of the womens movement other delegates placed soine of the blame for troubles in the fight for the equal rights amendment on women themselves C DeLores Tucker the Pennsylvania Secretary of State warned the convention that wcmen were risking defeat of the proposed amendment by spreading their efforts to other causes citing in particular efforts to broaden access to abortions Abortion Fight Defended Although leaders of the womens group here said that they had no choice but to fight for abortion because they consider it a basic issue for women several delegates said that in their states Roman Catholic opposition to abortion was probably hurting the E R A ratification drive Privately some women acknowledged internal friction was probably also hampering the movement Observers here who attended the groups two earlier conventions generally agreed that this years meeting was better organized and less troubled by internal disputes and that the organization had matured into a more sophisticated political organization than it was when it began in 1971 In its final session delegates elected Millie Jeffrey of Detroit a former official of the United Auto Workers as chairman for the next two years succeeding Audrey R Colom They also passed a resolution denouncing the Justice Department for not supporting affirmative action programs in its brief on the Allen Bakke case that is pending before the United States Supreme Court The women also made plans to seek the election of sympathetic legislators during 1978 elections and said that they expected to have a war chest of more than Si million for the renewed push for the amendment There was general agreement that the equal rights amendment whose passage had once seemed assured was now in trouble The legislatures of 33 states must approve it for ratification Of the 35 states that have already approved the amendment threeNebraska Tennessee and Idahohave voted to rescind their approval The womens group contends that these votes will be ruled void by courts But even if they succeed on this count its going to be a very very tight squeeze to get the other three ratified Miss McMichael said Were going to have to work very hard from here on in Studies are under way to determine which of four or five states are most likely to ratify the amendment and where the organizations limited funds should be spent Miriam Dorsey of Raleigh NC a leader in the ratification fight said the possibilities include North Carolina Florida Virginia and Oklahoma

85 years old today Like a mythic god on Mount Etna in The Aeneid the distinguished publisher unloosed a thunderbolt to stir up men and cities for the occasion The state of the Western world is so bad that think we are living through the beginning of the end of a great civilization You can sum up the reason in a fiveletter word Greed He should know about The Decline of the West After all he published Oswald Spenglers book on the theme a halfcentury ago He has also published many of the other authors whose works bridge the history of modern literature from Thomas Manns Death in Venice to John Herseys Hiroshima towell to yesterdays Page 1 review in The Times Book Review of Toni Morrisons Song of Solomon To name only a few titles from the House of Knopf is to overlook the numerous authors under his imprint who have received the Nobel Prize in Literature In a tour dhorizon the other day Mr Knopf who serves more as a presence than a publisher now talked about some of the things that interested himpolitics the environment music Brazil and even books I have nothing to do with the daybyday running of the firm he said 1 dont attend editorial meetings I do come into the office about twice a week but Im more like a retired partner in a successful law firm who is consulted once in a while My colleagues do very well running the firm The Role He Plays One of his colleagues observed Alfred does play a role more than he realizes Hes here to remind us who we are He founded the company in 1915 before the razzledazzle of todays publishing scene where books are often made not born and the demands of the marketplace sometimes overpower taste and originality The House of Knopf is a subsidiary of Random House which is a subsidiary of the RCA Corporation This firm was a onetime happening Mr Knopf said I dont think a publisher could start now with 5000 Atheneum began with a million in 1959 Where would you find printers who would turn out two special copies of a book for youone for your father the other for your fiancee Or a binder who gave you six months to pay if you had it Over the years Blanche and I did what we pleased and published the books we cared about Telegram From Mencken The late Blanche Knopf was major factor in the companys success and standards helping to bring in many European and South American authors Their son Alfred Knopf Jr is chairman of the board of Atheneum Publishers Mr Knopf is now married to the former Helen Norcross Hedrick who is giving a private birthday party for friends at the Cosmopolitan Club this evening On the occasion of Mr Knopfs 80th birthday Alistair Cooke longtime friend and Knopf author invented a telegram to him from the late HL Mencken a longtime friend and Knopf author It read he recalled Dont hurryits not so good up here Mr Knopf who spends some of his time firing off letters to editors and politicians and other inhabitants of the nether regions is not enamoured of bestseller liststo mention one of his favourite targets I think that bestseller lists ought to be abolished by law he declared Theyre just another example of running with the crowd He paused for thought and effect and raised an elegant eyebrow above his guardsmans mustache blue shirt and green tie On a chair next to his desk was a Malaccalike cane and a Panama hat with a ribband of red But the hell with publishinglets talk about the state of the world he said I think that Americans have a habit of electing the wrong people He picked up a copy of the Common Cause bulletin Look at this list of Senators who voted against their own bill on the public financing of Senatorial campaigns No Two Sides To It Of the state of the nation he said There is no question of my admiring Jimmy Carter If he goes the whole system goes down with him But his stand on abortion is shocking Im so mad about it that I would vote in protest for any woman on the ballot The right of a woman not to become pregnant is her own affair As Mencken used to say There are some questions on which there are not two sides One of Mr Knopfs disappointments is that some of his Brazilian authors have not broken through to North American readers in bigger way In particular he cites Jorge Amado author of Home Is the Sailor Doha Flor and Her Two Husbands and other novels Mr Knopfs authors were treated as friginds across his active publishing years One reason was that the Borzoi colophon on a Knopf book meant that special care would be taken with its design and physical appearance A Note on the Type still appears on the final page of every Knopf book Willa Cather one of Americas finest novelists said of her publisher He has of course published books he thought very secondrate and he has successfully done business with people who were not congenial to him But in his own mind he kept the two sets of values apart clear and distinct On the eve of his birthday Mr Knopf observed Ive had the best of it I was born at the

Dissident Episcopalians Meet to Discuss New Church,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/15/archives/dissident-episcopalians-meet-to-discuss-new-church.html,ST LOUIS Sept 14Decrying recent trends in the Episcopal Church including the churchs decision to ordain women priests hundreds of dissident priests and laymen opened a meeting here today for the purpose of founding a breakaway church The meeting was called by the Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen a coordinating ageny for 15 dissident groups after the Episcopal General Convention voted approval of women priests a year ago While opposition to women priests provided the strongest motive for leaving the church the dissidents also object to revisions in the Episcopal prayer book and have denounced the churchs liberalized stands on such moral issues as abortion and divorce Growing Mood of Defiance There is no firm estimate of the size of the dissident movement Some believe that if a new structure appears many Episcopalians who are now straddling the fence would join the dissidents One leader believes that 230 of the 7192 parishes will join by the end of 1978 Another contends that the movement represents at least half a million of the 28 million member church  The growing mood of defiance was reflected in opening addresses to the 1500 participants in the ballroom of the Chase Park Plaza Hotel Speakers insisted that the new movement must retain continuity with Catholic tradition and they placed the burden of an impending aplit on the General Convention last year in Minneapolis A feeling has grown declared the Rev George W Rutter of Rosemont Pa that the worst sin is schism The worst sin is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit and we are tempted to it whenever we deny His voice in Scripture tradition and the humble exercise of conscience We do not want to precipitate schism for Minneapolis did that Father Rutler called the decision to ordain women an act of heresy and accused the Episcopal Church of lapsing into secularism It has replaced the cosmic with the cosmetic he said A New Spring Envisioned Another speaker the Rev Carroll Simcox retired editor of the conservative journal Living Church asserted Our intent is to create an ecclesial structure in which Anglican Christianity will have a fair chance and a favorable environment for a new beginning a new spring Noting that many Episcopalians agree with the dissidents but choose to carry on the fight within the church Father Simcox paraphrased a biblical text saying We go to prepare a place for you The meeting was intended to bring scattered elements of the resistance movement together and to lay the groundwork for an ongoing structure tentatively named the Anglican Church in North America As leaders envision the process the present gathering will draw up a set of common principles and agree to support a constitutional assembly that would establish the actual structure of the new church Terry Laukhuff of Amherst Va president of the Fellowship said that no date for a constitutional assembly had been set but that several months of planning would be needed to prepare for such an event Meanwhile supporters of the Episcopal church including Presiding Bishop John M Allin were present among the participants in a quiet effort to avert a break Bishop Allin was earlier turned down as a speaker at the gathering but decided to come as an observer About 15 other bishops were expected to attend hut the Fellowship decided not to allow them to address the group Supporters of the dissident cause many of whom paid their own expenses to attend the meeting come from a variety of backgrounds and for different reasons They are decidedly middleaged and reside in 92 dioceses in the United States and Canada Many are deeply troubled by what they feel is a necessary painful separation from a church they have known all their lives Some come from the 16 parishes that have already seceded from the church or from the dozens of independent missions that have grown up across the country Others have come partly out of curiosity undecided whether to leave the church and looking for signs and clues as to which direction to go They want the certainty that something is there if they decide to jump Mr Laukhuff said They dont like jumping into a void They want to make sure theyve got company Onethird of the participants were clergymen mostly from small parishes Many have become affiliated with one of two provisional dioceses that d re expected to form the nucleus of a new church One is the Diocese of the Holy Trinity a nongeographical jurisdiction based in Los Angeles and the Diocese of San Francisco The Diocese of Los Angeles has filed suit against five secessionist parishes within its boundaries challenging their claim to church property In addition five priests have been deposed for schismatic activities A number of other regional dioceses are expected to take shape after the St Louis meeting also to serve as interim structures until the final church is founded

16Disaffected members of the Episcopal Church angeied by the churchs decisions to ordain wom en priests seceded from the Episcopal Church today and pledged themselves to a new provisional body called the Anglican Church in North America United Press Introspectional DISSIDENTS BREAK FROM EPISCOPAL CHURCH The Rev James O Mote prays after being selected in St Louis to become a candidate for bishop in new church made up of disaffected members of Episcopal Church Page 8 An interim charter for the proposed church was received with a standing ovation by 1700 participants at the climax of a threeday meeting of dissidents here Terry Laukhuff president of the Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen which organized the meeting called the statement of secession one of the greatest historiCal documents in the history of the church Heiirged participants to sign pledges or tsupport for the document and to return home to bring your parishes into the developing structure of the new church Nearly 50 congregations including 16 secessionist parishes have become visibly involved in the dissident movement and dozeniof others are reportedly considering a similar move The establishment of a clear focal point now is expected to quiCken the pace Dissident leaders claim to represent the feelings of at least half a miilion Episcopalians The Bpiscopal Church the American branch Of the worldwide Anglican communion has 28 million members Among other things the secessionist charter calls for a constitutional assembly at an unspecified date to draw up a permanent church structure Leaders said that such an assembly would require several months of preparation Under the charter the assembly would be called by bishops of the church Thus far the proposed church has no bishops but yesterday members of the breakaway Diocese of the Holy Trinity based in Los Angeles elected a candidate the Rev James 0 Mote of Denver The consecration of Father Mote who was deposed by the Episcopal Church was delayed indefinitely until three Anglican bishops could be found to perform the rite More Unified Course Envisioned Bishop Albert A Chambers of Denis Mass who is retired and Bishop Clarence J Haden Jr of the Diocese of NorthernCalifornia have signified their willingness to conduct such a consecration but a third bishop has not yet publicly agreed to join them Dissident leaders plan to devote the next several months to adding to those parishes that have already seceded from the Episcopal Church According to the plan clusters of parishes will then form new dioceses and begin electing bishops In addition to the Diocese of the Holy Trinity the dissident movement includes the Diocese of San Francisco These two are believed to contain at least 500 parlshioners among eight parishes The charter providei the first concrete statement of principles on which to build a solid movement and its formulation was believed by participants to put the dissident crowd on a more unified course The sixpage singlespaced statement Set forth standards of belief and practice underscoring the necessity for restricting the priesthood to men and for retaining Book of Common Prayer as the only acceptable basis for worship A year ago the Episcopal General Convention approved both the ordination of women priests and preliminary acceptante of a revised prayer book Those reforms galvanized a fragmented protest movement that had for a dozen years complained that the Episcopal Church was drifting rapidly toward liberalism and secularism In making a total break with the church dissident leaders ignored the pleas of Episcopal spokesmen and insisted that the mainstream of the church which had voted the changes by solid General Convention majorities had broken with its traditional faith Reflecting that position the Affirmation of St Louis as todays charter statement was officially called portrays the emerging church as the legitimate bearer of true Anglican principles and charges that the Episcopal Church is schismatic The affirmation accuses the Episcopal Church of unlawful attempts to alter faith order and morality and concludes that the church has thereby departed from Christs One Holy Catholic and Apostlic Church Louis Traycik the prosecuting attorney for Ogemaw County Mich read the statement to the closing assembly in the Chase Park Plaza Hotel Behind the speakers rostrum an altar bearing four arrangements of red and white carnations and six long white candles had been arranged for the final mass The audience listened quietly through most of the reading When Mr Traycik related the statements vow to keep the new church out of the major ecumenical councils the gathering burst into applause In similar outbursts the participants noisily supported a promise to allow parishes to control their own property and fiscal affairs and they unanimously rose to their feet to cheer at the conclusion As hundreds of departing participants signed forms supporting the new church which most regard as continuing tradition rather than forming a new church there was widespread satisfaction with its founding principles The charter statement declares that no schismatic person or body can depose a valid priest obviously referring to the action by Episcopal bishops against six dissident priests The document asserts the new churchs intent to remain in communion with Canterliury the seat of Anglicanism While some branches including those in New Zealand and Canada have accepted women priests the Church of England has remained somewhat ambivalent on the issue In terms of doctrine the document affirms the sacred Scriptures the Nicene Creed Apostles Creed and the Creed of St Athanasius and seven Sacraments It also disclaims the right to change any traditional understanding or article of faith The section of the statement dealing with morality includes strong disapproval of abortion and divorcestands that have been recently liberalized by the Episcopal Church
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/17/archives/letters.html,To the Editor Allowing that Paul F Power is right in his belief that the United States could have a voice in Northern Ireland if it would use it letter Sept 7 it is a shame that he has conveniently neglected to speculate on what that voice might say to work the nonviolent miracle he seems to expect Mr Power gives what at first glance appears to be an admirablealbeit semantically eccentricsummation of the issues at stake and then ducks the question of their resolution by suggesting merely that the US should raise basic political questions inherent in the Ulster issue This is a statement almost as fatuous as Mr Carters recent hollow call for economic aid for the province Neither money nor the political cooing of a whole flock of American doves is going to make a blind bit of difference tothe factional extremists who make necessary the retention of the 32000 troops Whose presence and effect upon the British economy so alarms Mr Power What would he offer instead We are back to politics as Mr Power blithely and blindly denies any sectarian reason for the conflict and suggests that the United States is entitled and obligated to try to shape decisions in the AngloIrish context which look toward peaceful change consistent with the history of decolonization in many parts of the world The exact meaning of this confusion of platitudes is open to interpretation but Mr Powers thesis is now revealed as having the construction of a Swiss cheese Better men than he have striven for a peaceful solution to the Northern Irish troubles and better men than he hive quailed at the prospect of the appalling civil war which would surely follow any mass withdrawal of troops but Mr Power can airily dismiss their fears as exaggerated I wonder if Mr Power has actually been in Northern Ireland or indeed outside of his Ohio home His highflown prose on recent secular changes in the Irish Constitution and the growth Of pluralist attitudes through out Ireland and the suggestion of a climate of toleration and mutual respect under the rule of lam would suggest not There is law in Northern Ireland There is also the law of the gun and bomb the law of the bigot mob law Call it what you will As a British journalist who has worked in Belfast I was asked several years ago by an American in Pennsylvania why we the British that is didnt have any of our boys in Vietnam I asked in return and in what hoped was a jocular way why the Americans didnt have any of their boys in Northern Ireland I wonder It would at least ease the burden on the British of guarding Mr Powers periphery of 15 million persons thats quite a periphery in a small country and certainly would make more sense than any of his maundering halfanswers But it is of course a preposterous idea and the violence and polarization will continue Talk right now is all we have and talk we must with the Americans with anyone who might have some constructive light to shed upon this ancient problem But it might be better and certainly less issueclouding if such muddled thinkers and closet polemicists as Paul F Power were to keep their mouths shut BILL TAYLOR New York Sept 7 1977 What Parks Are For To the Editor Time has come I believe when increased use of New York City parks by runners bicyclists walkers strollers players and even skiers and sledders justifies a permanent closing of Central Park and Prospect Park drives to cars during all daylight hours and well into the nght At a time when car traffic is being discouraged and pedestrian malls are discussed these parks should obviously again serve their original purpose and not function as highspeed commuting arteries Parkways are for the suburbs not the city It is not just a question of health peace and quietness but also of safety Accidents are frequent the wooden barriers between the walkways and the road are badly smashed and never repaired the wideopen road invites speeding racing through red lights is common on the West Side If the park has to be open at certain hours it should be only as toll road with the money to be used for park maintenance FRITZ MUELLER

showed in this crisis Despite the overwhelming burden of cases the assistants did not yield to the pressure either by sacriricing fairness or by failing to protect the public merely to clear the calendars On July 14 our office took in nearly three times the normal volume of criminal cases Arraignments were delayed at first because criminal histories were not available and because the arresting officers were needed for public protection on the street where they served backtoback shifts Our assistants worked as did the courts and Legal Aid until nearly 2 AM on Thursday and Friday and continued through the weekend More than 75 percent of the defendants had been arraigned within 48 hours of the end of the blackoutand 94 percent by the following day Cases lacking sufficient evidence were to be dismissed outright They were If the evidence showed a crime the assistants were not to dismiss merely to reduce the volume The care we took in screening is shown by the fact that a very small number of these cases were later dismissed by courts or grand juries As for the unfairly high bail it is not true Indeed about 24 percent of the defendants were released without any bail at all As for the harshness of our plea policies that depends on the point of view To one who is concerned only with the speedy release of defendants regardless of crime our policies may have seemed harsh We were concerned with the seriousness of the offenses and of the haim done We refused to be pressured into cheap plea bargains merely to reduce the volume of cases Our job is to prosecute offenders fairly and justly to the best of our ability We are doing it ROBERT M MORGENTHAU District Attorney of the County of New York New York Sept 12 1977 For an Accurate Affordable Congressional Record To the Editor It was indeed heartening to see a member of Congress write such a perceptive and wellwritten article on the defects of the Congressional Record as did Representative William Steiger on the OpEd page of your Aug 29 issue He is certainly correct when ne states that at 317 per page and rising the cost of printing the Record may soon become prohibitive note for example that it is for this reason that virtually none of the states print their own version of the Record to record the proceedings and debates of the state legislatures However Mr Steiger fails to note one important factor that helps to keep the cost of the Congressional Record artificially high Each member of Congress receives a fixed number of Congressional Record subscriptions which may be distributed free of charge at the individual members discretion These unpaidfor subscriptions are usually bestowed as gifts or favors to constituents or volunteer campaign workers The gratuitous copies add millions It is also correctly maintained by Mr Steiger that the usefulness of the Congressional Record debates as an analytic tool for the interpretation of legislative intent is severely impaired by the printing of rehearsed colloquies and superficial remarks made in absentia by the members of Congress Associate Supreme Court Justice Robert H Jackson noted the serious defects in the usefulness of the Record as far back as 1950 when he remarked in the Schwegmann Bros v Calvert case But to select casual statements from floor debates not always distinguished for candor or accuracy as a basis for making up our minds what law Congress intended to enact is to substitute ourselves for the Congress in one of its important functions Emphasis supplied Representative Steigers article should be read with great interest by every member of Congress I hope that his remarks will spur the Joint Committee on Printing and the House and Senate Rules Committees to institute the appropriate changes that will insure that the Record can once again become an accurate and affordable record of CongresSional events By the way it should be noted with some irony that when Congress returns from its recess Representative Steiger may ask to have the text of his article reprinted in the Recordeven though he wont actually he speaking on the House floor at the time he makes the request ROBERT

defined as slowmoving vehicles shouldnt they be required to display the triangular fluorescent orange sign that other vehicles do at these speeds On two occasions this summer rye nearly run onto mopeds with my car on dark streets There are probably several accidents daily because of this R C ELWELL Schenectady NY Sept 7 1977 Compelled Orthodoxy To the Editor Your letter writer of Aug 24 objecting to a recent decision allegedly invalidating on First Amendment grounds the required Pledge of Allegiance both misstates the case and misses the point It was in 1943 that the Supreme Court struck down compulsory flag salute as a violation of freedom of expression Justice Jackson wrote If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation it is that no official high or petty can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics nationalism religion or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein The recent case referred to by your reader accordingly held unconstitutional the requirement that pupils refusing to pledge allegiance must nevertheless stand silently during the ceremony In other words the Government cannot compel any act of orthodoxy whether by word of mouth or by standing on ones feet On the same ground the Supreme Court recently invalidated the motto on the license plates of New Hampshire Live free or die One can hardly agree with your reader that the law is trivialized when it extends protection against compelled orthodoxy BURTON CAINE Professor of Law Temple University Philadelphia Sept 8 1977
Matilda Cuomo: A Candidate's Wife Who Puts Her Family First,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/17/archives/matilda-cuomo-a-candidates-wife-who-puts-her-family-first-matilda-a.html,To reach the woman who may be the next First Lady of the City of New York it is sometimes necessary to vault a brace of bicycles fallen in the driveway scale steep concrete steps to an unassuming Cape Cod house and wade through unremitting offers of iced tea sandwiches and other sorts of homemade sustenance because like charity Matilda Cuomo begins at home But the house in Holliswood Queens where this friendly and foreverfeeding woman is most often found may be deceptively distant from the fray the campaign of her husband Mario for the mayoralty Plaques scattered around the kitchen are printed with maxims about facing a new day not with political slogans and the dining table is ringed with children as well as campaign confidants But Matilda Cuomos presence and her influence make her home an important part of the race for Gracie Mansion a building that she has never visited in a borough which she has never lived It is no secret that Mr Cuomos initial reluctance about running was a function of his wifes fears for a drastic change in the lives of their five children And this week the perception that to have her ear was to have her husbands grew still more when Mr Cuomo suggested that commercials showing a slow dissolve of the face of his opponent Edward I Koch into that of former Mayor John V Lindsay were withdrawn because of his wifes objections Mario said that Mrs Cuomo asked with some surprise Well its true that I always like more of Mario in the commercials more of Mario in the positive But I have reconsidered about those because it isnecessary for people to know the negative about Koch and what he stands for Ive gotten so many calls from people who think its very good Apparently members of the Cuomo campaign staff agree with Mrs Cuomos reassessment because the commercial has since been put back on the air Above all the good word in Matilda Raffa Cuomos conversation and the campaign topic she knows best is Mario So sincere you can depend on him she said He knows people hes honest he can bring them together he can work with them hes intelligent They are all qualities that the selfproclaimed Flatbush girl born and bred in Brooklyn in a family the size of her own noticed in the cafeteria of St Johns University when she first met the boy born and bred in Queens Within a year they were married after she graduated with a teaching degree and he started law school He wasnt a spender she said with a laugh and even today he still isnt for instead of getting rich he got involved I said to him along the line My God Mario you dont want to make money she said Theres no doubt that things could have been easierI was going to say if Mario had listened to methere is no doubt that we could have been living better and done more if he had practiced law and not gotten sidetracked Its hard but you cant really blame a person if theyre doing the right thing And finally she convinced herselfsometimes I think the children convinced me she saidthat the right thing this year was the mayoralty Oh its true that I was really against it at first Mrs Cuomo admitted in mileaminute bursts And my doubts were well founded It was not merely that Mario was not at home that has become the norm in 23 years of marriage in which the Cuomos have spent only one week alone togetherin Rome last year And Mrs Cuomo said the childrenMargaret 22 years old Richard 19 Maria 15 Madeline 13 and Christopher 7were enjoying themselves The role she had chosenI knew he would want me to stay home and raise the children and I was in accord with that she saidchanged too She was used to speaking her mind to her husband and children but not to Democratic clubs to voter forums Discusses the Issues I Was upset at first because I didnt know what I was doing Mrs Cuomo said in her living room all goldflocked wallpaper and goldflecked mirrors as the men of the Cuomo campaign ate meat loaf in the kitchen But it evolved into a luncheon here a tea there and then the senior citizens centers because it reflects badly on our society if we dont treat our elderly people well That has become her issue On the others she is less articulate seemingly less informed She opposes the death penalty but notes heatedly that the Mayor cannot legislate on it in any event On abortion she says Everyone has to live with their own conscience And she says her husband will act well on the hiring of women Its always by merit with Mario it doesnt matter what hell pick the best person It always comes back to this with Mrs Cuomo a bigeyed woman with the hones and body of one who has held on to a lot of her girlhood although yesterday marked a birthday whose lumber she will not disclose The issue is the man the man that she still knows better than anyone even though she can say a little sadly I think yesterday was the first time in weeks that we just had a few laughs together And she thinks that her endorsement should count for something Its offensive to hear my husband spoken of as a puppet because of the recommendation of the Governor recommendation that anyone would have wanted and accepted she said Im giving him my recommendation too and I think that shows something that Im willing to offer my husband to the city Because I knew hes that good
LETTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/18/archives/letters-privacy-and-the-press.html,The press freedomindividual privacy debate is not a good guysbad guys shootout but involves a fragile balancing of two public goods Floyd Abrams The Press Privacy and the Constitution Aug 21 warns that in the name of privacy we risk having officials  not editors  tell us what is newsworthy and how journalists should gather news If anything the balance has tipped the other way In recent years public interest and newsworthy exceptions have all but consumed the publicdisclosure tort aspect of the right of privacy And while many publishers editors and reporters use discretion when considering the publication of truthful but offensive and irrelevant informal ion commercial imperatives have encouraged others to use unfair and gratuitous items with impunity Director Legislative Commission on Privacy The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Boston Every day viewers of television news are subjected to ambitious reporters poking microphones at ordinary people in the grip of some terrible personal misfortune and asking How do you feel now that your home has been dest royed your wife and your children killed Arguably no public policy is served by this form of intrusion nor that of appealing to a prurient interest of readers by telling them about the affectional preferences of a citizen bystander who prevented the assassination of a President On the other hand the media are notoriously circumspect about reporting intimate though essential details about powerful public figures Only after he had announced his retirement did the press report that former House Speaker Carl Albert was more interested in women and alcohol than he was in running the House of Representatives Even now the Washington press corps adamantly refuses to pose the 64 question about Rosalynn Carters recent dilation and curettage Well was it an abortion And if so to what extent if any did the taxpayers subsidize it The reason for a strongly enforceable right to privacy is precisely that the publics right to know should he overseen by judges whose motivation is not to sell newspapers or compete for ratings but to protect the otherwise defenseless from unwarranted intrusions while guaranteeing the accessibility of information relevant to genuine issues of civic concern HARVARD HOLLENBERG Attorney at law New York City Floyd Abrams misses the point of a right to privacy in the seclusion of ones home when he notes what hijinks Mafiosi quacks and the like are up to in their homes Privacy builds a legal wall around the home for all of us No doubt many abuse the freedom they gain thereby But the wall is never legally insurmountable warrants probable cause and even deceptions allow the police among others to leap it in an easy legal bound Surely journalists like policemen and Presidential operatives ought not  and need not  disregard such frail legal barriers as we now have in pursuit of their causes however decent TOM GERETY School of Law Indiana University Bloomington Ind Mr Abrams applauds the application of the privacy concept to governmental intrusion but decries its application to the press I would rather have my family skeletons reported in a secret FBI file than on the front page of The Los Angeles Times If editors want to run the risk of treading into marginal areas for the sake of selling a few more copies then those extra copies can pay for their legal costs when their lack of discretion is challenged JO ANN M BECKER School of Law Fordham University Class of 1979 New York City In Orwells novel 1984 the basis for Big Brothers absolute control was his ability to monitor the intimate details of the lives of every citizen Totalitarianism may result from any gross power imbalance That the press which has already felt its oats by sponsoring the overthrow of an entire era of politics might have the right to intrude regardless of the means into the private dealings of all of us and to disseminate that knowledge means that the First Amendment might condone a government by the press that is more severe than a government by the politicians A dictatorship by the press in the guise of First Amendment freedom is no more palatable to me than the dictatorship by Big Brother that the press claims to fear EMILY BERK East Brunswick NJ Floyd Abrams in his otherwise admirable article on the press and privacy says Based on the experiences of the Hills Joseph Hayes wrote a bestselling novel The Desperate Hours The book added to the actual tribulations of the Hills certain incidents which had not occurred The fact is that Mr Abrams uses an assumption of facts which are not true and which took me many months and much of my energy and many thousands of my dollars to have dismissed by a judge and jury in court The Desperate Hours was not based on the Hills case or any other particular case JOSEPH HAYES Sarasota Fla Mr Abrams replies My statement that Mr Hayess novel and play were based upon the Hill familys experience stemmed from Mr Hayess own testimony in the Hill case as set forth in the opinion of Judge later Chief Judge Stanley H Fuld of the New York Court of Appeals In that testimony Mr Hayes stated that the reallife Hill case stimulated and inspired his writing of the play that it triggered the book in a very direct way and that the Life magazine heading True Crime Inspires Tense Play was certainly correct that true crime did inspire my play That being so I fail to see what it is in my article which so exercises Mr Hayes 
Varda: ‘Is There Such a Thing as A Woman's Film?’,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/18/archives/varda-is-there-such-a-thing-as-a-womans-film-is-there-such-a-thing.html,PARIS Agnes Varda whose One Sings the Other Doesnt has been chosen to open the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center adamantly denies that shes a filmmaker with a message although she feels strongly that women are usually portrayed as caricatures and that her film is a significant attempt to see them differently Do you understand she said Theres an enormous difference Filmmakers have to live in their time and place with opinions politics attitudes You cant be unhooked but significance is not a message Its not a militant film The picture is about two women one rebel who becomes a feminist pop singer and the othet quiet domestic But both learn selfpossession fight for the right to abortion bring up children alone and come to face the world with confidence It is by definition a feminist film though Miss Varda said some of the radical French feminists attacked it for being too nuanced not antimen enough She spoke about her picture her work herself her life over the stove as she cooked lunch at the table in the tiny garden of her groundfloor studioapartment and over coffee back in the kitch Frances leading woman director will open the New York Film Festival on Friday with her latest film One Sings the Other Doesnt She and director Jacques Demy with whom she has lived for 20 years converted two old shops into their home and offices painted doors and windows bright pink purple blue orange red collected a minijungle of potted plants and to make clear their establishment isnt quite like the rest of the ordinary Paris street painted the brick facade white with big mauve polka dots You see Im a contradiction myself Miss Varda said when a neighbor dropped in with some clothes she helped finish for the directors trip to New York for the film festival She had been explaining that her films are essentially all about inner contradictions and her own one is that Im a woman of tomorrow I have children out of wedlock advanced ideas I work hard all that but make my own clothes There was a long cotton flowered dress in tones of violet simple but fresh I bought the material at the market in Brittany where I was on holiday she explained I like to sew a little cook little garden a little look after the baby a little but just a little Its an antidote Its got to be carefully rationed not an institution Thats the trap for women You say I like to cook I like children and youre stuck with it and nothing else Obviously there is no risk for Miss Varda She is a 99yearold stubby bundle of voluble energy with short very black hair that she puts up in curlers after she washes it earnest greenish eyes a sensitive mouth and an overall air of knowing exactly what she wants to do without ever having had a moments doubt of being able She is proud that she was one of the first who launched New Wave films conscious feminist before Kate Millett and Penelope Gilliatt dedicated to her work and engaged in the world Im filmmaker and a member of the movement she said Which one interests you The two are not contradictory for her but neither are they synonymous You dont have to spend 600000 [the modest cost of the film which included many location trips in France as well as Holland and Iran] to be in the sisterhood that nice American word You can help women by changing the way people talk at the butchers But she is interested in looking at things from a different point of view Do you know any intelligent women They exist dont they Why arent they ever in films There are always stories about virile male friendships Brando and Nicholson Newman and Redford and so on but not about friendship between women The women are always motherly or tarty Is there such a thing as a womans film of special interest to women We have to see they havent had any choice Films are about the dominant class Workers dont have any choice either whether or not they care about bourgeois adultery The inner contradiction she was talking about is expressed in One Sings as the strain between womens desire for independence and selfreliance and their desire for family life stable relations In Le Bonheur film she made 10 years ago when I was 10 years younger thats the main difference the contradiction was in the demand for happiness Thats always selfish it contains the seeds of its own destruction Pomme the frizzy redtopped rebel of One Who Sings played by Valerie Mairesse is not happy Miss Varda said she is consistent and content Some women are inconsistent and happy But there has to be consistency cant stand theie women who make big proclamations about feminism and then say Darling buy me a mink Thats sexist blackmail just as much as Sweetheart bake me a cake The nuclear family is a base of oppression of powee tMdrxWas  right when he said the fainily was a miniature of the class power relations in the state At one point in Ope Sings the heroine says The man is the bourgeois and the woman is the proletariat Asked she is a Marxist Miss Varda shook her head firmly Not in that sense but Marx existed Freud existed these things come in the collective consciousness Still Miss Varda doesnt always interrogate her consciousness She has lots of babies and children in her films People ask what does it mean Why does make a woman more womanly to have children They dont ask Fellini what he means when he always has fat women He just likes them I like children guess Im a baby freak However the underlying theme is always there In Lions Love which she made in Hollywood in 1968 a different kind of contradiction was developed between the artifice of the selfconscious film world and the extravagance of the real world as presented in TV news It turns out that Hollywood winds up making cinema verite and the Cecil B De Mille spectacular is on the news Bobby Kennedys assassination it was almost on camera she said And now she is planning another approach to the thesis a film which might be made in the United States or in France but probably in Englishabout a family living in both countries astride the two cultures the two societies There are a lot of people like that In the end it is clear that Miss Vardas central impulse is to show the concrete everyday world she lives in and thinks about Once she made a short film about her block on the Rue Daguerre which has only one mauve polkadot house and otherwise is very typically Parisian She called it Daguerrotypes Someone complained that wasnt a balanced picture of Paris and she said Of course not it isnt even the whole district or the whole street but is really how people talk to each other on my block Jacques Demy her partner In life but not in films is more musical more dreamy she said He is working on big coproduction with the Russians a musical about filming Anna Karenina Their recipe for working akingside each other is that we never work together He has his world and I have mine I may be his first reader when the script is done or his first viewer but never make a suggestion Why should I He likes flying planes why should I go along if I dont Here this room the kitchen thats what we share and the bed What else is there to share We live together but we dont work together Valerie Mairesse and Therese Liotard the two stars of One Sings dropped by to see her bringing a bag of nectarines and some ham Miss Varda quickly ran through the calendar of the upcoming trip Besides the film festivals in New York and Telluride Colo there would be Cairo maybe Salonika I wont go alone said Miss Mairesse not without her nodding to Miss Liotard who is her dear friend in the film Silly said Miss Varda do you think youll be raped in front of the pyramids The subject turned to women in contemporary society It makes me terribly sad when there are women who dont have confidence in other women said Miss Varda Miss Mairesse pointed out that everyone had been astonished that you had confidence in me for this part Of course said Miss Varda I think the question was monstrous They didnt ask if you can act they knew that They said that since youre blonde and frizzy and funny you can only play stupid girls But it worked Remember in Taormina [where the film won the festival grand prize] the way the people watched and sighed They really liked it that reassured me because it showed it wasnt a theoretical intellectual film It was real to them In farewell Miss Varda said Remember to say that One Sings the Other Doesnt has been playing 27 weeks in Paris Thats chic thats whats good The message it became clear was the film  Agnes Varda director of One Sings the Other Doesnt Im a woman of tomorrow but   Therese Liotard and Valerie Mairesse who star as longtime friends in Miss Vardas film
Paris Cartoonist Lampoons the Frustrations of Her Readers,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/18/archives/paris-cartoonist-lampoons-the-frustrations-of-her-readers-hardwon.html,PARISClaire Bretecher like many Parisiennes longs for a bigger apartment and smaller hips Unlike many Parisiennes she lampoons these vanities in her immensely popular comic strip Les Frustrs The Frustrated Ones that appears here in the leftist weekly Le Nouvel Observateur And once or twice a year Miss Bretecher puts out an album of cartoons that presents a savage scatological and hilarious view of modern life not just French life Her books have been published in Italy Germany Yugoslavia the Netherlands Switzerland and Belgium In the United States where she would like to do more her cartoons have appeared in Ms magazine and Esquire In France the first I as Frustrs album sold 120000 copies Her seventh book published this summer is entitled Les Amours Ecologiques du Bolot Occidental and follows the adventures of an imaginary and amorous dog The Bolot Occidental and his perpetually pregnant wife live in The Third World next door to an animal reserve for endangered species Due to the Bolots indefatigable libido the couple is ineligible for the good life on the reserve but they keep trying This framework enables Miss Bretecher to send up conservation and ecology contraception and abortion the Pope male chauvinism and female docility the herd instinct class structure and the bourgeoisie Miss Bretecher who is 37 years old is herself the product of what she calls a bourgeois family with no money Born in Nantes she was educated in a convent With the chic nuns not the workingclass ones After a year of studying Beaux Arts and trying to be an art teacher she came to Paris HaidWon Success A tall stunning blonde with pale bluegray eyes a wide smile and a candid manner Miss Bretecher was not an instant success She bummed around knocking on doors for odd jobs when she was broke I always drew cartoons but it never occurred to me to make a living at it she recalled She drew illustrations for womens magazines I was very timid she said When Id get an appointment to see someone important Id allways vomit first In 1968 she got up enough courage to submit her first comic strip to Spirou then the top cartoon magazine Called Turnips in the Cosmos it was about astronauts She created several endearing characters for Spirou and later Pilote another cartoon publication including Robin the Faithful a crusader in the Middle Ages with Boy Scout leanings and Cellulite a naughty and sometimes raunchy little boy Three years ago the editor of Le Nouvel Observateur offered her a weekly strip He promised no censorship and no constraints Miss Bretether said To test him she produced a very funny and very rude strip showing how far a modern mother might go to pacify her overindulged son To Miss Bretechers astonishment the strip was printed and Les Frustrs was born Les Frustrs are a loosely knit group of pseudointellectuals who live in apartments with shag rugs and shop at Sonya Rykiellike many of the strips readers French intellectuals are fond of pondering the deep political significance of Les Frustrs which along with most everything else amuses their creator Im not political at Miss Bretecher insisted I dont even vote The cartoons are taken from everyday life Her own daily life is run from a small dishevelled Montmartre atelier where she works and lives with her husband a photographer Each morning she puts off the inevitable confrontation with the drawing board that occupies onethird of the living room On the morning of her deadline day she panics If I havent started by 2 I go to bed she said Once I rolled around til 4 thinking Nobody loves me Im stupid Im ugly etc etc And that was my strip for the week She says success has given her some confidence but not much Ive become a la mode quickly and some of my complexes have suddenly disappeared Les Frustrs have all of Miss Bretechers own problems and then some The males are nouveau riche poseurs patronizing chauvinists and insecure neurotics The females are vain and silly earnest feminists or downtrodden housewives and unfulfilled career girls Miss Bretcher claims that women appreciate her cartoons more than men Women can laugh at themselves Men feel hurt Their pride is wounded Openly contemptuous of men in general while professing to like them as individuals she said Im from a family where women are strong and men are weak I was raised to think its better not to marry than to marry a jerk But she is tired of womens liberation Ive resolved my own problems long ago Now I live with someone who understands that Im not doing the housework that my dough is mine and his is his and that I dont want kids But she has decided not to use her strip as a soapbox for her own feminist ideas I could have gone one of two waysto struggle and fight for women which is exhausting and finally limiting she said Or to forget about it and be more universal Male readers often think she hates women Ugh men she groaned Theyre such dopes Frankly Im fed up explaining things to them Miss

No‐Fault Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/18/archives/nofault-politics-washington.html,WASHINGTON Sept 17The Lance case has raised more problems and aroused more psychological demons than Mr Lance or President Carter ever imagined All the major players in this affairthe President and his staff Mr Lance the squabbling committee members and the presshave been soiled if not damaged They are all playing nofault politics blaming the system for their troubles And the trouble with it is that all their relations with one another in the future are likely to be influenced by this regrettable controversy The future is now the main issue We are coming in Washington into time when fundamental questions of national and world policy are rising to the fore At home on welfare reform tax reform educational reform inflation unemployment abortion busingeven the security of the American family from infancy to old age Abroad there are equally critical issues on the defense of the Western Hemisphere now dramatized by the controversies over the Panama Canal Cuba and illegal aliens from Mexico on the military and ideological coherence of whats left of the free world in the Atlantic and in Japan on the developing crisis in the Middle East the rules of trade and money in the industrial world and the racial struggles of Africa and the rest of the developing world Not a single one of these problems can be resolved by the President or the Congress alone Therefore they have to work together Nothing can be proved by logic in these tangles at home or abroad so they have to be resolved somehow by common sense and trust No problem in the hemisphere or the Atlantic Japan or in Rhodesia or South Africa can be composed without a sense of cooperation in Washington and without some confidence in the other capitals of the world that Carter and the Congress can agree on where they are and where they are going The Lance affair has been a diverMon from all this One of the enduring problems in a free and democratic society is how to keep the major problems that affect peoples lives from being overwhelmed by secondary issues This has troubled every writer and President in the United States since Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson and it is still a puzzler today For example if we measured the time and space on the national nightly news broadcasts and the newspaper front pages in the last month we would probably find that more attention was paid to Bert Lances banking practices South Koreas political payoffs Son of Sams murders and Elvis Presleys death than to all these other problems that will influence the human condition in the rest of this century Our new energy chief James Schlesinger was in Atlanta last week and proclaimed that we would have another economic crisis in the United States like the 30s with factories closing and families out of work and challenges to the security of our whole political and social system if we didnt begin now to conserve energy His eloquent appeals were scarcely noticed So there is a bit of a dilemma here because there is confusion about the meaning of the Lance controversy WASHINGTON is not surprising that the Government Operations Committee of the Senate loitered down into personal arguments over their responsibilities in dealing with Lance They were concentrating on personalities and on the past rather than on the future and Jimmy Carter has been doing the same thing He has been denying in his White House the ideals he used to get there and complaining about the press for pointing out the difference Lance has been making the point that it is unfair to judge a mans past business practices by the more strict banking and political rules of the presentwhich is not a bad pointbut he has chosen to attack the motives and even the integrity of members of the committee who may have attacked his motives but still must preside over Lances Office of Management and Budget in the future Whatever the rights and wrongs blunders or misjudgments of the past this obviously creates awkward personal and political problems for the future For one thing Lance has clearly revived the widespread fear that there is one rule for the rich and another for the poor in this country This is the drop of poison in his testimony and in the system he sought to defend He was an amiable and even ironic witness After all the United States had a few overdrafts of its own he observed but he promised to correct the overdraft system in his banks but didnt do so until he was forced by the Comptroller of the Currency He is an appealing and in some ways a tragic character but he missed the main point That is to say for whatever the reason or accident he has embarrassed the President diverted Mr Carter from his larger responsibilities attacked and divided the committee that has to oversee his work and infuriated members of the Senate whose votes are essential to much more important issues of national and foreign policy This is the future question that Mr Carter or Mr Lance or the Senate will have to deal with in the coming days
What Remains Is Sexual Melodrama,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/18/archives/what-remains-is-sexual-melodrama-melodrama.html,THE WALNUT DOOR By John Hersey 238 pp New York Alfred A Knopf 795 THROUGHOUT his long and meritorious career John Hersey has been an author of the public kind By that I mean that through his previous 18 books 11 of them novels Hersey has sought always to measure and define the impact of public eventsoften of the most massive and cataclysmic varietyupon the private character and mores of the individuals he has written about Perhaps that seems too obvious a way of talking about the author Hiroshima A Bell for Adano which won Hersey the Pulitzer Prize in 1946 The Algiers Motel Incident The Wall and more recently My Petition for More Space But while no one has ever denied his craftsmanshipHerseys ability to combine strong plot lines with meticulous research into the subjects that have concerned himhis reputation in literary circles has suffered at the hands of review Gene Lyons is a freelance writer who lives in Little Rock Ark He contributes a book review column to The Nation ers who do not care to be preached at in a novel or who have found his parables thin his allegorical tendencies unconvincing Accordingly although Hersey has spent much the past 20 years at Yale his alma mater and has more intellectual energy than whole regions of the Modern Language Association his work has not been made the object of academic enshrinement and very likely never will Probably this does not bother Hersey overmuch Since leaving his job as a war correspondent for Time magazine in 1944 he has always aimed for an audience broader than the one literary eminence customarily brings His novels teach themselves  Even so The Walnut Door seems to mark kind of departure The focus of this novel is the curious personal relationship between two pampered children of the educated middle class therefore Herseys ability to define character in this book is more important than the events he describes To a point Hersey succeeds quite well Elaine Quinlan managed to graduate from Bennington without having taken a single course in math beyond algebra or in

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/19/archives/letters.html,To the Editor Vigilance is most certainly needed in modernday medicine not as Dr Del Guercio maintains to prevent physicians from killing with kindness but rather to prevent us from painfully prolonging the agony of the dying in the face of the inevitable Dr Del Guercios address reprinted on your Sept 2 OpEd page should not be permitted to stand unopposed in its confused often contradictory approach to one of the major ethical dilemmas of 20thcentury medicine An easily refutable statement is that every other article in the New England Journal of Medicine    contains some reference to pulling the plug on patients   Would that more of our surgical confreres read every other article in that esteemed and invaluable journal In point of fact the journal did devote some pages in one issue Vol 295 No 7 to the nonresuscitation of terminal patients It seems that an argument could be made that not enough space is given in our medical journals to this fundamental question facing physicians virtually every day We should not forget that the Hippocratic Oath has been passed down to us over more than two thousand years It now includes many amendments made through the centuries not the least of which involve some precepts of JudeoChristian teaching Never was it meant as a fixed inviolate statement of Hellenic thought but rather it has undergone numerous changes and adaptations to the medical realities of the time Only in this fashion has it survived not only as a guarantee that the physician will not harm a patient but also that he will keep the best interests of the patient ahead of his own It is in this respect that I strongly object to Dr Del Guercios description of death with dignity as a tiresome phrase This in no way precludes the use of modern technology to help the viable patient or the use of public funds to finance further biomedical research It does however imply that there often comes a point of diminishing returns when the physician must accept the fact that no amount of technical knowhow can salvage a particular patient that we physicians have limitations and that there comes a time with certain moribund patients when all medical technology can do is prolong agony both for patient and family It is at this time I believe that the spirit of the Hippocratic Oath enjoins us to let nature take its course not because of economic considerations not because of politics not killing with kindness but because when all is said and done the one thing we as physicians can offer all patients is to ease their suffering There is no question that viable patients should enjoy all of the man power and technology available today in combating their illness However practitioners should screw their courage to the sticking place in realizing their limitations and beware the at times thin boundary between providing allout medical care for the living and bringing torture and needless suffering to the dying JEANPIERRE RAUFMANNMD Bronx Sept 6 1977 To the Editor Dr Del Guercios point about the physicians duty to preserve life needs all the support it can get but he does it a disservice by tying it to the Hippocratic Oath The authority of the oath has been rejected flatly by the medical profession as such The line to which Del Guercio appeals reads I will give no deadly drug to any though it be asked of me nor will I counsel such and especially I will not aid a woman to procure abortion Whether one is pro or con abortion is irrelevant What is important is that physicians who aid in procuring aborlions either reject the oath which is their privilege or violate it which is not Dr Del Guercio further prejudices his case by ignoring the distinction made about 30 years ago by Pius XII between putting a dying person to death and allowing a person without hope of recovery to die The distinction may be the subject of endless quibbling by physicians but there are times when specialists in any field do well to yield to common sense Prof WILLIAM A ROCK Susquehanna University Selinsgrove Pa Sept 3 1977  To the Editor Dr Del Guercio writes    our professional duty to deliver optimum care    means saving lives not killing with kindness Paying a doctor to help a terminal patient die is nonsense Does treating terminal patients ever save their lives Does paying a doctor to use chemotherapy radiotherapy and resuscitation equipment for terminal cases make sense Are the relief of pain and the provision of skilled and compassionate nursing synonymous with killing the patient with kindness Are we to be the arbitrators of when a terminal patient is to dieor is this not under the control of a higher Being These are important ethical questions M B HODES MD Oceanside LI Sept 3 1977 Freedoms Limits To the Editor In its current defense of the Nazis the American Civil Liberties Union has gone haywire Surely it knows  that the right of free speech does not include the right to shout Fire in a crowded theater when there is no fire The courts have long recognized this and certain other commonsense limitations on the right of free speech In essence they add up to the principle that free speech may not be used to incite to riot or to endanger the lives and safety of others The selection by the Nazis of a Jewish community containing many victims of Nazi torture and murder as a place for them to parade their hatred and murderous intentions is a deliberate incitement to riot There is no way such a parade could take place without the interposition of overwhelming police force And what would such a force be protecting The right of the Nazis to announce to the Jewish people in that community their intention to exterminate them That is torturing the concept of free speech to a point where it becomes sophist nonsense In our schools we teach our children that there are no rights without corresponding respon sibilities Is the American Civil Liberties Union so preoccupied with the rights that it ignores the responsibilities ALEXANDER TAFFEL Principal Bronx High School of Science Bronx NY Sept 7 1977 So That Adoptees Do Not Have to Vent Their Rage To the Editor In his Sept 7 letter assuring the public there is no need for anxiety over secrecy of the adoption records sealed in his Bronx Surrogate Court due to the coincidence that David Berkowitz appears to be an adopted child Judge Bertram R Gelfand is missing the lesson that should be drawn from the tragic Son of Sam killings I suggest that while the fact of adoption does not totally explain David Berkowitzs behavior it is an important element in it It may not be a coincidence that he is adopted and perhaps a proper offshoot of this tragedy should be a reexamination of what the sealed record does to the psyche of the adopted person I received many phone calls from adopted friends when news of David Berkowitzs adopted status came out My God hes one of us was the reaction All of them were horrified by what he had done but some part of them could recognize the source of his pathological rage and confusion I suggest it is no coincidence that psychiatric studies report a disproportionate number of adoptees in clinics and residential treatment centers throughout the country That the psychiatrists who examined David Berkowitz found him emotionally dead That this killer who signed himself Master of Reality in a letter from Korea had been cut off from the reality of his origins That a man who was not permitted to know whose son he was signed himself Son of Sam I suggest it is time for the public and Judge Gelfand to call for a way of opening adoption records so that future generations of adoptees do not have to vent their rage and frustration inward on themselves like those in our clinics or outward like David Berkowitz on society BEATTY JEAN LIFTON New York Sept 8 1977 Wrong Apple Pickers To the Editor Can somebody tell me why the US Department of Labor did not arrange for New Yorks unemployed people to get down to Virginia to pick the apple crop You dont even need a computer to figure out this simple case of supply and demand Does it make sense for the growers to import Jamaicans when Americans need jobs Only to the growers does it make sense As one reporter bluntly put it the imported help is more docile Translated into even plainer talk it means that they will put up with poor conditions It should not make sense to a US Department of Labor that really comprehends the overall situation in this country and is willing to make innova tions and plan effectively to combat unemployment So far its performance has been a disappointment and it seems that the big apple didnt pick the President it thought it was picking CHARLOTTE SAFIR New York Sept 3 1977 Moscow The Dissidents Who Came to Dinner To the Editor The Times in reporting the Moscow Book Fair overlooked an exceptional event On Sept 8 American trade publishers exhibiting at the fair invited Soviet authors to dinner at a Moscow restaurant The dinner was sponsored by the International Freedom to Publish Committee of the Association of American Publihers Among the guests were a number of dissident writers Soviet nonpersons denied membership in the Writers Union and precluded from publishing or earning a living at their craft Their disconnected phones and intercepted mail make them fearful of impending arrest and imprisonment Some of them have an audience abroad for their works but until last weeks dinner there has not been a formal occasion for them to meet with the foreigners who read edit and publish their books The dinner adds dimension to the debate engendered by The Times editorial of July 11 Selling Out at Moscows Book Fair That editorial criticized American participation in the fair as an insult to the courageous Soviet writers who are silenced in their own land and saw no alternative but for American publishers to stay away from the fair In fact American publishers were faced at that time with what is a recurring dilemma for those dealing with the Soviet Union either privately or at the government level Should we require human rights concessions from the Soviets before we agree to deal with them or is it better to meet with them on their terms in order to keep discussion open Do threats and public criticism work better than quiet diplomacy There isnt a simple answer for what works in one instance may not in the next Both approaches are valid and necessary and are often most effective when used in tandem It is a tribute to our open society that the American publishing industry did not take a unified approach to the Moscow fair Even within the Freedom to Publish Committee of the Association of American Publishers there was disagreement Some members chose to boycott the fair while others decided to attend Although these decisions were taken independently the result could not have been more effective had it been planned The Russians now know that there are some American publishers who will not do business with them at all under conditions of censorship They have also learned that many of those who exhibited in Moscow could not be dissuaded from meeting with dissident writers from raising sensitive issues with the authorities or from protesting when books were confiscated The Times should reserve its condemnation for those who refuse to take any stand publicly or privately against Soviet censorship For many American publishers at the Moscow Book Fair this was not the intention nor as reports now indicate has it been the case J ERI LABER Executive Director International Freedom to Publish Committee New York Sept 12 1977

Adolescent Pregnancy,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/24/archives/adolescent-pregnancy.html,CAMBRIDGE MassThe United States faces a problem that has reached the dimensions of a national disaster comparable to a flood epidemic or famineand one that results similarly from a colossal flaw of nature That flaw is the precipitous unprecedented drop in the age of puberty the problem is the spread of teenage pregnancy In 1840 the average young woman in Europe and the United States menstruated for the first time at the age of 17 her modern counterpart reaches the age of menstruation at about 12 Well known to biological anthropologists as the secular trend this crash in the age of sexual maturity has proceeded at the rate of four months per decade and in most populations continues The age of first possible parenthood has declined comparably and early literary references to teenage marriage and parenthood have been shown to be completely unrepresentative exaggerated or false In much of the third world we can watch the trend beginning Among the Kung San an African gatheringhunting people believed to model the original human way of life the age at first menstruation is 16 and the age at first birth 19 with a very narrow range Sex play in childhood and adolescence is ubiquitous 99 percent of girls are married by age 20 half of them before their first menstruation and no contraception is in use There is thus no explanation for the late age at first birth except late menstruation and adolescent sterility Human beings are not designed by evolution either in body or in spirit for the experience of adolescent pregnancy In the United Statesfrom 1940 to 1960 births in the 1519 maternal age group about doubled After 1960 outofwedlock births in the 1417year age range rose steadily until 1973 when legal abortions halted the rise But teenage pregnancy has continued to rise to the present rate of one million a year The fastest rise is in the youngest group 1113 years As maternal age drops from age 20 mortality risk for mother and child rises sharply as does the probability of birth defects Offspring of adolescent mothers if they survive are more likely to have impaired intellectual functioning Poverty divorce inept parenting child neglect and child abuse are all more frequent in teenage parents The baby of course is not the only sufferer For women of all ages the incidence of onset of mental illness increases fivefold to fifteenfold during the first month after delivery What sort of effect may we expect it to have on a junior high school girl Little stretch of the imagination is required to conclude that denying her an abortion is in itself a form of child abuse even leaving aside the kitchenabortion horror tales In every other arena of life including the criminal court we absolve her of responsibility for her actions in the maternity clinic we avert our eyes and condemn her Consider the plight of these children Assaulted by culturally sanctioned sexual innuendo and borne along by physical and physiological events that have never before befallen such young children they are at the mercy of their own and one anothers impulses having five years less experience and mental growth than their pubescent counterparts of a century ago To guide them through these biological storms we offer religions thick with the dust of a past era parental counsel that is vague timid false irrelevant or negligible and teachers who on the subject of contraception are silenced by rule of law The people who keep children in the dark about contraception have now deprived them of a major source of rescue from the accident caused by this legislated ignorance An estimated onethird of the 250000300000 abortions funded by Medicaid each year go to teenagers and it is easy to see how ignorance kept a ceiling on this figure even before the law withdrew the funds bowing to a superstitious campaign against womens rights to govern their bodies The effect of this capitulation is the moral and practical equivalent of sabotaging a lone remaining dam above an already inundated flood plain Its result will be a lockstep cycle of children born to children inadequately parented and inadequately parenting condemned to poverty with a generation turnover time approaching one decade Let us hope that the proposed substitute bounty payments to foster parentsis merely illadvised because if it is not illadvised it is simply cynical Foster care is such a wellstudied failure that it is difficult to be charitable to its promoters except where the only alternative is the orphanage We may sympathize with the impulse of those whose private views make them oppose abortion on ethical grounds But their personal reading of the human moral law need not constrain the rest of us from exercising a more complex judgment We must now evidently fight for the right to do so In the meantime the law may yet provide some protection for pregnant children The arguments that I give though they must not be taken as a substitute for a womans right to choose produce the conclusion that an abortion must always be available to a teenager Modern teenagers are the victims of a physiological blight the capacity for immature pregnancya tragic anomalous biological novelty It is our clear duty to help save them from this blight not condemn them to it A little moment ago in European history the intense convictions of some people led them to enjoin otherson pain of torture and deathfrom believing that rulers derived their power from the governed that many religions were possible that animal species were mutable and that the planet Earth revolved around the sun In another moment the highminded stricture against womens rights over their bodies will seem in retrospect comparably arbitrary and bullying But for the transient rather desperate here and now some of us have a moral sense that enables us to feel obligated to several hundred thousand pregnant children
SWITZERLAND VOTING ON ABORTION REFORM,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/24/archives/switzerland-voting-on-abortion-reform-weeklong-balloting-will.html,GENEVA Sept 23In what is known here as direct democracy Swiss citizens this week are deciding such major national issues as whether to give all women the legal right to have an abortion within 12 weeks of becoming pregnant In balloting ending on Sunday the voters are deciding the fate of a proposed constitutional amendment that would end the present virtual ban on abortions Exceptions are now allowed only when two physicians certify that a pregnancy endangers a womans life or threatens to impair her health seriously The proposal has been placed on the ballot in accordance with a constitutional provision that allows 50000 registered voters to sponsor an amendment for adoption in a nationwide vote That procedure is itself at issue in the voting this week Voters are asked to approve or reject a proposal by Parliament that the signatures of 100000 registered voters instead of the present 50000 be required for the initiation of constitutional change Another proposal from Parliament before the electorate calls for increasing the number of signatures needed to demand a referendum on legislation from the present 35000 to 50000 In proposing these changes Parliament pointed out that with the expansion of population and the enfranchising of women the number of voters had increased sixfold since the current signature totals were decided upcn in 1874 As a result it argued the present totals allow so much polling as to be detrimental to efficient government But opponents see in these proposals an attempt to curb the rights of the ordinary citizen Environmentalists have placed on the ballot through the initiative route a proposed constitutional amendment that would demand immediate compliance with strict cleanair regulations for cars that the Government Parliament and the Swiss automobile trade regard as impossible to enforce The Government has drafted plans for meeting approximately the same goals as the proposed measure but by stages extending to 1982 Voters also have before them two proposals for protecting tenants from unreasonable rent increases In addition to these national issues most of the voters will be called upon to pass on a broad array of proposals dealing with local affairs The most divisive of the national issues is the proposed constitutional amendment on abortions Reflecting the diVisions between and within the countrys almost equally numbered Roman Catholic and Protestant populations as well as its political parties medical associations womens groups and other private organizations the federal Parliament was unable to agree on whether to recommend the acceptance or rejection of the proposed 12week abortion rule As a result for the first time Swiss citizens are voting on a private initiative without the benefit of Parliaments advice The present law has many opponents because its enforcement is left up to each cf the 25 cantons that compose the Swiss confederation Some cantons particularly those with large urban populations interpret the law liberally Supporters of the 12week rule say that as many as 70000 abortions are performed in Switzerland each year either illegally or by stretching the present law The approval of this rule they contend would end the hypocrisy that now surrounds abortions and make them equally attainable for all women The abortion measure like all proposed constitutional amendments must win majority of the votes cast both nationwide and in a majority of the individual cantons This second hurdle is particularly feared by the measures supporters because opposition is strongest in the smaller conservative cantons which outnumber these where the late urban populations are concentrated
Sexual Revolution in Soviet Straining Strict Morality,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/25/archives/sexual-revolution-in-soviet-straining-strict-morality-soviet.html,MOSCOW Sept 24The leading Soviet literary weekly suggested last spring that an increase in the number of children born out of wedlock not only might improve the countrys sagging birthrate but also might allow women who do not marry to have families Morality should not stand in the way of human happiness wrote Leonid Zhukhovitsky in Literaturnaya Gazeta After all its inherent obligation is to protect the human being and not itself Such frankness in the pages of the publication of the Writers Union can be attributed in part to the Kremlins concern over a birthrate that has hovered near 18 per 1000 of population for a decade It also highlights changing attitudes toward the longtaboo subject of sex A Puritanical Facade Maintained Since the Bolshevik Revolution which was followed by a hedonistic period until Lenin attempted to squelch it the Soviet Union has maintained a puritanical facade Its citizens have been insulated from the pornography that assaults the West and Soviet films and magazines are generally demure That facade does not reflect the realities in a country where one new mother in 10 is unmarried where almost a third of marriages break up and where sexual encounters have become commonplace The leadership has seemed ambivalent about how to respond The shift in moral values evokes the sexual revolution that hit the West some years ago but a Russian contends that it results from a dissipation of faith We dont have anything to believe in he said Either you believe in God or inthe man who is leading you Without either it is hard to have morality A tolerance for sexual relations outside marriage has become most noticeable in the major cities Viktor I Pereverdentsev a leading social demographer reported two years ago that nearly half of a sample of happily married women in Leningrad believed that they were entitled to extramarital affairs Another researcher in Moscow privately recounted details of an unpublished survey of young unmarried women in which twothirds condoned premarital sex and the rest were mostly indifferent A study of Leningrad students several years ago disclosed that 85 percent of the men and 64 percent of the women had had sexual relations before they were 21 years old A few confessions have even emerged in the controlled press For goodness sake dont think that some immoral woman is writing you a 34yearold Kiev housewife recently told the weekly supplement Nedelya in revealing details of an affair she had carried on for five years According to published statistics over 400000 babies a year are born out of wedlock despite the availability of birthcontrol devices and a national network of abortion clinics that charge less than 7 for a visit A Leningrad study disclosed that one of 14 young brides questioned cited pregnancy as the motive for getting married The premarital pregnancy rate seems to be due not only to nonchalance among young men but also to sporadic shortages of the birthcontrol devices Speaking of condoms a young father said You dont always find them available While Soviet brands sell in packets of five for 35 cents foreignmade ones bring a ruble apiece or 140 on the black market Pills Loops Vasectomies The birthcontrol pill Is less popular than in the United States or Europe because of side effects like weight gain Sovietmade diaphragms are considered unreliable with loops or cervical caps more widely preferred A Moscow physician said that vasectomies had caught on only among Government or party officials who wanted to eliminate risk of blackmail if they engaged in extramarital affairs Though gigantic shifts in societys approach to extramarital and premarital sex were noted by Dr Perevedentsev the social demographer more than two years ago the authorities long refused to acknowledge that a prqblem existed A researcher told of a censor who refused to approve a study of frigidity among women until the figures were lowered a 1974 manual announced that 100 percent of Soviet men in a study reported achieving orgasm though articles have since hinted otherwise One consequence is that schools have virtually ignored sex education except for the Baltic republic of Latvia which allots 12 hours a year We had no classes in it so we learned about sex ourselves a Moscow member of Komsomol the Communist youth organization recalled In our school everybody slept around by the time we had finished the eighth grade By the 10th grade one girl was already pregnant But when I look at the kids today I think we were quite moral Articles have dramatically limned the horrors of premarital sex Zdorovye a widely read health magazine warned young men a couple of years ogo that intimacy before marriage can cause fluctuations of potency that become the source of doubt lack of confidence and sometimes even neurotic reactions Young women it said usually encounter disillusionment and a conviction of frigidity The Advice Is Sometimes Dated Zdorovye has taken the lead in telling Russians what they want to learn about sex including how long intercourse should lasttwo minutes it advised It sometimes sounds dated for it says among other things that women have less interest in sex than men The most common male mistake is the tendency to overestimate the sexual aspirations of women explained A I Belkin a physician in a 1975 article The coldness of a young wife becomes an unexpected and unpleasant discovery for the husband Yet it is quite natural The cautious trend toward more candor has prompted a number of readers to share their experiences He swooped down like a kite and afterwards he fell fast asleep a young bride complained describing her wedding night In the morning when he woke up he was surprised to see my tearswollen eyes Zdorovye urged more tenderness from the bridegroom because nature isnt on her side at this difficult moment Despite widespread interest specialists still complain about a lack of literature on sexual subjects A book on venereal disease for adolescents I Will Speak Frankly was praised by critics but printed in only 30000 copies Perhaps the biggest stride has been the creation of marriage clinics first in Riga and then in Leningrad and Moscow Cheslovas S Grizitskas a neuropathologist who runs the program in Riga told a Soviet interviewer last year We simply prepare our young people very badly for marriage and they enter adulthood considering that love is only enjoyment But love is also responsibility 50 Divorce Rate in Moscow Disenchantment is reflected in the divorce statistics which last showed 27 divorces for 100 marriages Dr Perevedentsev calling this figure low because it included only officially registered divorces estimated that up to a third of the marriages might have ended In cities like Moscow and Kiev the divorce rate is approaching 50 percent of marriages A Leningrad survey of 1000 divorced people reported that 244 cited infidelity among the reasons why their marriages broke up while 215 mentioned drunkenness these could be symptoms rather than causes of course The continuing housing shortage which forces many newlyweds to squeeze in with relatives has also contributed to the toll another Leningrad study found that 79 percent of divorced couples polled did not have their own accommodations when they married The lack of apartments has apparently discouraged some couples from matrimony though not from love affairs A popular trysting place for unmarried students in Moscow has been the cramped compartments of the overnight train to Leningrad System Encourages Affairs A divorced Muscovite contended that the rising statistics did not reflect the extent of failed marriages If you join the Communist Party or become an official a divorce would look bad on your record he said But the higher you go the easier it becomes to acquire a mistress The system encourages extramarital affairs He reported that some young women at his office got promoted by sleeping with the manager The most recent census has shown 15 million more married women than men Sociologists attribute the discrepancy in part to unwed mothers who list themselves as married One in Sverdlovsk who is 46 wrote Literaturnaya Gazeta to plead for more understanding I am not a single mother at all she said I dont feel alone because I have a son In the controversial article in Literaturnaya Gazeta suggesting more children out of wedlock Mr Zhukhovitsky argued that an increase in extramarital affairs and illegitimate births should not be ascribed simply to promiscuity If many many unmarried women did not become mothers society today would be short many many children And children are the countrys future He concluded After all what is really bitter is not life without a husband but life without love
Swiss Voters Uphold Abortion Ban,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/26/archives/long-island-opinion-swiss-voters-uphold-abortion-ban.html,GENEVA Sept 25Switzerland retained its ban on elective abortions today by rejecting in a nationwide referendum a proposal to permit a woman freely to obtain an abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy The proposal was doubly defeated when it failed to win the endorsement of either a majority of Switzerlands 25 cantons or states or a nationwide majority of voters Both majorities were needed for approval because it was proposed as constitutional amendment Only eight of the cantons approved the measure Although these included cantons with large urban populations they could not offset the opposing votes The nationwide total was 994677 to 929239 against the proposed change with a relatively high turnout of 50 percent of registered voters The double rejection was a severe setback for supporters of liberalization of the present law which permits abortions only if two doctors agree that a pregnancy endangers a womans life or threatens to impair her health seriously The sponsors expected that the conservativeminded small cantons and those that are predominantly Roman Catholic which together form a majority would vote against easing the abortion ban But they had hoped that the voting in the cantons with large urban populations would provide a nationwide majority for the measure The Roman Catholic hierarchy strongly opposed the measure as did many Protestant clergymen Switzerlands population of 63 million is almost equally divided between Protestants and Catholics After three years of consideration Parliament aproved last June a Government bill that retains the principle that abortions are banned but permits exceptions for other than medical reasons for the first time A recognized social worker will be able to certify that an abortion is necessary to spare the expectant mother grave distress The approved bill was not put into effect pending todays vote but it now becomes law In other votes today the Swiss approved Parliaments proposal that the endorsement of 100000 registered voters instead of the present 50000 be required to force a referendum on a projected constitutional amendment Similarly they agreed to increase to the number of signatures needed to force a referendum on a bill passed by Parliament to 50000 from 30000 Again heeding Parliaments recommendations the voters rejected by large majorities a proposal by ecologists to introduce stringent antipollution standards for motor vehicles The standards were deemed unattainable in the time allowed except at great economic cost
House Leaders Seek to End Standoff With Senate Over Abortion Funds,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/27/archives/house-leaders-seek-to-end-standoff-with-senate-over-abortion-funds.html,WASHINGTON Sept 26House leaders will seek tomorrow to break a threemonth deadlock between the House and Senate over Medicaid funding for abortions a situation that has stalled 601 billion in appropriations for the Departments of Labor and of Health Education and Welfare The negotiations have been conducted against a Friday deadline that Federal officials said today was largely illusory Although the fiscal year expires on that day Congresss failure to appropriate new funds would have little impact on continued disbursements for the fiscal year that begins Saturday the officials said Programs would be financed despite inaction on the new appropriation the officials said because of provisions that allow for continued payments for Social Security benefits aid to the aged blind and disabled public works jobs manpower training and other major programs Payrolls Would Be Affected However the payrolls of the two Federal agencies would be affected by the middle of next month if an agreement is not reached Were in a bind Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr said today of the deadlocked HouseSenate conference Were trying to work it out Later today a vote by the full House was scheduled for tomorrow on the Senates version of the legislation Senate conferees vowed Sept 12 not to attend any further conference sessions until the House voted on the Senates more permissive legislation which would allow Medicaidfunded abortions when medically necessary a term that House conferees consider deliberately vague The Senate voted 60 to 33 last month to reject the more stringent House legislation which would ban all Medicaid abortions except in cases in which the womans life was endangered A standoff was ended last year when the Senate conferees acceded to a similar House bill They did so however with the belief that the Supreme Court would uphold their position But the Courts ruling this summer that upheld a ban on Medicaid abortions appears to have stiffened the Senate position House leaders who sought ways today to bring the Senate measure to the House floor tomorrow also worked behind the scenes to effect a compromise However House conferees today appeared adamant at a closed meeting and unlikely to accept some of the exceptions approved by the Senate which would allow Medicaid when abortions are performed in cases of rape or incest or if the woman suffers from a disease such as multiple sclerosis or renal disorders Nor did either House or Senate conferees appear concerned with the ostensible Friday deadline Robert Burrill the Treasury Departments chief disbursing officer said that Congresss failure to appropriate new funds would not interfere with the scheduled mailing on Thursday of checks for Supplemental Security Income A spokesman for the Social Security Administration said that 42 million recipients whowere aged blind and disabled would receive checks totaling 410 million Mr Burrill said that three days later the Treasury Department would mail Social Security checks totaling 65 billion to 333 million recipients Mr Burrill said that these checks are covered by a trust fund and would be disbursed throughout the year regardless of whether Congress appropriated the funds However an HEW official said that If Congress failed to appropriate new funds by Oct 18 the agency would be unable to meet its payroll of 133000 persons Similarly a Labor Department spokesman said that funds for public works employment jobs manpower training and other major programs would be disbursed regardless of Congressional action However the department could not pay its 16000 employees unless a Congressional appropriation was enacted by midOctober
ACCORD IS EMERGING IN CONGRESS ON BAR TO MEDICAID ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/28/archives/accord-is-emerging-in-congress-on-bar-to-medicaid-abortion.html,WASHINGTON Sept 27The outline of a compromise that would break a threemonth deadlock between the House and Senate on abortions funded by Medicaid emerged today after the House voted 252 to 164 to affirm support of a ban on such abortions except when the mothers life was endangered The House action cleared the way for an agreement because Senate conferees had vowed Sept 12 not to attend any conference sessions on the issue until the House voted on the Senates version of the bill The Senate had rejected the Houses version in early August Senator Warren G Magnuson Democrat of Washington who is chairman of the Senate conferees said that the Senators would yield on their insistence upon the financing of abortions that were medically necessary a term that the House conferees regarded as deliberately vague In exchange Senator Magnuson said he hopes that the House conferees will accept Senate language that would allow such abortions in the case of women suffering a wide range of specific diseases including insanity measles multiple sclerosis and kidney disease that could endanger the life of the mother or the health of the fetus An informal poll indicated that the would be acceptable to most House conferees Senator Magnuson also said he hoped the House would yield to the Senate language and allow Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest a proposal on which the House conferees appeared severely divided The deadlock over the abortion issue has stalled the 601 billion appropriation bill for the Departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare Senator Magnusons proposed exceptions to the Medicaid ban are in the conference report accompanying the existing law A memorandum prepared recently by the Attorney General indicated that the report does not have the force of law We dont want to do that this year Senator Magnuson said We want to put them in the bill Representative Daniel J Flood Democrat of Pennsylvania who is chairman of the 13 House conferees said today that he considered the exemption of those suffering specific diseases to be plausible but added that he wanted to consider it The HouseSenate conferees will meet tomorrow afternoon for the first time since Sept 12 when they vowed not to return to the conference table until the House had voted on the latest Senate bill That vote was held today If any compromise is approved the new legislation would permit Medicaid payment for more abortions than were permitted under the presen law which is identical to the House version Representative David R Obey Democrat of Wisconsin who is considered a moderate among the conferees said that he would support both Senate positions I dont think theres a majority yet but a majority could be gotten Mr Obey said Representative Silvio O Conte Republican of Massachusetts another conferee who is the author of the provision that allows Medicaidfunded abortions when the mothers life was endangered said that he would support the exemption of those suffering specific diseases but not exceptions for rape and incest Those cases he said were usually resolved immediately after the incident by dilation and curettage It would have a good chance Mr Conte said of Senator Magnusons proposal to exempt those suffering from specific ailments Representative Edward R Roybal Democrat of California another conferee said that he was supporting all the exemptions sought by Senator Magnuson Republican members of the House made the big difference in todays vote in which 135 Democrats voted to support the Senate position and 139 Democrats voted against the Senate position However 113 Republicans voted to oppose the Senate position while only 29 Republicans voted to support it Todays vote came up on a motion by Representative Louis Stokes Democrat of Ohio who told the House The Senate language is not my language my preference is no languague The onehour debate was short eventempered and generally predictable The House Democratic leaders officially took no role in the vote although many House members inferred that the leadership sought a vote that would strengthen the House conferees Thomas P ONeill Jr Speaker of the House told newsmen that although he had declined to vote on the Houses abortion ban he supported the measure Representative Flood told the chamber I urge that the resolution be decisively defeated so that we can go back to conference with a strengthened hand Representative Robert E Bauman Conservative Republican of Maryland said that there can be no compromise on an issue of life and death the Senate language is so broad that it constitutes abortion on demand However Representative Robert N Giaimo Democrat of Connecticut argued that Were never going to agree in this country on the great divisive issue of abortion so it behooves us to find a middle ground Representative Elizabeth Holtzman Democrat of Brooklyn told the House To deny a safe medical abortion in the case of rape or incest is unconscionable Representative Joel Pritchard Republican of Washington said that the real issue is whether were going to have safe abortions or illegal abortions for the women in this country Dont think today that the House of Representatives is going to stop abortions in the United States he added  Last a similar HouseSenate impasse was brolen when the Senate yielded to the House language At that time however many of those in favor of abortion believed that the Supreme Court would uphold their position However earlier this year the Supreme Court upheld the ban on Medicaid abortions and that appears to have stiffened the Senates resolve Senator Magnuson and Mr ONeill both predicted a swift resolution of the impasse probably within 48 hours The negotiations have been conducted against a deadline Friday that Federal officials have said was largely illusory Although the fiscal year expires on that day failure by Congress to appropriate new funds would have little impact on continued disbursements for the fiscal year that begins Saturday Oct 1 In a related development an Institute of Planned ParenthoodWorld Population released today a study that showed that at least 261000 lowincome women in this country 85 percent of whom were on welfare obtained abortions last year that were paid for at least in part through Medicaid and Social Services programs at a total cost to the Government of 61 million The repbrt said that the average cost of an abortion in the United States in 1976 was 280 which was 42 higher than the average monthly welfare payment for an entire family

emerge The House voted 252 to 164 to affirm its support of a ban on such abortions except when the mothers life is endangered The chairman of the Senate conferees Warren Magnuson of Washington said

IllinoisGovernorActingLikeU.S.Candidate,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/28/archives/illinois-governor-acting-like-us-candidate.html,CHICAGO Sept 27About the time the other day when the last stragglers were limping along Chicagos lakefront toward the finish line in the first annual Mayor Richard J Daley Marathon Gov James R Thompson was sprawling in the Arizona sun absorbed in an account of a different kind of running He was reading Jules Witcovers Marathon a recounting of Jimmy Carters dogged fouryear campaign for the Presidency he won last fall No one has suggested that Mr Thomp son 41 years old has yet set his sights on winning the Republican Presidential nomination in 1980 with anything like the early singlemindedness Mr Carter brought to the task of becoming the Democratic standard bearer But Big Jim Thompson as the 6foot 6inch 210pound Republican Governor is widely known has scarcely been reticent about acknowledging that he has more than a passing interest in national office somewhere down the road Many Questions on Future Since winning the Governorship last year by 1390137 votes the largest margin in the states history over Michael Howlett the colorless Secretary of State who was Mayor Daleys chosen candidate Mr Thompson has seldom made an appearance without having to face up to questions about his longrange plans from fellow Republicans as well as from the press In the past he has conceded that he might like to run for President some day but recently although he does not disguise his pleasure at being asked he has been more circumspect in his answers For one thing he is aware that he faces a reelection race in Illinois next year He was only elected to a twoyear term last year because of a constitutional change that was made to get elections for state office out of the Presidential cycle And as he told a questioner in Tucson as he prepares to run for a fouryear term Im not so politically foolish as to allow my opponent in 1978 whoever it may be to go around saying Thompson is off running for the Presidency and what we need is a Governor of Illinois Jokes About Visiting Home His frequent speaking engagements outside the state which have recently included political appearances in Iowa New York Wisconsin Arizona Washington DC and Michigan have led to occasional jokes in Illinois about whether the Governor might be visiting his home state at the moment But the boyishlooking Governor whose casual clothes and relaxed manner at least rival the style of President Carter does not seem troubled by the implied criticism At a Republican fundraising dinner attended by more than 300 persons in Tucson the other night he grinned and said Some cynical reporters in my state when they heard I was coming back to Arizona in September after having been here in July asked How many electoral votes does Arizona have  As the audience laughed he added still smiling Jim Thompson isnt running for anything but Governor of Illinois I dont know how many electoral votes Arizona has but youve got a lot of Illinoisans Arizona Although he acknowledged in an interview that he had been cautious about traveling during the legislative session that ended in July Mr Thompson said he had loosened up a little more since then His aides say that he gets scores of invitations to speak out of state as well as hundreds from within Illinois At the moment he plans to make political appearances in the next few months in Michigan New Hampshire Indiana Ohio and Mississippi If his Democratic opposition believes he is vulnerable because of his apparent interest in national office it has not evidenced itself in any stampede of candidates to challenge him net year On the contrary two of the betterknown Democrats in the state Daniel Walker the former Governor who was defeated in the 1976 primary by Mr Howlett and Secretary of State Alan Dixon both of whom were considered possible gubernatorial candidates have already declared that they definitely will not make the race Michael J Bakalis the State Comptroller the only other Democrat with a statewide reputation who has been mentioned seriously as a gubetnatorial candidate is reported to be taking soundings at the moment before announcing his intentions probably in early October While Mr Thompson has been given generally high marks as Governor even by his opposition there are some leading Democrats who have declared that his smooth sailing through the last legislative session was due more to luck than to political skill They say that with the death of Mayor Daley Mayor Michael A Bilandic and other leaders of the Chicago machine were reluctant to stir up too much controversy by battling the demonstrably popular Governor and that they were happy to accept compromises with Mr Thompson that benefited the city Failure on Crime Plan The only major setback the Governor suffered at the hands of the Democraticcontrolled Legislature was the failure to pass his socalled Class X Crime package which would have set minimum sixyear penalties for several serious crimes Mr Thompson a former United States Attorney who is usually considered moderatetoliberal Republican makes much of his tough stance on crime especially before partisan GOP audiences In Tucson the other night where he spoke before going on to Austin Tex to make a nonpartisan speech on regional problems at a symposium at the Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Public Affairs Mr Thompson was warmly applauded by his Republican audience as he declared in explaining his Class X crime plan And when people say Governor that means an 18yearold who holds up a grocery will have to get a minimum sixyear sentence I say thats right and I say he should Anybody who walks into a store with a loaded gun prepared to use it ought to go to jail for six years maybe longer Mr Thompson did not mention to that audience that he had recently vetoed two bills that passed the Legislature overwhelmingly one of which would have prevented the use of state funds for abortions and the other of which would have permitted the use of laetrile in the treatment of cancer Although he concedes that both vetoes may be overridden at a special session of the Legislature beginning Oct 24 Mr Thompson a physicians son declared that he could not sign either as a matter of conscience
ACCORD IS EMERGING IN CONGRESS ON BAR TO MEDICAID ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/28/archives/accord-is-emerging-in-congress-on-bar-to-medicaid-abortion-could.html,WASHINGTON Sept 27The outline of a compromise that would break threemonth deadlock between the House and Senate on abortions funded by Medicaid emerged today after the House voted 252 to 164 to affirm support of a ban on such abortions except when the mothers life was endangered The House action cleared the way for an agreement because Senate conferees had vowed Sept 12 not to attend any conference sessions on the issue until the House voted on the Senates version of the bill The Senate had rejected the Houses version in early August Senator Warren G Magnuson Democrat of Washington who is chairman of the Senate conferees said that the Senators would yield on their insistence upon the financing of abortions that were medically necessary a term that the House conferees regarded as deliberately vague Senator Specifies Diseases In exchange Senator Magnuson said he hopes that the House conferees will accept Senate language that would allow such abortions in the case of women suffering a wide range of specific diseases including insanity measles multiple sclerosis and kidney disease that could endanger the life of the mother or the health of the fetus An informal poll indicated that the would be acceptable to most House conferees Senator Magnuson also said he hoped the House would yield to the Senate language and allow Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest a proposal on which the House conferees appeared severely divided The deadlock over the abortion issue has stalled the 601 billion appropriation bill for the Departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare Senator Magnusons proposed exceptions to the Medicaid ban are in the conference report accompanying the existing law A memorandum prepared recently by the Attorney General indicated that the report does not have the force of law We dont want to do that this year Senator Magnuson said We want to put them in the bill Conferees to Meet Today Representative Daniel J Flood Democrat of Pennsylvania who is chairman of the 13 House conferees said today that he considered the exemption of those suffering specific diseases to be plausible but added that he wanted to consider it The HouseSenate conferees will meet tomorrow afternoon for the first time since Sept 12 when they vowed not to return to the conference table until the House had voted on the latest Senate bill That vote was held today If any compromise is approved the new legislation would permit Medicaid payment for more abortions than were permitted under the present law which is identical to the House version Representative David R Obey Democrat of Wisconsin who is considered a moderate among the conferees said that he would support both Senate positions I dont think theres a majority yet but a majority could be gotten Mr Obey said Representative Silvio O Conte Republican of Massachusetts another conferee who is the author of the provision that allows Medicaidfunded abortions when the mothers life was endangered said that he would support the exemption of those suffering specific diseases but not exceptions for rape and incest Those cases he said were usually resolved immediately after the incident by dilation and curettage It would have a good chance Mr Conte said of Senator Magnusons proposal to exempt those suffering from specific ailments Representative Edward R Roybal Democrat of California another conferee said that he was supporting all the exemptions sought by Senator Magnuson Republican members of the House made the big difference in todays vote in which 135 Democrats voted to support the Senate position and 139 Democrats voted against the Senate position However 113 Republicans voted to oppose the Senate position while only 29 Republicans voted to support it Todays vote came up on a motion by Representative Louis Stokes Democrat of Ohio who told the House The Senate language is not my language my preference is no languague The onehour debate was short eventempered and generally predictable The House Democratic leaders officially took no role in the vote although many House members inferred that the leadership sought a vote that would strengthen the House conferees Thomas P ONeill Jr Speaker of the House told newsmen that although he had declined to vote on the Houses abortion ban he supported the measure Representative Flood told the chamber I urge that the resolution be decisively defeated so that we can go back to conference with a strengthened hand Representative Robert E Bauman Conservative Republican of Maryland said that there can be no compromise on an issue of life and death the Senate language is so broad that it constitutes abortion on demand However Representative Robert N Giaimo Democrat of Connecticut argued that Were never going to agree in this country on the great divisive issue of abortion so it behooves us to find a middle ground Senate Yielded Last Year Representative Elizabeth Holtzman Democrat of Brooklyn told the House To deny a safe medical abortion in the case of rape or incest is unconscionable Representative Joel Pritchard Republican of Washington said that the real issue is whether were going to have safe abortions or illegal abortions for the women in this country Dont think today that the House of Representatives is going to stop abortions in the United States he added Last year a similar HouseSenate impasse was brolfen when the Senate yielded to the House language At that time however many of those in favor of abortion believed that the Supreme Court would uphold their position However earlier this year the Supreme Court upheld the ban on Medicaid abortions and that appears to have stiffened the Senates resolve Senator Magnuson and Mr ONeill both predicted a swift resolution of the impasse probably within 48 hours The negotiations have been conducted against a deadline Friday that Federal officials have said was largely illusory Although the fiscal year expires on that day failure by Congress to appropriate new funds would have little impact on continued disbursements for the fiscal year that begins Saturday Oct 1 In a related development an Institute of Planned ParenthoodWorld Population released today a study that showed that at least 261000 lowincome women in this country 85 percent of whom were on welfare obtained abortions last year that were paid for at least in part through Medicaid and Social Services programs at a total cost to the Government of 61 million The report said that the average cost of an abortion in the United States in 1976 was 280 which was 42 higher than the average monthly welfare payment for an entire family

Abortion—;One Mother's View,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/02/archives/new-jersey-weekly-abortionone-mothers-view.html,MY CHILD is dead if one can call a 3monthold fetus a child I do He lived for three hours a rare feat for a premature baby the size of a pen and weighing but six ounces He was only two weeks over the legal limit in every state for being aborted on demand Ive sat through the livingcolor slide shows of antiabortionists with their blowups of aborted dismembered children and discolored salinesolutioned children and have been properly mortified But nothing can bring the fact of destroying life into a more painful personal focus than involvement with a doomed fetus struggling to live No one has ever been sadistic enough to suggest showing a mother her aborted child To do so would place ones mental state in question But the very fact that the normal mind cringes from such cruelty indicates a curious fallacy in the way we compel ourselves to make decisions dealing with human life and death We remove ourselves from the situation We intellectualize rather than humanize In the name of science the common good zero population growth or whatever one chooses to call it we have reduced into a source of ridicule the valid part that emotions play in decisionmaking Most repugnant in the arguments for abortion is the contention that the fetus especially in its earliest forms is not a human being that its life functions are primitive that it isnt human in the legal sense of the term Being black I live daily with the result of that kind of thinking directed against my ancestors to justify slavery and its own attendant denial of human and legal rights In order to destroy believing the object of ones destruction to be subhuman or inferior is a palliative prerequisite It is not just by chance that a poll of doctors revealed that the ones least in favor of abortions were those directly involved with birth and related areas obstetricians and gynecologists Those most in favor were those doctors least involved with direct birth contact psychiatrists This principle of favoring from an aloof distance is pervasive No one with the capacity to create a war is ever seen dying in it The cries to bring back the death penalty are not from those who rehabilitate former criminals Involvement involves The social problems that force a woman to decide on an abortion are valid indeed But equally valid is the tenuous grip on life that begins with conception the heartbeat by the sixth week and the kicking and friskiness by the ninth week although he or she is still yet too small to be felt by the mother A glib sanctimonious repeal of abortion laws is not the solution Killing on A glib sanctimonious repeal of abortion is not the solution all levels was here long before any laws against it One answer is to inculcate in our children the imperativeness of reliable contraceptive measures with the same naturalness and sense of purpose that we make school nutrition end play a part of their lives Unless one is planning a child intercourse without reliable contraceptive measures could become as remote as ones wildest fantasy Our countrys record of almost 800000 married and unmarried women undergoing legal abortions in one year and the record of our nations capital of having more abortions than live births last year is a sinister commentary on the frivolity and impulsiveness with which we inadvertently conceive unwanted children When we take the enigma out of conceiving life perhaps we will then be ready to cherish it where it properly belongswith life itself  Martha DuVal lives in Plainfield
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/02/archives/the-nation-summary-carters-chance-to-close-some-loopholes.html,During his election campaign President Carter often derided the nations maze of tax laws as a disgrace to the human race and more loophole than law Audiences applauded but inthe absence of a strong wellorganized constituency for revision tax law changes remain politically difficult and particularly vulnerable to specialinterest pressures Last week preparing to submit the Administrations package of proposals to change the tax system Mr Carters general approach became somewhat clearermake Congress swallow the bitter changes by adding sweeteners in the form of general tax rate reductions for most families and businesses These are the main elements of the tax package Personal taxes The Administration is expected to propose a series of changes that would lower the amount of tax paid by families earning less than 100000 a year and especially those earning less than 20000 The changes include replacing the 750 personal exemptions which are deducted from taxable income by a 250 credit against taxes owed The Carter package would reduce the marriage penalty by giving one spouse a special deduction and generally diminish the discrepancy in tax liabilities between married and unmarried taxpayers The Administration is also considering recommending a permanent reduction in withholding taxes partly to gain political support for structural revisions and partly to stimulate the economy Capital gains Unlike other income profit from the sale of assets is now treated as a capital gain and 50 percent of it is exempt from taxation The Treasury wants to abolish the exemption and also impose a tax on inheritance of assets the socalled death tax Congressional Democrats have warned that the death tax especially would be unpopular but Mr Carter is hoping to enhance its acceptability by proposing that it not be applied to family farms and small businesses Expense Accounts The President has been critical in the past of the practice of deducting the cost of elaborate lunches from a businesss taxable income Some Administration planners believed that Mr Carter should ask Congress to eliminate the lunch deduction entirely but the President apparently has decided that a provision to limit the deduction to half the meal bill would be more practical considering that the business lunch is such an institution Even that half measure is likely to provoke the wrath of the hotel and restaurant industry Mr Carter will probably take a firmer stance on business entertainment such as buying tickets for shows and sporting events by recommending that deductions be disallowed entirely Corporate taxes The Treasury has recommended elimination of the deferral of taxation on corporate profits earned overseas and reinvested there Ending the deferral could raise more than 100 million in revenue annually according to Administration analysts but corporations are expected to lobby fiercely to preserve their tax advantage They have won battles against similar proposals in the past Mr Carter is expected to try to soften the opposition somewhat by proposing a percent reduction in the general corporate tax rate now 48 percent He is also likely to make the package more attractive to business by including provision to give corporate stockholdets who pay a tax on dividends partial credit for taxes already paid by the corporation on profits Compromise On Abortion After three months of stalemate over the use of Medicaid funds for abortions the House and Senate seemed ready to compromise last week Further delay would push debate into the fiscal year that started yesterday leaving the Departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare without 601 billion in new appropriations But apparently not even money hanging in the balance could alter rigid positions and the new fiscal year arrived without a settlement Because of special provisions in the law though the two departments will be able to keep on spending as normal The question of how freely to apply Federal money to abortions became critical earlier this year when the United States Supreme Court upheld a ban on the use of Medicaid funds Essentially this affected poor women A study released last week by Planned ParenthoodWorld Population showed that last year at least 261000 lowincome women obtained abortions paid partly or in full through Medicaid or Social Services programs The cost to the Government was 61 million Through its conference committee the House insisted that abortions paid for by Medicaid be limited to cases in which the mothers life was in danger The Senate conferees wanted far more liberal plan to include pregnancies resulting from rape or incest and for cases where the mother or fetus would suffer serious permament health damage The broad differences prompted debates such as this The chairman of the Senate conferees insisted that the health damage allusion was intended for some 2000 genetic diseases but the chairman of the House conferees wondered disapprovingly if that would include an infant with one blue eye and one brown eye Despite some progress the two sides were still far apart and they decided to try tomorrowagain One More Step For Neutron The House last week followed the Senate and approved the funds President Carter wants for development of the neutron bomb After a sometimes acrimonious debate a proposal by Representative Ted Weiss DemocratLiberal of Manhattan to delete money for the bomb from the authorization bill for the Energy Research and Development Administration was defeated Mr Weiss however claimed a moral victory saying the debate had been the first discussion of tactical nuclear weapons on the House floor The neutron bomb Is comparatively more destructive to human life than conventional nuclear weapons and less destructive to buildings and landscape while its radiation is of short duration A region where the bomb was used would within hours be habitable again For this reason its proponents say it would be a more credible deterrent in Europe than present dirty tactical weapons while for exactly the same reason its opponents fear commanders would be too quick to use it thereby bringing on worldwide nuclear war Mr Carters decision whether to produce and deploy the bomb will follow further studies by the Pentagon and consultation with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies Since a Soviet attack would be expected to cross the northern plains of Germany it is presumably the West Germans whom the bomb is intended to protect but Defense Minister Georg Leber has denied that the West Germans are particularly eager to have the bomb in Europe The Soviets have several times condemned the bomb heartily but have also expressed a fairly cordial attitude toward renewing the stalled talks on strategic arms limitation and extending present limitation agreements beyond their current expiration date In the Matter Of Mr Helms Did Richard Helms commit perjury when he told a Senate committee in 1973 that the Central Intelligence Agency provided no financial help to political opponents of the late Salvador Allende Gossens president of Chile A Federal grand jury has yet to return an indictment against the former director of the CIA but the issue has already confronted the Carter Administration with a grave dilemma Since prosecution would force the Government to make public information that could damage national security the issue is Save the secrets or save Helms Asked about the case at his news conference last week President Carter suggested that a decision to prosecute would depend on the possible damage such a trial might have on security concerns He said he would take up the matter soon with Attorney General Griffin B Bell A Television In the House The House of Representatives is moving somewhat faster than a glacier toward broadcasting Its sessions on television From 1972 until 1974 the Joint Committee on Congressional Operations studied the idea then endorsed it Last week so did Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr Still the House remains cautiousmembers might be encouraged to showboat or caught asleep on camera with their feet on the desk Representative Jack Brooks of Texas chairman of the House committee that has endorsed broadcasting isnt one who fears the mediums message After listening to his colleagues for 24 years he said television would not cause more demagogic showmanship than members already generate As for those potentially embarrassing candid camera moments Mr Brooks noted that House employees would control the cameras Caroline Rand Herron and R V Denenberg
State Eases Law On Sex Education,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/02/archives/new-jersey-weekly-state-eases-law-on-sex-education.html,TRENTON UNDER new regulations approved recently by the states Board of Education local school districts in New Jersey with can now offer courses dealing human sexuality in optional separate classes for boys and girls without violating the law prohibiting the segregation of students by sex However the board also ruled that the content of the separate courses must essentially be the same The change approved by the board was a response in part to threats by some districts that they would eliminate sexeducation courses rather than teach them on a coeducational basis The revisions have generated renewed interest in the state in a forthcoming decision by Dr Fred G Burke Commissioner of the Department of Education involving a sexeducation controversy in the Bergen County community of Dumont The Dumont dispute involved the efforts of John Bannon to block the teaching of certain aspects of human sexuality to his daughter Patricia Mr Bannon regards these aspects as deviant and contrary to his familys religious belief which is Roman Catholicism After a number of hearings on the dispute beforehe Commissioner and two hearings before the Appellate Division of the State Superior Court Dr Burke expected to hand down a ruling soon The position of Mr Bannon in the hearings was that his daughter who has since been graduated should not have been forced to attend sexeducation courses dealing with abortion contraception and deviant sexual behavior The position of the board was that it could not allow any parent to unilaterally withdraw a child from a course that the parent regards as objectionable HoWeyer while the dispute was being adjudicated the Bannon girl was allowed to be excused from the objectionable aspects of the course and was given individual instruction instead In large part the revised regulations approved by the state board were aimed at heading off similar disputes in other districts where parents object to the teaching of sex in coeducational classrooms Previously any segregation based on sex was regarded as unlawful In an effort to achieve a compromise the state board referred to a 1975 opinion by the State Attorney General It held that the nonsegregation provisions in New Jerseys Administrative Code were much more strict than Federal regula Revised code has generated interest in Dumont dispute tions For one thing local New Jersey school districts were not given the Federal option of separating students by sex for sexeducation classes Thus the board subsequently ruled that coeducation courses could be optional in the state In addition it ruled that each district must provide separate restrooms shower and locker rooms although they must be comparable When the revisions were first proposed last spring one state board member remarked that separating sexes for sexeducation classes would not stop students from comparing notes afterward In addition state education officials said that although the courses should be essentially the same teachers could vary emphasis on some aspects of sex for girls and others for boys
Court Rule Stops Episcopal Priest From Preaching in Jersey Church,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/03/archives/court-rule-stops-episcopal-priest-from-preaching-in-jersey-church.html,PLAINFIELD N J Oct 2Bowing to the temporal authority of a Union County court order the Rev Stanwood E Graves stood mutely beside the altar of St Stephens Episcopal Church here this morning while another priest officiated at the mass and prayed that the bishops of this diocese may come to their senses about the ordination of women to the priesthood Father Graves whose congregation has sought to secede from the church because of its opposition to women in the priesthood had been forbidden to conduct the service by Bishop Albert W van Duzer whose edict was upheld in Superior Court on Friday As 300 parishioners squeezed into the churchs 90yearold oak pews Father Gravess place at the alter was taken by his predecessor the Rev Canon Ronald C Henstock who was called out of retirement to officiate at the mass Like Father Graves Father Henstock is also opposed to women in the priesthood and in his prayer of intention he chastised those he accused of using humanism instead of faith heresy instead of truth After the services it was Father Gravess turn to speak out and he denounced diocesan officials who he said had overstepped their bounds with a vengeance like a bunch of commissars and who were blackening the name of Christianity At issue is the question of liberalizing various aspects of the Episcopal Church While the most publicized part of the dispute concerns the ordination of women to the priesthood the controversy also  encompasses the marriage of homosexuals abortions and a revision of the prayer book All of these have in some degree been sanctioned by the national church but are strongly opposed by the congregation of St Stephens The importance of such matters was being debated far from the shinglewalled hillside church here today as a House of Bishops conference in Port St Lucie Fla supported Presiding Bishop John M Allin whose ideas are close to Father Gravess holding to a more traditional view of Episcopal theology One of these is that women should not be allowed to serve as priests because Christ was a man These matters will be debated again tomorrow when lawyers representing the St Stephens congregation will appeal Judge Harold Ackermans temporary restraining order issued Fridayin Superior Court enjoining Father Graves from preaching or conducting at the church Father Graves said this morning that he had decided not to disobey Judge Ackermans order despite the fact that St Stephens seceded from the Episcopal Church last May and considers itself out of the jurisdiction of Bishop van Duzer who sought the court order Father Graves said We have pretty good trust in the Lord and the judicial system of the United States and in appeals thereto As a result Father Graves said he was confident that the diocese would fail in its attempt to take control of St Stephens property and exclude the present congregation from the church Bishop van Duzer who is attending the bishops conference could not be reached for comment If they lose and are displaced the members of the congregation Say they will hold services elsewhere One parishoner Sherry Boyle of Rahway compared their determination to that of first century Christians who met in caves and back rooms and peoples homes and places like that We will not be alone said Father Graves who campaigned for Bishop van Duzers elevation to his present post At least six other congregations in New Jersey have voted to withdraw from the Episcopal Church although only one of themSt Marks in West Orangehas so far announced its decision publicly the rector said
Children and Their Children,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/04/archives/children-and-their-children.html,A nation that is moving backward on abortion policy must in simple decency move forward with policies help women avoid the need for abortions What is the Government planning to do for people who do not want to have children Not much Despite hints of a new family planning initiative the Administration has not moved yet Moreover reports of policies under consideration at the Department of Health Education and Welfare are worrisome Secretary Califano an opponent of abortion apparently preparing a program that would effectively help those who already are pregnantbut not do much for those who wish to avoid pregnapcy The failure of the current family planning effort is reflected in the present high birth rates and soaring illegitimacy figures among girls aged 10 to 17 This jump in illegitimate births has occurred in spite of the availability of relatively reliable birth control methods and until recently of legal abortions for rich or poor Usually the young women many still children themselves are illprepared physically emotionally or economically for motherhood Too often teenage parenthood results poverty divorce birth defects child abuse and neglect Abortions are not the whole answer to the problem Though onethird of the countrys abortions are performed on teenagers more than half of the pregnant teenagers decide to go through pregnancy As both parent and child mature the decision to have and keep the child is often regretted By then of course its too late The best solution is to prevent unwanted pregnancies But HEW Secretary Califano seems to have greater interest in helping young women who are already pregnant than in enlightening the potentially pregnant He is considering for example ways to expand Medicaid coverage of poor women experiencing their first pregnancies Thats a fine idea But the Secretary must also consider those youngsters who do not relish the idea of parenthood At the very least the Government should encourage local efforts to provide birth control information and devices on request Otherwise by merely easing the burdens but not the consequences of pregnancy Federal policy may end up scarring a new generation of children and their children
Public TV Finds The Gold in Opera,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/05/archives/public-tv-finds-the-gold-in-opera.html,AFTER YEARS of benign neglect or if you will thinlipped tolerance opera has been discovered by public television More specifically opera has been discovered to be a potentially strong fundraiser A Metropolitan Opera production of La Boheme starring Luciano Pavarotti and Renata Scotto broadcast live from the opera house last season brought in 1 million to station coffers from grateful viewers Public television executives have suddenly seen the operatic light Channel 13 recently carried a retrospective of past opera presentations The Metropolitan series has scheduled three more live broadcasts from its stage later this season And the Great Performances series carried on Wednesdays at 9 PM will be presenting opera productions for the next several weeks Included in this module as it is called is Strausss Salome next weekIn the Live from Lincoln Center series Massenets Manon starring Beverly Sills will he performed Oct 18 at 8 PM Tonights Great Performances offering at 9 PM is Mozarts The Marriage of Figaro in a Unitel production designed and directed for television by the brilliant JeanPierre Ponnelle The list of participants is singularly_ distinguished The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra is conducted by Karl Bohm Figaro is sung by Hermann Prey Susanna by Mirell Freni Count Almaviva by Dietrich FischerDieskau the Countess by Kiri Te Kanawa and Cherubino by Maria Ewing Musically and theatrically this is a strenuously lively productionperhaps just a shade too manic too selfadoring in spots Some of its rather unorthodox readings of the script are anticipated in the very first scene Where Figaro is supposed to be counting off numbers while measuring his room for a marriage bed with Susanna in this production he already has the mattress which now is being measured against Susannas body The style is obviously broader than some traditionalists might desire But the cynicism of the Beaumarchais playthis was the second part of a trilogy that began with The Barber of Sevilleis carefully preserved in its production The confrontations of peasant and master of cunning and force are kept visible just below the sparkling surface of the opera buffa Mr Ponnelle uses television as commentator as well as a recorder Eccentric camera angles underline character Some arias and in one instance an entire quartet are used as interior monologues heard on the soundtrack but without the performers moving their lips The Countesss moving Dove Sono in the third act is supplemented with flashbacks of her marriage in happier days Figaro is split into two figures for his fourthact solo one Figaro in work clothes admonishing the other in formal costume At times the camera is too busy seemingly desperate for a new shot with each musical line The overall production however is extraordinarily handsome and the performances are generally splendid If Miss Freni occasionally gets overly cute she is compensated for by the unerring charm of Miss Ewings Cherubino The production is sung in Italian and Martin Bookspan provides a synopsis for each of the four acts The Marriage of Figaro is three and onehalf hours long Opera lovers are advised not to miss a minute of it A stereo soundtrack will be simulcast on radio station WNCNFM  In more familiar television areasthe situation comedy and madefor television moviea new and highly unlikely subject for primetime entertainment turns out to be child abuse Tonight at 8 oclock on CBS Norman Lears Good Times winds up a twohour treatment of this social problem as Willona Janet DuBois sets out to adopt a young girl who has been mistreated by her natural mother And at 9 CBS covers the scene again with Mary Jane Harper Cried Last Night Mr Lear proves once again that comedy formats do not exclude serious material In the past Lear productions have tackled such sensitive issues as alcoholism unemployment emotional depression and abortion and have been handled skillfully and the very context of comedy has created a more powerful impact for subjects that simply are unanticipated The device works again in the instance of child abuse All of the salient points are made in passing The problem is widespread it is not limited to any one economic class it is difficult to prove in legal terms and frequently the parent needs as much help and compassion as the victim Good Times took the easy way out on one count The offending mother simply abandoned her severely bruised child leaving the episode to cope only with her daughter and not the total more complicated situation Mary Jane Harper does grapple directly with all of the issues in a portrait of a white uppermiddleclass wife unable to cope with a young daughter after having been deserted by her husband Once again the script written by Joanna Lee touches all key bases but several motivational holes and some awkward plotting are likely to stimulate impatience more than conc^rn However exceptionally fine performances by Susan Dey Tricia ONeill Bernie Casey and young Natasha Ryan lift this television movie considerably above the banal average

ACCORD ON ABORTION SEEMS TO BE DISTANT,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/06/archives/accord-on-abortion-seems-to-be-distant-each-sides-resolve-has.html,WASHINGTON Oct 5Political vulnerability posturing personality conflicts the absence of a strong leadership position the Senate tradition of greater liberalism and a deeply divided nation all have been cited as factors in a threemonth deadlock between the House and Senate on the Federal financing of abortions House and Senate conferees havebeen sitting around ornate conference tables since early July and they appear almost as adamant as they were the day they began Thirteen House members led by Daniel J Flood 74yearold Democrat of Pennsylvaniaa flamboyant former actor With bejeweled fingers and pleated shirts resolutely uphold the Houses position a ben on the use of Federal funds for abortions except when the mothers life is endangered Fourteen members of the Senate led by Warren G Magnuson 72yearold Democrat of Washington an earthy man who speaks in a hoarse whisper resolutely uphold the Senates position to allow Medicaid to pay for abortions in cases of rape and incest and when medically necessary a term that ouse members consider deliberately vague House to Vote on Request No further conference meetings are now planned although the abortion issue is tied to 601 billion in funds for the Departments of Labor and of Health Education and Welfare for the new fiscal year which began last Saturday House conferees agreed today to wait until Wednesday before requesting a House vote of support for the conferees position which has been diluted only to the extent of allowing victims of rape and incest to receive medical procedures such as dilation and curettage provided that those crimes were duly reported and before a diagnosis of pregnancy The two departments have said that starting Oct 18 six days after the House vote they will not be able to meet their payrolls without the new appropriations Approval of those appropriations is contingent upon agreement on the abortion Issue When asked whether the delay might be intended to put pressure on the Senate to acquiesce Mr Flood said There is always great tension and pressure under the circumstances Last month the House decisvely rejected the Senate position by a vote of 252 to 164 after the Senate rejected the House position by an equally decisive vote 60 to 33 There are very strong personal convictions Mr Flood said in explaining the protracted dispute Public opinion that Ive heard is generally pretty strong one way or the other Senator Magnuson offered a different view He contended that senators by virtue of their larger constituencies and sixyear terms were more insulated from political pressures than House members who can be overwhelmed by activists who concentrate their efforts in selected districts Senator Magnuson added that the overriding pressures these days came from the antiabortionists The political pressure in a district on a Congressman is much more mmediate whereas in the Senate a fellow Will say I know theyd be mad at me but three four years from now theyll forget about It It wont be an issue The senators of course are not immune from political pressures Mr Magnusons position is undoubtedly buttressed by clear signal from the voters of Washington who approved a referendum to provide state funds for abortions by a margin of 65 percent to 35 percent Awareness of their constituencies has undoubtedly led to heated and protracted arguments regarded as posturing at conferences intended to break the deadlock Mr Flood for example customarily begins each meeting by citing the Houses overwhelming vote against the Senate proposal to the consternation of the Senators Similarly several House conferees believe that Senator Edward V Brooke Republican of Massachusetts has been playing to the galleries by his unequivocal denunciations of the House positions Arguments about genetic counseling and testing of the fetus also have evoked emotional responses with Mr Flood responding at one point that he opposed aborting a fetus who had one brown eye and one blue eye In addition the conferees all men casually use terms such as hardware for intrauterine devices and a quick scrape for dilation and curettage which others find inflammatory Leadership Is Divided Unlike the energy package in which the Democratic leadership is actively involved the abortion issue is not a partisan issue and it has deeply divided the leadership Republicans on the other hand have played a key role in the legislation The antiabortion amendment wbas proposed by Representative Henry J Hyde of Illinois and modified by Representative Silvio 0 Conte of Massachusetts both Republicans It was the House Republicans moreover who provided the margin for victory by supporting the ban by vote of 98 to 21 while House Democrats opposed the ban 134 to 103 Senator Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon a major opponent of the ban has called abortion a single issue that could destroy a Congressmans career because people on both sides feel so strongly about it Last year when the House first enacted an abortion ban the Senate yielded largely because many proabortionists believed that their position would be upheld by the courts The Supreme Court has since upheld the abortion ban however thereby raising the stakes and stiffening the resolve of the Senate The general expectation now Is that the leadership of both chambers will have work to break the deadlock Many of those who have watched the proceedings have discerned a movement toward settlementthe Senate is willing to yield on its insistence that abortions be allowed when medically necessary for example provided that the House makes a similarly significant concession
Abortion Is Top Issue for A.C.L.U.,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/07/archives/abortion-is-top-issue-for-aclu.html,The American Civil Liberties Union has decided to make its top priority for the coming year a campaign to preserve the right of women to obtain abortions if they choose The 80member board of the ACLu representing virtually every state placed the abortion fight at the head of its list its chairman Norman Dorsen said because at this critical time of debate in the House and pressure for a constitutional convention freedom of choice is gravely in danger There hasnt been a constitutional convention since the first one he said and we are afraid one called to take up the question of an amendment abolishing abortion will be used by rightist groups to overturn other rights and protection of minorities and unpopular groups Mr Dorsen who also is a professor of law at New York University and Aryeh Neier executive director of the liberties union discussed the boards action at a press conference yesterday at the groups headquarters at 22 East 40th Street They said that actions by the United States Supreme Court Congress and the Administration this summer and moves to deny Medicaid funds to pay for abortions have given momentum to groups that would like to amend the Constitution to prohibit all abortions Nine states have adopted legislation calling for a constitutional convention on the subject and the danger is very real that in 1978 the 25 additional states needed will pass such calls Mr Dorsen said We want middleclass women to know they are next in line for attack by antiabortion forces Mr Neier said These forces alone do not have the power to brill about a constitutional convention he said but they have been joined in pressing for the convention by radical rightist groups that view abortion as an issue with more potential for bringing about a convention than they could offer The nine states that have called for a convention are Indiana Louisiana Massachusetts Missouri Nebraska New Jersey Rhode Island South Dakota and Utah
Why I Am Running For Mayor,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/08/archives/why-i-am-running-for-mayor.html,The blackout again spotlighted the immense poverty in New York City Under cover of darkness the poor retrieved a small part of what they needed Newspapers and politicians labeled them animals and criminals But who are the real criminals Those who took a box of Pampers Or bankers who gouge profits from us while millions especially blacks and Hispanics are forced to inhabit dilapidated housing Are the real criminals those who grabbed a shirt or the politicians who laid off thousands of city employees and closed hospitals schools and daycare centers Look at the tacts Two years ago New Yorkers were asked to sacrifice while the local government straightened out the citys financial crisis Since then the city has cut 66000 jobs with the number of teachers slashed by 15000 Hundreds of hospital beds were eliminated and daycare programs closed Eightysix percent of black youth under 20 were unemployed this June These cuts hit the black and Puerto Rican communities hardest The capitalist candidates for Mayor dont blame the rich for the fiscal crisis Some blame it on overspending for labor costs although the 1970 census reported the median wage for men in New York City as 7679 and less for women blacks and Puerto Ricans Some blame welfare although city welfare payments average out to a meager 215 a day Some blame soft living although the services cut or eliminated are necessary free tuition at the City University of New York health care at city hospitals bilingual education decent sanitation service and efficient mass transit New Yorks financial problems dont coin from bloated social services This crisis was caused by a system that prioritizes money for the Pentagon and the banks debt service before our needs To maintain high profits the system makes working people bear the burden of inflation unemployment and cutbacks In contrast I say Human needs first Our tax dollars should not go to the already rich bankers but should be used for the needs of working people unemployed blacks Puerto Ricans women and youth We the majority are on the bottom of their list of financial expenditures As individuals we can do little But together we can fight for our rights a job an adequate income free education and medical care a clean environmentfor the right of oppressed national minorities to control their own affairs and the right of women to full equality When residents of the South Bronx fought to keep Lincoln Hospital open when CUNY students fought for free tuition when blacks Puerto Ricans and Chinese on the Lower East Side fight for control of their schools when unionists strike for better contracts when women fight for safe legal abortion when gays fight for gayrights legitlation when Queens residents fight against the Concordethey fight the Democratic and Republican politicians Why fight aguinst them during the year and then vote for them on election day We must also fight to protect the liberties of those who espouse unpopular issues At present Puerto Rican independence advocates are being smeared as terrorists and bombers Those charges have led to victimizations I am running for Mayor to offer workingclass alternative in these elections The Democratic Republican Conservative and Liberal parties represent bankers and rich businessmen not the majority of New Yorkers who are working people Our interests are different from their interests It is in our interest to fight for expanded social services it is in their interest to cut services and expand their profits Working people need a party that represents them We need a labor party which could put the full power of the labor movement into our struggle We are a party of working people who seek to replace rule by the rich minority with rule by the majority we stand for a socialist society in which human needs are always placed before profits The OpEd page has invited all candidates for Mayor of New York City to express their views on any subject Catarino Garza is candidate of the Socialist Workers Party and William Lawry is candidate of the Free Libertarian Party By William F Lawry Im mad as hell and Im not going to take it any more Those words from the movie Network made me realize that to rehabilitate New York I had to run for Mayor myself Every four years Ive heard politicians promise great things and then Ive watched the city slide further into physical decay and economic disaster I intend to make this city a beautiful safe place in which to livefor me Because Im tired of living in a filthy town where its dangerous to walk the streets at night Join me and well turn New York around in four years We will make the city more attractive to the middle class The middle class is the only hope of the poor A strong upwardly mobile middle class will vacate enough lower rungs on the economic ladder to permit the poor to step up from poverty That alone will reduce our taxes and improve our quality of life Pea soup Now I know that as soon as someone says we can do something about the terrible conditions in New York City there is a polarization set up between Yes we can and No we cant And then we hear a chorus of better government and yesnos about the better government And that kind of pea soup has brought New York to its knees I will cut through the pea soup In the United States the free market decentralized and competitivehas shown us time and again that individuals can invent produce purchase and profitably use the widest variety of goods and services ever known to man One reason for our prosperity is that the free market rewards initiative another is that the free market junks outmoded ideas Public sanitation costs New Yorkers three times the price of private sanitation Isnt it about time we took bids for citywide private sanitation Taxes Politicians are telling us I can do it you cant With our money they force us to accept things that they feel we need done and cant do for ourselves I will end the New York City sales tax 1 believe you will know what to do with the money I will institute a tax rebate for voluntary services rendered to this city Drugs and crime At least 60 percent of our street crime is to pay for overpriced dope At present an illegal heroin habit costs over 100 a day If drugs were legalized a habit could cost under 10 a day And the pusher who now cajoles our children into that first free trip would lose his profit margin and disappear Victimless crimes Homosexuality or playing the numbers may not be your preference but the city is here for all of us Besides when we drop victimless crimes from the book we will free the police and courts to concentrate on murderers muggers and rapists Instead of vice squads lets spare no expense to see that real criminals are properly prosecuted victims get restitution and precincts that reduce crime get bonuses Ill put real political power in the hands of the local community boards How Ill turn taxes back to the individual neighborhoods and Ill give neighbors more say about what goes on within their boundaries Politicians say theyre afraid of graft and corruption but Id rather trust a local person with funds for the improvement of his own school and neighborhood than a bigtime politician with funds for the whole city And heres where you come in If youre going to sit back and let someone else do the job on your local board for sure youll have incompetents and crooks running things But if youre willing to take an active role attend meetings and be responsible for seeing that funds are wisely spent you can accomplish tremendous things Look at the effectiveness of many block associations We can take this city away from the politicians and give it back to ourselves I respect and trust youthe people of New York City I dont want to change or coerce you at all I wish only to get the bureaucracy out of your way so you can fully express your own wishes Say something with your votedont waste it on politicsasusual The Race for City Hall
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/08/archives/books-of-the-times-genetic-help-for-laymen.html,With the waning over recent decades of serious infectious and nutritional diseases as major killers and health problems in the industrialized countries we now face the impact from the more than 2000 known genetic or hereditary diseases About one person in 10 in Western society or 22 million Americans is seriously affected by genetic disease mental retardation or birth defect Up to 30 percent of admissions to the major childrens hospitals in this country are due to genetic diseases Some are known at birth or in infancy while the symptoms of others may not strike until the fifth or sixth decade We might wonder why the numbers are not even more staggering Each person has four to eight harmful genes and an estimated one in three people carries a gene for a severe mental defect Not all bad genes have a significant effect on an individuals health but that person could be a carrier capable of passing on the disorder to child Dr Aubrey Milunsky a leading medical geneticist in Boston has written a fascinating easy to read guide through the world of genetic disorders and the social and ethical problems they create Each gynecologist obstetrician and family practitioner would be doing his patient and future generations an important service by calling attention to this book Importance of Counseling The number of genetic disorders is almost endless rising each year as result of newer research findings and increasing the importance of genetic counseling for young couples and wouldbe parents Genetic counseling is not a new specialty Dr Milunsky points out that Talmudic scholars had accurate knowledge about hemophilia the bleeding disorder Ancient rabbis exempted from circumcision a male child whose brother had bled heavily following this ritual The exemptions extended to the sons of sisters of a woman who had had a male who bled excessively after circumcision In their wisdom this exemption was not allowed for the fatherers sons born to other women In short the rabbis recognized that hemophilia was passed by women but affected Whats new The availability of options unknown to past generations Medical geneticists have developed the technology to prevent many birth defects through prenatal diagnosis to detect carriers of genetic disorders though they have no obvious symptoms to diagnose certain genetic disorders at birth and to provide some specific treatments Probably the most revolutionary new technique is amniocentesis whereby doctor inserts a thin needle into the womb to remove fluid and cells for analysis under the microscope and in test tubes Through this technique chromosomal disorders such as Downs Syndrome mongolism can be diagnosed in time for an abortion to be performed if the mother desires Chromosomal disorders occur about once in every 200 live births All too often parents say if only we had known after a baby is born with a hereditary disorder If more women chose to use amniocentesis services at the proper time in pregnancy 14 to 16 weeks the social costs of some genetic diseases might be blunted While virtually every chromosomal dikorder recognizable through the microstope can be diagnosed in the fetus too many disorders not known to be chromosomal such as Huntingtons Chorea Woody Guthries disease still escape detection by amniocentesis and other tests Although amniocentesis is considered a minor surgical procedure it is not as simple as it may appear from the usual descriptions Often omitted from newspaper and television accounts is the recommendation that ultrasound or soundwave studies precede the amniocentesis so the needle can be properly inserted thus avoiding the placenta and decreasing the chances of bleeding In up to 10 percent of cases the removed cells may not grow even when flawless techniques are used in the laboratory A second or third amniocentesis may be needed and even then the answers provided are not always correct and still some genetic disorders will not be excluded by the test A Guide for People Dr Milunskys book is not an encyclopedia of genetic diseases but rather a guide to stimulate people to learn when and where to find genetic counseling and then how best to use it Because the information provided by medical geneticists can be valuable not only to prospective parents but also for their children and future generations he urges those who have had genetic counseling to request if not offered written summaries that they can keep with other important documents such as wills and insurance polices Know Your Genes is a valuable contribution for the concerned patient and the unborn child If academic experts wrote more books of this type for the public and medical practitioners spent more time communicating with individual patients then suspect the image of the medical profession would be less tarnished than it is now our country would be healthier and ethical problems would be less controversial because the public would have a better understanding of the complexities involved KNOW YOUR GENES By Aubrey Milunsky MD 335

Goodman Sets A Drive to Buy Radio‐TV Time,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/09/archives/goodman-sets-a-drive-to-buy-radiotv-time-new-york-political-notes.html,New York Political Notes Trying to head off an electoral disaster for the Republican citywide ticket State Senator Roy M Goodman the GOP mayoral candidate is opening an intensive fundraising effort this week to try to buy radio and television time during the final weeks of the campaign The Senators political and financial problems are severe Politically he conceded that he and the Democratic mayoral nominee Representative Edward I Koch both East Siders are working off the same electoral base At the same time the Liberal and Conservative mayoral candidates Mario M Cuomo and Barry Farber are competing with Mr Goodman for the votes of Catholics and conservatives in the Republican pockets of strength in the outer boroughs Goodman campaign aides privately concede that it is very possible that he could wind up third in the mayoral race Financially Mr Goodman has raised about 300000 but ominously for him the contributions slowed down drastically in the last month to the point where the candidate heir to the ExLax fortune had to contribute 75000 of his own money Much of the money was spent for the GOP primary campaign against Mr Farber Republican politicians and contributors perceived that any chance of a Goodman victory went by the boards with the candidacies of Mr Koch and Mr Cuomo both middleoftheroaders like Mr Goodman If I had to choose opponents it would not be a Koch or Cuomo he said Mr Goodman would like to raise some 250000 for commercials to head off a landslide defeat that could jeopardize any chances for the state ticket next year Mr Kochs Congressional seat or even reelection to the State Senate since many Liberals will oppose the endorsement of the Senator because of his challenge of that partys position for Mr Cuomo  Compounding Mr Goodmans problems are his running mates Assemblyman John A Esposito of Queens the candidate for City Council President and William F Larkin of Manhattan a former Assemblyman for Controller Mr Esposito conceded that he was a reluctant candidate who was pressured to run by his county chairman City Councilman Jack R Muratore Mr Larkin was supposed to be a standin while Mr Goodman tried to find another Controller candidate He didnt so Mr Larkin is running The campaigns of both are virtually nonexistent Neither has headquarters or campaigan staff Mr Larkin said he had a campaign kitty of about 300 Mr Esposito is doing slightly better up to 2000 Another problem is that Mr Goodman and Mr Esposito are diametrically opposed on many crucial issues such as the death penalty and abortion Mr Esposito for example scored 91 percent on the recent Conservative Party report card on various legislative votes Senator Goodman scored a mere 13 percent only slightly better than Mr Espositos opponent State Senator Carol Bellamy who got a zero That was not as goodat least from a Conservative standpoint  as the State Senate minority leader and veteran of the West Side liberal political wars State Senator Manfred Ohrenstein who received a 20 percent rating Despite her national fame former Representative Bella S Ahzug did have some difficulty raising funds for the Democratic mayoral primary Her final postprimary report last week showed that she had spent a total of 860112 but better than one third represented outstanding loans 248263 and unpaid bills 49288 Mrs Abzug was apparently so short of funds in the final days of the primary campaign that several show business figures had to make massive contributions Among them were David Geffen of Hollywood a recording industry executive 39000 Dino DeLaments the producer 16000 Paul Simon the singer 10000 and Shirley MacLaine the actress 7000 Ann Tokar an Abzug fundraiser kicked in 25000 of her own money in the final days Howard J Samuels who was a major fundraiser for Mr Cuomo In the Democratic primary campaign is now managing Mr Cuomos campaign on the Liberal and Neighborhood Preservation party lines Most of the Democrats who ran the Cuomo primary campaign have jumped ship and are supporting the party nominee Representative Koch Other top figures in the trimmed date Raymond B Harding the special down Cuomo campaign are Vincent Albanese and Joseph Mattone fundraisers and longtime friends of the candidate Raymond B Harding the special assistant to the Governor and Liberal Party leader Harold Holzer and Maggie Peyton carryovers from Bella Abzugs campaign and Robert Sullivan who is a Samuels associate Incidentally Mr Samuels whose political stock has slumped badly since his defeat in the 1974 Democratic gubernatorial primary is reported to be talking to Carter Administration officials about a Washington post Mr Samuels one of the first top New York politicians to back Mr Carter was widely mentioned for an administration post earlier this year but may have hurt his clnces with some controversial remarks at a United States Conference of Mayors session at which Mr Samuels represented the President Now however the reports of a Samuels appointment have started again The war of nerves between State Controller Arthur Levitt and the man who would like to succeed him City Controller Harrison J Goldin intensified last week First Mr Goldin let it be known that he was sponsoring a poll on Mr Levitts strengths and weaknesses Then Levitt aides prompted Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut after a lunch with Mr Levitt to report that he was relieved to find that Mr Levitt who was 77 last June and has been Controller for 23 years would seek another fouryear term next year

Carter And the Lobbies,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/09/archives/carter-and-the-lobbies-washington-taking-on-all-the-lobbies-at-the.html,WASHINGTON Oct 8  President Carter is in deep trouble for the first time since he entered the White House but In fairness he is in trouble because he has had the audacity to face up to the most difficult national and international problems of our time Make a list of the most powerful special interest lobbies in Washington and there is scarcely a one of them that he hasnt challenged the labor lobby the Israeli lobby the oil and gas lobby and the automobile lobby to begin with Also the lobbies for the blacks the Chicanos the cities the farmers and abortion And in addition the lobbies against the Russians free trade equal rights for women affirmative action in education and changing the status of the Panama Canal This is not a oneway battle either For every concession he makes to the consumer lobby he is whipsawed by the bigbusiness lobby and vice versa When he challenges the Russians on their violations of human rights it is said that he cannot get on with Moscow and when he cooperates with Moscow on the Middle East he raises a storm in Israel Every President since the last world war has had to face this tangle which is called democracy So whats new In Carters case the new thing is that he has decided to take on all the powerful lobbies at the same time to fight on every front on every continent and on every issue from economics to theology The reaction to all this is mixed The diplomatic reports going out from Washington to the other capitals of the world in the last few days are quite different from the newspaper and electronic reports going out to the American people In general Carter is being praised in the diplomatic reports for trying to get down to fundamental questions to get the cooperation of the Soviet Union on human rights arms control and a compromise settlement in the Middle East Most diplomats in Washington seem to agree that Palestinians do have legitimate rights and that there is no way considering the geography and politics of the world that the Soviet Union can be kept out of a peace agreement in the Midddle East The newspaper reports to the American people are quite different They deal primarily with the opposition to Carters Middle Eastern energy economic and Panama policies with his troubles in Congress on these issues WASHINGTON Taking on all the lobbies at the same time and with his personal and political tactics These newspaper reports emphasizing the negative and the opposition have surprised troubled and irritated Mr Carter He came to Washington proclaiming the goodness of the American people and relying on a Democratic Congress to support a Democratic President But like President Kennedy before him he has lately been discovering that the goodness of the American people is overwhelmed by the selfishness of the special interest lobbies and that the Democratic Congress has a will of its own Also he has made some surprising mistakes Not since the last war have we had a President who was more available to Congress the press business and labor or had such exquisite personal manners But lately in his presentation of major policies he has been sudden and alone not only in his handling of the Bert Lance case but in his latest pronouncements on the Middle East The first hope and major demand of the Congress and the allieseven of the Russiansis that they should never be surprised by sudden twists or turns of American policy But Jimmy Carter keeps surprising them by passing long on first down He advocated a homeland for the Palestinians without checking it out even with his own State Department He announced his energy and welfare programs without analyzing the opposition in Congress and he called for support of his Panama treaties before the text was published or both sides agreed on what it meant So he is in trouble with the lobbies the Congress and even with his own party and for another reason For while he has defied the lobbies he keeps on trying to compromise with them When he runs into opposition on his 50 tax rebate proposal he retreats When he makes a deal with the Soviet Union on a Middle East Geneva conference and runs into the savage opposition of the proIsraeli lobby he embraces his badmannered friend Mr Koch the Democratic candidate for Mayor of New York All this puzzles Washingtonthe members of his own party the opposition the allies and the international community And yet they respect Mr Carters courage and his determined intention to confront the major issues at home and abroad If he is in trouble now it is probably because he has taken on too much too soon

One Week in Ireland Charms a Skeptic,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/09/archives/one-week-in-ireland-charms-a-skeptic-the-weather.html,Its not truejust a bit of the old blarneythat every Irishman you meet will greet you with a grin and charm you with his chatter During a week spent arming through the Irish countryside and exploring the byways of Dublin I met one who didnt He was a man in his 80s sitting on a wooden bench outside a oneroom post office and general store along the Ring of Kerry He was gazing across the road across the rocky cliff beyond and out over the misty sea My stamps bought I joined him on the bench but he barely looked at me I talked about the weather inandout sun and he grunted noncommital responsesand then I realized he was staring at my sneakers Not bad for walking he said at last but youll not beat shoes with nails for climbing so Im not about to try to give you any of that old blarney Im certain beyond any doubt that Ireland con tains a fair share of the rude unfriendly uninterested folk you find in the United States and most everywhere else you travel Its just that I didnt happen to meet them It was my first visit and I arrived with a journalistic chip an my shoulder During three years as a travel editor I had read hundreds of articles about Ireland not one of which was negative in tone Thus it was a Doubting Thomas who landed at Shannon Airport of a Sunday morning I took four days to reach Dublin staying at a variety of hotels and one farmhouse and picking and choosing among the tourist sites that most appealed and least impeded my highway progress That left about three days for the capital city on the Liffey mostly on foot What follows are impressions of my stay They add up to this I came I saw I was conquered The Weather Traditional travel wisdom holds that Ireland is wet and at best cool all year round so I arrived with raincoat umbrella rubbers and sweater They all came in handy It rained every day of the visit generally a fleeting affair followed by brilliant sunshine leaving the countryside with that special feeling of freshness that follows a storm There was one proper deluge that earned headlines on front pages The Irish Times spoke of monsoon level rains in some areas I kissed the Blarney Stone in a downpour and spent my farmhouse night amid blasts of thunder Just in case and in remembrance of the fact that lit was summer I carried a swimsuit but it was the sweater that counted Seldom did the temperature rise into the 70s and some evenings were in the 50sfine for walking but not calculated to lure one to the beach The Sites Advice from friends and reporters about what to see in a foreign land should generally be received with gratitude and rejected with dispatch A small percentage will match ones tastes but the problem is finding the right percentage Killarney is a must I was told I found it buried in tourists and touristhe shops chockablock with backpackers and souvenir stands cars and horse  drawn sightseeing carriages vying for road space Blarney Castle was a bore I was assured I found the castle charming the grounds a sylvan treasure and the stonekissing operationeven in the raingreat fun You climb 125 steps to the tower top lie flat on your back and bend backward over empty space to kiss the limestone block while aide holds your legs All of which left me with sopping clothes a backache no sign that my blarneyproduction was enhancedand the contentment that comes with knowing that you have done what was expected of you Medieval banquets friends warned were hokey and none hokier than that at Bunratty Castle hard by Shannon Airport Velvet gowns speeches of welcome in courtly language modified medieval fare mulled wine hearty broth capon served on long wooden tables and eaten without benefit of silverware folk songs gaily and expertly deliveredit was in sum a boisterous tasty and altogether hokey delight All for about 14 One piece of advice my counselors all agreed ow Dont miss hearing traditional Irish music even if you have to go to that site most popular with tourists the Abbey Tavern I found my way to the tavern in Howth nine miles from Dublin and spent hours sipping Guinness while the Abbey Singers made music with fiddles and pipes and guitars and lilting voices The audience though rich in tourists from around the globe also had its share of native Irish and IrishAmericans who sang alongand not only on the refrains The Driving Wheels gave me the freedom to explore tiny villages and suit my sightseeing to the mood of the day I drove a total of 600 miles averaging fewer than 100 miles a day small potatoes for a Stateside vacation But motoring in Ireland has its special challenges The twolane highways the main thoroughfares on my voyage are narrow twisting affairs frequented by sheep cattle and horsedrawn caravans I had little difficulty with leftsideoftheroad driving but I never did quite get accustomed to the sight of oncoming cars zipping out around hay wagons into my lane Theres a lot of courageousnot to say foolhardydriving in Ireland I did very little of it And after one try at night driving high beams in my eyes on unlighted roads I made sure to reach my hotel before dark Roads are well posted though I grew to distrust the milestothenextvil lage signs Cork 10 miles said one yet it took me 30 minutes driving at 40 miles an hour Cities have adopted oneway streets with a vengeancefine for the native but totally confusing for the visitor I opted for a Category A car the cheapest at 119 a week plus taxes petrol not included Gasoline costs about 92 cents an Imperial gallon which is 20 percent larger than a United States gallon The Sights The Ring of Kerry is about 150 miles long an oval road west of Killarney which for much of its length winds along the Atlantic coastline Its not an easy drive and the multiple blind curves are the least of it What put me at risk was the relentless beauty I couldnt keep my eyes on the road as I passed one dizzying vista after another long sweeps of rugged rock down to crashing surf white tufts of sheep on tilted greensward endless fringes of empty sand My days of driving provided a kaleidoscopic image of the country a tumble of green hills and jagged cliffs of tiny stone villages and thatchroof huts I was bewitched and it didnt make sense How many times can one see slopes painted in every imaginable shade of emerald and notif youll pardon the expressionbecome jaded How often will one delightedly spy a tumbledown mosscovered castle or abbey on the horizon before the sight becomes a bore I dont know the answer I never reached that point The Capital My days in Dublin were spent strolling and it is a fine city for that with its share of narrow twisting streets to match the fine wide shopping boulevards I managed to touch base at many of the museums and churches that friends had recommendeda favorite was a guided tour of Dublin Castle past Waterford crystal chandeliers through rooms loaded with French furnishings and Italian art Mostly though I browsed in the shops as an excuse to strike up conversations with sales clerks My nights were spent in pubs though I did devote part of one evening to attending the Abbey Thea ter where a Sean OCasey work was on the boards I hadnt done my homework all I knew was that the Abbey was the great repertory theater of Ireland and I was ready for a grand old building not the slick modern edifice I found The play was Cockadoodie Dandy which OCasey called my favorite Its a play rich in symbolic figures a fantastical creation that never gets off the ground not my favorite Im afraid I was off to a pub after two acts Still to have seen even this OCasey performed at even this Abbey Theater The seat about 450 The People A brilliant sun was shining when I reached Killarney and I headed for the Great Southern Hotel for a bite of lunch It is a 19thcentury edifice with marble  columned barn  size lobby where I in my baggy slacks and scruffy sport shirt was received with dignity by an aged factotum in swallowtail coat He showed me to the room where lunch was being served a dark oaken place I demurred Its such a lovely day I said perhaps I should find a sunnier spot at another hostelry Undaunted he led me through corridors to a tiny sunporch decorated in bright yellow looking out over the hotel gardens and summoned a waitress to serve meall the while making pleasant conversation I have never been accorded such warm hospi tality as a stray visitor in a big hotel in a town that makes its living by tourism But that kind of behavior seems to be second nature to the Irish Not that they will force themselves on youthat only happened once when a gaggle of giggling school kids in Dublin spied my camera and demanded I take their picture Otherwise if I wanted to make contact the first overture was up to me On the coast one day I greeted a woman in her 50s who was walking along the shore Soon she was telling me about the place They gather periwinkles out there on the flats and how she had grown up in the area and was back for the first time in four decades a kind of pilgrimage you might say Chatty bright sharing her sentimental feelings and her joy in the ocean spray with me My most memorable encounter occurred in a pub I had heard of the Irish taverns as friendly boisterous spotsand they are all of that What I had not realized was the degree to whiqh the pub is central to an Irishmans life I found myself pondering this equation Do they chat endlessly as an excuse to drink or drink as an excuse to chat Certainly they do both with gusto One night in Dublin at Mulligans in Poolbeg Street I fell into the company of a solicitor and an executive of an import firm We talked not at all about the weather if one engages in a real conversation in a pub I found it tends to be fairly cosmic in subject and adversary in nature In a word we arguedabout politics about journalism about abortion When the summer closing time of 1130 arrived I was carried off to an afterhours bar There the battle continued joined in by a small thin bald patron who sat beside me at the bar He was loaded his speech slurred barely able to keep from falling off the stool but he insisted on offering up his opinions throwing his arm over my shoulder sneezing every other minute Ive a desperate cold How do you get rid of a drunk in Ireland I wondered How long would my new friends tolerate the pest Then the solicitor interrupted for the 10th time stopped in the middle of a sentence and walked over to the sneezer shook his hand and generally welcomed him to our group An accepting people I thoughtthough of course he hadnt been the solicitor The Hotels My first stop was at Dromoland Castle in NewmarketonFergus eight miles from Shannon Airport This stone edifice complete with turrets and tower gate was built more than two centuries ago replacing a 15thcentury fortress And the estate was the property of the family of Brian Boru high king of Ireland a millenium ago Today it is a resort complete with ninehole golf course tennis fishrich lake and river and walking trails The interior of the castle has been elegantly remodeled ancestral paintings decorate the walls thick rugs cover the floors and the 76 rooms are in all ways tasteful and comfortable I found it an ideal antidote to the overnight flight from Kennedy International Airport a soothing luxurious way to begin my week in Ireland Single rooms with breakfast start at 43 The Waterville Lake Hotel on the Ring of Kerry offers views of the sea on one side a lake on the other and the full gamut of resort sports Guidebooks rave about the amenities of this modern lowslung hotel and it certainly provides a kind of luxury sparkling plumbing elaborate cuisine spacious public rooms But one should never stop there after visiting Dromoland It seemed a rather characterless establishment an immaculate 94room motel tricked up with chandeliers that would be totally at home in the Poconos The price upward from 28 breakfast included Before my trip I asked a travel agent about staying in one of the hundreds of farmhouses that offer bed and breakfast He urged me to try one in the south The farms are more prosperous there he said so theyre apt to be more comfortable I ended up at the Fitzgeralds of Ashton Grove Knockraha seven miles from Cork When I arrived soaked by a downpour I needed all the comfort I could get I found it by the fire in the cozy parlor Mealstasty hearty farewere taken at my own table in the dining room My bedroom was simply furnished the spotless bathroom down the hall The price for bed and breakfast about In Dublin I stayed at the Shelburne a comfortable old giant 170plus rooms across from St Stephens Green After a night in a cramped room overlooking an airshaft I moved to bright and pleasant quarters in the front with a view of the park The Shelburne is an institution in Dublin Thackeray visited more than a century ago and the Constitution of the Irish Free State was drafted there in 1922 Its Horseshoe Bar is tiny and elegant a favored upperclass place Most rooms have television sets though the one in my room received only BBC programs Singles range upward from 32 with breakfast
A Clinic for Men On Birth Control,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/09/archives/new-jersey-weekly-a-clinic-for-men-on-birth-control.html,HACKENSACK MEN at Planned Parenthood Well why not Women have traditionally had more outlets to discuss their feelings and learn about their bodiesthrough clinics selfhelp groups and gynecologists said Adalyn Hixson executive director of Planned Parenthood of Bergen County Now men will have a chance too for a malereproductive clinic has been opened in Planned Parenthoods office at 485 Main Street in Hackensack Although Planned Parenthood of Essex County opened a similar clinic in Newark about 18 months ago there are only a handful of such facilities in the country The men who attend the weekly sessions in Hackensack receive instruction about male and female anatomy birth control and venereal diseases They get a blood test for VD and a physical examination by a urologist recently hired by Planned Parenthood The clinics first session held in midSeptember drew eight men between the ages of 18 and 77 They were all very enthusiastic Miss Hixson said One of our aims will be to improve male and female rapport in the area of sexuality Its also another approach to the tremendous problem of unwanted teenage pregnancy The clinic will help men become better informed One thing the first clinic session taught the coordinators was that men felt more comfortable being interviewed and examined by other men perhaps because they are not used to doctors of the opposite sex In any case the message was clear Miss Hixson said No women unless they are wearing lab coats To kindle interest in the clinic Planned Parenthood hired three men to visit shopping centers parks bowling alleys department stores and other places where men congregate to distribute literature and to invite them to attend the clinic One recruit Fernando Barreto is a 22yearold student at Ramapo College He feels that being a student makes talking with potential participants easier It gives me an in because I know where guys get together he said I tell them the clinic will give them factual information that they can understand You wouldnt believe the myths that go aroundthat you cant get pregnant in a certain position for example or that VD carries a stigma Meredith Bernstein the coordinator of information and education at Planned Parenthood gives the lectures now but the three men are also being trained to do so The organizations urologist is Dr Stephen Katz who who is devoting several hours a week to the clinic lie gives the men not only a general physical examination but also a prostate examination something they should have done routinely once a fear and twice a year after age 40 according to Miss Bernstein Initially there will be no fee at the clinic but in the future fees may be charged on a sliding scale A college student for example would pay 7 for physical examination The clinic is federally financed and will cost 14200 for the first four months Joseph Weiss 34 ran a service station before joining Planned Parenthood as a recruiter Ninety percent of the men I talk to have been interested he said They seem to feel its about time they have something for themselves the way women do It gives them a chance to let down some barriers said John Williams the third recruiter Men arent as likely to seek out a urologist as women are to find a gynecologist Yet every 30 seconds statistics tell us someone contracts VD If a man is sexually active its important to have that blood test Planned Parenthood of Bergen County which treats 6000 women a year and gives pregnancy counseling to 2000 more has a staff of about 30 All have been women until now The clinic does not perform abortions or vasectomies but will provide referrals Its telephone number is 201 4891140 The male clinic will be held Monday nights but men who want information or referrals may call any time All calls are kept confidential 
End to Medicaid Abortion Funds: A Change in the Social Landscape,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/11/archives/end-to-medicaid-abortion-funds-a-change-in-the-social-landscape.html,As the SenateHouse deadlock over the restriction on Federal aid for abortions drags on at least one outcome is certain Far fewer abortions will be paid for by Medicaid and abortions will thus be significantly less available to poor women than they have been in the past Urban Affairs The main accomplishment of this legislative exercise will be that a Congressional majoritys abhorrence for federally assisted abortions will have been written into the laws of the United States But the question of what this piece of legislation will do the social landscape of the nation could be much larger than that particular achievement Though clear answers to that question have not yet developed a few straws have by now been caught the wind The Supreme Court ruled this summer that though women had a constitutional right to abortions the Constitution did not require that public funds be spent on them Immediately thereafter a prohibition against Federal spending for abortions contained in an earlier law went into effect A Dramatic Decline As a result 14 states or jurisdictions such as Guam and the Virgin Islands have already terminated all funds for abortions and approximately 28 are in the process of doing so New York and 11 other states or jurisdictions have so far decided to continue providing state funds for abortions for poor women But it is in the states where all the public funds for abortions have been terminated that the shape of the future is beginning to be discernible Tennessee cut off state funds for Medicaid abortions on Aug 15 The impact of that decision became apparent immediately according to Sterling Scruggs director of the Planned Parenthood Association of Memphis Normally we get between 110 and 120 calls in a twomonth period he said in a recent interview In the two months since the cutoff weve had only about 55 calls Overall we think weve served 80 less women in this period than we would normally have served Asked why he thought there had been such a precipitous falloff just in the number of calls inquiring about the service Mr Scruggs could only speculate that the women had either concluded that abortions were once again illegal or that there was no use in trying to obtain one After all he said a lot of the women who need Medicaid abortions are not the most sophisticated women in the country Thats one of the reasons its such a shame that theyre being denied this help Mr Scruggs said that prior to the cutoff 85 to 90 percent of the women who called and made appointments to come in actually showed up at the clinic Now he says despite the fact that the fee for an abortion has been cut in halfto 60 only 40 to 50 percent now follow up on their initial contacts They cant scrape up even the 60 he said One woman said she just couldnt get the 60 and asked us which was the better method turpentine or a coat hanger We quickly gave her a free abortion The experience in Texas where funds were terminated on Aug 5 has been similar to that in Tennessee according to Myron W Chrisman president of Reproductive Services Inc an organization that has in the past performed 20000 abortions a year Reproductive Services operates four clinics in Texas and one in Oklahoma Though the clinic in Oklahoma is still operating at full capacity because that state is still providing funds for abortions the overall activity of the organization dropped from 1837 cases in July to 1520 in August In Waco Texas Mr Chrisman noted our planned Parenthood affiliate normally handles 40 cases a month In August it handled 10 So far the Texas orgaization has held to its basic commitment to serve all women who opt for an abortion in the first trimester no matter what their circumstances Because of the unavailablility of public funds to pay for services for poor Reproductive Services has raised its rates for women who can pay by 20 thus levying a very narrow and special tax to help pay for abortions for the poor because Congress has ruled out such financial assistance Even so the agency is running up a substantial deficit according to Mr Chrisman Few experts believe that the slack created across the country by the absence of Federal financial assistance can be taken up by such devices as raising the prices of abortions for those who can pay subsidies granted by social service agencies or even by major programs undertaken by philanthropic institutions At least 261000 poor women obtained abortions that were financed by some combination of Federal and state program last year Eightyfive percent of those women were welfare mothers The total cost to government was 61 million which is reasonable for a governmental enterprise but a staggering load for the private sector to attempt to undertake in whole or in substantial part The health social and economic costs to the country are likely to be enormous Mr Scruggs of Memphis points out for example that while an abortion in the first trimester costs 140 at his agency prenatal care would cost welfare agencies 565 and the care for the mother and child for the year of her birth would be 1100 A recent study prepared by the Alan Guttmacher Institute the research division of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America attempted to assess the nationwide costs of the withdrawal of Federal assistance It concluded that if only onethird of the women who would have wanted abortions gave birth first year governmental costs for medical services public assistance services and selected social welfare services resulting from the increased unwanted births minus the Medicaid expenditures for abortion would be about 200 million Estimates on the health costs are also significant For example the Federal Center for Disease Control estimates that if all women who would have obtained legal abortions turned to illegal means 90 additional deaths a year would result and if all of them chose to carry their pregnancies to term 44 additional deaths would result
Califano Declares Dispute on Abortion Is Unfair to Poor,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/12/archives/califano-declares-dispute-on-abortion-is-unfair-to-poor.html,WASHINGTON Oct 11 APThe Secretary of Health Education and Welfare Joseph A Califano Jr said today that it was grossly unfair to hold the vulnerable people of our nation and thousands of Federal and state employees hostage in a dispute over paying for abortions for poor women The lack of a bill providing funds for the Department of Labor and for HEW Is seriously disrupting his departments operations Mr Califano told Democratic Congressional leaders In letters to the Senate majority leader Robert C Byrd Democrat of West Virginia the House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr Democrat of Massachusetts and several committee chairmen Mr Califano said It is imperative that the Congress either enact the appropriations bill this week or pass a continuing resolution that would provide temporary funding of HEW salaries and operations If Congress does not act this week Mr Califano said benefits for thousands of poor people children the sick aged and disabled will be cut off Dispute Over Abortions The annual funding bill for the two departments and several related agencies is stalled between the House and Senate in a dispute over Federal funds for abortions for poor women As a result the appropriation for the last fiscal year expired Sept 30 with no new money available to pay department employees and money for various programs is about to run out HEW spokesmen said earlier that the departments key programs would continue indefinitely However as the deadline passed and funding expired it became clear that a number of secondary programs and support services would be affected State rehabilitation agencies for instance are running out of money to process claims for Social Security disability benefits While disabled recipients are not affected there will not be anyone to process new applications We have been informed that as of Oct 12 New York State will be unable to meet its payroll for employees to process the determinations Mr Califano said Texas has informed us that it will furlough 612 employees on Oct 12 because of the lack of maternal and child health and State Health Department grants Idaho does not have any carryover money to fund its nutrition and community services programs for the aging Before the month is out Mr Califano said various other programs will begin to run out of money If there is no appropriation by the end of the month 475000 black lung beneficiaries cannot receive their checks due the first week in November the Secretary said Other programs soon to be affected help finance state health programs Federal aid to schools with large numbers of Governmentdependent pupils education for the handicapped and social services for the aged Mr Califano told the Congressional leaders that if no agreement was possible by Thursday then I urge you to pass a continuing resolution for however brief a period of time so that public servants can continue to get paid and so that the old and the young the disabled and the poor may receive benefits to which they are entitled

HOUSE VOTES CHANGE IN STAND ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/13/archives/house-votes-change-in-stand-on-abortion-concession-to-senate-would.html,WASHINGTON Oct 12In a concession intended to break a threemonth deadlock on Medicaid abortions the House voted today to allow Medicaid financing for medical procedures such as dilation and curettage for some victims of rape and incest The House voted 263 to 142 to allow medical procedures before the fact of pregnancy is established necessary for prompt treatment of forced rape or incest reported to a law enforcement agency The House bill had previously banned all Medicaid abortions except when the mothers life was endangered which is the existing law The Senate favors permitting financing of abortions in rape and incest cases or when either the mother or the fetus would suffer serious health damage Supporters of the new provision contended that it could take up to four weeks to establish pregnancy and that the new language would therefore authorize thousands of abortions Opponents said that it was no real compromise because it did not fundamentally alter the existing law as interpreted by the Administration and the courts Meanwhile the Senate Appropriations Committee indicating that it still sought a more permissive statute upheld its stand and rejected the House compromise It also approved a 15day continuation of funds for the Departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare The abortion ban had been an amendment to the 601 billion appropriations for the two agencies and dispute on abortion has tied up the money for the agencies Undecided Last Night As late as last night the House leadership which had strongly opposed a continuing resolution of the type proposed by the Senators had not decided whether to accept the Senators proposal The leaders of both the House and Senate however are under pressure from the Administration to resolve the deadlock which has imperiled paychecks of 150000 employees of the two agencies as well as the services of the two agencies President Carter told Congressional leaders this morning that he realized that abortion was an emotional issue that was not easy to handle He expressed concern however about Federal employees not drawing their salaries and about programs being threatened In a related development the Labor Department distributed a memorandum to its employees advising them to consider going on welfare purchasing cheaper food and seeking the services of charitable organizatons Veterans of recent military service may be eligible for assistance by the American Red Cross the memorandum advised Relatives can perhaps help out Social service organizations and churches and synagogues can sometimes give emergency assistance The House amendment was approved on a vote of 209 to 206 to recede from its present position Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois and author of the Medicaid bar on abortions was opposed to the concession but supported the later adoption of the provision allowing medical procedures for the victims of rape and incest This amendment permits thousands of abortions which saddens me and troubles me but I will support it Representative Hyde told the House It can take over a month to establish whether or not a woman is pregnant Mr Hyde said Liberalization Lamented This is a liberalization of the position the House has had he continued It is a far cry from what I want It is a far cry from what the law has been Representative David R Obey Democrat of Wisconsin disagreed This amendment is merely a restatement of the present law what the Attorney General says the present law is Mr Obey said Mr Obey noted that the Hyde amendment did not ban the Federal financing of abortions It merely banned the federal financing of abortions of Medicaid recipients Representative Newton I Steers Jr Republican of Maryland agreed This is clearly no compromise Mr Steers said Representative Robert E Bauman Republican of Maryland opposed making any concession to the Senate The issue is more important than paychecks for Government workers Mr Bauman told the House The issue is life itself Representative Thomas P ONeill Jr Speaker of the House told newsmen this morning that I dont anticipate that there will be any payless paydays He said that some resolutions would be found to assure the continued flow of salaries and services Employees of the two agencies would receive only half of their biweekly paychecks next week unless the matter is either resolved or postponed by a continuing resolution An additional 75000 state unemployment agency worker also would be affected Senator Edward W Brooke Republican of Massachusetts supported a continuing resolution because during that time we hope that we can come up with some kind of compromise

The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/16/archives/the-nation-in-summary-for-obvious-reasons-tax-reform-to-wait-canal.html,Military maxim Dont fight a war on two fronts at once President Carters energy program is in troublea lot of it and so last week he decided to delay presenting his already overdue tax proposals to Congress Politically the delay made sense Tax law changes are difficult to shepherd through in the best of circumstances because they are vulnerable to specialinterest pressures and there simply isnt a strong and well organized constituency for revision In this circumstance in particular some Administration officials fear tax and energy might get played off one against the other The tax proposal is expected to include income tax rate reduction the heart of the energy program is tax measures and it is not inconceivable that Congress might write rate reduction into the energy bill as a substitute for the temporary rebates to consumers of proposed energy levies The delay also made sense programatically By all accounts Mr Carter is doing with the tax proposals what he did with the energy and welfare plans He is going through all the gory details of the program himself hes making all the final decisions and hes not making up his mind until the last minute There is in that procedure a tactical advantage as well With Mr Carter still thinking those around him can remain noncommittal What Mr Carter is thinking about are the detailsthe size of the cuts he wants proposed the shape of the tax relief for business The broad outlines of the program are still a reduction in personal income tax especially for families that make under 20000 a year the abolition of the capital gains advantage and for business a set of measures designed to encourage investment Such encouragement was included in the package all along but now it is being given more emphasis The Administration has been reluctant to talk about how concerned it is over the current economic lull lest such talk prompt companies to hold back on planned investment and make prophesy of a real slowdown selffulfilling One measure of the official concern however is that Administration planners have apparently expanded from 172 billion to 20 to 22 billion the overall tax reduction in the package with nearly all the additional relief designed to promote capital spending More investment is good for business and also for people because it creates jobs in construction and in capital goods industries which in turn means more consumer spending and more jobs in other industries Tax reform the President said last week is long overdue It is as I have discovered recently an extremely complicated matter Since the days of Theodore Roosevelt Adm Alfred Thayer Mahan and the Great White Fleet the Panama Canal has occupied en almost mythic placeat the center of the area where grand diplomacy and grand naval strategy overlap So it was that when two retired admirals appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee which is considering a new treaty by which Panama would eventually gain sovereignty over the waterway their views met a respectful audience As it turned out one of the officers Mm Elmo Zumwalt spoke in favor of the new treaty He said holding on to the canal would only antagonize to Panamanians who could easily render it useless at a future time when United States warships really needed it The other admiral Thomas Moorer echoed allegiance to the Mahan tradition of naval supremacy and freedom of movement with some adjustment to take care of 20th century Communism Admiral Moorer said that ratification of the new treaty might well be followed by a Russian or Cuban presence astride the waterway Admiral Zumwalt was supported by another venerable military figure Gen Maxwell D Taylor like Admiral Moorer a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff But the final word will not be the militarys it will rest with the Senate and there the treaty as even the Carter Administrationadmits is in trouble The Administration has orchestrated an impressive array of both Democratic and Republican figures to speak in its support including former President Ford and former Secretary of State Henry A Kissinger In addition the Panamanian leader Brig Gen Omar Torrijos Herrera stopped off Friday at the White House for consultations He and Mr Carter issued a statement of understanding which affirmed that while the United States had the right to use military force to keep the canal open that did not mean the United States could interfere in the internal affairs of Panama The latter condition was designed to counter Panamanian apprehensions that the amount of sovereignity they will gain by the end of the century will not be absolute Panama will hold a plebiscite on the treaty on Oct 23 Once again there was some budging last week toward compromise in the threemonthlong stalemate in Congress over whether and when Medicaid funds can be used for abortions And once again the movement wasnt enough The House made another offer grudgingly the Senate promptly rejected it and offered a modification of its own the House rejected that and the issue is back where it was in July  in conference Whats ahead is anybodys guess The House last week softened its ban on all Medicaid abortions except when the mothers life is endangered It voted to allow Medicaid payments for medical procedures such as dilation and curettage only for victims of rape and incest who report the incidents to the police and when the procedures are performed before pregnancy is established For its part the Senate substituted for its insistence that abortions be allowed when medically necessary a provision that would permit them when either the mother or the fetuss health is endangered One thing the two chambers did managed to agree on was a 15day continuation of funds for the Department of Labor and Health Education and Welfare The abortion measure is attached as an amendment to the bill that authorizes 601 billion for salaries and services for the fiscal year that began two weeks ago Because the abortion issue is holding up the appropriations bill 146500 employees of the two agencies were scheduled to have received only half of their biweekly paychecks this week Even on the question of continuation the two chambers agreed just barely Representative Robert E Bauman might have been speaking for all the antiabortionists when he said The issue is more than paychecks for Government workers The issue is life itself The first indictment of an alleged bribetaker has been handed down in the South Korean influencebuying scandal in Washington an action that critics of the twoandahalfyear investigation had long awaited and believed had to come sooner or later Until last week only alleged bribegivers had been formally accused On Friday a Federal grand jury charged Richard T Hanna a former California Congressman with seeking 100000 in bribes for attempting to influence fellow members of Congress to support Seouls objectives in particular increases in American military aid He is the first former or present member of Congress to be indicted in the scandal Mr Hanna a Democrat who left Congress in 1974 was said to have worked with Tongsun Park the Korean businessman considered the central figure in the scandal and to have helped establish the George Towne Club scene of parties given by Mr Park allegedly to win favor with Congressmen The investigation is looking into the activities of several other former Congressmen Mr Park who it is believedt could tell much has been indicted but is in Seoul out of reach of both prosecutors and investigators Benjamin Civeletti Assistant Attorney General in charge of the criminal division and Paul Michel the chief prosecutor in the case arrived in Seoul yesterday Their mission to try and work out some way of getting to Mr Park The House ethics committee one of several panels conducting inquiries into allegations of Congressional misbehavior has also talked with Seoul about access to Mr Park Mr Civeletti and Mr Michel are expected to ask that Mr Park be sent back to Washington President Park Chung Hees Government has so far refused such requests South Korea is however said to be willing to have American officials in Seoul question Mr Park Caroline Rand Herron
A Novice in Affliction,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/16/archives/a-novice-in-affliction-novice.html,DYLAN THOMASs famous poem Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night is about death it is a surpassingly beautiful admonition against the acceptance of death written by the poet to his dying father Yet its repeated imperativeRage rage against the dying of the lightis as much applicable to other forms of death and loss that can be experienced by any of us well before actual extinction Though Eleanor Clark uses as an epigraph for her memoir lines from Miltons When I Consider How My Light Is Spent wherein the blind poet speaks bravely and stoically of his intention to present his true account to God it was of Dylan Thomass fierce commandment I thought while reading her very personal and very frank account her own nearblindness The personality that emerges from Eyes Etc is hardly meek and passive stoic perhaps but hardly accepting of her fate in the usual sense of the word Eleanor Clark wishes in these pages to present herself as a novice in affliction who does not want pity who does not want to be cheered up by wellintentioned friends and who intends to reject vigorously what she calls the Pollyanna syndrome sweet little me so brave Her condition at the start of the memoir is simply HELL In the late winter of 1976 Eleanor Clark the author of Rome and a Villa Baldurs Gate The Oysters of Locmariaquer which won the National Book Award in 1965 and other books suffered massive retinal hemorrhages that left permanent scar tissue in the second of her afflicted eyes the first had hemorrhaged three years earlier The condition known es macular degeneration and though loss of sight was not total she found herself unable to read and her vision severely and bizarrely affected The chronicle of her experience which we have here was written on huge drawing pads with Magic Marker pens Try to write a page a day this way Get used to it Other people haveThurber et al she begins talking to herself encouraging herself for what must be resisted is despair Ultimately Eleanor Clark filled one hundred pads with her chronicle which is partly an energetic even feverish dialogue with herself and partly a selfportrait addressed to the public though the author does not at all times accommodate herself to readers not familiar with her life The most moving parts of the memoir have to do with her early experiences with affliction She discovers herself clumsy and easily humiliated angered by saleswomen and cafeteria workers who treat her as if she were an idiot yet cringing before them imagining she overhears remarks about herself They ought to go eat someplace else not come here bothering us    They got their own places to go to people like that A cocktail party is an undersea experience populated with dim faces some of them belonging to close friendsor are they friendsperhaps they are strangers who resemble friends just closely enough to lead one into embarrassing blunders Near blind the afflicted one can all too easily imagine herself a mental cripple as well She learns little tricks ways of covering up gaps in comprehension and realizes suddenly that an elderly woman she had known had grown shrewd in such maneuvers in order to disguise her senility This is indeed helland one cannot will oneself not even by the most strenuous act of the imagination out of it At the startperversely the distorted eyesight was almostalmostamusing Cars zooming down at you from the sky or up from out of the ground a highway    turned into a roller coaster no straight line anywhere doors and windows wiggling columns teetering each at a different angleperilous but funny quite a new conception in architecture and every face a grotesque Being kissed by her husband she cannot help bursting into laughter for she sees a huge crooked mouth coming out of his ear and two noses or none The world is crazily funny perhaps but only sporadically For she felt at least at the beginning that her impaired eyesight was worse than death The memoir was written over a period of months probably not more than six beginning in Vermont in the summer of 1976 ending that fall in Connecticut Throughout that period the family read from The Iliad and The Odyssey and that reading colors this memoir Nevertheless it is slender even slight one would wish it longer more comprehensive less concerned with daily life guests visits Vermont neighbors the coming and going of shadowy people whom we never come to know more concerned with the profound theme of affliction The Anatomy of Afflictionwill that do or The Afflicted Anatomy Eleanor Clarks selfportrait is certainly a frank assertive one and some readers may find it provocative indeed Like Nabokov she has strong opinions and does not hesitate to set them forth For instance Its normal to congratulate yourself when somebody younger than you kicks off especially suicide Moral as well as genetic superiority for mental weaknesses or illnesses evidently recognizing only physical affliction as real neurotic depression I never could understand or feel much sympathy for God forgive me  Is suicide funny Well ignoble anyway and thats always partly comical nestce pas She sees justice in the fact that the house of a disagreeable and disliked woman is demolished in a hurricane And if we smile at it why that only gives us still another bond with Noah    Avantgarde fiction demands that the reader pretend to be all agog over the authors next cerebral pinwheel or sparkler for sustaining interest its that or nothing Anyone who is against birth control and abortion has to be a criminal idiot House guests we know only by first names Gloria Paul Stanton Fred etc will be startled to learn that they did not measure up to Eleanor Clarks expectations and that she regrets having invited them to her home Though her cheeks are streaming with tears she does not hesitate to tell off hospital technicians who are stupid or inconsiderate or who mangle the English language Am I getting used to it But I dont want to she thinks at one point The memoir does indeed show a change in her accepting of her affiction but life is irreparably altered and it is useless to pretend that it is not Eyes Etc though concluded has the feel of being a memoirinprogress frank unsentimental unstoppered indefatigable

Sissy Farenthold: A Role Model on Campus,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/16/archives/sissy-farenthold-a-role-model-on-campus.html,AURORA N YWhen Frances T Sissy Farenthold walked into the threeroom presidential suite at Wells College for the first time last year she was greeted by a row of portraits of her 12 male predecessors I had them taken down and sent ever to the library she recalled There wasnt a role model among them Sissy Farenthold is if nothing else a cola model for the 482 undergraduates at Wells The mother of four grown children Mrs Farenthold is a lawyer and nationally known politician and feminist leader She was the first woman elected to the Texas Legislature where she served two terms and twice reached the runoffs in the race for governor In 1972 at the Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach she became the first woman nominated for Vice President of the United States Last year the 51yearold Mrs Farenthold surprised most of her friends and much of the academic world by agreeing to pack up and leave her beloved Texas to become the first female president of this 109yearold womans liberal arts college on the shores cf Lake Cayuga in western New York In the 19 months since then she has trimmed the budget launched a major recruiting drive and perhaps most important brought added visibility to an institution with a program that is generally agreed to be stronger than its largely regional reputation Staff members say that they wish she would smile a bit more and her views on abortion and other issues have caused some problems with alumnae But the consensus is that the unlikely match has been a good one Im not an academic and Im a Democrat in Republican territory she said But I enjoy working and learning Its been a good experience The student newspaper gave her high marks in an assessment of her first year last spring Shes been tough truthful and caring it declared Sissy Farenthold who got her nickname from a younger brother was born in Corpus Christi Texas and attended the Hockaday school a girls preparatory school in Dallas She graduated from Vassar College in 1946 at 19 and went on to the University of Texas Law School where she was one of five women in a class of 500 In 1950 she married George Farenthold who is in the oil and steel pipe business and while raising four children maintained her legal practice which included working with the poor through Legal Aid She entered politics at the state level because she explained They told me that the only job open to a woman in the local organization was secretary In 1969 because of her opposition to the Vietnam War she was the only member to vote against a resolution commending President Lyndon B Johnson In two unsuccessful gubernatorial campaignsin 1972 and 1974she ran on issues of property tax reform increased welfare benefits and the regulation of utilities and became one of the bestknown women in American politics In 1973 she became head of the National Womens Political Caucus in which she is still active Mrs Farentholds introduction to Wells College came in the spring of 1975 when she former Representative Bella Abzug and others spoke at a conference on womens rights Several months later she was approached about the college presidency and agreed to accept Except for her education she came with few of the traditional qualities of Wells presidents and students were openly skeptical We all wondered she was just using it as a springboard for a job in Washington said Wendy Hartog a senior Such doubts were heightened by rumors that she was being considered for a post in the Carter Cabinet She did however come with a commitment to womens education and with considerable visibility qualities that the trustees valued highly Wells College was founded in 1868 by Henry Wells the founder of Wells Fargo and the American Express Company The college library contains a collection of memorabilia of early express companies and seniors still ride to commencement ceremonies in old Wells Fargo stagecoaches The college has numerous assets including a picturesque 360acre campus modern facilities an 8million endowment a luxurious 9to1 studentfaculty ratio and loyal alumnae more than half of whom contribute to the college each year The costtuition room and board 4s 5550 this yearis competitive with similar liberal arts institutions Wells also has problems however When Mrs Farenthold arrived she discovered that the operating deficit was 500000 or 10 percent of the budget She trimmed the faculty by three to 57 and began to nibble away at things that had become traditions but werent essential to the academic process When I first came here to speak I was served lobster newburg she recalled I dont know if the other tables got the same thing but Its the only college dining hall Ive ever seen that served lobster newburg Since I became president the food has gotten worse Mrs Farenthold also set out to cut energy and utility costs as part of an ethics of less campaign She delayed turning on the boilers for three weeks yanked out extension phones shut down buildings during the short January terms turned off airconditioners and brought in some energy consultants to suggest further steps The budget is expected to be in balance by next year but recruitment remains another major problem Wells problem is visibility said Luther Van Ummersen the vice president and treasurer who was brought in last year from Middlebury College No one knows were here Last spring despite a high level of applications the number of acceptances for the freshman class dropped from 180 to 120 In response to the crisis Mrs Farenthold organized a recruitment drive that brought the freshman class up to 150 Mrs Farenthold has begun to strengthen academic programs in such fields as the sciences engineering and management where womens institutions have traditionally been weak Gladys Heldman the professional tennis promoter who was brought onto the board last year is helping develop a program of internships in the petroleum industry A brochure for the math department acknowledges that many women have been socialized against quantitative study and notes that the department offers counseling and remedial work in the belief that an analytical mind is neither a masculine nor a feminine characteristic Central to this effort to reshape the curriculum in a liberal arts context is the personality of Mrs Farenthold whom students unabashedly describe as a model The role argument really works said Carol Lustenader who graduated in 1976 and now works in the development office I dont know if Id like to be from Texas but I would like to have her ability Cindy Auburn a sophomore said that she transferred here this fall largely becaus of Mrs Farenthold It builds selfesteem to knew that women can do important things and just as important get credit for them she said Mrs Farenthold lives in the presidential residenceIts done in antebellum style but up here they call it Federalistalong with a vizsla dog and two of her four children The presidents Belgianborn husband George operates his business in Houston and visits about once a month This sort of thing is the price of a mobile society said Mrs Farenthold Its a kind of rootless existence which is somewhat ironic since until I was 42 I lived five blocks from where I was born Mrs Farenthold travels extensively for fund raising and recruitment and continues to speak out on feminist issues which can sometimes cause problems A recent speech on abortion brought several letters of protest from alumnae and one major donor wrote to the college saying that while she would continue to support Wells she preferred to deal with a nonpartisan official Friends say that for all her success as a public figure Mrs Farenthold is basically shy and students say she can sometimes seem aloof For students her ability to create positive morale is her strongest asset I sometimes forget how famous she is said Anna Wood a sophomore from Monroe Me She was nominated for Vice President of the United States and recently she went to a dinner where she was the guest of honor and the person at her right was Vice President Mondale Think about that The Vice President was there and the president of our colege was the guest of honor Wow
CUOMO IS SWITCHING CAMPAIGN STRATEGY,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/17/archives/cuomo-is-switching-campaign-strategy-now-an-outsider-he-tries-to.html,Moving into the intensive final three weeks of the long mayoral campaign Edward I Koch and Mario M Cuomo have switched roles from those they held at the time of the Democratic mayoral primarya switch that has apparently produced a shift in the strategy of Mr Cuomo but not of Mr Koch Theres been an extraordinary convolution of roles Mr Cuomo said Koch started as an outsider while I was perceived as the Establishment candidate Now clearly hes the Establishment candidate Mr Cuomo the New York Secretary of State lost the Democratic mayoral primary to Representative Koch but is still on the ballot next month as the Liberal Party candidate I like it better out here Mr Cuomo added making a virtue out of necessity They played their altered roles yesterday as the four major mayoral candidates held the first televised debate of the generalelection campaign The other three concentrated their attacks on Mr Koch with Mr Cuomo who led the way challenging the deals he indicated had helped Mr Koch win the nomination The Republican mayoral candidate State Senator Roy M Goodman and the Conservative contender Barry Farber who are generally believed to be trailing the two Democrats have not changed tactics from their last encounter in the Republican mayoral primaiy which Mr Goodman won However Mr Goodman has been campaigning hard to avoid a devastating defeat that could jeopardize his future political career wither in the State Senate or in the quest of some other office Except for Mr Farber the other three mayoral candidates have been campaigning at a reduced pace in the weeks since the Sept 8 primary and The Sept 19 runoff but they are expected to intensify their politicking after the World Series of baseball is over when voter attention can be captured again Mr Koch and his aides trying to counter an overconfidence that could reduce his victory margin and affect the mandate for change he seeks said he would follow the pattern of his successful pri mary drive and campaign like an out rather than as the oddson favorite to be the next mayor That means Mr Koch would continue to concentrate on the citys problems both in personal appearances and in a 200000ormore television advertising campaign the backbone of his primary effort One variation of the pattern would involve a toning down of criticism of Mayor Beame since a lameduck Mayor who is now backing Mr Koch Overall Koch aides expect to raise up to 500000 without the hard selling that was necessary when Mr Koch was the underdog Fat cats flock to winners to the point where David Garth Mr Kochs chief strategist repeatedly talks of discouraging large contributors who would like to buy access to a new Mayor Running Against a Problem We do not want to appear to be the incumbent Mayor Mr Garth said Our basic strategy is were not going to vary our strategy he added Were running against a problemlet the people know more about what the problems are Mr Garth creator of the Koch television advertisements which will not change substantially summed up the thrust of the Koch campaign The city is in desperate shape and before we go to Washington to get help we have to put our house in order cut to the bone and make sure that any new money will be used not wasted Mr Koch echoed that Reality was his oneword summation of his campaign The code word of a Koch administration is realitywhat are the facts how do you deal with them he said The continuing concentration on the bad news at City Hall also serves Koch aides conceded to nip in the bud any rising voter expectations that would require minor miracles for a new mayor to satisfy Mr Koch conceded one substantial change in his status He has been inundated by job applications but has been filing them in a drawer He said he also discouraged those who were already addressing him as Mr Mayor One thing Im bent on not doing is giving anyone the impression that Im the Mayorelect he said echoing a political axiom that was firmly established when Thomas E Dewey was narrowly defeated in the 1948 Presidential race Mr Koch said that the only concession to his status as a heavy favorite was that he was receiving appraisals of government institutions from Beame administration insiders and outside critics and experts Mr Kochs campaign manager Edward N Costikyan and Maxwell Lehman a former city administrator are handling such memorandums Where It Is Possible Mr Koch and his staff wont readily concede it but there has also been a general toning down of his often flamboyant campaign rhetoric as well as a qualification of an earlier pledge to reduce business taxes The candidate now adds the phrase where that is possible While Mr Koch is acting like a man who might have to redeem his pledges Mr Cuomo who was considered the likely November winner several months ago has shifted his strategy to reflect his underdog role Money is one signal He raised and spent 15 million in the primary He has now set a target of 250000 in the general election and has collected only onethird of that Another signal is that Mr Cuomo pledged to put more effort into his campaign and has backed that up with a series of lengthy position papers on various issues That move could also reflect the growing influence of Howard J Samuels one of the few major Democrats left in the Cuomo campaign Mr Samuels papered the state with position papaers in his unsuccessful 1974 gubernatorial campaign There are few differences on substantive issues between Mr Cuomo and Mr Koch but Mr Cuomo does draw a fine line by opposing layoffs in general Mr Koch keeps his options open on the subject by talking about discharging loafers and extraneous employees but not going much further Ed Koch is wrong when he tells you the way to balance the budget is to cut services Mr Cuomo said at St Francis Preparatory School last week He argued that continuing reductions of services would accelerate the flight of the middle class Actually Mr Koch mentions few specifics when he talks of layoffs and service cutbacks to restore the citys fiscal health He has not committed himself to either except in cases of wastea stance that presumably any mayor or candidate would take Charisma and the Clubhouse Mr Cuomos attacks on Mr Koch center on his alliance with the Democratic organizations in Manhattan Brooklyn and the Bronx during the runoff primary In a variation on the Koch campaign theme Mr Cuomo said Mr Koch could give us charisma and the clubhouseBess Myerson and Meade Esposito Mr Esposito is the Brooklyn Democratic chairman and Miss Myerson a member of the Koch inner circle frequently accompanies the candidate to satisfy the publicrelations view that a candidate needs a woman by his side even if he is single Mr Cuomo will also emphasize his newly created Neighborhood Party to point up his asserted independence and his ties with the outer boroughs particularly his home borough of Queens Senator Goodman from the start has taken the hardest line on the seriousness of the citys fiscal crisis and is continuing to do so He said at a meeting last week that the next mayor must scale down the city government and if he doesnt I predict without equivocation that the city will go bankrupt and I dont say that lightly Mr Goodman is counting on a perception by the voters of him as the candidate most willing to tell the truth about the citys precarious fiscal condition and the most willing and able to do something about it However the Senators own aides concede that at least so far that perception is not widespread and that the candidate is caught in an electoral squeeze between Mr Kochcompeting with him for liberal Republican voters and independents from Manhattan where both candidates liveand Mr Cuomo and Mr Farbersiphoning normally Republican votes in the outer boroughs That strategic problem has obviously been perceived by normally big Republican contributors who a Goodman aide explained are donating 100 instead of an expected 1000 each Endorsements of Mr Goodman by other Republican officeholders including fellow legislators have also been scarce Some of Mr Goodmans top advisers are ready to concede second place to Mr Cuomo but are fearful that the Senator could trail so far behind that his political future could be jeopardized Mr Farber has based his campaign on his philosophical and ideological differences with the other candidates on such issues as abortion the death penalty and homosexual rights The thrust of his campaign has been that liberals brought the city to its present state and that he is running against three liberals Let the word go forth nationally and across the world that our municipal mental illness has ended and a clean safe honest and rational New York now invites taxpayers to come return and remain to fill the good jobs that will also come return and remain Mr Farber said in what has become a rallying cry for his campaign

Kenya Center Uncovering Secrets of Insect Life,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/18/archives/kenya-center-uncovering-secrets-of-insect-life-researchers-at.html,NAIROBI KenyaAmong the towering eucalyptus trees on the Masonga Wai River here stands one of the most remarkable if least known scientific institutions in the world a complex of laboratories where more than 30 researchers from 17 countries are discovering the innermost secrets of the lives of insects and their close allies They have found what makes wood taste good to termites how to induce abortions in tsetse flies one of the few insects that incubates its eggs in a uterus how ticks in the grass find other ticks already parasitizing an animal and join them in clusters and how termites decide when to build a roof over their trails The scientists say such knowledge is essential to developing effective and environmentally sound pest control methods They also hope to use the same knowledge not to destroy insects but to grow them more abundantly under controlled circumstances as sources of food Established only seven years ago the International Center of Insect Physiology and Ecology is regarded throughout the scientific world as the leading institution of its kind ICIPE pronunced every way you can think of by its polyglot staff is an independent internationally supported center that concentrates on seven types of insects responsible for enormous crop damage livestock destruction and human suffering particularly in tropical regions The target species are tsetse fly termite mosquito tick African army worm maize stem borer and sorghum shootfly These are extremely difficult pests which have defied solutions for decades Ordinary pest control techniques have not been successful and out of necessity we have had to reexamine these insects from the most fundamental basis said Prof Thomas R Odhiambo the centers director Professor Odhiambo a Kenyan and an internationally recognized authority on insect reproductive hormones conceived the idea for the center 10 years ago as both a much needed center for attacking difficult insect pest problems and as a focus of scientific excellence that he believed developing countries needed to become truly independent Professor Odhiambo proposed an insect biology center in a 1967 article in Science magazine entitled East Africa Science for Development In that article he argued that unlike Western philesophies which are dualistic distinguishing between objective and subjective realities traditional African philosophies are monistic making no such distinction As a result Professor Odhiambo wrete Science in the modern sense has no firm foundations in African society He argued that newly independent African countries would remain handicapped if they only imported the technological fruits of science done elsewhere and failed to develop their own centers of scientific innovation Such centers in African countries would not only tackle African problems but also by exposing more Africans to scientific ways of thinking serve to revise traditional outlooks on life that hamper economic and technological development Professor Odhiambos article caught the attention of a number of Western scientists who were also interested in the Third World Led by Carl Djerassi a Stanford University biochemist they agreed to work with Professor Odhiambo to turn his idea into reality Their success has been nothing short of remarkable and by most accounts largely the result of Professor Odhiambos tireless efforts to persuade private and governmental bodies in a number of countries to donate money to suppert the center Among the centers prime targets is the tsetse fly an insect resembling a horsefly that infests some 4 million square miles of Africa and carries African sleeping sickness also called trypanosomiasis The disease accounts for substantial human suffering and death and puts vast tracks of prime grazing land off limits to cattle Whereas most insects reproduce prolificdlly laying enough eggs to sustain massive losses and still keep the species going tsetse flies produce only one offspring at a time Instead of laying eggs that immediately become vulnerable the egg is carried in a uterus where it hatches and the larva fastens its mouth on an intrauterine milk gland and matures Just before it is to pupate a cocoonlike phase the fully mature larva is born After pupation larvae become mature flies Larvae Not Vulnerable Because of this maternal protection the larvae are not readily vulnerable to pesticides But this complex reproductive system gives us an opportunity to look for some weak link that we can exploit Dr Mohammed Chaudhury an American scientist in the program said He and his colleagues have identified a number of hormones produced by various glands in the mother tsetse that control the reproductive process By performing surgery on individual flies to remove the glands Dr Chaudhury is finding out which hormones control which steps of the process Using a binotular microscope and instruments designed for eye surgery Dr Chaudhury carefully opens the fly which is chilled in cold water and excises the tiny organ The wound closes without stitches At first we had a lot of mortality Dr Chaudhury said but eventually we improved the technique and havent lost very many flies He found which gland and hormone trigger ovulation Removal of the gland rendered the flies sterile He found another hormone that controlled the milk gland Removal of this one caused the next two or three flies to be born as miniatures the one after those to be aborted before term and eliminated further reproduction Hormones Researched Tsetse researchers at the center are also testing the effects of overdoses of various hormones Some have been synthesized artificially and administered to the flies to produce abortions Such a chemical would be useful in the field for controlling tsetse flies if a way could be found to deliver the hormone in the right doses to the flies Dr Chaudhurys colleagues are working on one novel approach feeding the hormone to cattle It should be harmless to the cattle but flies that bit them to suck blOod would ingest a dose and be unable to reproduce A similar stratagem of armoring cattle against their parasites is being investigated for tick control by Dr Fred Obenchain another American Ticks are a major threat to cattle in Africa because their bites transmit a fatal disease known as East Coast fever Even ticks that do not carry the disease may attach by the thousands each taking one to two cubic centimeters of blood causing the cattle to weaken and die Immunizing the animal against the disease still leaves it vulnerable to sheer blood loss from nice clean ticks said Dr Obenchain Were going to try to immunize animals against the ticks themselves Vaccine for Cattle The goal is to develop a vaccine from some critical protein substance within the tick perhaps the hormone necessary for molting After such an immunization cattle would carry antibodies to the hormone in their blood When a tick took its blood meal it would ingest the antibodies which in turn would destroy the molting hormone in the tick Without this hormone the tick could not shed its old excskeleton and grow It would die before it could reproduce Termites are another of the centers major targets not only because of their propensity for eating wood in housing but because several species especially in Africa eat grass competing with livestock and wildlife Dr Gilbert W Oloo a Kenyan has been studying termite food preferences and how the insects find their favorite foods He has made chemical extracts from various grass species and identified the substances that contribute the preferred flavor Dr Oloo once soaked some filter paper in a flavor extract and presented it to the termites in one arm of a Yshaped maze while their favorite grass ated of its flavor was in the other arm The termites preferred the paper Dr Oloo and his colleagues study termites in the field where they burrow in the ground like ants but the scientists also keep a number of colonies in the lab each in a block of earth carefully dug out of the ground Dr Oebele H Bruinsma a Dutch termite specialist is analyzing the ways termites build their nests mounds and foraging trails The behavior is often governed by chemical secretions For example the large body of the queen termite has been found to emit a volatile substance When worker termites smell this substance at a certain concentration they gather soil particles in their mouths and begin cementing them together at precisely the distance from the queens body where the odor is at the right concentration Roofing Instinct in Termites As the wall gets higher the concentration of the odor diminishes so the workers begin making the walls curve inward until they meet forming an ovalshaped dome known as the royal cell A similar phenomenon prompts termites to build roofs over regularly used foraging trails When a new trail is established it simply runs across open ground As the concentration of an odoriferious substance deposited by the traveling termites grows it reaches a critical point that suddenly stimulates the termites to gather soil particles and cement them together constructing a roof over the trail Dr Oloo has obtained quantities of the substance painted squiggly trails across a piece of paper and watched the termites roof over the circuitous path Such experiments are more than scientific tricks If termites depend so heavily on various odors to survive interfing with these chemical messages the ough some nontoxic process may prove a better method of termite control than hazardous pesticides This is really a major aspect of our program Professor Odhiambo said The old methods of using chemical pesticides have been found to have disadvantages Biological controls can give us safer and more effective methods of pest management Professor Odhiambo has another idea Once some of the problems of insect pests have been dealt with he would like to turn the same intimate knowledge of insect life toward raising insects as food In many parts of Africa various insects are eaten as food not only by people on the edge of starvation but also by many who consider termites for example a tasty addition to a varied diet Professor Odhiambo believes that it may be possible to farm insects on an intensive basis and produce large quantities of protein in addition to other insect byproducts such as honey and beeswax I would like us to have a shot at it he said but funding is still a tremendous problem It has taken a long time to win donors Professor Odhiambo now must spend much of his time visiting donor groups around the world to maintain and increase the centers budget It has grown over the years but still lags behind what the centers officials feel it should be One mission of ICIPE is to help establish science in East Africa but as a nongovernmental institution we need outside help to strengthen our financial base Professor Odhiambo said Developing countries must develop the capability of doing science It is a necessary part of being independent This is another in a series of articles describing the creative process of scientific research
A. H. Raskin,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/19/archives/ah-raskin-growing-acceptance-for-the-coalition-of-union-women.html, When the Coalition of Labor Union Women was formed four years ago to spur the nations unions into more active concern with the needs of working women there were no cheers from the allmale high command of the union establishment Nor did toplevel enthusiasm grow when the coalition spent most of its first two years in factional battles for control between advocates of radical change and others determined to work within the framework of organized labor Since then however attitudes and approaches on both sides have mellowed to a point that made George Meany at the coalitions annual convention in Washington last month ente ra roguish confession to having become a closet feminist The descriptive grew out of the close alliance that developed between womens organization and labor in lobbying Congress for a higher minimum wage a measure of particular benefit to women workers because so many art at the bottom of the pay scale If supporting a living wage for all workers makes a feminist move over sisters Ive been called a lot worse the 83yearold president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations told the union women The coalition which uses the acronym CLUW pronounced clue has settled into a course that keeps it close to labors mainstream on such legislative issues as full employment labor law reform and national health insurance But it is independent enough to take a strong stand in favor of some issues that the federation and most of its affiliates duck as too controversial Notable in this category was the unanimous adoption at last months convention of a resolution defending the right of women at all income levels to have abortions if they wished A principal element in the coalitions formation in 1973 was its determina tion to swing the federation away from its hostility to the Equal Rights Amendment The coalition has won that fight and the AFLCIO is now in the forefront of organizations campaigning for ratification of the amendment    The coalitions new presidentJoyce D Miller an international vice president of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Unionis a champion of affirmative action in unions and the work place but she also affirms that ability to do the job ought to be the sole criterion for employment or promotion in any field On that basis Mrs Miller gives low priority to an issue on which many of her associates feel strongly When will a woman break into the federations 35member executive council which has been a closed shop for men since Samuel Gompers day Just to say here is a woman put her on the executive council is a form of sexism Im not for that though not all my colleagues agree Mrs Miller said in an interview in her cluttered office on Union Square I think the trade union movement has moved on recognizing the right of women to greater representation I cant get all hung up on the issue of executive council membership At the moment the prospect of female breakthrough into labors Sanhedrin seems remote even though the last two years have marked the most rapid turnover of council members in the federations history Kathleen Nolan president of the Screen Actors Guild who had led in speculation as a possible choice is currently preoccupied with a fiveway race to hold on to her own presidency She was denied renomination on the official slate but is running as an independent in a mail referendum    Mrs Miller the new chief of the coalition is concentrating her initial energies on making the coalition a mass organization Of the six million women in unions only 5500 now belong to CLUW Mrs Millers goal is to double that total within a year At 49 she is a woman of arresting presence bigboned with dark skin and coalblack hair given to heavy jewelry in gold and silver Born in Chicago of a middleclass family Mrs Miller decided early that unionism was the career for her While studying at the University of Chicago for her bachelors and masters degrees she worked on an assembly line making gumballs for penny vending machines then switched to a job as parcel wrapper at Marshall Field  Company before enrolling as a student intern at a United Auto Workers summer camp I came to the labor movement with stars in my eyes she declared I saw it as a vehicle for social change and Ive never changed my mind She held a series of union teaching and consumer posts while having three children and the problems of bringing them up especially after her marriage foundered 13 years ago have given her an intense interest in improving childcare programs for working mothers A day care center she set up in Chicago in 1970 was described in a Government report as the RollsRoyce of day care    Mrs Miller is convinced that CLUWs success in fighting off the efforts of outside radical groups to use it as an instrument for advancing their own agenda has left it well equipped to grow Membership dues of 10 a year supplemented by subsidies from the AFLCIO and several major unions are enabling the group to hire its first fulltime staff member and set up its own headquarters in New York We are against the Phyllis Schlaflys of the world said Mrs Miller referring to the antifeminist who is leading a national crusade to defeat the Equal Rights Amendment The same ultraconservative women who are antiERA are also antiunion Now we have a group to fight them from the other side Prof Barbara Wertheimer of Cornell Universitys School of Industrial and Labor Relations whose book We Were There is the most definitive history of women in American unions shares Mrs Miners belief that CLUW has built a solid framework for future progress However she stressed the need for demonstrating that the financial aid it receives from established unions is not stripping it of required independence The challenge for the coalition is to press its efforts to advance the common interests of working men and women while also keeping enough distance to prove that it is something more than an arm of the oldline labor movement
KOCH VOWS TO GIVE CITY JOBS TO WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/19/archives/koch-vows-to-give-city-jobs-to-women-promises-them-posts-at-all.html,Women will get jobs at all levels New York Citys government and there will be flexitime and parttime schedules for those whose family needs would conflict with unbudgeable work rules Edward I Koch said yesterday The Democratic candidate for Mayor was applauded when he announced this during a breakfast of women for Koch and again when he promised not to use the adjective qualified in describing the women he would appoint The word is not used with male candidates he saidit was assumed So would be with women Mr Koch shared the podium in the Georgian room of the Americana Hotel with the ebullient Midge Costanza a special assistant to President Carter who drew guffaws from the 400 guests when she told of her early days in politics speaking with mock enthusiasm of the opportunities she had been given to lick envelopes Mr Koch spoke carefully from a text packed with promises and with assurances that he was notas others have saidthe next Mayor but simply the Democratic candidate against Roy M Goodman the Republican Barry Farber the Conservative and Mario M Cuomo the Liberal The loudest of the 14 bursts of applause came when Mr Koch promised city funds for abortions for poor women if Federal funds were withheld The same pledge has already been made statewide by Governor Carey but Mr Koch was cheered loudly when he said If not other funding is available I will provide city funds to pay for abortions in municipal hospitals for those women who choose them but cannot pay for them The fivepage compendium of womens issues that he read was fashioned under the supervision of his cocampaign manager Bess Myerson who joined in the cautions to the crowd that the campaign was not over yet Its two down and one to go she said alluding to the primary and the runoff that Mr Koch won and the Nov general election that can make him the 105th Mayor of New York City Of the need by many workersmen and womento work a nontraditional schedule he noted that flexitime and parttime schedules have been successfully used in the private sector and must be adopted for city workers He made such accommodations for some of his Congressional staff members with no inconvenience said Mr Koch who represents the East Side in the House of Representative Surrounded by workers whose jobs are threatened by the conversion of lofts into housing Mr Cuomo New Yorks Secretary of State stood on a Broadway sidewalk and urged all mayoral candidates to join in his protest of the program Its such a clear perversion of a good objective he said We need housing but certainly not at the expense of jobs His specific target was 693 Broadway between Third and Fourth Streets which is owned by New York University and is scheduled to be converted into apartments Is this deliberate Is it done in a sinister way Mr Cuomo asked rhetorically  I doubt it I think its really an ineptitude City housing officials should fight such plans he said One of his Liberal Party supporters Gerald R Coleman a former member of the City Planning Commission said that liberal taxwriteoff rules were encouraging conversions of this sort In the shadow of the Municipal Building home to a portion of the citys Civil Service Mr Goodman called for the relaxation of rigid work rules for city employees The State Senator proposed among other things To give agency heads more control over employees Now he said executives are heavily encumbered with red tape from the personnel department and the Budget Bureau To develop better middlemanagement supervisors Past performance is rarely evaluated in promotions he said The city maintains only a few training courses The present system fails to pre pare middle managers to assume responsibility To encourage broadbandingsimplification of the classification of Civil Service jobs to a few broad categories To make job cutbacks forced by the citys fiscal crisis not on the basis of attrition but on the basis of functional criteria On the steps of City Halla few paces from where Paul ODwyer the City Council President was holding a news conference to ndorse State Senator Andrew J Stein for Borough President of ManhattanMr Farber charged that Mr Koch a onetime liberal now masquerades as the reincarnation of General Patton The former host of a radio talk show cited a statement he said Mr Koch made about limiting felony sentences during television debate last Nov 26 But spokesman for the television station WNEW said later that Mr Koch had not been on the station that day While Mr Stein was receiving Mr ODwyers endorsement Robert F Wagner Jr who lost the Democratic primary to Mr Stein and who is now the RepublicanLiberal candidate was given the support of the New Democratic Coalition the umbrella group for the partys insurgent faction The CouncilmanatLarge termed the vote a triumnh for the reform politics which I represent
The Conference Committee Is a Venerable Institution,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/23/archives/the-conference-committee-is-a-venerable-institution.html,WASHINGTONThere was anger and amicability at the HouseSenate conference Keep it short You havent come within the realities of what were doing today Very reluctantly me and my proxies well go along with the House So it went last week in the early stages of the conference on energy legislation but almost any day in some dark corner of the Capitol one can here something similar It is the stuff of a typical conference on the disagreeing votes of the two houses As an institution the SenateHouse conference one day younger than the Congress itself On April 8 1789 the first conferees met to try to establish rules for resolving differences between House and Senate versions of bills It had been a routine practice in colonial legislatures deriving from British Parliament procedures in the days before the supremacy of Commons The conference is not the only way to settle the final details of major legislation although it is the most common The simplest way is for one house to adopt outright the measure voted by the other That often happens with Constitutional amendments But the pride and jealousy of each chamber make It very hard for a complicated bill to escape without changes When President Johnson bulled the House bill on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 through the Senate without a single amendment it was an exceptional show of legislative muscle that almost rivaled the triumph of political accommodation in settling the basic issues of Federal aid to education A more typical approach is for one chamber pass a bill for the other to amend It somewhat then for the first house to repass it with the amendments Congress did that on the Public Service Jobs bill last March Theoretically that procedure could be strung out with each house voting on amendments and sending the bill back and forth until the differences had been narrowed enough for one side to give in That might have worked in 1789 but today It would be impossible there is too much to do And so the conference is a shortcut The conferees try to make those adjustments and while the bill can be rejected later on the floor either house and the conferees told to go back and insist on something else it cannot be amended Some conference questions are easy A twoyear House authorization and a fouryear Senate authorization can become a threeyear conference authorization after some speeches with no one losing face Dollar differences can be resolved the same way Last month the budget committees even split the difference on the two houses forecasts of economic growth more of an intellectual than a practical exercise One thing the conference is not supposed to do is go beyond the scope of the hills before it That means that when the House voted for a Federal minimum wage of 305 in 1980 and the Senate voted to make it 315 the conferees could have taken either of those figures or something in between but not 304 or 316 They settled for 310 When the arguments are not over numbers but words the task is more difficult Conferees settled easily the appropriation for the Departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare but not the terms of a ban on abortion that was part of the same bill The House wants to prohibit Federal money for abortions except when the mothers life is endangered the Senate prefers a more liberal version The conference meetings have been brief and have gone nowhere When a provision is not In one houses version of a bill a lot of basic writing of legislation goes on in conference The energy conferees for example are struggling over ways to promote solar heating because that was not in the House bill though the House conferees are tar more knowledgeable than their Senate counterparts about housing matters That type of House advantage extreme in this case is not unusual By the time Representatives acquire the seniority to be conferees they often are subcommittee chairmen and the key to influence in the House is expertise on precisely defined issues Who the conferees are sometimes makes a big difference While ordinarily they are the senior members of the pertinent committees the Senate occasionally has added others to make sure the view of the entire chamber is defended This was done regularly with civil rights bills to insure liberal representation The House reaches outside the committee hierarchy to include authors of major floor amendments Conferences used to be held In secret often not until the very end of a session so members knew little of what had happened and had only a quick takeitorleaveit shot at the results Committee elders casually would scrap amendments voted on the floor that they disliked Since 1975 conferences by rule have been open but most take place in rooms too small for the public to get much of a chance to see whats going on An issue is discussed and one side presents a proposal It first votes on it by voice vote a show of hands or a rollcall The other side either accepts or rejects the proposal Proxies are liberally used because attendance is often sparse particularly at the abortion meetings these days After a string of rejections conferees often get angry At 230 one morning last August Senator Wendell Anderson Democrat of Minnesota blew up at Representative John D Dingell Democrat of Michigan for insisting that auto emissions had not been proved unhealthy The Senate side then pressed on for a victory in setting emission levels Each side tends to exaggerate its concessions but a giveandtake spirit often develops Deciding whether to take the Senates 2500 limit on subsidized energysaving loans or the Houses 2200 the conferees heeded Senator Henry M Jacksons request Why doesnt the House recede on that Weve been receding all afternoon All right agreed Representative Thomas L Ashley Democrat of Ohio
"In The Act,’ The Drama Backstage Is Not An Act",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/23/archives/in-the-act-the-drama-backstage-is-not-an-act-behind-the-scenes-of.html,LOS ANGELES Next Saturday night Liza Minnellis new musical The Act opens at the Majestic thus bringing to close one of the most rumored and casualtyprone road tryouts Broadway has seen in several yearsa tryout ironically that can boast not one but two backstage melodramas the first one played onstage the second one off Since the shows single dress rehearsal on the Fourth of July in Chicago casualties have included two actors an assistant choreographer 92000 worth of costumes and their designer some 80000 worth of scenery one marriage two titles Shine It On and before that In Person three songs and most of the book Plus the director which is a story well get to With a ticket advance of 2 million and half of its 1 million cost already paid back on the road what New York critics will say may not matter much especially since Miss Minnelli is contracted to play The Act for only 39 weeks Before director Gower Champion quietly came in to doctor the show during its final month in Los Angelesunofficially replacing Martin Scorseseno one was betting The Act had much chance with the critics anyway That is not beyond an expectation that they will admire Minnellis razzledazzle performance By closing week however Mr Champion was said to have worked substantial changes and all bets are now off Produced by Cy Feuer and Ernest Martin How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying the show brings home some realities Item Rising costs have pushed its Saturday night orchestra seats to a record 25 Item Partly because regional and subscription theater have grown while the influence of drama critics has diminished The Act has been able to play a longish 15week sellout tour through Chicago San Francisco and Los Angeles in the face of poor notices KNBCTV in Los Angeles said After three Hours not only does the show need a new book you need a new backside Twothirds of the audience in San Francisco and Los Angeles was made up of Civic Light Opera members who were locked in months ago when they renewed their seasons subscription Item While Hollywood is gingerly trying out movies like Julia and Looking for Mr Goodbar which speak w feminist concerns for more films about women the new seasons first likely musical hit offers the biggest brassiest womans role since Hello Dolly Bigger Miss Minnelli plays Michelle Craig a monomaniacal sexually selfconfident woman who belts out 12 of the shows 13 songs With token assist from Barry Nelson and the company of 10 she dominates center stage ducking off only twice all evening to change the color of her Halston pants outfits If theres a point The Act underscores most its that Miss Minnelli on Broadway has incomparable star power her boxoffice pull recalling the days of Ethel Merman and Mary Martin Film and nightclub stars like Shirley MacLaine Debbie Reynolds and Bette Midler fill seats but so far they have chosen to play Broadway once or twice while this is Miss Minnellis fourth time up She won the Tony for Flora the Red Menace in 1963 played a twoweek sellout concert at the Winter Garden in 1973 and reversed the slipping grosses of Chicago two years ago when she stepped in for an ailing Gwen Verdon Miss Minnelli is a manic overachiever and The Act is an attempt to synthesize everything hes done so farsing dance and act in a vehicle which is both a concert and a book musical with its settings in Hollywood and Las Vegas mobilized on a Broadway stage Half of the show is a straightforward Vegas act written by John Kander and Fred Ebb which portrays the nightclub debut of Michelle Craig a 32yearold former star of early 60s movie musicals The other half by George Furth Company is a backstage saga told in flashbacks of her rise to and fall from fame complete with a comeback accomplished with varying degrees of help from a producerhusband a lover and a songwriter confidant If the Craig biography is too scrambled to come off as unabashed roman a clef its art still imitates the life of several recognizable stars Mostly it calls to mind Miss Minnelli or Shirley MacLaine or AnnMargret all vaguely by way of Judy Garland As it is smorgasbord you can take your pick Two years ago when Mr Furth was showing the book around to producers working them with songwriter Marvin Hamlisch A Chorus Line the part was for a 40ish woman and any number were mentioned including Mary Tyler Moore Doris pay Debbie Reynolds and Cloris Leachman Finally it was offered to Shirley MacLaine But in mid1976 when Miss Minnelli was filming New York New York for director Martin Scorsese she asked for the part and got it It seems Mr Kander and Mr Ebb were lined up to do the score now and over the years they had written some 17 shows and acts for her including Cabaret for which all three won Oscars with Mr Feuer and Mr Martin producing It looked to be clear sailing again for the old team The part was made younger 32 Miss Minnellis age Also she wanted Mr Scorsese to direct and the team went along Mr Scorsese is one of the hottest film directors around since Mean Streets and Taxi Driver but he lacked theater experience and admitted he hadnt even seen much of it His youth had been spent in movie balconies Rehearsals began in Los Angeles last May and it was tough going from the start While Miss Minnelli worked on Kander and Ebbs songs and the dances created by Las Vegas choreographer Ron Lewis Mr Scorseses time was split three ways final polishing of New York New York editing a rock documentary called The Last Waltz and directing the show Designers despaired of having too little time with Mr Scorsese to discuss their plansonly 15minute meetings on the runso it came as no surprise when their uncoordinated efforts at the Chicago opening were roundly disliked In time the sets and lighting would be worked out but Theadora Van Runkles costumes seemed so misguided that they were scrapped at once One critic described them as sadistic no doubt thinking of her crepe gown with a cutout circle exposing one side of Miss Minnellis short waistnot her best feature Or another that wrapped in gathers at the waist when it wasnt unwrapping Halston was quickly summoned to redo all the costumes as meanwhile Miss Minnelli got by on stage with Halstons out of her closet The new designs costing 100000 plus fee are simple and monochromatic with all of Miss Minnellis clothes shimmering with sequins But the show faced much tougher problems stemming in part from Mr Scorseses overall conception Early on he had toyed with the idea of shaping The Acts Michelle Craig as a continuation of New York New Yorks Francine Evans the bigband vocalist role Miss Minnelli played It picks up the singer 10 years later he said when shes alienated from the people around her She ends up alone but shes still working Although he came to abandon the idea partly because it would have Craig  Minnelli nearing age 50 Mr Scorsese clearly meant to carry over the films nearly operatic gloom Now he thinks hes a stage auteur one observer sniped The flashbacks as painful memories were played downstage before backdrops on a blackpainted floor At one point he spoke of having Barry Nelson and the other actors in black leather but settled for dark fabrics Since these dimly lighted scenes dealt with quarrels a fistfight abortion infidelity bankruptcy death and so onall of them totally unrelated to the nightclub act they interruptedaudiences came to dread them Moreover since Michelle Craig sometimes pattered to her audience as if they were in a Las Vegas nightclub people got lost trying to sort reality from flashback The Chicago Tribunes Linda Winer wondered if Miss Minnelli hadnt better things to do Two weeks later the San Francisco Examiners Stanley Eichelbaum saluted Miss Minnelli but called for major overhauling On opening night in San Francisco two men slid into side aisle seats in the 23d row after the houselights dimmed They were directors Michael Bennett A Chorus Line and Ron Field Applause They had been invited by the Shubert organization major backers and owners of the Majestic where The Act would play to have a look and quietly return comment At intermission one of them was recognized which next day prompted Mr Feuer and Mr Martin to invite them for a chat Both agreed and after the initial meeting there followed a friendly bullsession in Mr Bennetts hotel suite attended by the star director writers choreographer and producers Mr Bennett and Mr Field extemporized ways to brighten up the show with the meeting ending up in hugs and kisses as dawn came in the window Afterward Mr Scorsese is said to have remarked Gee this is so painful to which someone cheerfully replied Marty a wise man once said that if Hitler were alive today they wished he were out of town the director of musical in In the following weeks though Mr Scorsese installed some cuts and laughs lightened the shows mood a bit even painted the floor red his meticulous cinematic work methods werent fast enough to please anybody Hes a terrific little guy said Mr Feuer in his Los Angeles office last week a film genius but urn this is theater By now Mr Feuer and Mr Martin had eyes on other directors especially Michael Bennett or Bob Fosse Cabaret and Chicago but Miss Minnelli stood firmly behind Mr Scorsese If Marty goes she reportedly said I go too though she flatly denies this While Miss Minnelli is known for being fiercely loyal to friends especially her directors in the case of Mr Scorsese there have been rumors of a romance that dates back to the early days of shooting New York New York Now gossipcolumn reports of handholding in San Francisco restaurants and private film screenings in Berkeley only added to the companys growing unease about a lack of control and expertise at the top There were mutterings at rehearsals especially about Mr Scorseses absence at performances Still there was hope On closing night in San Francisco after Mr Scorsese had spent six weeks of hard trying critic Stanley Eichelbaum on a second look found things tighter springier and more enjoyable Then two bombshells dropped The morning after the Los Angeles opening The Los Angeles Times critic Dan Sullivan expressed the general consensus when he wondered if he had just seen the dumbest backstage musical ever to the point where you figure theyve got to be kidding On the very same day it was announced that Julia Cameron Mr Scorseses wife had filed suit for divorce Beset by difficulties and other commitments from all sides now the director had to think of stepping down Three weeks later when he was laid up with asthma director Gower Champion was hired on with both Mr Scorseses and Miss Minnellis agreement A lowkey announcement was given to the trade press citing the illness It was handy notes Mr Feuer so we used it Mr Champion caught the Saturday matinee and evening shows Sept 24 rehearsed the company on Sunday and inserted several changes Monday night Gone suddenly were II minutes worth of the overture the abortion scene a scene where Michelle Craig is slapped around by her lover until she subdues him with karate and a pair of scenes in which she twice loses the Academy Award At the same performance Mr Champion put in a new opening a tag on the second act showstopper City Lights and a number of minor adjustments to lighten and simplify Though he has taken full charge and continues the process his name will not appear in the credits As this article goes to press Mr Scorsese is in Rome discussing a film about street gangs with plans to return to New York for the opening He and Mr Champion have closed ranks and refuse interviews I inherited a sick child said Mr Champion and I cant talk about right now So whats the big secret said an observer Directors are replaced every day The way hes hiding out youd think Scorsese had committed mass murder or something I had nothing to do with Marry going Liza Minnelli is saying stretched out on her dressingroom sofa in Los Angeles Marty did it He came in He said I know youre going to trust me I will not let you open in New York as anything less than superb Youve never worked with Gower but we need help Its a technique I know nothing about but nobody is telling me Gower can add something terrific I want the very best for you  She takes a cigarette from her orange terry robe and lights it slowly Its not like Marty stormed off somewhere in an Italian rage The show is still on his mind Everything is very amiable and the vibes are very very good Hes even giving a cast party in New York Why then so much secrecy Everybody is rumorshy now she says This goddam production You cant make a move and they turn it into a big Federal deal Ive never seen publicity on a Broadway show like this have you About

Abortion Foes Gain Support As They In Campaign,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/23/archives/abortion-foes-gain-support-as-they-intensify-campaign-a-scramble.html,Buoyed by the recent antiabortion stands in all three branches of the Federal Government groups across the country are mounting highly organized increasingly broadbased and generally wellfinanced campaigns to limit access to abortion Their longrange goal already hacked by a dollar investment well into the millions is to erase the Supreme Courts 1973 decision legalizing abortions with a constitutional amendment The steppedup drive has influenced a growing number of states to end Medicaid abortions since the Aug 15 cutoff of Federal funding the result of judicial decisions and Congressional mandates Where legislatures must still vote on whether to continue state financing antiabortion forces like their opponents arc applying pressure through political prornkes to support our weakest friends and target our weakest enemies While abortion opponents are reportedly benefiting from a conservative backlash against womens issues minorities and permissiveness in general supporters of abortion rights are gearing up for defense and counterattack as they have not done since the 1973 Supreme Court decision A Scramble for New Alignments After that decision proabortion peopleor as we prefer prochoice people went on a long siesta said the Rev J Hugh Anwyl executive director of Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles Now they will have to build new coalitions working with the medical professions and with poor women deprived of Medicaid abortions Jubilation is the antiabortion reaction to the Medicaid cutoffs and other ckvelopments according to the Rev John F Wilder of St Louis who organized Christians for Life six months ago as ministry of Tower Grove Baptist Church Missouris largest Southern Baptist congregation Raising 9000 by soliciting 1 a month from contributors Christians for Life aimed a directmail campaign at the nations 35000 Southern Baptist churches The National Right to Life Committee an umbrella organization is regarded as the largest on either side of the abortion controversy It says it has 11 million active supporters in 3000 chapters Judie Brown Washington spokesman for the association said its recent fundraising mailings were producing a 12 percent response whereas 2 percent considered normal She called the organizations progress phenomenal For instance Mississippi which has been a constant fourchapter state since we incorporated in 1973 has 22 new chapters in the last month Mrs Brown said Last year our national fundraiser James Bothell of Tulsa delivered just over the 250000 budgeted for the Washington office This year hes projecting 1 million Hes overwhelmed He said Its not meits the issue  Although the issue of the moment is government financing of abortions is entwined with the more basic battle now building over the courtaffirmed constitutional right of abortion Some though not all of the opponents impatient with the progress of an antiabortion amendment in Congress want constitutional convention and have persuaded legislatures in nine of the required 34 states to petition Congress to convene one Pennsylvania Vote Due At a Pennsylvania Senate committee hearing in Philadelphias ornately massive City Hall Friday 200 spectators applauded or disputed sotto voce as the 14 witnessesseven on each sidecited the thoughts of members of the original 1787 Constitutional Convention in the city The convention call to be voted on by the Senate soon has already passed Pennsylvanias House From the moment of fertilization the Pennsylvania version specifies every human being  shall be deemed to be a person and entitled to the right to life The text identical to that introduced in Congress in 1975 by Senator Jesse Helms the North Carolina Republican allows for no exceptionsnot even to save a womans lifebut in fact never mentions the word abortion Reached at the University of Texas law school after the hearing Prof Henry Witherspoon board member and legal adviser of the National Right to Life Committee said that an abortion should be permitted provided every reasonable effort had been made to preserve the unborn life when a reasonable medical certainty exists that continuation of the pregnancy will cause the death of the mother Predicting that a humanlife amendment may take a number of years Mr Witherspoon said he preferred going through Congress rather than turning an inexperienced one  shot constitutional convention loose Congress Deadlocked on Issue Heavy lobbying by both opponents and proponents of abortion has been directed at House and Senate conferees deadlocked for three months over whether to liberalize the Hyde Amendment for the 1978 fiscal year In August the Supreme Court upheld the amendment passed by Congress last year which bans Federal money for abortions including pregnancies caused by rape or incest unless the womans life was in danger In June the Supreme Court had ruled that states need not provide Medicaid funds for non therapeutic abortions and that public hospitals need not perform them As the political potential of the abortion issue expanded beyond the immediate issue of public financing a 13state check by The New York Times shed additional light on the nature of the opposing sides  In nearly every state abortion rights advocates have failed to equal the opponents network of dedicated activists and steady if often modest contributors or more often than not cannot turn out equivalent busloads of demonstrators  While antiabortion groups have a reputation for singleissue activism they have alliances and commonalities with groups that range from those fighting to Stop the Equal Rights Amendment to Stop the Panama Canal Giveaway as reported from Florida  Groups favoring legalized abortion overlap widely with organized advocates of civil fesninist and welfare rights as well as familylimitation proponents such as Zero Population Growth The effect in some ways is to increase their strength and in others to diffuse money and activism  The Committee for a Human Life Amendment receives direct support from the National Conference of Catholic Bishops as well as local Roman Catholic dioceses and archdioceses But the antiabortion movement in general including the committee cuts across spiritual lines attracting support from Orthodox Jews Mormons Black Muslims Jehovahs Witnesses many Baptists and other conservative Protestant sects  Under the Tax Reform Act of 1976 organizations that are mainly educational can now use 20 percent of their budgets for direct lobbying without losing incometax exemption or deductibility Political action committees which can provide funds for candidates as well as lobby for causes but are nonexempt and nondeductible are being set up to work for an antiabortion amendment In addi1 tion action committees are planned in every Congressional District by 1978 as recommended by the Catholic bishops Pastoral Plan for ProLife Activities By last March the National Committee for a Human Life Amendment had received 906404 in contributions according to a monitoring project of the National Abortion Rights Action League In its required reporting of contributions of 500 or more the amendment committee said it had received 459403 by March from the nations dioceses and archdioceses59106 of it from those in New York State Committees are now being organized in each of the five Congressional Districts of the Buffalo Diocese to elect candidates favorable to the Constitutional amendment and other antiabortion legislation The 13 states surveyed by The Times were New York New Jersey Connecticut Massachusetts Maine Florida Alabama Kentucky Texas Illinois Michigan Washington and California
Homosexuals In New York Find New Pride,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/25/archives/new-jersey-pages-homosexuals-in-new-york-find-new-pride-gains-are.html,It was Yom Kippur at Congregation Beth Simchat Torah Manhattans fouryearold selfproclaimed gay synagogue and the temple facilities in Westbeth apartments in Greenwich Village were over flowing with more than 350 worshipers As the Kol Nidre services proceeded the congregantt riaYnity of them in suits prayer shawls and yarmulkes jnsmi the rabbi as he recited a special holiday petition for gay liberation which ended Fulfill your promise to lift the oppressed from degradation Remove affliction and suffering from all gay people Four years ago the synagogue consisted of a small hand of homosexuals who gathered at irregular intervals for services Now it is a part of New York life involved in United Jewish Appeal fundraising efforts treeplantings in Israel and offering classes in Hebrew It is one of many symbols of what some homosexual New Yorkers call the new gay pride The citys homosexual population which oniy a few years ago began to come out of the closet and into the street has developed markedly in recent months into a cohesive open and organized force Despite national setbacks such as a recent unfavorabld ruling by the United States Supreme Court on the dismissals of homosexual teachers gains by homosexuals in New York and elsewhere have been enormous Many people still think of homosexual life in terms of interior decorators Fire Island and bars with a leather motif This world does indeed exist and flourishes in some neighborhoods There have always been bars caterinfr to homosexuals where much socializing goes on nd much information about homosexual concerns is exchanged But increasingly the homosexual community is very much one of lawyers physicians teachers politicians clergymen and other upperclass professional men and women Aside from their sexual preference many tend to live like their heterosexual counterparts One trustee of the synagogue for homosexuals for instance mentioned offhandedly My lover and I keep a kosher home now We met at the synagogue Everybody laughs because this is one of the traditional roles synagogues have always played Homosexuals are now showing a greater willingness to identify themselves Homosexual neighborhoods for example are growing in parts of Greenwich Village Chelsea the Upper West Side and Brooklyn Heights A variety of organizations such as parents of Cays rnd Salsa Soul Sisters are proliferating along with homosexual religious congregations No one claims to have accurate statistics on how many homosexuals there are in the city10 percent of the population is the mostoften cited figureor how to identify them But leaders of the community all contend their ranks are swelling and becoming visible If the demographics are true said Robert L Livingston of the New York Political Action Council we ought to be able to make a Mayor H Gerald Schiff an accountant who helped found the Greater Gotham Business Council returned to New York in 1975 after a fiveyear absence and found the change striking 1 came back to an entirely different city he said It was very much more openly gay more willing to seek out gay professional people gay clients gay customers more conducive to coming out Ronald Gold of the National Gay Task Force said I can get my windows washed by a gay person get my television repaired do anything and never see a straight person again The reason is that a network of homosexualoriented services and enterprises has evolved over recent month many of them listed in Greater Gothams dirertory or the Gay Yellow Pages a national and local publication so that bars are no longer the sole source of information There is a Gay Switchboard and a Lesbian Switchboard a Gay Mens Health Project publications such as Gaysweek Christopher Street and Lesbian Tide the Gay Teachers Association Dignity a group of homosexual Roman Catholics Integrity a similar group of Episcopalians a program Gay Rap on WBAI radio travel agencies as well as numerous clothing accessory and book stores In addition to getting involved in these services and enterprises the homosexual community has become active politically and the growing political consciousness activists in the community say will be a factor to be reckoned with Many homosexuals became involved politically when they battled for passage by the New York City Council of a Measure that would have barred discrimination in housing and employment Its passage has failed six times most recently in September 1975 But as was the case nationally with Anita Bryants campaign in Florida the defeats only strengthened the homosexuals resolve to organize their forces better and to fight harder next time The Democratic mayoral candidates this summer acknowledged homosexuals strength by appealing for their vote in interviews conducted by the New York Political Action Council Edward I Koch the Democratic mayoral candidate and long a supporter of homosexual rights in Congress got a preferred rating as did Bella S Abzug Herman Badillo and Percy Sutton Mario M Cuomo who is now the Liberal Party candidate was rated acceptable Mayor Beame and Joel Harnett unacceptable In the Democratic primary Kenneth Sherrill a candidate of the Gay Independent Democrats and other clubs won the post of district leader in the 69th Assembly district on Manhattans Upper West Side becoming he said the first openly gay man to be elected to any party or public office in New York State Meanwhile according to Mr Livingston the Political Action Council signed 12500 new voters during a threeweek homosexualoriented registration drive in June What youre seeing this year is a logical first step politically he said One factor contributing to the growing selfawareness of homosexuals has been the generally tolerant attitude of the city in the past few years People who never before thought of living their lives openly people in important positions are now being sanctified by the liberals said Arthur Bell a Village Voice columnist and longtime activist Alongside this apparently growing tolerance is what many leaders perceive to be the more subliminal influence of homosexual tastemakers in New York Gays have a higher economic level said Mr Schiff who founded the Greater Gotham Business Council with a group of professional men almost two years ago Gay men easily learn to socialize So thty save less spend more on highluxury items have nicer apartments Thus he said a disproportionate number of homosexual trendsetting men set styles for stores advertising campaigns and customers Your major stores are catering to gay Candidates Evaluated taste certainly in fashion he said Meanwhile thousands of New York homosexual professional people are choosing to cultivate economic political and social ties among themselves I speak the same language as my patients said Dr Kenneth W Unger physician who has had a largely homosexual practice in Greenwich Village for almost four years Its something I believe in he continued sitting in his Sheridan Square office The gay community can do best by buying gay Many patients had come to him he said after suffering humilia1 tion from straight physicians As a result of the new freedom homosexuals have found in dealing with homosexual doctors outbreaks of diseases have been recognized in a way they might not have been even a year ago Earlier this month the New York City Health Department announced that in study done with the Gay Mens Health Project it had found a significant number of cases of sexually transmitted intestinal infections in the homosexual community A sample of 100 sexually active men showed 26 percent harbored intestinal parasites Dr Yehudi M Felman director of the Bureau of Venereal Disease Control called on the medical and gay communities to help fight this sofar silent epidemic with more frequent examinations and treatments Lawyers too have discovered that homosexuals have special needs that they appreciate being tended to by homosexual attorneys Im getting to be quite an expert at drawing up gay wills said George Terzian who has had his own practice for nearly two years Clients often start out thinking they merely need wills then progress to more complicated property insurance and tax matters As do unmarried heterosexual couples homosexual couples need legal contracts more than married ones do precisely because married people are covered by laws that they are not Thus lawyers draw up wills in which a lover becomes the heir and also designs statements of joint ownerships of weekend homes among other things In life insurance special provisions are made for a lover Why would homosexuals choose him over an equally competent straight lawyer Its like any minority group Mr Terzian said Theres a tremendous bond Psychologically its more important than the law part They dont understand when they first get here how much legal I help I can give them But they feel they can be much more cpen about themselves I The same kind of services and businesseS have blossomed recently among lesbians as they have among homosexual men Many women prefer the term lesbian arguing that the slang gay usually thought of as meaning male Thus there Is a lesbian switchboard newsletter bookstores restaurants and political groups as well rs a worclcmouth list of rectors lawyers pychatrists and stock broker Nevertheless some lesbian 121 leN Outbreaks of Disease Found Male Indifference Cited admit they have a larger problem of Invisibility to overcome than homosexual men have The network has really escalated in the past three years said Ginny Apuzzo of the National Gay Rights Lobby Washingtonbased group Yet fewer prominent women have come out because they have more to lose and less to gain They can gain es much by being just feminists Major groups such as the National Gay Task Force have made it a point to have equal male and female leaders Nevertheless while lesbians may support male homosexual groups and causes they do not always agree All we have in common is samesex preference noted Adrienne Scott a leader of the yearold Gay Rights National Lobby and a former editor of Blueboy a slick magazine sometimes referred to as Playboy for Gays There are many gay men who cant relate to women and lesbians who cant relate to men she said There are lesbian separatist groups that will not join in gay pride demonstrations Some lesbians have also been distressed at male indifference to the womens movement We come into the gay movement with an intellectual and emotional perspective that comes out of the feminist movement said Ginny Apuzzo Theres real problem with many lesbian feminists when men choose to live and die with gay rights alone Its an uphill struggle for the women to be heard in the homosexual rights movement she acknowledged Moreover according to Betty Powell a member of the New York State Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights lesbians still threaten many women in the feminist movement Thats still not resolved Indeed there are serious divisions within the homosexual population in New York not just between men and women but between old and young moderates and radicals the wealthy and the poor Beyond this there is whats thought to he the huge reservoir of closet gays men and women who still will not write out a check to an organization with gay in the title who insist newspapers be sent in plain brown wrappers or who pimply feel that disclosing their sexual preference to the general public will endanger their jobs home and family In addition there are those such as the priest from an Episcopal church the trustee of Congregation Beth Simchat Torah the honiosexual father engaged in a custody battle over a child who participate in gay rights activities but prefer not to have their names published Too much exposure they fear would hurt their reputations because of stillexisting biases in the straight world Often in recent months homosexuals who come out have been pleasantly surprised about the benign response Six months ago you wouldnt have caught me on television for anything Mr Schiff said He did appear his neighbors in the small town in Connecticut where he has a weekend house saw him and the posDistress thought it was simply interestin7 he related laughing However Mr Schiffs willingness to liccent the new actvism is not universal Many Said to Stay Silent Theres a whole generation in their 40s and 50s that has always played the role of trying to assimilate in the straight world he noted Militant groups like the Gay Activist Alliance continue to stage demonstrations more than a dozen in the last monthwhich some moderates feel are counterproductive The group marched recently to protest portrayals of homosexuals on the television series Soap an antihomosexual sign in Geordies an East Side singles bar and President Carters stand on human rights since it failed to mention homosexuals When all the polite tactics fail we have to do the more confrontational things Mr Kennedy argued The point is to show people who offend the gay community that they cant get away with it Despite the relative freedom homosexuals have in New York all believe more needs to be done Both Mr Kennedy and Mr Livingston want either a homosexual group or city government inspectors to crack down on bars bathhouses and afterhours clubs that are firetraps Nine men were killed May 25 in a fire at the Everard Baths in Manhattan Everybody is optimistic that the antidiscrimination ordinance can be passed by the City Council since its principal opponent Councilman Matthew J Troy Jr was defeated in the Democratic primary The measure has the enthusiastic support of Mr Koch Other activists are talking about homosexual addiction alcoholism and venerealdisease centers sponsored by the government for poor people who feel uncomfortable in heterosexual clinics A developer in California is planning what is billed as the first male homosexual retirement home Lesbians in New York envision a lesbian Workmans Circle for the same purpose Even so concern lingers about an antihomosexual backlash which activists see as part of a national conservative backlash also aimed at school desegregation the Equal Rights Amendment and abortions Gay teachers honestly feel oppressed said Marc Rubin of the Gay Teachers Association a week before the United States Supreme Court refused to review two state rulings allowing teachers to be dismissed on grounds of homosexuality Its almost a paranoia The American Psychiatric Association denounced the court decision strengthening its stand first taken only fcur years ago that samesex preference is not a sickness The efforts to frighten citizens into fear of the influence of homosexuals on our children are utterly without scientific foundation and the efforts should be combated by all citizens of good will Jack Weinberg president of the association said

The Martha Movement: Growing Advocate for Homemakers,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/29/archives/the-martha-movement-drawing-advocate-for-homemakers.html,Jinx Melia aged 40 wife mother teacher of management skills to women and founder of the Martha Movement emerged last weekend from yet another of the rapidly accelerating number of conferences about what she calls the nature of the homemaking bust Mrs Melia was frustrated because she felt the wrong people were speaking sociologists economists writers tle professionals We homemakers are always being talked to she said Our opinions are never asked She wants to give a voice to 60 million American women who identify themselves  often defensively  as housewives or homemakers and the Martha Movement was started in May 1976 to provide that voice Based in Arlington Va where Mrs Melia lives it claims 6500 members in 75 chapters in all 50 states On its board are Eleanor McGovern wife of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota the Democratic candidate for President in 1972 and Yvonne Braithwaite Burke Democrat of California According to Mrs Melia women are joining at the rate of a hundred a week paying 5 yearly dues  Filling a Gap The Marthas want to express what the homemaker is doing right how she can enjoy it more and have others respect her within and without the walls of a house Marthas are emerging to fill the gap between Mara bel Morgans Total Woman who devotes herself slavishly and singlemindedly to the pursuit of her husbands happiness and the extreme feminist The movement Mrs Melia directs is named for the biblical Martha who is contrasted with her sister Mary in the 10th chapter of Luke Martha invites Jesus into their home and then becomes distracted by domestic chores while Mary sits at the Lords feet to listen to his philosophy When Martha complains that her sister should help her Tesus gently suggests that Mary has chosen the better role The parable is ambivalent and Jesus certainly gives credit to Martha but we feel that most of todays attention is to the Marys with Martha continuing unrecognized says one of the groups leaflets Were anything but divisiveMarys out in the world Marthas at home Mrs Melia says Were neither radical feminism nor Total Woman We want to strengthen our marriages raise our children keep our wits and our sense of worth make money when we need to and develop emotional social and financial nondependence Martha Matters is the organizations motto and the name of its monthly informationsharing newsletter a forum for and about homemakers and one of the services covered by the 5 dues Outside financing has also come to the Marthas from the Equitable Life Assurance Society and the Avon cosmetics company through its foundation Besides the newsletter there is an intouch service a nationwide tollfree telephone number 8003364549 for Martha Movement Callers can be put in touch with Marthas all over the country to discuss needs ask help in an emergency find out how homemakers can be more influential in a community Intouch also includes a mail chain Mary Hunter the groups administrative director says the chain is equipped to respond to the 200 to 300 people a week who write to say My husband doesnt appreciate me my kids dont or My children have grown up and I dont feel Im worth anything the lack of selfworth is an underlying dread in all these letters Mrs Melia is just as quick to expound on what the Martha Movement is not She includes the following A religious movement although it takes its name from the Bible A lobbying organization although it wishes to inform homemakers about any proposed laws affecting them whatever their interests may be An antifeminist protest Women everywhere are beneficiaries of the feminist movement Mrs Melia says From establishing a womans credit history to developing awareness of shared responsibilities the feminist movement is recognized as the most significant social movement of the 70s A political activity We are a national membership organization that exists to meet the needs of the homemakers and that has no political or ideological stand she says The kindred souls in my book are those who belong to the National Congress of Neighborhood Womenwhich has its roots in Brooklyn and the white ethnic working class The Martha Movement has been fiercely criticized by women activists and its leader called a phony and a coward for taking no position on the equal rights amendment or abortion two issues that inflamed passions at virtually every one of the state womens meetings this year The meetings elected 1442 delegates to travel expenses paid to the National Womens Conference to be held in Houston from Nov 18 to 21 Although Mrs Melia was not among those women elected at the meetings she plans to go to Houston as a delegateatlarge paying her own way She along with hundreds of other women was selected by the National Commission of the Observance of International Womens Year headed by Bella S Abzug The commission was mandated by Congressional law to make sure that the immense diversity of American women was represented at Houston I am very concerned that two very powerful factionscall it left and right if you willare going to Houston with agendas each seeing the other side armed for disruption Mrs Melia said We want to help bring both sides together to present a united front to work to address the same deep needs We do not see any women as the enemy Bob Gass We want to strengthen our marriages raise our children keep our wits and our sense of worth and develop emotional social and financial independence Jinx Melia

cases not so proper are taking in stride the ups and downs of autumn life in the nations fourth largest city At different sometimes overlapping social strata Philadelphians and their suburban neighbors are doing what they can about some things and talking about the rest There is always talk about New York City Radio commercials for a Manhattan hotel invite Philadelphians to spend a weekend in New York City when all the New Yorkers are in the country But after the Phillies lost the National League pennant to the Los Angeles Dodgers many fans here rooted vehemently against the Yankees in the World Series Local newspapers proudly published stories about Reggie Jacksons father who operates a tailor shop here The Inquirers World Series editorial however called the winners the Bad News

Kelly is in town running the family masonry business But in recent weeks the familys fortunes have attracted unusual attention through the publication of a new book Those Philadelphia Kellys With a Touch of Grace by Arthur H Lewis Mr Kelly said he is not bothered by the hooks portrayal of him as an aging playboy athlete once dominated by his late father and still dominated by his mother although he is 50 years old Mr Kelly acknowledged that his mother helped kill his ambition to be Mayor of Philadelphia in 1975 but said in an interview that he might still run some day a decision that would mean Id have to clean up my act  In a recent City Council discussion of prostitution Mr Kelly noted that living a bachelor life in the center of the city he had never been approached on the street He was not upset he said when The Evening Bulletin published a frontpage article based on interviews with streetwalkers asking them if they would accept MT Kelly as a client The prevailing opinion in the industry seemed to be that Mr Kelly while unknown to its practitioners would be an acceptable client Mr Kelly said his problems with writers usually arose because people sent to interview him had no interest in sports and could not understand that while he goes to many football basketball and hockey games and still rows in shell races on the Schuylkill on weekends he also goes to the opera occasionally and is a member of the board of the Pennsylvania Ballet He said a veteran politician once told him Kelly your problem is that you talk too much and youre too honest  Another Philadelphian

Article 16 — No Title,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/30/archives/article-16-no-title.html,built a kitchen in the headquarters on Macnougat Street They would wait for him there at night and then feed him When Koch won the City Council seat carrying every one of the Italian election districts that were supposed to belong to DeSnit his MANA friends waited for him downtown When he showed up they shot off Roman candles Bleecker Street Ed is very Old World in his reactions Mr Pupolizio says Iles like a southern Italian When I needed you you came and so youre my friend when I needed you you didnt come so how can I say youre my friend Mr Popolizio is correct There are things Koch neither forgives nor forgets and because there are he has turned cold gone sour and dismissed people forever I believe in loyalty Koch says Several times Ive counted on people and then found they didnt measure up Thats traumatic for me If Im betrayed Ill never forget it Its not acceptable for close political friends and associates to betray me Its unforgivable When Im betrayed its as if that person is dead as far as Im concerned Ill engage in all the civilities but Ill try to walk around that person If I get into a room with that person Ill try not to see him Its as if that person no longer exists This is strong stuff and it is one of the things that comes out of having a private life and a public life that have become one and inseparable Koch seems to define the contours of his existence by applause and by acclamation and for years now he has been approaching voters and asking How am doing Am I doing all right There is a certain charm in this but also a suggestion that Koch more so than most politicians really does measure himself by what others say Sometimes he must bleed Here he is now recalling the controversy over the construction of a lowincome housing project in Forest Hills In 1971 I stood up and said that you cannot put a lowincome housing project in a middleclass neighborhood without destroying the neighborhood Boy the guff I took then The Lexington Democratic Club censured me They censured me The East Side The East Side is for lowincome projects just so theyre built in Forest Hills Now this wasnt really a bet rayal the censure it was a political thing But when Mark Siegel who was the leader of the Lexington Club for the Assembly stood at every subway stop with his opponent I knew his opponent would lose but I had to do it I believe that if a guy is out to destroy me then I do something about it And here is Koch on John Lindsay who among other things refused to support him against Whitney North Seymour Jr in the House race in 1968 after Koch had supported Lindsay for Mayor in 1965 Lindsay Please dont ever compare me to Lindsay He had the attention span of a gnat He was more interested in the ribboncutting the adulation With me people can say lie made it Hes one of Ours I dont mean just the Jews I mean people My background isnt St Pauls Its not noblesse oblige My parents are Polish Jews know it sounds like sophomoric klutz But I want to give something back to my country After he was elected to the City Council in 1966 his friends began to speculate about Kochs running for Mayor They would gather at Kochs apartment on Saturdays at noon and he would offer them cold cuts and wine Then they would talk On Friday afternoons people went to Dan Wolfs office at The Village Voice and talked there The night before some of them might have been at the home of Mary Perot Nichols who was the city editor of The Voice and who was also running something of a political salon Koch had been elected to the House in 1968 but by the next year there was speculation that he might run for President of the City Council while Herman Badillo ran for Mayor Koch did not do this but in 1973 full of hope he announced for Mayor himself j He raised 125000 spent most  dropped out of the campaign some 45 days after he had entered it The New Democratic Coalition had not backed him the press had not taken him seriously so many of his old friends had as they say in politics gone against him Koch was unhappy and it was not until 1975 that anyone heard him talk about running for Mayor again Meanwhile of course there was Congress By almost everyones reckoning Koch was doing well in the House winning his seat in successive elections with 62 70 76 and 75 percent of the vote and becoming probably the bestliked and most effective member of the New York delegation In 1973 he persuaded the conservative Barry Goldwater Jr an Arizona Republican to cosponsor a privacy bill The bill passed as the Federal Privacy Act in 1979 allows citizens to inspect Government files that relate to themselves Koch also worked for Federal subsidies for mass transit introduced a bill to provide home health care for the elderly fought passionately for aid to Israel helped to get the quota lifted on the emigration here of Soviet Jews and introduced legislation that led to the establishment of the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse in 1970 In this last effort he enlisted the support of William F Buckley Jr Koch has always done well with conservatives and consistently now he talks about how much easier they are to get along with and how much more full of rectitude they are than liberals It is one of Kochs anomalies It may also mean From 1969 through 1976 Kochs voting record was rated at 91100 percent by Americans for Democratic Action and at 91 percent by the AFLC10s Committee on Political Education You cannot vote much more liberal than that but frequently now Koch sounds like a conserva tive and increasingly he speaks ill of liberals This is not necessarily political expediency it may not even be a suggestion made to Koch by David Garth unlikely as it is that Mr Garth would ever discourage it It is even possible that the newly perceived picture of Koch as a man of the center may have some substance The death penalty for example became an issue in the campaign and Koch said he was for it His critics saw a certain deceit in a man with a nearly 100 percent ADA rating being for the death penalty but Kochs record shows that he supported it at least as early as 1970 I love the East Side Koch says but I get 200 letters a day and the letters say Save the whales Save the porpoises Save the Jews in that order I can tell youto be for the death penalty isnt popular in my district Moreover Koch goes out of his way if not to denigrate then at least to separate himself from other liberals You show me a reformer and Ill say whats new he says or I call myself a liberal with sanity That drives the exotics up the wall The exoticswhen I first used that word the New Democratic Coalition went crazy or Im not knee jerk never knee jerk or I support the right to abortion But the proabortionists theyre so tough I dont really like them And so on Koch works hard at this Still in the beginning when only 6 percent of the Democratic voters were supposed to know him Kochs image was decidedly kneejerk In contrast to 1973 however Koch had 250000 in the bank when he announced and he had Garth and Bess Myerson Garth says he looked at the polls dismissed the 6 percent factor and looked instead at Bella Abzug While it was true that virtually all the Democrats knew her only 30 percent of them seemed to like her Therefore most Democrats did not like her It was the same with Beame and pondering this Garth knew that Koch had a chance Mostly Garth worried about Mario Cuomo Mario had the best ethnic split in the primarya black

Governor's Race: 16 Names on Ballot,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/30/archives/new-jersey-weekly-governors-race-16-names-on-ballot-governors-race.html,TRENTON VOTERS going to the polls on Nov 8 will have a choice of a record number of candidates in the race for Governor with the names of 16 persons listed on the ballot During recent gubernatorial elections the number of candidates from minor parties has steadily increased as more and more persons found it easier to get the required 800 signatures on a nominating ballot and thus qualify to have their names enshrined in the states political record book Since the turn of the century there usually have been five or six candidates listed on the gubernatorial ballot but in some years special parties also have come into being Such parties have been based on issues ranging from Plenty for Everybody State Soldiers Bonus and Prosperity With Liberty to Veterans Choice The 18 candidates on the ballot for Governor this year are four more than in 1973 and more than double the seven listed in 1969 There would have been even more if the Secretary of State had not invalidated the petition of the Communist Party candidate 23yearold Charles Spektor of Clifton who did not meet the constitutional age requirement at least 30 and if some of the independent candidates including State Senator Anthony Imperiale had not withdrawn from the race Although the Democratic incumbent Governor Byrne and his Republican rival State Senator Raymond H Bateman of Somerville have dominated the newspaper coverage of the forthcoming elections the television media has found that the requirement of equal time has forced it to search out the minor candidates and give their views a public airing Despite the number of candidates the race that counts is the one between Governor Byrne and Senator Bateman That contest appears to be one of the closest in history with Mr Byrne and Mr Bateman in a virtual tie in the closing weeks of the campaign A New York TimesChannel 2 poll conducted by telephone between Oct 15 and 19 indicated that the Governor who was a decided underdog a month ago may have picked up momentum in his bid for reelection Nov 8 One of the minor candidates John F Donato a 48yearold physician from Newark is running on the slogan Axe the Tax He has taken a strong stand in favor of openness and honesty in government and advocates mandatory spending limitations minimal taxation and maximum efficiency Francis W Flowers an inventor and manufacturer from Brooklawn in Camden County is opposed to the state income tax He would finance the states budget by increasing employment through the creation of new businesses The 55yearold Mr Flowers is a former president of the Brooklawn Board of Education He has rented large trucktrailers on which he has emblazoned his name and picture and has strategically placed them on main roads and highways to get his message across to the motoring public Mr Flowers favors greater freedom of information and public disclosure of the finances of politicians He urges voters to declare your independence Bill Gahres is a 64yearold retired electrical contractor and locksmith from Barnegat He is running on the Right to Die slogan and strongly supports the right of the public to sign binding living wills  Such a will would permit a terminally ill person to die without resorting to the use of extraordinary lifesustaining equipment Mr Gahres also supports capital punishment and a modified state income tax Robert Gantaume of Paramus says that if elected Governor he will not press for reenactment of the income tax The 55yearold supervisor for the New York Telephone Company favors a reduction of state government spending and would institute improvement of the services rendered to the public His slogan is Grass Roots Jasper C Gould of Bernardsville is a retired electrician who advocates streamlining the government and the election of judges He is 65 years old and is running on the Liberty and Justice for All slogan Chester Grabowski of Clifton has chosen the slogan Independents for All He is opposed to the income tax which he would replace with a 1cent sales tax on all commodities Mr Grabowski is 52 and the publisher of The PostEagle a PolishAmerican newspaper As an ethnic candidate he says he would do away with all discrimination eliminate bilingual education abolish busing and restrict state hiring to residents of New Jersey Lief Johnson of Orange is a familiar figure in the halls of the State House in Trenton where he advocates to all who will listen the positions of the Labor Party These include opposition to decriminalization of marijuana and a strong advocacy of the development of fusion energy and other forms of energy to stimulate economic growth Julius Levin of Haddon Heights the candidate of the Socialist Labor Party has been vying for the Governors seat for the last 10 years If elected he would opt for the elimination of the present form of government and replace it with a wholly democratic industrial government originating from within the working class According to Mr Levin all social ills of society emanate from the capitalistic system which he says should be abolished Angelo S Massaro of Kearny is the representative of the Populus Party and in 1973 he received 1898 votes of the more than two million cast in the gubernatorial election He is 61 a mechanical designer and supports full employment an improved educational system compulsory retirement a fulltime Legislature and uniform penalties and enforcement of all violators of the law Richard D McAleer of Hoboken is a disabled veteran who ran unsuccessfully for the State Senate in 1970 He is a teacher of the handicapped and would overhaul the welfare system and workmens compensation program Chauncey E McSpiritt of North Bergen is listed on the ballot under the slogan Cheap Chauncey Upstart He is opposed to the sales tax the income tax drilling for oil in the Baltimore Canyon off the Jersey coast abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment Mr McSpiritt is 54 and operates a medicaltesting laboratory He advocates help for the elderly a cleanup of the environment and job training for youth Frank Primich of North Bergen is a candidate of the Libertarian Party and is dedicated to limited governmental control over the lives of individuals He advocates economic and individual rights and feels that governments role is solely to protect those rights He is 56 and a physician specializing in obstetrics and gynecology Paul B Rizzo of Trenton is a retired textile inspector for the Federal Gov ernment Also 56 he is opposed to both the sales tax and the income levy He would promote full employment and would encourage business to locate in the Garden State William Zsidisin of Bayonne is running on the One for All slogan and would stimulate the economy by promoting the growth of business and industry in the state The 43yearold Mr Zsidisin is an engineer for Jersey City He would cut government spending in the areas of general state operations and education and he advocates increased research into the means of developing cheap abundant energy Although many of these candidates are evidently serious in their attempts to gain public office their efforts may well be in vain In the 1973 gubernatorial elections the 10 minorparty candidates collected a total of 31161 votes or fewer than 15 percent of the total number cast The same holds true for the 1969 election when five minorparty candidates got just over 55000 votes of the 23 million cast 
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/31/archives/letters.html,To the Editor Following a number of articles in your paper regarding the party conferences in the United Kingdom we write to suggest some discussion might be appropriate regarding the House of Commons It seems to us that both in the United States and Great Britain the demands of a technological society have subverted the political purpose and constitutional intention of the main legislative machinery until it is either ignored or acts merely to endorse decisions taken by executive and bureaucracy We wish to dwell on the United Kingdom Parliament but it may be of interest to your American readers to consider whether this country is not following the same path A gentlemens agreement in Britain on many issues amongst civil servants and government officials prevents the Commons from being properly involved or even informed an national and international affairs before the vital decisions are reached Society we are told is so complex that each major issue has to be dealt with by specialists far removed from Westminster Crucial decisions are taken or deferred by bureaucrats in Whitehall or Brussels bureaucrats who have no direct authority from the electorate Politicians no longer see a parliamentary career as adequate reward for ambition If indeed the Palace of Westminster is irrelevant to late 20thcentury Britain then it should be abolishedthe United Kingdom is all too encumbered by tiresome anachronisms On the other hand if it should be the focus of political activity as we believe then it ought to reestablish its importance in the power structure We realize of course that the Commons is incapable of doing this unaidedthe party system has so drained the initiative and authority of Parliament over countless decades that any resurgence will not be spontaneous There are several methods by which change may be rendered and the party conferences should have debated theses If the parties are to broaden the basis of their support by for example adopting a proportional representation election system which would enable interest groups to form within Parliament instead of on the outside the Commons would again be established as the focus of political life The pro portional representation system is not necessarily the remedy for Parliaments ills but it remains imperative that the decisionmaking body of the United Kingdom regain that power or we face government by the bureaucracies of Whitehall and Brussels influenced only by national pressure groups DAVID JESSOP GUY D LAFFERTY Glen Rock NJ Oct 21 1977 Wages and Standards To the Editor Your Oct 22 editorial entitled Burdensome Cargo of Regulation was cogently logical in stating that important industries are sapped of initiative by protective regulations leading to inefficiency and higher prices But in your discussion of regulation of industries you mentioned the DavisBacon Acts requiring prevailing rates for workers on federally assisted projects and then went on to say that these rates were the highest union wages paid even when the nearest union local is 50 miles away As a contractor employing union men and as an individual involved in plumbing association activity throughout the country may I differ emphatically on two counts First the prevailing rate does not inhibit competition in any way among the contractors who must bid for the projects on the basis of low hid awards The prevailing rate is a set of rules similar to standards set by the architects plans indicating in great detail the structure to be built The prevailing rate prevents unscrupulous contractors from cheating by use of mediocre workmen as well as mediocre material to produce a mediocre product at public expense Moreover the contracting agency is under no obligation to set the union scale as the prevailing rate There are localities where union locals are minimal compared to nonunion men In those cases the local contractor can submit verified statements indicating the actual real average wage paid in various trades and those rates will be and must be accepted by the local authorities under DavisBacon regulations Your editorial castigated and quite correctly promulgation of comforting and protective walls where industries nestle and grow fatbut you certainly cannot castigate reference standards by government which industries and their employees must adhere to for the general welfare LEONARD X FARBMAN Brooklyn Oct 24 1977 Of Pregnancies and a Matter of Life and Death To the Editor Your Oct 19 news article summarizing a medical report that older women on contraceptive pills have an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease has enormous implications with regard to the current debate in Congress on the use of Government funds to pay for abortions The reported confirmation of previous information will lead many women to abandon the pill and accept the risk of less effective methods of contraception The result will be more fullterm pregnancies and maternal deaths Members of the House who have voted overwhelmingly to deny Medicaid benefits to women in need of abortions have apparently ignored the sociologic implications of their decision They should realize that pregnancy unwanted or not also has its risks there is a real albeit small threat to the life of women at the time of childbirth Ready access to abortion is a matter of life and death the life of the mother and it is time that the majority of the people in this country having no moral aversion to abortion make it clear to legislators that they do not want women to be deprived of any personally acceptable opportunity to avoid an unnecessary premature death Possibly the legislators never had it explained to them in this way THOMAS C CHALMERS MD Bronxville NY Oct 20 1977 Restricted Outrage To the Editor The US stand on apartheid in South Africa does credit to our countrys stand on human rights At the same time failure to speak out on Russias denial of human rights in Czechoslovakia in Hungary and in the Baltic states as well as oppression of dissenters by other Communist states in Eastern Europe is certain to induce considerable cynicism in many Shall we believe there is one law for the powerful and another law for other nations JOSEPH H AARON Brooklyn Oct 21 1977 Retirement at 70 The Proper Exemption To the Editor Your Oct 21 editorial criticizing the Senates exemption of tenured college faculty from the mandatory retirement bill currently before the Congress indicates a lack of familiarity with the unique problems this worthwhile public policy creates for higher education institutions throughout our country First there is a special problem of Affirmative Action on the college campus since higher education was the first major area of national life to be made subject to implementation edicts from the Federal Government All higher educational institutions have in place plans to bring increased numbers of women and other minorilic policy creates for higher education ties to our faculties These plans are especially related to specific retirement normally at age 65 Here are two worthy public policies on a direct collision course If the 70year retirement level is mandated on higher education it will mean that Affirmative Action will be virtually eliminated for the next fiveyear period at most campuses It is difficult enough for colleges and universities to be able to consider new faculty positions given the current economic climate in the nation Further this arbitrary action without notice would decrease the opportunities already limited for young scholars to find positions in a tight market Secondly and probably more importantly tenure as it presently exists in most collegiate institutions is not renegotiable once granted It is virtually a worklife commitment by an institution to an individual until retirement Colleges make extensive searches to enable new people to fill academic posts which are open because a colleague is at or near retirement A Federal mandate coming without prior warning or advance planning time without even adequate Congressional hearings means that an institution will have increased personnel costs which it will find difficult to renegotiate This brings us to another publicpolicy objective the necessity of holding down tuition to remove economic circumstance as a barrier to higher education Duplicate personnel costs mandated by a higher retirement age will more than likely not be restored to institutions through special appropriations Thus the only recourse many will face will be to pass this added cost to already burdened parents and students HARRY A MARMION Southampton L I Oct 21 1977 The writer president of Southampton College of Long Island University is cheirman of Federal Relations Committee of Commission on Independent Colleges nod Universities On the Benefits of Meditation To the Editor On Oct 20 a Federal District Court in Newark barred the teaching of Transcendental Meditation TM in New Jersey schools on the grounds that the instruction was religious in nature In recent months the TM organization has also been promoting a controversial course of instruction which it claims leads to the ability to levitate fly without wings and to become invisible As a psychologist and researcher in the field of meditation I can attest to the benefits of meditation for many peoplewhether TM or the other recognized formsand thus share the concern of a number of investigators in this area about the impact of these new developments While the TM organization has often oversold its product as a panacea it was largely due to its persistent promoting that middleclass America was willing to sample the technique at all As a result meditative relaxation has become so well accepted in the United States that the presidents of such leading corporations as Monsanto and the Adolph Coors Co have permitted news media to quote them as saying that they themselves have derived significant benefits from itand eminent scientific journals have published impressive research on beneficial physiological changes during meditation Will the adverse TM publicity destroy all that has thus far been achieved for the meditative relaxation techniques in the West Clearly if we want to preserve the stressreducing benefits of meditation for our society we cannot afford to allow controversies engendered by the TM court decision or the levitationinvisibility program to obscure the fact that it has been demonstrated that meditative relaxation has a great deal of value Since there now exist a number of scientifically developed noncultic forms of meditation that ultimately can he taught by teachers within the school system by mental health professionals in hospitals and clinics and by relaxation specialists within industry concerns about the fate of a single meditation teaching organization now become obsolete As for those Americans who are practicing TM with beneficial results the overwhelming majority of them have been in no way involved with the religious implications of the TM cosmology Most of them learned the technique simply in order to obtain the benefits of deep relaxation If TM has helped them achieve this then they can continue practicing it with full confidence in its value What we must beware of is not to throw the baby out with the bathwater The new forms of meditative relaxation are now being taken seriously by many physicians and psychologists who looked askance at meditation when it was embedded in a cultist or religious context However these new forms could eventually play an important role in preventive health care PATRICIA CARRINGTON Princeton NJ Oct 25 1977 The writer author of Fredom in Meditation teaches psychology at Princeton University
Conferees Ease the Deadlock on Medicaid Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/01/archives/conferees-ease-the-deadlock-on-medicaid-abortions.html,WASHINGTON Oct 31House and Senate conferees took their first major step today toward breaking a fourmonth deadlock on abortions financed by Medicaid by reaching tentative agreement on treatment for victims of rape and incest A stalemate persisted however on whether to allow Medicaidpaid abortions in those cases in which serious health damage to the mother would result if a pregnancy were carried to term The conferees agreed to allow medical procedures such as dilation and curettage when necessary for the prompt treatment of the victims of rape or incest The House members of the conference gave up their previous insistence that those procedures be allowed only before the fact of pregnancy was established and only when those crimes were duly reported to law enforcement offices The House conferees also yielded on their earlier stand that only victims of forcible rape be allowed such procedures thereby allowing Medicaid coverage for victims of statutory rapeall women under 18 who engage in sexual intercourse even when they have given consent On June 17 the House approved a total ban on abortions paid for by Medicaid which it later modiified to the extent of exempting women whose life would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term On June 29 the Senate approved a ban on Medicaid abortions that cornpletely exemptedvictims of rape and incest as well as those cases in which it was medically necessarya term that the House conferees considered deliberately vague Almost Total Standoff t Since then each chamber has several times ratified its own positions and disapproved of those taken by the other house This has been reflected in an almost total standoff at the meetings of a HouseSenate conference whose members were appointed to reconcile the differences in the two versions Senator Edward W Brooke Republican of Massachusetts asked the House conferees to define the meaning of prompt in the treatment of victims of rape and incest Representative Robert H Michel of Illinois the Republican whip and ranking minority member among the House conferees replied that his understanding was that a woman could not wait until she missed her first period and then obtain the medical procedures George Mahon Democrat of Texas who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee attended the conference for the first time since the meetings began last July emphasizing the leaderships commitment to a speedy resolution of the stalemate Mark Gallagher lobbyist for the National Committee for a Human Life Amendment which is financed by the United States Catholic Conference an organization representing Roman Catholic bishops attended as an observer and privately indicated to the House conferees whether he found various Senate proposals acceptable At the outset Representative Daniel J Flood Democrat of Pennsylvania who is chairman of the House conferees stated what many observers considered to be the crux of the HouseSenate dispute on Medicaid abortions The Senate wishes to pay for as many abortions as possible Mr Flood said whereas the House wishes to pay for as few abortions as possible The deadlocked conference has stalled passage of 601 billion in Federal funds for the Department of Labor and the Department of Health Education and Welfare The Medicaid abortion ban was attached as a rider to the appropriations bill Senator Warren G Magnuson Democrat of Washington who is chairman of the Senate conferees proposed allowing Medicaid abortion when serious health damage would result if the pregnancy were carried to term Representative David R Obey Democrat of Wisconsin said that although he was sympathetic to the request the House will never accept any language that does not contain three wordspermanent physical and mother Mr Magnuson then modified his proposal to include serious permanent physical health damage to the mother Mr Mahon agreed that allowing Medicaid abortions in cases of potential damage to mental health provides such loophole that you couldnt get by with that The House conferees defeated by a 6to6 vote a proposal by Mr Obey to accept the Senate language after substituting the word grave for serious Its abortion on demand Mr Flood said The Senate conferees were clearly pleased however to take the rape and incest compromise offered by the House conferees Ellen Leitzer of the American Civil Liberties Union who was a spectator at the session told newsmen that onethird of the 11 million abortions last year were performed on women under the age of 18 These minors are considered to make up an even larger percentage of the 269000 women who had medical abortions The conferees had previously agreed to allow Medicaid abortions when the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term They also had agreed to allow Medicaid payments for drugs or devices to prevent implantation of the fertilized ovum or for medical procedures necessary for the termination of an ectopic pregnancy The conferees will meet tomorrow afternoon to try to resolve their last remaining disagreement whether to allow Medicaid abortions to protect the health as opposed to the life of a woman They will meet against a backdrop of a fastapproaching deadline as the two Federal departments are quickly running out of funds and a Senate determination not to provide additional temporary funds Such temporary financing was granted last month to tide over the Federal employees during the prolonged dispute

restrictions from the temporary money measure Under current law Medicaid funds may be used for abortions only when a mothers life would be endangered if the fetus was carried to term In effect this

Issues on the New York Ballot,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/04/archives/issues-on-the-new-york-ballot-a-justifiable-proposition-the-answer.html,New York State voters will be asked to decide ten separate issues next Tuesday including a proposition a question and eight amendments to the State Constitution They have been passed by the Legislature and now require ratification by referendum A Justifiable Proposition The propositionwhich will appear first on the ballot would authorize the state to issue over three years 750 million in bonds for investment in local projects to stimulate tourism manufacturing and other jobcreating activities The money could not be used on privately owned facilities This proposition has been challenged in the courts on the ground that economic development is not a single purpose as the Constitution requires for a bond issue Two courts agreed but the Court of Appeals has said it will not rule on the constitutional question until after the voting Even if the court rules it valid the proposition may not be wise Many challenge it on the practical ground that the Legislature has only loosely defined the kind of local projects that would qualify for state contributions Initially we were disappointed by the Governors failure to appoint the commission that would have to approve each grant He has now appointed it the members are widely representative and responsible Many nonetheless fear that politics will inevitably conquer prudence and that state funds are certain to be diverted to projects that produce not jobs but votes This danger is real but in our view the proposition now acludes an adequate review system There is great danger too in the still declining economy of the state and high rate of unemployment We recommend a YES vote The Answer to the Question No The question before the voters will be whether to convene a convention for the purpose of writing a new State Constitution If the voters answer Yes delegates would be elected next November to meet in 1979 The Constitution itself would then require the voters approval If the answer is No the call for a Constitutional convention would not again appear on the ballot for 20 yearsunless the Legislature requires it by special action Proponents of a new Constitution argue with justice that the present document is too long too detailed and inadequate in its authorization and control of local debt But such objections only demonstrate the desirability of a new Constitution they do not mean that the voters m approve it The most recent Constitutional convention in 1967 revealed deep division over the question of funding private schools with public money Article XI of the present Constitutionknown as the Blaine amendment forbids the use of public funds or property for religious schools Both friends and foes had learned to live with this provision but the possibility of basic change set both sides to jockeying over changes exacerbating the religious feeling that underlies the school question It is easy to guess that a new convention would revive the turmoil Likewise a convention would surely be divided over the question of abortion which would overshadow other business and make ratification impossible The practical way to amend the Constitution is by the present piecemeal system as exemplified by the eight amendments on this years ballot We urge a NO vote on the 1979 Constitutional convention The Eight Amendments AMENDMENT 1 to the present State Constitution would provide for the appointment rather than the election of judges of the Court of Appeals They would be named by the Governor with the Senates consent from a list screened by an expert panel The Governor the Chief Judge and the majority and minority leaders of both houses of the Legislature would select the panel The assumption in this reform is that the unworthy partisandealing that sometimes disgraces the nominating and election process would be eliminated The voters should permit a test of this hope Candidates for judicial office sometimes reveal their alltoocommon humanity in unseemly jockeying for votes Vote YES AMENDMENT 2 would provide for the appointment of a single administrator for all the state courts This should help in assigning judges where they are most needed and might speed the judicial process Vote YES AMENDMENT 3 would make it easier to examine allegations of misconduct against judges by eliminating the Court on the Judiciary and placing all of its functions in an expanded Commission on Judicial Conduct Vote YES AMENDMENT 4 would increase the dollar limit of civil cases which town city and village courts are permitted to adjudicate Experts on these matters complain that this would complicate a web of local and district courts that already resembles the administrative mechanisms of the Ottoman Empire They believe the whole system should be changed Vote NO AMENDMENT 5 would permit the state to increase pensions of widows and widowers of former employees who belonged to the state retirement system Since some of these people suffer severe hardship as inflation erodes their benefits simple justice dictates a YES vote AMENDMENT 6 would permit vacancies on boards of education to he filled by appointees until the next board election At present such interim appointments expire every Dec 31 leaving posts vacant for months or in the case of New York City local school boards for years because the board elections take place only at threeyear intervals Vote YES AMENDMENTS 7 and 8 would increase the borrowing capacity of the Job Development Authority and allow it to make loans for commercial purposes The authority claims to have helped private employers create more than 50000 jobs It has provided capital to supplement bank loans at interest rates that make expansion feasible It has not yet suffered a single default It addresses a vital need in the state Vote YES on both

A Relay forWomen's Rights Runs Into Southern Chivalry,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/04/archives/a-relay-for-womens-rights-runs-into-southern-chivalry-convention.html,BENTON Ala Nov 3The going is tough now for the runners who are relaying a flaming womens rights torch from Seneca Falls NY to Houston Back above the MasonDixon Line in New Haven and NeW York and Bryn Mawr there were people who cared people who lined the road and cheered Housewives politicians businessmen and athletes volunteered by the dozen for a turn at bearing the torch But this is Alabama deepest Dixie where male chauvinism is more revered than reviled There are few volunteer runners and fewer cheers Only fire ant nests and kudzu vines line the road Today was the day the torch traveled one of the most famous stretches of highway in the United States the 46mile leg of US 80 that cuts through this little crossroads on the way from Montgomery to Selma A dozen years ago the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr drew worldwide attention and sympathy when he led hundreds bf marchers along that stretch in an historic demonstration for black rights Todays demonstration for womens rights attracted a few idle stares from the of boys loafing around the cluster of gas stations on the edge of Benton The runners had to be imported from Auburn University 50 miles east of the starting point on Montgomerys outskirts Most tended toward indifference Somebody called up and asked our athletic department to come up with some runners said Cindy Monk a 19yearold junior hefting the heavy smoky brass torch at the beginning of her threemile leg Its fun to run But womens lib is no big deal for us Weve still got Southern gentlemen down here Thats the way we like it Convention Scheduled in Houston The 2612mile relay began Sept 29 in Seneca Falls where the first national womens convention was held in 1848 It will end in Houston on Nov 18 when another national convention is scheduled to begin The 1848 convention which drew 300 participants was concerned mainly with suffrage The Houston meeting which may draw 20000 participants will cover a wider range of concerns with special emphasis on abortion and the equal rights amendment The torch relay got off to an auspicious start Judy Carter one of President Carters daughtersinlaw ran the first mile There were cheers and speeches Two weeks later with relay teams averaging about 50 miles a day the torch arrived in Washington Margaret Costanza one of Mr Carters top aides left her White House desk to run a leg There were more cheers and speeches Across Potomac Trouble Started Then the torch was borne south across the Potomac River Thats when the trouble started for us said Catherine East a relay official after a wearing day on Alabamas highways and byways It got harder and harder to get publicity and runners except in big cities like Charlotte and Atlanta The South is tough country when comes to womens rights Of the 15 states that have rejected or failed to take action on the equal rights amendment 10 are in Dixie Texas is the only Southern state to act favorably Thirtyeight states must approve the amendment before next March for it to become operative although supporters are waging a campaign to extend the deadline Alabama has been the toughest state of all for the torch bearers The antiERA types somehow persuaded all our volunteers up around Birmingham not to take part Miss East said We finally got a track team to help Then we brought in a woman marathoner who clipped off 30 miles and got us back on schedule more or less Many of the relay runners in Alabama have been women and the sight of them panting past has drawn wolf whistles from truck drivers and sneers from many other women Takes Femininity Away Now what would a woman want to get involved in something like that for Jean Wright asked as a scantily clad runner passed through Prattville a town north of Montgomery Theres no law against it Mrs Wright continued But it sort of takes her femininity away I mean if she wants to climb telephone poles for a living well let her do it But that sure doesnt make her a woman I mean a real woman Sheila Parrish another Prattville resident saw the torch relay as just so much nonsense Look she added I want men to open doors for me and pull out chairs and tell me Im pretty Why should I want to run half way across this country with some old torch I dont want to be a man As todays runners neared Benton followed by an entourage of race officals in vans and cars Alabamas negative attitude toward the struggle for womens rights seemed to be taking its toll Along one deserted stretch of US 80 the runners were spotted plodding along without their heavy torch Diane Westhoven passing womens rights torch to Kat Milly on US Highway 80 yesterday between Selma and Montgomery Ala the highway on which the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr staged a historic civilrights march in 1965 Map shows route of the

"Senate, in Payroll Plight, Continues Abortion Curb",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/05/archives/senate-in-payroll-plight-continues-abortion-curb.html,WASHINGTON Nov 4Fearful of being blamed for payless paydays for more than 200000 employees of two Federal agencies the Senate grudgingly agreed today to a House proposal that conditioned continued funds for the agencies through Nov 30 upon continuation of a strict curb on the use of Medicaid funds to DRY for abortions Congress on the eve of a monthlong recess thereby postponed for four weeks efforts to resolve one of the longest and most intense disputes ever to divide the two chambers the dispute over the severity of a ban on Medicaid abortions The House seeks a continuation of the current law which bans the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions except when the womans life is endangered The Senate seeks a less restrictive rule that would allow Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest and when a woman would suffer severe and longlasting physical health damage The abortion curb is contained in a rider to a 601 billion appropriations measure for the Departments of Labor and of Health Education and Welfare for the fiscal year that began Oct 1 The abortion stalemate which has lasted four months has imperiled the salaries of more than 200000 employees as well as an additional 500000 people who rely upon grants and contracts from the two agencies A proposal to substitute the Senate language for the current law in the temporary financing measure was approved earlier in the day by an 11to10 vote of the Senate Appropriations Committee The senators yielded however after being informed that the House which a day before rejected a compromise proposal on the abortion issue voting instead to continue the financing and the current ban through Nov 30 had already gone home for the recess The senators failure to approve the temporary financing resolution therefore would have meant that the thousands of Government workers would not continue to get their paychecks The Senate then approved the House measure called a continuing resolution The voicevote approval came after House leaders assured the senators that no further postponements would be sought and that the leaders would use their prestige to seek a compromise on the abortion issue The House sent us a continuing resolution and went home takeitorleaveit Senator Warren G Magnuson Democrat of Washington the chairman of the Senate conferees told his colleagues Senators Lament Predicament Senator Edward W Brooke Republican of Massachusetts lamented that this months salaries of the Federal employees depended upon Senate concurrence with the House measure 1 would hope that we would not hold their pay hostage to this particular problem he said Senator Milton R Young Republican of North Dakota the ranking minority member of the Appropriations Committee also regretted that the House had placed the payroll problem squarely on the shoulders of the Senate The House has gone home and if we dont take this employees of Labor and HEW wont get their money Senator Young said Exchanges between the House and Senate began earlier in the day when Senator Magnuson met briefly with some of the House conferees Before the meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee Senator Magnuson speaking of the Senates concessions told Representative George Mahon Democrat of Texas chairman of the House Appropriations Committee Weve walked the last mile Representative Mahon then told the senators that because of parliamentary difficulties the House would be unable to act if the Senate changed the House proposal in any way Therefore he said the 235000 employees of the two agencies would not be paid At the committee session Senator Birch Bayh Democrat of Indiana said If we dont decide that were going to stand up now to all intents and purposes the conference is over Its only a question of whether people will be without their paychecks the week before Thanksgiving or the week before Christmas Senator Robert C Byrd of West Virginla the majority leader told the committee that the Senate would be blamed if Federal employees went without their paychecks because of the Senates insistence on its position
"TV's ‘I, Claudius’ Will Test the Boundaries Of Public Broadcasting",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/06/archives/tvs-i-claudius-will-test-the-boundaries-of-public-broadcasting-i.html,This seems to be a year for stretching the boundaries of what is acceptable for television Before the season began ABCTV had Its ordeal with Soap a sex oriented comeay series that got religious groups and some network affiliates in a lather over its preoccupation with adultery sexual promiscuity impotency and transvestism A campaign was successfully mounted to drive a number of advertisers off the series but it failed to drive the show itself off the air Nait the stations df the Public Broadcasting Service are bracing for possible outcry by moral watchdogs against I Claudius a 12part series on the dissolute life in ancient Rome from the years 24 BC to 54 AD For sex and violence content the British Broadcasting Corporation program exceeds anything distributed nationally on American public television to date and reduces Soap to a sliver While none of the PBS affiliates has refused to carry I Claudius there is uneasiness in some parts of the country about how viewers may react to it The series begins on WNET 13 tonight Essentially a drama of political and moral corruption the series illuminates the lust for power and flesh that prevailed during the reistns of the four ern perors of Rome who followed Julius Caesar and preceded Nero It moves from the murderous machinations during the reign of Augustus that brought Tiberius next to power to the bizarre times of the insane Caligula to the era of Claudius the oncepresumed court idiot that sets the stage for the fall of the Roman Empire I Claudius which stars Derek Jacobi John Hurt Brian Blessed and Sian Phillips debuted on BBC2 a year ago won a raft of trophies that are the British equivalents of Emmy awards and has been repeated in the United Kingdom several times since The series stirred no significant protest in that country but racy programming has always gone down more easily on British television than it has here What makes the 12 hours of I Claudius troublesome to public television stations here is that the political tale is played against the background of incest prostitution adultery rape sex tournaments and sex orgies There are also several seduction scenes instances of toplessness the peregrinations of nymphomaniac moments of homosexual loveplay and a gruesome abortion These are interlarded with beheadings assassinations gladiator games murder by sword and murder by poison Yet for all this an apologist for I Claudius put it accurately when she said No matter how it sounds it aint 42 Street Indeed it does injustice to I Claudius to speak of it and Soap in the same context Soap is the work of an independent team of Hollywood producers and writers who have Nielsen ratings in mind and nothing in particular to say I Claudius is drawn from two celebrated novelsI Claudius and Claudius the Godby the estimable poet and essayist Robert Graves and the adaptation by Jack Pulman seeks to preserve the authors intended parallels to our times Moreover the Graves works have the validity of being based on the historical writings of Suetonius and Pliny  If it is necessary to further separate the two shows Soap means to shock while I Claudius in the BBC2 production seems in most instances to try very hard not to The sex and violence belong to the historical fabric All that the two programs have in common is that they have jarredfor approximately the same reasons and in the same yearthe program acceptance criteria of commercial and public television Regular viewers of WNET 13 in New York may wonder why I Claudius would be a source of concern at all They very likely have seen on the local station such sexually candid programs as Emile Zolas Nana JeanPaul Sartres The Roads to Freedom and Bruce Jay Friedmans Steambath few years ago the station also carried demonstration of acupuncture on which the buxom patient was displayed in the interest of science in all her natural glory from the neck to her trim ankles But WNET is not PBS WNET is only one station and an atypical onein the national Public Television System As one of relatively few communityoperated stations and the principal outlet for the largest and most sophisticated metropolitan area it has over the years maintained a higher degree of permissiveness than most public television stations around the country PBS the national distribution system did not carry Nana Roads to Freedom or the acupuncture show leaving those programs to the discretion of local stations It did carry Steambath eventually but only after the drama had played twice on the bolder stations without explosive consequences If PBS has earned a reputation for puritanism it comes from having to serve about 270 public television stations each concerned with the sensibilities of the people of its locale Among the PBS affiliates are stations in the Bible Belt But even more inhibiting is the fact that many PBS stations are owned and operated by state governments Wisconsin Maryland Mississippi and New Hampshire for example or by universities and public school systems Generally none of these governmental or institutional owners wishes to become involved with or held responsible for putting on the air programs that may be controversial for showing nudity for using blasphemous or obscene language or for dealing excessively with sexual themes I Claudius therefore is a chancy venture for American public television and one that got on the national servicethrough the highly regarded Masterpiece Theater serieson sheer merit Said Lawrence K Grossman president of PBS It is historically accurate written by a true artist and beautifully mounted and performed These are grounds for accepting it I dont know on what grounds we could have legitimately declined  Nevertheless as a safeguard against viewing by children PBS is sending out alternative programmingrepeats of earlier seriesto stations that normally schedule a showing of Masterpiece Theater in the afternoons The regular nighttime presentations contain introductory notes by Alistair Cooke which alert viewers to the nature of the material I think I ought to say at the start Mr Cooke says in introducing the first episode that some people are going to be more shocked by this series than by most of the dramas weve shown on Masterpiece Theater But Robert Graves did not make it more cruel or more gamy than the manuscript of Suetonius from which he worked   Violence is not shown just for titillation Getting the program past the PBS acceptance standards was one hurdle the series faced in the United States Another was to win the approval of the Mobil Oil Corporation the underwriter of Masterpiece Theater for all its seven years In the past Masterpiece Theater has presented such sale miniseries as Upstairs Downstairs The Forsyte Saga The Last of the Mohicans and Dickens of London And as a rule sponsoring corporations generally eschew any identification with controversy on commercial or public television this Is the reason most in vestigative documentaries and serious original dramas on television go begging for advertising support Joan Sullivan the executive at Bostons WGBHTV who puts together the Masterpiece Theater package advised Mobil that I Claudius was likely to create controversy and that the company might not want to associate its funding signature with a program so steeped in violence and sty Miss Sullivan who became interested in the series even before it was produced and knew she wanted to buy it for this country when she saw the finished work noted in a memo to Mobil that WGBH would try to find another way to present the series if I Claudius was considered unsuitable for Masterpiece Theater But Herbert Schmertz vice president of public affairs for Mobil said he had no reservations at all about I Claudius Theres no question that its adult fare but theres a big difference between adult and controversial would be surprised if it were controversial he remarked He added that he expected Mobil to gain from the presentation the satis faction of providing televison extraordinary quality as well as an identification with that quality Indeed Mobils underwriting of public television programs begun at the start of the energy crisis generally has been designed to make a favorable impression on opinion leaders rather than to sell its petroleum products to mass audiences Mobil no doubt was comforted also by the fact that the sex and violence in I Claudius is set around 2000 years ago As Miss Sullivan observed There is some insulation from the historical distance All the same for the American presentation of I Claudius Miss Sullivan has been busy making editsnot censorial cuts she insists but merely deletions of frames here and there usually of no more than five seconds duration She is doing this she says without prompting from Mobil to make slightly less graphic the scenes that would probably be found most offensive in this country A sequence of barebreasted dancers in the opening scene for example was shortened Why I felt should we chase off the people who would otherwise enjoy the wit the satire and the spectacle of the whole series with a dance scene right at the start that was longer than it had to be anyway Miss Sullivan remarked Nothing is lost in terms of the drama here or in any of the other cuts Ive made She also edited out a coarse comment by a Roman soldier on the Virgin Birth a line in which one soldier orders another to rape a child the bloody frames in which an infant is stabbed to death and some bedroom shots in which the cameras look down on two nude bodies making love  These deletions are judgments made from a sense of responsibility to a mass audience The shots would be disturbing to people in some parts of the country Miss Sullivan said The scenes are powerful enough without the extensive permissiveness Miss Sullivan confessed also to rearranging a scene in which Caligula thinking in his madness he is Zeus attempts to pluck his own unborn child from his sisters womb and to eat the fetus I really found that unnecessary and sickmaking  Miss Sullivan said The Idea comes across just the same Interestingly this was a scene that the BBC had already toned down from the script by Mr Pulman much to the annoyance of the author of the adaptation Unlike American production companies which farm out episodes of series to a number of writers BBC2 insists on having all the scripts written by a single person to preserve the style and maintain an evenness of quality Mr Pulman took exception to the BBCs cutting his script for the scenes finale which was to have been a long shot showing the butchered woman hanging on a chariot after the abortion I think that was a mistake he said because it left us with the horror of Caligula with blood on his beard and deprived us of the pity for that silly girl his sister who knew he was mad and played up to him without realizing until the end what he was going to do to her Mr Pulman contended that the absence of pity diminished the meaning and import of the scene Wherever possible Mr Pulman noted he has tried to give dramatic purpose to the necessary scenes of sex or violenceoften to develop characterso that they would not be gratuitous For example a scene that shows how the mad Caligula has turned the palace into a brothel is turned into a device to underscore the humanity of Claudius The orgy itself the adapter points out falls into the background of a situation in which Claudius helps the terrified young wife of a senator escape from being forced into prostitution o Of the various orgies Mr Pulman said Youve got to deal with them somehow or other in portraying life in ancient Rome Here and there you see a naked breast but in fact I think you see nothing that to a reasonably intelligent adult is offensive You see people lying around and holding each other people playing and there is an atmosphere an orgiastic atmosphere But in fact you dont see a detail We let the viewer supply his imagination which is quite right and proper because in the end thats not whats important about the scene Mr Pulman whose credits also include the Poldark series believes it is impossible to avoid dealing with violence and sex on television Its part of our lives part of our drama for four hundred years The problem is to deal with it not in a gratuitous way but in a dramatic way in terms of the story In many ways its actually an advantage to try to get around an offensive scene because if you are able to show it whole you dont push your mindyour creative sense hard enough When you use your Ingenuity to avoid showing what you have to you can usually find dramatic bonuses in it The dramatic bonuses Mr Pulman speaks of may make the difference between a program that upsets and infuriates public television viewers around the country or one that as the British say goes down easily 
VOTERS IN NEW YORK TO RULE ON 10 ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/06/archives/voters-in-new-york-to-rule-on-10-issues-careys-750-million-bond.html,New York voters will be faced Tuesday with 10 propositions questions and amendments about which most of them know little and the common feeling among politicians is that many of the major items face defeat Proponents and opponents of Governor Careys proposal to float 750 million in bonds for economic development the revision of some aspects of the court system a constitutional convention en expansion of the Job Development Authority and the rest of the proposals have been competing heavily in the last day or two in an effort to influence the lastminute decisions that most voters will be forced to make At the top of the ballot is the Governors bond proposal the constitutionality of which has been an issue in the courts with opponents arguing that its provisions are constitutionally too broad That issue was resolved only partly last week with a Court of Appeals decision that left the item on the ballot but also left the possibility that if the voters approved it it would be declared unconstitutional The confusion has compounded a skepticism that the public commonly holds toward increasing the state debt in any case and most of the bond issues proponents feel the suit cost them dearlyin both time and money It really hurt their ability to raise funds said James S Vlasto a spokesman for Governor Carey adding that the midweek decision left less than a week to convince the electorate Transportation Secretary William C Hennessey whose department would control many of the projects financed by the bond issue said he was on every talk show I can find and believes weve still got a shot at it Economic Action Inc the citizens organization that is coordinating the probond forces is continuing to work but even Mr Carey seems to think that the prospects for the bond issue which appears on the ballot as Proposition No 1 are dim The effort for a constitutional convention Question No 1 also has had considerable trouble Its main supporter was the Constitution itself which requires that the possibility be presented to the voters every 20 years although it was joined by some organizations and individuals who feel that the 200year old Constitution is in need of an overhaul to make it simpler and clearer Among them is the RepublicanLiberal candidate for Manhattan Borough President Robert F Wagner Jr who pointed to the controversy over the bond issue as an example of why a constitutional convention would be useful But opponentsincluding the Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson Republican of Binghamtonhave denounced the idea of a convention as a 20 million boondoggle recalling that the 1967 convention had spent six months and 10 million to produce a document that when it was presented to the voters as a package was rejected by a vote of 3 to 1 A grassroots effort by some antiabortion organizations around the state favoring a convention seems to have received a big setback in the form of a recommendation of a no vote by the states Roman Catholic bishops who said it would be a cumbersome ineffective and costly method of revising the State Constitution That question Question No 1 is also given little chance of approval Much more has been heard about Amendments No 1 2 and 3 which would revise some of the procedures used in the states courts Amendments 2 and are relatively noncontroversial measures that would make formal the centralcourtadministration system that has been in place for several years placing the budgeting and standard setting for the states courts under one administrator and would make the system used to discipline judges more efficient Amendment 1 would change the method of selecting judges to the states highest court the Court of Appeals from election by the public to selection by the Governor with the advice of a bipartisan nominating committee The idea has both fervent supporters and fervent detractors The supporterswho feel that elective politics have no place in the states highest courthave been pressing their views with radio spots through the weekend The detractorswho say appointed judges are not demonstrably better than elected ones and who oppose what they say is the disenfranchisement of the publicare citing the qualms of the Conservative Party and the New Democratic Condon and warnings from former Gov Malcolm Wilson that it will destroy the judicial branch as one of the three coordinate and independent branches of government Publicopinion surveys earlier this year showed that about 75 percent of the public opposed the appointment of jjudges and the outcome of this amendment is in doubt On the remaining amendments little has been heard Amendment No 4 would eliminate the 6000 limit on cases in town city and village courts Amendment No 5 would give the same costofliving adjustment to pension benefits given to widows and widowers of state employees as are given to retired employees themselves Neither seems to have aroused much interest or outcry from any quarter Amendment No 6 would allow vacancies on a Board of Education or Community School Board to be filled by appointment until the next regularly scheduled schoolhoard election rather than only until Dec 31 of the year in which they occur as is now the case Mayor Beame voiced his support for it late last week citing the cost benefits of eliminating special elections Amendments 7 and S would increase the borrowing power and the scope of the Job Development Authority a state agency that makes lowInterest loans to nonprofit corporations to finance new industrial plants or to expand existing ones

Book Review,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/06/archives/book-review-a-tyrant-exposed-tyrant.html,BOOKS about Idi Amin fall into two categories those that expose him and those that exploit him Lately there has been an outpouring of both genres an avalanche of Amin literature that threatens to push the dimestore paperbacks about Nazi storm troopers off the shelf Unfortunately the exploitative books outnumber the serious ones and to a degree they work to undermine them by sensationalizing the grisly or comic myths that have long obscured a regime whose evil is very real very banal and in no need of exaggeration Two serious books however are worth comment A State of Blood by Henry Kyemba stands above the pulp thrillers and satirical concoctions Continued on Page 50 The Inside Story of Idi Amin With a Foreword by Godfrey Lule Former Minister of Justice and Solicitor General of Uganda Illustrated 288 pp New York Ace Books Paper 250 Reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights Submitted by the International Commission of Jurists 167 pp Geneva Switzerland International Commission of Jurists 6 it is the most important book on Amin since David Martins General Amin which first documented the massacres in Uganda appeared in 1974 It must be read by anyone including members of the world press who persists in regarding Amin as more of a buffoon than a butcher Kyemba assisted by a former Reuters correspondent John Man provides a dismal portrait of a country in its death throes and of life in the high echelons of Government It is a selfserving account but under the circumstances probably the most reliable we are likely to have of how Amin thinks acts and squirms to stay in power Kyemba was in his words an insider in the Government since 1962 He served President Milton Obote as personal private secretary he was with Obote in Singapore in January 1971 at the time of the coup and broke the news to him that Amins troops had taken over He held the same position under Amin and then after a period of suspicion and demotion rose in 1972 to become Minister of Culture and later Minister of Health By the time he defectedin Britain last May out of fear for his lifehe had established a record of longevity in Amins cabinet Kyemba was close to Amin He engaged in late night chats at the Marshals bedside counseled his wives and nodded to his mistresses received a lavish wedding gift from him supervised his medical treatment and helped cover up his crimes I have worked intimately with the man who gradually revealed himself to he Africas most ruthless killer he says without overstatement Kyemba has no doubt that Amin is personally implicated in many of Ugandas killings which he placesextrapolating from among other things the bloated bodies he has seen floating near Owens Damat 150000 But never did he hear Amin issue explicit execution orders only coded euphemisms understood by Amins bodyguards such as give him the VIP treatment As Minister of Health Kyemba had access to Mulago Hospital including its busy morgue and thus a window on Kampalas underlife He saw the bullet riddled bodies of Angelican Archbishop Jawan Luwuum and two Cabinet ministers who Amin insisted to an unbelieving world had died in a traffic accident He comforted Mrs Dora Bloch the highjack victim left behind during the Israeli raid at Entebbe before she was dragged screaming from her hospital room by four men from the dreaded State Research Bureau She reminded me very much of my own mother He heard from Amin himself that she had been killed and he dutifully hid her belongings and falsified hospital records in a coverup Kyemba sets the record straight on a number of macabre tales that have dogged Amins rule He does not believe for example that Amin killed his second wife Kay who was unfaithful by having her body dismembered and her limbs sewn back on in reverse positions More likely she died during an abortion at the hands of her lover a doctor who subsequently committed suicide It is true however that Amin had her body reconstituted and displayed to her assembled children as a lesson on the wages of infidelity Nor was it true Kyemba asserts that there was a student massacre at Makerere University in August 1976 of the magnitude reported by the British press which claimed 700 victims Gross misrepresentation of this kind does nothing to aid the cause of justice in Uganda he states the truth is horrific enough Indeed it is On two occasions Amin told Kyemba that he had tasted human flesh which he described as even more salty than leopard meat It is likely Kemba says that Amin practices blood rituals on his slain enemies since it is the custom among Amins tribe the Kakwa to insert a knife in the body and touch the bloody blade to their lips Kyemba retraces some of the now famous episodes of Amins early career that reflected the kind of leader he would become his massacre of Karamojog cattle raiders just before independence his pocketing of money from gold and ivory trade with Congo rebels One wonders in the light of this why his coup was greeted with such jubilation Kyemba sharing the feeling of the time explains it as reaction to Obotes unpopularity but he admits to being shocked by one postcoup incident a proObote officer taking refuge in a doctors house was gunned down the unsuspecting doctor it was later learned was hauled off to a military barracks and crushed by a tank Equally mystifying is how Amin manages to stay alive and in power As Kyemba describes it his rule rests first upon simple unbridled terror enforced by 15000 thugs mostly Nubians and southern Sudanese spread through three separate security organizations Their loyalty is bought with a license to plunder and with provisions of luxury items ferried on the twice weekly flight to England the whiskey run Equally important is Amins own personality His political naivit is matched by a low cunning which guides him in choosing the singular gesture sometimes dramatic sometimes diversionary to fend off threats Initially he won the loyalty of the Baganda tribe by bringing back their exiled chief for burial He quelled unrest in the army by expelling Asians and handing over their property At close quarters Amin can be jovial and generous dispensing money from bulging pockets playing songs on the melodeon capable of the small thoughtful gesture His unpredictability has saved him from several assassination attempts He is constantly on the move constantly telephoning orders from undisclosed locations and constantly mixing truth and falsehood to keep his top officers off balance Of course he is constanly killing Why did Kyemba serve this man for so long especially after his own brother was killed by Amins goons in 1972 He is at pains to explain it and his rationalizations thread the narrative from start to finish Often he says he was unaware of what was going on the assertion is difficult to uphold given the nature of his disclosures At one point he argues that he hoped to work from within to exercise some influence on the course of government at another he claims that ministers were little more than ciphers anyway The answer probably lies in the assessment of Kyemba frequently heard from other Ugandan refugees that he is a man very much concerned with looking out for himself I thought I had Amins confidence and 1 did not fear for myself he admits in explaining why he did not flee earlier Why did Amin trust him I was able to maintain an out ward detachment that never threatened Amin he says That statement speaks volumes about Kyembas capacity to close his eyes to the horrors inflicted upon others around him It undercuts a moral tone he strives vainly to impress upon the reader and makes his plea for international sanctions against Uganda something of a hollow call It is for others to judge whether Kyemba has justified in any way his long collaboration with Amin by adding to the stockpile of information that may someday help to bring him down Uganda and Human Rights a compilation of reports that the International Commission of Jurists has submitted to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights is the most comprehensive documentary record to date of the atrocities of the Amin regime The reports by the commission an international organization of lawyers based in Geneva with a reputation for impartiality do not aim to provide startling new disclosures Instead they set down coldly and dispassionately the names the dates and the circumstancesinsofar as this is possible  of hundreds of persons who have been liquidated since Amin seized power in 1971 The material is presented in a straight forward nonsensationalized manner but the cumulative effect is chilling In Idi Amins Uganda anonymous goons drag judges out of their chambers surgeons out of operating rooms and politicians out of hotel receptions The victims are stuffed into the trunk of a Peugeot 504 never to be seen again or turn up in notorious Makindye prison where their final agonies are played out in death cells nicknamed Singapore and Dar Es Salaam after the fact that former President Obote was overthrown while attending conference in Singapore and subsequently lived in Dar Es Salaam The tortures are unspeakable in their savagery Prisoners are immersed in holes filled with cold water Their heads are placed inside car tire rims while they are whipped a practice the guards call giving them tea Officers cut off their organs one by one or slash open their bellies with machetes and reach in to pull out their intestines In Amins Uganda murder is capricious As in Nazi Germany people are killed for belonging to the wrong tribe the Acholis and Langis But a man may also disappear because he refused a bank loan to a soldier or drove a flashy sports car or was on a dance floor with a beautiful woman Death is not impersonal and methodical as it was under the Third Reich heads are smashed with sledgehammers and car axles and other prisoners are called in to roll around in the gore and clean it up We used to make a small hole just behind the toilet for the eyes teeth and broken skulls and cover it up says one survivor of Naguru prison The reports contain descriptions from eye witnesses named whenever possible and depositions from two former Cabinet Ministers They cover every aspect of human rights violationsthe expulsion of Asian noncitizens the purges in the Army the massacres of entire villages the deaths of Amins collaborators and relatives The only shortcoming is a selfadmitted onethe recorded cases are of prominent people What cannot be told are the circumstances of the deaths of countless other anonymous victims most of them ordinary citizens who have disappeared without attracting public attention Almost as shocking as the bestiality of Amins rule is the fact that the UN Commission on Human Rights confronted with such a wealth of irrefutable evidence failed twice to take any action whatsoever During its most recent deliberations this spring it turned its back on the issue at the very time when the murder of Angelican Archbishop Luwuum and

Transcript of the President's News Conference on Foreign and Domestic Matters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/11/archives/transcript-of-the-presidents-news-conference-on-foreign-and.html,Following is a transcript of President Carters news conference yesterday as recorded by The New York Times through the facilities of ABC News 1 Unemployment CARTER Mr Pippert Q Mr President you said a lot last year about helping people out of work yet unemployment persisted around 7 percent and was twice as high among blacks Yesterday the head of the Black Caucus said that your programs in his words had not even begun to dent unemployment among blacks Why has the Administration been unable to lower unemployment and what are you going to do about it A Theres no easy answer of course to the unemployment question Last December the unemployment rate was I think 81 percent It came down in April or May to about 7 percent and its leveled off at that figure We had an economic stimulus package with a heavy emphasis on jobs and tax reductions amounting to about 21 billion which is now beginning to be felt I hope Last quarter about 3 billion of that program was in effect by the end of this quarter 18 billion will be in effect and in the first quarter of next year the full amount We believe that this will have a beneficial impact on unemployment rates but it certainly wont solve the problem We will by next June for instance have 725000 jobs under the Comprehensive Education Training Program This is the highest level of jobs of this category supported directly by the Federal Government since the New Deal days under Roosevelt But its a tedious slow process I think the general worldwide economic slowdown is causing this problem to be felt in all nations We hope though that it will come down next year as it began to come down this year 2 HumphreyHawkins Bill Q Will you accept a HumphreyHawkins full employment bill to set the goal of 4 percent unemployment in five years A Weve been working very closely with the Congressional leaders including my personal conversations with Congressman Hawkins and Senator Humphrey The HumphreyHawkins bill is a concept that I endorse and support This bill has been constantly modified since it was introduced several years ago as you know We expect to have an announcement about the Administrations position on HumphreyHawkins within the next few days There are some important aspects of the bill that have been modiified recently One is to inject into the bills concepts a strong antiinflation commitment in addition to the antiunemployment commitment Also from the bill has been removed the direct authorizations for programs that might have been very costly They would have to be considered stepbystep by the Congress as required Another thing that has been added to the recent version of the bill is some flexibility to accommodate changing times in the future My belief is that these specific modifications by the authors of the bill and their staffs working with my staff can be realized and my expectation is that we will have a successful conclusion of the negotiations and then that the bill will be presented to the Congress with my endorsement 3 Health Insurance Q Mr President you had a meeting yesterday on national health insurance I know that you dont have a program to present at this time but can you give us some clue as to your thinking as to where youre going with national health insurance and have you got any kind of timetable in mind A Its too early yet to lay down specifics for the national health insurance program This was a concept that was endorsed by all the candidates for President last year And its a need in our country that this entire health care system be improved One of them is to cut down the exorbitant increases in national health care Take the hospital costand weve already initiated a major effort on the hospital cost containment bill These costs have been doubled every five years which makes it almost impossible to give better health care because the costs have grown up so rapidly there Also there are many facets of national health care in addition to just health insurancephysical fitness is obviously one air and water pollution problems prevention of disease expansion of the medical personnel that can give health care And weve just signed a bill to provide for socalled positionextenders to let registered nurses and others do more of the work in health care I would say that since this was just an exploratory talk and my first one yesterday with my top staff members and Cabinet members that its too early to lay down a schedule but well be working on this now with increasing commitment and I think by early next year the principles of the national health program will be outlined to the American people 4 Conviction of Helms Q Mr President Mr Helmss attorney says that his client will wear his conviction on charges to failing to testify fully before Congress as a badge of honor Do you think its a badge of honor and do you think a public official has the right to lie in public about his business under any circumstances A No it is not a badge of honor and a public official does not have the right to lie The Helms case is one that we inherited Ive never met Mr Helms I dont believe the Attorney General has ever met Mr Helms This is a serious problem that evolved in years past We had three major facets of this question one is to uphold the law the second was to uphold the veracity requirement the truthfulness requirement of those who testify before Congress and the third one was to make the best judgment we could on how to protect the security of our nation I think that the decision that was made by the Attorney General confirmed by the court was the right decision and the best decision It does fulfill all three of those requirementsIt does not condone lying it does uphold the law and I think it did protect as best we could the security of our country 5 Middle East Situation Q Its our understanding that some of your top national security advisersmet yesterday in the White House situation room to sort of reassess the situation in the Middle East in light of the recent trouble on the Lebanon border Can you give us some assessment this morning especially of what effect this might have on the Middle East peace conference later this year A This new outburst of violence is of great concern to us and I think to the nations in the Middle East to all nations of the world The unwarranted and continuing terrorist attacks have been part of the Middle East picture for many years The retaliatory measures taken by nations who were attacked by terrorists has been part of the picture in the Middle East for years I think it shows the volatile nature there of the continuing problems I think it shows in a much more vivid way than perhaps in the past the recent past the need for an immediate convening of the Geneva conference as soon as we can to get these national leaders to sit downor their representatives to sit downon a continuing basis and work out face to face these divisions that have existed in the Middle East for generations Loss of life is deplorable but the situation is never going to be improved in my opinion until those nations there are willing to step beyond the procedural debates and squabbles about exactly how to go and exactly what representation will be present and start dealing with the real issues Ive been pleased that the Israeli Government has adopted the procedures for the Geneva conference that we proposed I was pleased with the statement yesterday by President Sadat that he was willing to go to Geneva or anywhere else and begin to consult directly with Israel and with the other Arab nations without quibbling any more about the detailed wording of the procedures Thats our position I hope that Jordan and Syria and Lebanon very quickly will make a similar response to us and that we can then convene the Geneva conference But the major allencompassing question in the Middle East is that the bloodshed in my opinion will not be stopped until the nations are willing to negotiate on the basic divisions that have separated them so long 6 The Israeli Attack Q Do you think the Israeli attack was justified or retaliation A Well I think this is a question thats hard for me to answer whether Israel can sit dormant and quiescent and accept repeated attacks on their border villages without retaliation whether the retaliation was excessive Those are questions that I think both answers would be perhaps yes There ought not to be any attacks or if there are continued attacks some retaliation is required I dont know the details of it but I think the overriding consideration is not to condemn Israel at this point for retaliation but just to say that if the provocations were absent that the retaliation would have been unnecessary and the best way to resolve it is for Lebanon Syria and Israel relating to that region of the Mideast for Jordan and Egypt and Israel to start direct negotiations The whole thing is just sitting and teetering on another outbreak of even more major violence And I think that at this time condemnations of people is probably inappropriate but an urge for all nations now to stop this present recent outbreak and to move towards major consultations is the only answer that I can give 7 Safety of Dams Q Im asking you sir about the question of safety of the 50000 dams in the United States Its five years since Congress authorized an inspection program but moneys never been put up for it and last weekend Mrs Carter went down to Florida to inspect the latest disaster and presumably reported back to you and presumably you have some ideas on what to do next about it Could you tell us sir A Yes Again this has been as you knew an historic question in that it lasts from one year to another from one decade to another even generations There are now about 50000 dams in this country that need to be inspected without delay Weve allocated 15 million to the Corps of Engineers to commence this examination procedure The priorities for inspection of dams will be established upon the number of people who are endangered by these potentially unsafe dams Only about 2000 I believe out of the 50000 are Federal dams The rest of them are privately owned in some instances owned by the state or local governments water reservoirs and so forth This is a project that requires a broad range of participation State governments and local governments ought to participate as well and private owners of dams ought to reassess both the need for the reservoir to continue in existence filled with water or the repair or examination of the dam by letting the water down or by other means I think that these tragedies that occur restimulate interest which has in the past died down after a few weeks I dont intend to let this interest die down The tragedy in Toccoa Ga was one that was very narrowly defined This was a small privately owned dam just above a 200foot waterfall Below that waterfall was a very small college And 37 people have been found dead two more are missing We acted immediately there weve got even more extensive flooding with a number of peoples lives being lost in North Carolina But I intend to pursue this dam safety inspection now without surcease It will not be postponed any further 8 Abortion Financing Q With the Senate and House conferees deadlocked over federally funded abortions a young woman in Texas recently was unable to obtain a Medicaid abortion and went across the border into Mexico obtained a cheap botchedup operation and died My question is sir does this prompt you to any second thoughts about your recent comments that life is unfair when you compared the plight of these poor women with people in better economic circumstances who can pay this relatively small cost for a safe legal abortion A My stand on Federal financing of abortions has not changed But obviously I deplore any sickness or loss of life I deplore unwanted pregnancies and we are trying to take other means to make sure that abortions are not necessary But Im not in favor as Ive said before of Federal financing for abortions 9 Candor About Helms Q Id like to go back to the Helms case for just a moment In light of the July 25 meeting at the White House that involved you and the Attorney General and others in which you fully discussed the Helms case I wonder sir if you could give us the reasons for your statement on Sept 29 that you had not consulted with the Attorney General about the Helms case and the second part of my question is was one consideration to avoid a public trial at all costs to keep the secrets secret A The Sept 25 meeting was not in the first place a thorough discussion of the Helms case It was a brief meeting at which the Helms case was outlined with no secret material discussed no documents examined no mention made of people or others who might be involved or if the trial did go to conclusion There was a general discussion there fairly brief Our hope at that time expressed by the Attorney General by me the Vice President I think by the national security adviser was that a negotiated settlement might be reached Then we did not think that was a likely prospect The second question that arose was if we had to go to trial because of an indictment should it be concluded aggressively or would the question of national security revelations have to he faced And we postponed that decision with an understanding that if that prospect did present itself to me that I would then be briefed on the consequences of those prospects That never did occur The question that was raised in September was based on a statement by Admiral Turner who heads up the CIA the national intelligence community that we were faced with the prospect of two alternatives one was a decision not to prosecute at all and the other alternative that Admiral Turner mentioned which was in the reporters question that the complete trial would be held with the revelation of national security secrets I replied that the Attorney General had never presented that information to me which was true The only other contact that I had after Sept 25 with the Attorney General on this subject at all was that one day in passing I think after a Cabinet meeting he pointed out that there was an inclination on the part of Mr Helmss attorney to act in a proper way or patriotic way But I have never been given any briefings about secret documents that might be revealed nor people to be involved because fortunately we did not have to face that prospect 10 Differences With Burns Q Mr President the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board Arthur Burns says hes going to have to continue to restrain the growth of money supply in order to control inflation which of course is your goal also but this can drive up interest rates and I wonder what threat you see from this to the business expansion which is needed to reduce unemployment A Well you always have that inherent conflict which is one that was pointed out earlier about the unemployment rate and the HumphreyHawkins bill On the one hand economic stimulation leads to rapid growth more employment at least on a temporary basis On the other hand you have inflationary pressures develop when you have an excessive supply of money and excessive stimulation of the economy I strongly support the autonomy and independence of the Federal Reserve We have had a 2 percent increase in interest rates this year because of action taken by the Federal Reserve But theres a fairly good balance now in my opinion between the Federal Reserve on the one hand controlling the supply of money in the marketplace to some degree the Congress which has direct authority to act which indirectly controls the supply of money by changes in the tax laws rebates and so forth and the President of course who participates with the Congress in establishing budget levels the rapidity with which programs are carried out once the moneys authorized by Congress and so forth I wouldnt want to change that basic structure I think its good I might say the press reports of disharmonies or arguments of lack of friendship or cooperation between me and Chairman Burns are completely erroneous We have meetings regularly we discuss the economic issues openly and freely The director of the Office of Management and Budget the Secretary of the Treasury the Vice President attend those meetings Coincidentally today is one of those monthly meetings when Ill be with Mr Burns Weve never had any disagreements on those subjects So I dont think that I have any inclination to criticize the actions that have been taken by Mr Burns 11 Fight for Energy Bill Q Mr President you canceled your trip overseas in order to be here for the last stages of the fight over your energy bill You gave a speech on television the other night What else do you personally intend to be doing during this period when you would have been traveling to bring about a result thats acceptable to you A I dont know of anything thats more important for me to do as President other than defending our nation and guaranteeing its security than to have the Congress conclude their long years work with a successful result spelling out legislation and an energy policy for our nation to help resolve a serious problem Energy waste threatens our countrys economy jobs inflation energy waste threatens our nations own security makes us overdependent on foreign imports which might be interrupted at any time And I think that the best thing I can do the rest of this year is to work closely with the Congress individually with members of the Congress with the conferees who are now engaged in very productive work And I canceled the trip reluctantly but with the additional realation that our relationship with the countries that I would have visited will be much better in the future if the United States takes this belated action to provide a workable energy policy The Congress is making I think good progress There are five major elements of the energy package five separate hills that will come to my desk eventually And theyve almost completed work on two of them The others are highly controversial Perhaps the most wide disparity between the House and the Senate is on taxation itself They are dealing with one thats of crucial importance to consumers and that is electric rate structures to eliminate the great advantage that has been going in the past to those who waste electricity So I think the Congress is making good progress But I dont think theres any doubtI know theres no doubt in my mindthat I did the right thing to stay here while the Congress is in its crucial weeks of the conferees work 12 Meetings on Energy Bill Q Do you expect to meet with members of the HouseSenate conference committee personally during their deliberations A Yes sir Q And have you done so this week and will you be doing so in the immediate future A Yes as a matter of fact tomorrow I have another meeting scheduled with the House chairman Congressman Staggers I have met with him previously and with Senator Long Senator Jackson And I had a long meeting Sunday afternoon and Ive met with Senator Byrd Saturday afternoon for a couple of hours I meet with the House and Senate leadership weekly at a breakfast And in the past Ive called in the entire subcommittees that relate to particular aspects of the energy package I consider this to be my overriding responsibility at this time and between now and the time the conferees conclude their work and the House and Senate vote on the conference reports Ill put this as a top priority for myself Ann 13 Right to a Job Q Mr President do you share the philosophy of those that say every American has a right to a job Does that influence you in your decision on HumphreyHawkins A Yes it does We also I think have proposed to the Congress a move in that direction in the program for better jobs and income the welfare reform proposals Included within that proposal is an additional 12 million jobs most of which would be in the private sector This is above and beyond the programs weve already initiated this year We have a heavy emphasis in almost everything we do to cut down unemployment in our country Its multifaceted in nature and I believe that every person in our country thats able to work ought to have an opportunity for a job 14 Broadcasting Nominee Q Mr President are you aware Mr President that one of your nomineesyour most recent nominee to the Corporation for Public Broadcastingwas a very active member of the White Citizens Council in Mississippi and worked very hard to keep schools from being integrated down there If that is true would that make any difference to you in making that nomination A No I was not aware of it and Id have to know more about the circumstances before I would consider withdrawing the nomination There have been in the past in the South and in other places alignments with White Citizen Council groups and groups even more radical in nature I always think its good to give people a chance to change if they will but I have not known about that allegation but Ill look into it 15 Business Tax Proposals Q Mr President now that youve given yourself more time on your tax reform are you rethinking or changing your mind on any of the reforms that are most unsettling to business specifically the capital gains special treatment and the free martini expense account lunch A We will continue to assess all aspects of tax reform including the free martini business lunch which might be of special interest to this group But I think that this is a time for us now to assimilate the action that Congress has taken and is taking on Social Security which has major tax impact and on the energy package which also has a major impact on the tax structure Following that decisionor those decisionsby Congress we will combine what we know then with what we know about our national economy prospects Give us another month or so to assess the changes and then Ill make decisions on specific component parts of the tax reform package But Ive not added in nor excluded yet any component individual portions 16 US Spending Shortfall Q Its now clear sir that the executive branch has failed to spend billions of dollars appropriated by Congress over the last few months Do you know the size of that shortfall and what effect its had on the economyspecifically jobs A I believe that were up to date in expending money for jobs Both Secretary Kreps of Commerce and Secretary Marshall the head of the Labor Department have reported to me no later than last Friday that in the local public works programs in the jobs program under Labor that they are at least current or ahead of schedule There has been however this past fiscal year a socalled shortfall in that several billions of dollarsapproximately 10 billions of dollarsthat had been appropriated by Congress were not spent Some of that I think a substantial portion of it was in the Defense Department And this has been the case in many years in the past Were trying now to put a much more accurate means in effect of assessing how much money we spend each month compared with what the Congress has authorized and what we want to spend so that we wont have this major shortfall in the past It does have two component effects One is it saves money for the taxpayers but the other one is it quite often tends to put a dampening effect on the economy by extracting money that would have been added to stimulate And also of course in cases where programs that are needed are delayed that creates a problem for those who might receive the benefits But I dont believe theres any evidence that this has been done in the case of jobs Weve been very insistent that the programs designed to stimulate our economy this year and to give our people jobs stay on schedule Q Thank you Mr President

Henry Miller Gerald Durrell and Allen Ginsbergbut comes realize that her intuition is not infallible Youth crusade Many residents of Publishers Row are becoming more and more convinced that their neighborhood is steadily slipping into a crisis This year for the umpteenth successive time tests and studies by educators show that the average schoolchild is not reading as much or as well as the child who occupied his desk back in the 40s and 50s For this television poor teaching the stresses social change are all being blamedthe cause is moot Meanwhile the childs parent who is also a taxpayer squeezed by inflation is making the schools and public libraries reduce the number of books they purchase If the trend continues the reading of books may beconA a lost art Many publishers look back nostalgically to the days when the writing publishing and circulation of childrens and young peoples books were confined to a cozy circle Some 50 houses issued 2000 hardcover titles a year selling 90 percent of them schools and libraries The remaining 10 percent found their way into the relatively few bookstores that had childrens departments to be sold to grandmothers who could afford their high price tags Usually grandmothers chose for their grandchildren the books they themselves enjoyed when young The coming of the Paperback Revolution after World War II didnt change the situation very much Most publishers didnt want to spoil the good thing they had going by offering cheap editions Many librarians were reluctant to buy books that would soon wear out Then when the budget crunch began to be felt a halfdozen years ago a score of of publishers started issuing softcover reprints of books that had sold well over the years Many libraries welcomed them but relatively few were taken by bookstores Early this year a number of the massmarket paperback firms that had ventured into the childrens and young adult field became convinced quite inde pendently that they must do something to meet the growing crisis As Walter Meade Avon Books editor in chief puts it We saw that if we were going to stay in the business wed have to regear our editorial procedures and promote and merchandize our young peoples lines in the same way as we Co our adult books Much the same thing being said by the people at Bantam Dell and Pocket Books Ace never very active in childrens publishing has decided to join the movement Scholastic which for years has been selling paperbacks to students through their teachers is planning to offer more of their titles through bookand variety stores One of the first effects of the editorial regearing has been a marked increase in the prices some authors are offered for reprint rights Bantam for example paid Roald Dahl 1 million for seven books Several companies are planning to bring out originals to supplement their reprint lines Come 1978 the number Of titles published will proliferate All will be designed to appeal to children and their parents rather than teachers librarians and grandmothers For the very young there will be new and expanded series of picture books for their older brothers and sisters biographies howto books and novels that illuminate a world their grandmothers never knew There will be more discussions of such matters as drug use and abortion To sell and promote them the publishers will use the same sales and promotional devices that have proved successful with adult books Bookstores supermarkets and varietystore chains will be provided with racks to display their titles attractively will be urged to expand their childrens sections and family reading centers Authors will be sent on crosscountry tours for press and television interviews for autographing parties in stores Last week Paul Zindel the Pulitzer Prizewinning playwright was barnstorming the West and Midwest in behalf of his book Pardon Me Youre Stepping on My Eyeball The massmarket houses arent alone in hoping that their crusade will

WHY MEN DOMINATE WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/13/archives/why-men-dominate-women-startling-new-evidence-of-female-infanticide.html,There is not a single country in the world today whose top political position is held by a woman Although during the last decade women have entered fields previously barred to them men still monopolize the key positions in government industry and military institutions The questions remain Are there innate biological harriers that prevent women trom attaining equal power Or is there something built into the human male that makes it more natural for him to command females than for females to command him To answer one must know why male supremacism has been so wellnigh universal Feminists actually tend to underestimate male supremacism They are afraid for one thing that if it has been in continuous existence throughout virtually the entire globe from the earliest times to the present then perhaps it really is natural for men to dominate women Some radical feminists conclude that their txxlies are at fault and that women will not achieve parity unless they cease to bear children True liberation according to Shulamith Firestone for example will come only when babies are manufactured in bottles By bionic superfemales perhaps In all their eagerness to disprove the universality of male dominance several feminists have attempted to resurrect semitnystical theories about a golden age of matriarchy when women reigned supreme over men Yet nothing justifies the exhumation of this 19thcentury corpse Not tr shred of evidence hisforicol or contemporary supports the existence of a single society in which women controlled the political and economic lives of men Other feminists have recently insisted that the reported high incidence of male supremacist institutions is an illusion created by the sexist minds of male anthropologists But this idea is based on a lack of understanding of the real prejudice that does exist among Marvin Hams a Columbia University anthropologist is the author of recently published Cannibals and Kings anthropological fiehlworkers male or female They suffer from the temptation to claim that they have lived among groups whose customs are not to he found anywhere else Far from wanting to overlook it most of my male colleagues would jump at the opportunity to write journal articles for example about domineering matrons or harems of male concubines Knowing this about the state of the art I find it impossible to believe that the widely reported cultural biases against women are mere motes in the eyes of male fieldworkers Many feminists argue that the sexes were equal when people lived in villages or small mobile groups called bands prior to the development of the state It is true that anthropological studies of contemporary band and village peoples do not always indicate the presence of strong malesupremacist institutions But most of this anthropological fieldwork was carried out after warfare was suppressed by colonial authorities and thus may lead to false inferences From the analysis of large representative samples of all the human societies studied by anthropologists 1 find overwhelming evidence that males control females in most domains of social life For example in 75 percent of these societies the bride must move from her own family to that of her husbands while the opposite pattern prevails in only 10 percent of the marriages This shift in residence immediately places the bride at a disadvantage it is she who must adapt to life in a strange household often far from supportive parents and siblings Lines tracing family ancestry show the same asymmetry Children are linked with their ancestors exclusively through males at least five times more often than they are linked exclusively through females But even in cultures where descent is in the maternal line married children remain with their mothers in only about a third of the cases In another third male children stop living with their mother and take residence in their mothers brothers household bringing their wives with them This pattern implies that it is the mothers brother who controls the domestic scene even though descent is in the female line Remarkably not a single case of the opposite of this patternthe conferring of control on the fathers sister in a society which reckons descent paternallyhas ever been identified Patterns of plural marriage also overwhelmingly attest to the dominance of males Men are polygamous a hundred times more frequently than women are Furthermore the transfer of valuables from the grooms family to the brides is extremely common This transfer compensates the menfolk for the loss of her valuable services A striking fact is that In all the anthropological literature only one or two cases are known of economic compensation given by the brides sisters and mother to the grooms sisters and mother for loss of the grooms valuable productive and reproductive services In other words marriage usually involves the exchange of women between groups of men seldom if ever the exchange of men between groups of women Political institutions show the same lopsided quality Headmen rather than headwomen are the rule as are male chiefs rather than female chiefs In matters religious it is the same story Shamanspersons possessing privileged access to the realm of supernatural beings through trances dreams and druginduced hallucinationsare far more often reported as men than as women In addition the members of the majority of band and village societies regard women as ritually unclean especially during menstruation They believe menstrual blood pollutes But they use semen in rituals aimed at improving the groups health and wellbeing Throughout the world men menace women and children with noisemakers masks and other sacred objects whose true nature is kept as a male secret Mens clubhouses in which these items are stored and from which women are excluded are also part of the same complex Women on the other hand seldom ritually menace men there are no womens houses where they gather to protect themselves against the pollution given off Male dominance also shows up in the division of economic tasks In almost all band and village societies women do the drudge work such as weeding seed grinding fetching water and firewood carrying infants and household possessions and routine cooking The appropriate response to this preoccupying fact of past and present male dominance does not of course lie in rewriting prehistory or in mythology or in testtube babies or attacks on male anthropologists Rather what is called for is an investigation of the cultural conditions that have nurtured and sustained male sexism Like most advocates of womens rights I do not hold to the theory that men dominate women because it is natural for them to be aggressive and take control Male supremacy is not a biological imperative or a genetically programmed characteristic of the human species Nor is it an arbitrary social convention or a conspiracy among males to degrade or exploit women as many radical feminists believe Theoreticians of the womens movement have written volumes on the subject but they have either ignored or misunderstood the crucial factors that led to male dominance Far from being arbitrary or conspiratorial male chauvinism arose during prehistory to counter a basic threat to human survival the threat of overpopulation and the depletion of resources Furthermore my research has convinced me that the patterns of early human sexism cannot be understood without investigating the origin of another scourgewarfare My theory holds that male supremacy and prehistoric warfare together constituted the core of a primordial system for avoiding the misery and annihilation latent in the reproductive power of the What recent feminist writers have failed to realize is that this entire complex of male supremacism plus the very definition of feminine as passive and masculine as aggressive can be deduced from one fact Virtually all band and village societies engaged in warfare in which males were the principal if not exclusive combatants Throughout prehistory as well as during more recent epochs warriors fought battles exclusively with spears clubs bows and arrows and other musclepowered weapons Under these conditions the greater average strength and height of the human malewhich can be traced back to our primate ancestrybecame critically important Military success and hence the life and death of whole communities depended on the relative number of aggressive brawny men who were psychologically and physically prepared to risk their lives in combat In preparation for their combat roles males were taught competitive sports such as wrestling dueling with spears and racing with heavy weights Masculinity was also instilled by subjecting boys to intense physical ordeals such as circumcision trials of stamina deprivation of food and drink and druginduced hallucinatory encounters with supernatural monsters To get males to risk their comfort and their lives in behalf of perfecting powerful system of rewards and punishments was needed Ostracism was the punishmen sex was the reward Those who best endured the trials of boyhood and the rigors of combat were rewarded with wives and concubines In many instances only those who had faced an enemy in combat could marry This explains why virtually all band and village societies taughtand those still in existence still teachthat only males should be proficient in the use of clubs spears and bows and arrows and why they often forbid women to touch these weapons just as they generally excluded women from frontline combat Since some women are brawnier than some men and could no doubt be trained to be as brave excluding them might seem irrational But if wives and concubines were to be the chief inducement for men to become masculine women had to be trained from birth not for combat but for ac Because of the importance of male combat teams band and village warfare generally tended to promote the organization of communities around a core of permanent male residents consisting of fathers brothers and sons Different residential patterns arose at higher levels of political organization when warfare involved long expeditions against distant enemies These localized malecentered groups formed military alliances by exchanging women It was the line of resident males therefore who acquired control over the communitys resources This ex through males why postmarital residence was with the husband and why the group that gave away a sister or daughter in marriage sought compensation Furthermore as I said the allotment of women as a reward for male aggressiveness led to polygamous marriages between one man and several wives Drudge work for women and ritual subordination and devaluation also followed directly from the need to reward males at the expense of females and from the need to provide supernatural justification for the whole arrangement I am not saying that warfare caused sexism much less that sexism caused warfare Rather the point is that warfare and male sexism were closely linked social inventions both of which arose to serve the same vital function namely that of preventing overpopulation and the consequent destruction of the natural resources needed by prehistoric human groups I have been led to this conclusion as a result of my attempt to explain a puzzling fact Recent studies by William Divide of City Universny of New York have revealed that warmaking band and village societies often killed their infant daughters and that they did so far more frequently than they killed infant sons The more intense the warfare the greater the difference between the number of buys and girls reared to adulthood Among those band and village societies whose population was known prior to the suppression of warfare there is an average discrepancy of 128 boys under 14 to 100 girls In contrast to an expected ratio of 105 to 100 at birth some groups have as many as 200 boys for each 100 girls That means that at least half of the girls born were artificially deprived of the chance to grow up From informants descriptions it appears that these infant girls were killed by smacking them on the head with a rock for example or by systematically neglecting to As band and village societies gave way to expansionist state societies warfare ceased to be effective in slowing population growth In fact it eventually became a part of a system for expanding growth through the incorporation of defeated peoples into everlarger imperial states But infanticide continued nut being confined to prehistoric bands flourishing as well in civilized societies as a principal means of family planning despite admonitions of church and state In India and China as has long been known female infanticide was common and the practice survett well into the present tentury During the last 101 years the British were horrified to discover that the ratio of male children to female children in parts of northern India was as high as 213 to 100 Anthropologist Mildred Dickeman contends that some castes destroyed all their female babies In China in regions such as Amoy and Fukien 30 percent of female babies were killed and in some villages it went as high as 80 percent From the time of Marco Polo onward European explorers and missionaries volubly expressed disgust and horror over the way savages and Orientals disposed of their unwanted children 13u1 recent investigations by historians have shown that infanticide was probably also common in England France Germany and Italy In England between 1250 and 1358 and then again between 1430 to 1545 the sex ratio of male children to female children was 133 to 100 In Italy it stood at 125 to 100 among the wealthy families of Florence during the 15th century Infanticide in the JudeoChristian tradition however was murder therefore every effort was made by parents to make it seem as if the deaths of unwanted babies was purely accidental The most frequent explanation of infant deathsuffocationwas handled by the parish priest not by the coroner Such deaths were routinely attributed to something called overlayingaccidental suffocation caused by a mothers rolling over on her infant in bed If the mother who was accused of overlaying was married and living with her husband she could expect to go unpunished except for having to appeal as a public penitent at the front of her church Unwed mothers similarly accused were treated differently they were labeled witches and were stoned to When a baby died from overlaying it was impossible to prove homicidal intent Obviously however if parents were strongly motivated to rear their babies they would seldom roll over on them The fact that they rolled over more often on girl babies than on boys proves that in a systemic sense overlaying was a form of infanticide Other surreptitious forms of infanticide were also employed It was a common spectacle to see the corpses of infants lying in the streets or on the dunghills of London and other large cities during the 18th century Eventually Parliament decided to intervene and set up foundling homes with various systems for collecting unwanted infants without risk to the donor Elsewhere babies were passed through revolving boxes set in the walls of foundling hospitals But governments were nut capable of sustaining the cost of rearing large numbers of children to adulthood and foundling hospitals quickly became de facto human slaughterhouses According to historian William Langer there were 150X admissions to Londons first foundling hospital between 1756 and 1760 Of those admitted only 44X survived to adolescence Additional thousands of foundlings were destroyed by wet nurses who were given employment by parish workhouses In order to economize parish officers assigned the infants to women who were nicknamed killing nurses or shebutchers because they could lx counted on to make sure that their missions to foundling institutions increased steadily throughout Europe during the early years of the 19th century In France admissions rose from 90000 a year in 1789 to 138000 in 1822 By 1830 there were 270 revolving boxes in use throughout France with 336297 infants legally abandoned from 1829 to 1833 Mothers who left their babies in boxes consigned them to death as surely as if they had dropped them in the river Between 80 and 90 percent of the children in these institutions died during their first year of life This information is relevant to the current debate about abortion but has not been taken into consideration as yet by either side It shows that Western civilization has a history of covering up and disguising the consequences of population pressure and the means that were ordinarily employed to escape from the burden of unwanted children The present intolerance of abortion has for its background centuries of tolerance of infanticide especially female infanticide In the past the issue was not the right of the fetus to live but the right of the child to live But the rights of neither child or fetus can be understood apart from the cultural history of sexism The guiding principle of male  chauvinism has always been that women are responsible for population pressures and that women and children should be punished for reproductive errors and the unintended consequences of sexual intercourse In my opinion the current opposition to abortion of the same One reason I found the practice of female infanticide among band and village societies so puzzling is that women are more valuable than men from the point of view of reproduction and reproduction is the key to the survival of any species Contrary to the ideological preconceptions of malecentered cultures most men are reproductively superfluous The fertility of a group is determined by the number of its adult women rather than by its adult men This can be seen by comparing a group of one man and 10 women with one consisting of 10 men and only one woman Since the one man can easily keep all 10 women pregnant the birth rate of the group with 10 women will be 10 times higher 11 than that with 10 men At first I was inclined to explain female infanticide merely as a further manifestation of male supremacy Since males are dominant it seemed logical that men should want sons rather than daughters However if women are to be the principal rewards for bravery and aggressiveness why go out of the way to limit the supply of wives concubines and drudges Since men exploit women the logical thing for them to do would be to rear more daughters than sons With their monopoly over weapons men would have little to fear if they were outnumbered If slaves can outnumber masters serfs can outnumber lords and workers can outnumber capitalists why could women not have outnumberd men Nor does the fact that males are more valuable than females in warfare clear away the paradox True sons will be preferred when the survival of the group depends on the brawny warrior Yet human beings have never failed to grasp the elementary truth that if a group wants many sons it must start by having many mothers The fastest way to expand male combat strength is after all to regard every little girl as precious and not to kill or neglect a single one But the pursuit of a policy of unrestricted population growth was no more feasible for our prehistoric ancestors than it is for us today The implications of unrestricted fertility are catastrophic By allowing free range to reproduction our ancestors could easily have doubled their numbers every generation which is a rate sufficient to convert the entire universe into a solid mass of human protoplasm in less than 2000 years To conserve resources such as wild game forests and soils band and village peoples therefore had to find ways to overcome the temptation to rear as many females as possible The dangers of overpopulation for them were far greater than the danger of limited warfare carried out with simple weapons As 1 now see it the peculiar inversion of values that rendered biologically essential females inferior to aggressive biologically superfluous males can be explained in no other way The only conditions under which it is preferable to rear sons is when one cannot afford to rear daughters These conditions exist lation begins to deplete the environment and to lower living standards to bare subsistence eventually threatening the very survival of the species The practice of female infanticide and warfare represented an extraordinary if grim victory of culturally induced behavior over natural impulses In an epoch when contraception was ineffective and abortion constituted as much of a risk to the mother as to the fetus infanticide was the only real alternative to overpopulation Nothing could be gained however by practicing infanticide with the same frequency against both male and female infants since as I have said males do not contribute equally to the population problem Male babies therefore could be raised in unlimited numbers and left to take their chances as adults and to perish in warfare Women were excluded from frontline combat and rarely died as a result of intergroup hostilities thus preventing warfare from mutually annihithe combatants Warfare contributed to the regulation of population in two ways in addition to the loss of A marriage ritual of contemporary Negritos in the Philippines The woman like valued chattel is carried over an obstacle custom not dissimilar to the carrying of a bride over a threshold life it caused First it led to the dispersal of enemy groups over territories separated by no mans lands in which valuable plants and animals were preserved and second it provided the immediate practical motivation and justification for the rearing of sons at the expense of daughters It took a very powerful cultural force to get parents to kill or neglect their own children But an especially powerful force was needed to get them to neglect or kill more girls then boys In the context of the simple economies of band and village peoples women were at least as valuable as men Since they could do everything men could plus giving birth and nursing children it was no simple achievement to make them seen less valuable The economic value of women was especially hard to mask where subsistence depended on simple types of horticulture for which women almost everywhere provided most of the muscle power True as hunters women were overshadowed But this resulted from the male monopoly over the weapons of war which were essentially the same as the weapons of the hunt The males hunting specialty arose from his warfare training not from a need to be brawny or a need for women to stick close to the campfire cook and care for the children Hunters like warriors are better off when they operate at less than maximum efficiency since the problem of overpredationtaking too many animalshas had far more serious consequences throughout history and prehistory than not taking enough Anthropologists have found that among temperateor tropicalzone hunters the supply of meat is limited more by the prey species than by the skills of the hunters Women hunters could easily substitute for men without reducing the supply In fact several recent studies have show that among horticulturists women usually provide more calories and proteins by growing plant foods and raising or capturing small animals even when they are prevented from hunting big game Moreover the need for women to nurse small infants does not naturally lead to their roles us cooks and homebodies Hunting is an intermittent activity and there is nothing to prevent lactating women from leaving their infants in someone elses care for a few hours once or twice a week Since band and village communities were organized around kinspeople women modernday working women and had no trouble in finding the preindustrial equivalents of baby sitters and daycare centers And of course since the men did not have 9to5 jobs there was no reasonexcept for warfare and male supremacismwhy they could not have minded the baby Freudians have long been aware that some kind of link must exist between warfare and sex roles but they have inverted the causal arrow and derived warfare from male aggressivity rather than male aggressivity from warfare This inversion has spread to other disciplines and hangs over the popular culture like a fog For Freud aggression was a manifestation of the frustrations of sexual instincts during childhood and war was simply socially sanctioned aggression writ large That men should dominate women followed automatically from the way in which the possessors of male sex organs and the possessors of female sex organs respectively experienced the traumas of childhood sexuality Boys compete with their father for sexual mastery of the same woman They fantasize that they are omnipotent and that they can kill their rival who in fact or fancy threatens to cut off their sex organs Thisthe central scenario of Freudian psychodynamic theoryFreud called For the young girl Freud envisioned a parallel but fundamentally different trauma A girls sexuality is also initially directed toward her mother but at the phallic stage she I makes a shocking discovery She lacks a penis The girl holds her mother responsible for her castrated condition and so she transfers her love to her lather because he has the valued organ which she aspires to share with him But her love for her father and for other men is mixed with feelings of envy because they possess something she lacks So while males must work out their Oedipus complex by learning how to be aggressive girls must learn to compensate for their lack of a penis by accepting a subordinate status and by having babies which symbolically stand for the lost penis Although this scenario sounds like sheer poppycock anthropological research has shown that there is widespread if not universal occurrence of psychodynamic patterns that resemble Oedipal strivingsat least in the minimal sense of sexually charged hostility between olderand youngergeneration males and penis envy among fdmales Freud was definitely onto something but unfortunately his causal arrows were backward I think what is poppycock is the idea that the Oedipal situation is part of human nature rather than a product of a specific set of cultural conditions All of the requisites for creating castration fears and penis envy are present in male supremacismthe male monopoly over weaponry the training of males for bravery and combat roles in training females to be the passive reward for masculine performance in the patrilineal bias in the prevalence of male polygamy female concubine age competitive male sports intense male puberty rituals ritual uncleanliness of menstruating women in the transfer of valuables at marriage and in many other malecentered institutions Obviously wherever the objective of child rearing is to produce aggressive masculine and dominant males and passive feminine subordinate females there is going to be something like a castration fear between males in adjacent generations and something like penis envy among their sisters and a great degree of suppressed hostility and anxiety between the sexes and ambivalence about sexual Although my theory holds that anatomy destines males to be trained to be fierce and aggressive if there is war it denies that anatomy or genes or instinct or anything else makes war inevitable Merely because all human beings In the world today and in the known past have lived in warmaking sexist societies or societies affected by warmaking sexist societies is not reason enough to cast human nature in the image of the savage characteristics required for war The fact that warfare and sexism have played and continue to play such prominent roles in human affairs does not mean they must continue to do so for all time With the development of safe contraceptive alternatives to overlaying killer wet nurses and other destructive means of regulating population growth the prospects for ending the thralldom of male supremacy have greatly improved Unfortunately after the rise of statelevel societies warfare acquired new political and economic functions unrelated to population control functions that were present only in incipient form among band and village societies Nonetheless as military technology becomes more and more computerized and handtohand combat becomes obsolete women may very well achieve full sexual parity Women are already taking their places alongside men in silos housing the intercontinental ballistic strike force And a female head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is no longer unthinkable as women move steadily toward the day when the first lady in the White House is the President I see no reason to doubt that sexism will eventually die out provided of course that our culture does not die out first If It does it will not be the fault of our genes but of our will and intelligence  Contemporary male Philippine Negritos in training

Rating the Raters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/13/archives/long-island-weekly-rating-the-raters.html,THERE is probably nothing more disconcerting to a public official than to have the entire record of his votes on complicated issues summarized by some organization with an impressive name and then be stamped pro or anti on some worthwhile cause Whether that cause is democracy good government or the environment such rating systems reflect primarily the prejudices of those who created them and brought them into existence They often have very little to do with the subject matter to which they are supposed to pertain Most recently I got a report from the League of Conservation Voters that rated me at 48 percent on a list of items they considered important to conservation Actually this wasnt a bad rating as the average score for members of the House was 49 percent and for Republican members 28 percent However it still is disconcerting to receive these kinds of ratings knowing that the general public does not know what they represent and therefore takes them seriously The very week this rating was brought to my attention I received letters from the National Wildlife Federation the National Audubon Society and the League of Women Votes of Long Beach each group congratulating me on my environmental votes Of course published ratings get more publicity than complimentary letters and they are harder to explain The best way to begin to understand this particular rating is to ask yourself what is the League of Conservation Voters Obviously it must be a group of people who got together dubbed themselves conservation voters and decided to take it upon themselves to judge who is voting correctly on environmental issues If I were to tell you that the League of Accuracy in Ratings Organizations has given this group a very low rating for accuracy in rating systems in fact has rated it zero you would probably be impressed Of course the League of Accuracy is something I have invented in order to make a point but I would probably have little trouble forming such a group if I wished and by doing so could issue any sort of ratings I wished The person choosing the issues on which the rating is based controls its outcome The end result is what has become known in Washington as the Rating Game This socalled League of Conservation Voters did choose 23 issues on which to rate Congressional members A discussion of a few of them will illustrate how totally misleading a rating system can be One of the issues on which I was rated wrong was my refusal to vote for black lung legislation The bill in question would have given every coal miner who had worked for 30 years lifelong Federal pension at taxpayer expense whether he was sick or not I felt that this ripoff of taxpayers funds was one of the most unjustified bills to come before Congress since I was first elected but I will leave it to the reader to fathom what on earth this has to do with conservation I was also given a negative rating for my opposition to more funds being spent on population research Whether or not you agree with me about the necessity of spending 16 million more on this program I do not believe that this can be called a genuine conservation issue Another issue this group chose to rate legislators on was abortion Somehow they have classified an important social issue into their environmental rating system Incredible but true It is this kind of flimflam that undermines the publics confidence in the ratings of such selfappointed watchdog groups I consider much more important in my environmental record work I have done to protect the environment in our Long Island area For instance a successful fight that I helped wage resulted last fall in the ap propriation of close to a billion dollars in Federal funds for the building of two vital sewagetreatment plants in the City of New York Presently the sewage is being dumped raw into the Hudson River making the journey into the ocean and eventually being dumped right onto our beaches I consider more important my fight to get a coordinated ocean monitoring program so that we can get early warnings of pollution problems developing off our shoreline This will provide a service that will have some real meaning to the people who live in our area I can only conclude that there are better ways to rate a Congressman than to adopt someone elses prejudices in the form of a socalled rating system John W Wydler of Garden City a Republican is the United States Representative for the Fifth Congressional District John Cayea
Califano's Appearance Is Picketed,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/13/archives/califanos-appearance-is-picketed.html,While more than 1500 pickets demonstrated outside for a womans right to abortion Joseph A Califano Jr the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare yesterday a rternoon fielded questions at an annual town meeting held al the New York University Law School on Washington Square South The occasion was Law Deans Day and Mr Califano had been invited to discuss his departments policies Much of his time was taken up with questions concerning abortions and the denial of Medicaid funds for such operations for poor women except for compelling medical reasons Speaking from the floor a woman in the audience told Mr Califano that she had undergone a safe abortion two weeks ago because she had Feen able to afford one She declared that the denial of Medicaid funds was forcing poor women to undergo backroom abortionslike one from which she herself had almost died 12 years agoand that Mr Califano was trying to impose his Roman Catholic tenets on the nation The Secretary replied that if he had felt he could not separate his religion from his duties as a public official he would not have accepted his current position He also noted that President Carter although different in religion and background shared his own opposition to the expenditure of public funds for abortion on demand The demonstration outside was organized by a coalition of womens groups favoring the right to abortion on request It began with a speech by former Representative Bella S Abzug who declared that a maledominated White House and Congress failed to understand the needs and rights of women The pickets drew about 30 counterdemonstrators representing groups opposed to abortion The antiabortion groups said they had learned of the abortion demonstration only the night before and did not have time to mobilize more of their supporters Durinc4 the questionina inside NYUs Vanderbilt Hall Mr Califano also discussed the issue of sterilizations and anounced past practices as outrageous He said his department would issue new and tougher standards next month The clay of promiscuous sterilization financed by HEW is over Mr Calfano declared The New York TimesMarilynn K Yee Proabortion demonstrators protesting the visit of Joseph A Califano Jr Secretary of Health Education and Welfare to NYU Law School yesterday
LETTERS TO THE NEW JERSEY EDITOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/13/archives/new-jersey-weekly-letters-to-the-new-jersey-editor-use-of-utility.html,Alas its been that time of year again Despite a state law that forbids signs on utility poles politicians continued to violate this law by tacking their names and faces on poles just about everywhere Indeed if Rockland Electric Public Service Gas and Electric and New Jersey Bell who own the poles refuse to prosecute and stop this practice then I suggest that the utilities instead of giving free advertising space to politicians charge these candidates and their respective political parties for pole space Perhaps with the additional revenue the utilities wouldnt have to ask us for such giant rate increases Abortions Women Must Have Freedom to Choose Chris Smiths recent letter on abortion contains just one statement with which I can agree We must work to provide positive alternatives to abortion I know of three such alternatives abstinence which is the solution of dreamers contraception which is the solution of realists and forced motherhood which is the positive alternative offered by Right to Life Birthright and the Catholic Church Until such time as sex education and the widespread availability of contraceptives combine to prevent the need for abortion access to abortion must be available so that women have the freedom to choose their own future be it motherhood or not Public funding of abortions through Medicaid must be provided so that this choice is not a meaningless one Those who oppose abortions are free to choose not to have them but to say that the Government should not fund abortions because of this is to say that the Government should not fund mass transit because not everyone takes buses and subways Restrictions on public funding of abortion must be removed both nationally and in New Jersey Yes lets eliminate abortions but this can only be done by freedom of dhoice not by mandatory motherhood Illegality or lack of funding has never stopped abortions and never will I challenge the New Jersey Right to Life Committee to endorse public funding of contraception for everyone who wants it Then we can together await the day when abortions are no more Gillette
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/14/archives/letters.html,To the Editor On Oct 19 the South African Minister of Justice announced that a number of organizations were declared to be unlawful and that certain publications were prohibited The banning of certain individuals including Percy Qoboza editor of The World was announced simultaneously Few people need to be reminded that race relations are a highly inflammatory issue That is why there is a law in South Africa prohibiting incitement of racial hatred Our Government has to prevent the polarization of black and white and take all possible steps to curb incitement of racial hatred or efforts to inflame emotions to the point of violence The fact that The New York Times insists on referring to those against whom the Government action was aimed as moderates reflects bias rather than the realities of the situation Since the unfortunate events of June 1976 in Soweto certain elements in the South African society have gone out of their way trying to inflame emotions in the field of race relations for ideological and political reasons This has been extremely disruptive to black community life School attendance had become all but impossible for black youths in Soweto Even such a staunch and internationally known opponent of my Government as Chief Gatsha Buthelezi has warned the Zulu nation against agitators who incite schoolchildren to destroy schools and boycott examinations The actions of the South African Government precipitated a flood of articles editorials and comment not only in the South African press as one would have expected but also in newspapers abroad including The Times This inordinate coverage of purely domestic actions by the South African Government raises an interesting question Where was this frantic clamor and extensive coverage when a South American bimonthly magazine was closed down a month ago  not by law but by executive decree When an African country in June simply nationalized foreignowned magazines without compensation the silence of the world press was stunning No longer able to deny that a double standard is applied when reporting on South Africa The Times editorialized recently that injustices elsewhere were rampant but that in South Africa they had become unforgivable Unfortunately The Times failed to mention or at least underemphasized certain very relevant points eg that there are still seven black newspapers regularly distributed In South Africa that the Governments actions were aimed at agitators and militants that the status of The World newspaper will be reconsidered as soon as the situation in South Africa returns to normal The South African Government has always placed a high premium on the freedom of the press and has shown tolerance with the press to such an extent that the editor of the London Daily Telegraph recently observed that he could not think offhand of any country in Africa so indulgent with newspapers so stunningly offensive to the Government President Carter must also take some responsibility for the present crisis since his pressures on behalf of South African blacks had encouraged black militant groups to believe that the United States was backing them to the hilt whether they acted in a peaceful or in a violent fashion This attitude of the US Administration obviously acted as an incentive for people who wanted to achieve their goals by violent means rather than by the peaceful means which President Carter propagates South Africa is a microcosm of the world in respect of racial national cultural and socioeconomic factors For that reason the prevailing circumstances called for measures which although unpopular and unreasonable in the eyes of the world and even among some South Africans would serve to insure that law and order was maintained in the Republic Without law and order there can be no development in fact no changes of any kind JOHAN ADLER Deputy Consul General of South Africa New York Nov 2 1977 What It Takes to Trap Solar Energy To the Laitor Steven Nadis letter Nov 3 is wrong when he asserts that we can switch from fossil fuels and continue to enjoy the scenery too The trouble is that the solar energy is available in a very dilute form spread out over all that scenery The solar radiation reaching the earths surface in the 48 contiguous states is arriving at about 1500 times the rate at which we use fossilfuel energy However biological trapping of solar energy by green plants in our temperate climate has an overall efficiency of less than 1 percent The overall efficiency of manmade solar energy trapping devices if one includes energy expenditures for manufacture maintenance and operation of the devices plants do all these things themselves probably is only a few percent Neither of these estimates allows for transporting the trapped energy to the place of its use Therefore an overall average efficiency for a mix of solar energy trapping systems can be expected to be about 1 percent This means that the recoverable solar energy available at the surface of the US is roughly 15 times what we need to replace fossil fuels Roughly 7 percent of the surface area of the country would have to be devoted to trapping solar energy That amounts to several goodsized states covered with solar panels and fuel crops PHILIP FILNER East Lansing Mich Nov 4 1977 Diminishing Wealth To the Editor It is becoming increasingly discouraging to hear and read about the various legislation that the Congress is enacting in the publics behalf regarding the inflationary spiral in the economy I would like to dwell on the pending Social Security changes and how the Congress has for years stubbornly kept this legislation inconsistent with income tax revisions By the continuing increases in our Social Security deductions they are admitting that both the cost of living and the salary scales in the United States are rising steadily Why then dont the income tax brackets change in direct proportion to and at the same time as the FICA deductions I am a wage earner in the mid20000 range with a family of four and a mortgage on my home I am barely able to survive from paycheck to paycheck because of all my payroll deductions including New York State taxes It is particularly appalling to find that I am still being federally taxed as though I were in a wealthy bracketa carryover from 20 or 30 years agowhen in fact I am in a mean income bracket Furthermore a graduated Social Security deduction would be much fairer than the present overbearing legislation before the Congress Since the time for acting is now I urge an adjustment to the Federal tax table structure in the immediate future WARREN A SCHLOSS Wayne NJ Nov 4 1977 Abortion Overkill To the Editor My understanding of Dr Chalmerss rationale [letter Oct 31] for ready access to abortion is as follows Older women who abandon the use of medically risky contraceptive pills will have a consequent rise in pregnancies and maternal deaths Since he reasons pregnancy carries with it a real albeit small threat to the life of women at the time of childbirth the obvious solution is ready access to abortion The reader Is left wondering if this ready access is intended only for older women or for all since all undergo risk although the risk is smaller for younger women The writer seems to be motivated by humanistic concerns Certainly he is not advocating abortion for purely selfish reasons Yet I fail to understand such need for overkill I assure you there is no pun intended Is it because certain elements in society cant see the forest for the trees Are todays humanists so completely absorbed in that which is visible and near at hand in the person of the woman herself that they crowd out any concern for the baby they would so casually destroy It is quite clear to me that proabortionists rhetoric represents nothing more than the presentation of just a partial picture which does not account for the existence of a true human being the unborn child WALTER F GEARY Massapequa LI Nov 3 1977 Yugoslavia Why an Ambassador Resigned To the Editor David A Andelmans Oct 31 news analysis on Yugoslavia carries one factual mistake which I should like to correct He asserts that the new Carter Administration ordered Mr Silbermans withdrawal I resigned as ambassador shortly after the Presidential election of last year effective Jan 20 1977 I did not wish to serve in the Carter Administration even for the short time it would have taken to recall a Republican appointee President Carters foreign policy direction was outlined by Zbigniew Brzezinski in the 1976 summer issue of Foreign Policy Brzezinski called for what I believed to be inordinate accommodation to one species of totalitarian impulse a species surely no less opposed to American interests and values than other varieties The Administrations brief flirtation with human rights notwithstanding my prior apprehensions do not now seem exc essive We have indeed seen a warming in our relations with Yugoslavia which did not deter the Yugoslays from recently sending US arms to Ethiopia in blatant violation of solemn agreements with this country as well as with Vietnam Cuba Eurocommunism the nonaligned bloc and recently the Soviet Union Our adversaries will always welcome unbalanced American concessions Some call that diplomacy others would give it a different name LAURENCE H SILBERMAN Washington Oct 31 1977 To Punish a Terrorist To the Editor The argument made by Thomas G Quinn [letter Nov 1] that the death penalty would put the word finis to the long saga of terrorism and hijacking does not hold water To believe that terrorists who already face the high odds of perishing under police flak would be deterred by the specter of eventual execution is puerile indeed If anything they would kill more hostages knowing they have nothing to lose but their lives As the British weekly The Economist once pointed out death sentences would probably instigate more seizures of hostages for the purpose of obtaining commutation of sentences Mr Quinn insists that a civilized society must have the death penalty in order to protect the innocent I say that a society unable to find a remedy for its ills without resorting to coldblooded killing is not civilized and I challenge Mr Quinn to say that Britain where the death penalty was definitively turned down is not a civilized country Not to mention Italy where out of 50 kidnappings in recent times only one resulted in the death of the victim Needless to say Italy does not have the death penalty Does Mr Quinn know that when pickpocketing was a capital crime scores of pickpockets would go to watch the execution of their esteemed peers in order to ply their trade among the crowds assembled at the fatal spot DAISY KOUZEL Atlantic Beach LI Nov 2 1977 On Retiring a Professor To the Editor Decisions to appoint professors to tenure are the most difficult in academic administration They determine over time the quality and intellectual vigor of a university faculty They involve guarantees of many years of security and freedom To extend those years by national legislation would force American universities into a most serious problem Can any means be found to terminate tenure before an excessive statutory limit without invading the delicate area of academic freedom How can any procedure for early termination assure that it Is the professor and not his ideas that are superannuated J DOUGLAS BROWN Princeton NJ Nov 1 1977
Asian Women Nurture a Growing Consciousness and Activism in Chinatown,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/14/archives/asian-women-nurture-a-growing-consciousness-and-activism-in.html,Goldie Chu is a tall slender softspoken woman from New Yorks Chinatown She is 46 years old and a mother of five Recently someone said to her I didnt know you were a militant feminist Well what is a militant feminist supposed to look like Mrs Chu asked as she recalled the incident with a laugh Still Mrs Chu knows something about both militancy and feminism for she will be representing the Asian American Womens Caucus at the First National Womens Conference which will be held in Houston Nov 1821 Mrs Chu is an example of the growing militancy and outspokenness among women in Chinatown While younger universityeducated Asian women have been politically active and vocal since the days of protest against the Vietnam War in the 1960s it has only been in recent years that older women with families have been moved to speak out and become more involved both inside and outside the community Mrs Chu was one of the two highest votegetters at the New York State Womens Meeting in July in Albany and the only AsianAmerican among the five tcp delegates She tied with Shawn Leach a I 6yearold black woman from Grecnburgh NY with 2056 votes beating out such feminist celebrities as Betty Friedan and Karen DeCrow I was astonished overwhelmed Mrs Chu said of her victory I didnt believe it I think they trust me because I have Ieen community based and I have been very clear as to where I stand SpecialInterest Caucus She has been active on the Two Bridges Neighborhood Council the Two Bridges Demonstration School Board and the Settlement Housing Fund among other groups In Houston Mrs Chus group hopes to join a specialinterest caucus to stress the needs of minority women The Asian American Womens Caucus a Chinatownbased multipartisan organization formed a year ago to encourage women to get involved in the political process will emphasize job opportunities for Asian women bilingual and bicultural education and expansion of social services Mrs Chu a native of Hawaii who came to New York at age 16 noted that Asian women seeking to confront American society must overcome stereotypes People wonder if you are a Suzie Wong type or if you are docile Some Asian women respond by rejecting their culture to prove how unChinese they are she said You dont have to be one or the other You can be yourself Im privileged that I can pick and choose from the two cultures I am quiet most of the time but theres a time to shove and scream Virginia Kee another Chinatown activist was the first ChineseAmerican to be elected judicial delegate of the United Democratic Organization a local group She is a teacher at Junior High School 65 where 70 percent of the students are Chinese We are still regarded as passive and quiet she said Others tend to sweep by us and think they can get away with it I may be traditional in manners but not traditional in fighting for change in the community where there is so much to do Our needs are growing due to the larger number of immigrants and were pretty fed up Mrs Kee who is married to a doctor practicing in Chinatown had her early lessons in the civil rights struggle as a youngster living among blacks in Charlotte NC Twelve years ago she helped found the Chinatown Planning Council a multiservice agency While only a handful of women have put themselves In the public eye outside the community many others like Beverley Jung have been active in Chinatown Ran for School Board Disillusioned with the quality of education especially the lack of bilingual and bicultural programs for minority children Mrs Jung a housewife in her 40s and the mother of two young daughters decided last spring to run for a position on the District 2 School Board her first attempt to win office Asians must stand up and be counted Mrs Jung said We pay our taxes like everyone else and we have no representation I want my daughters [aged 8 and 3] to have the best possible education Mrs Jung did not win but she concludes that she scored a victory nonetheless Im glad I did it said Mrs Jung the wife of a post office supervisor It was hard work and often very frustrating and I loarned from it The first time I gave a speech I was petrified but I developed confidence as I went along I intend to keep active and Im going to win next time A growing militancy has emerged too among the garment workers in Chinatown most of whom are women It is estimated that close to 10000 women mostly immigrants with a language barrier are employed in the more than 300 factories that operate in the area Today it is not uncommon for factory women to stop work to argue for better wages they are paid by piecework when they believe that they are getting too little Is there an Asian womens movement In the last few years groups ranging from informal consciousnessraising gatherings to activist organizations have been formed In addition some women have joined other thirdworld or multinational groups But most of the women interviewed conceded that establishing a strong movement would be a formidable task Jane Chen Ozeki 29 a staff aide to City Council President Paul ODwyer and a longtime resident of Chinatown said that one of the problems was in reaching many of the working women in the community Their immediate concerns are not so much about abortion or the equal rights amendment she said but rather in day care and hospital care for the elderlythings that affect their everyday lives Just being a woman is not common enough ground to bring them out Mrs Chu the delegate to the Houston Conference agreed that it was a problem to bring women together because of different timetables language and needs However she stressed the importance of the equal rights amendment and abortion issues Asian women like everyone else want equal pay for equal work she said As for abortion Im sure that if they knew there was a choice they would make a choice Asian women are not baby machines There is no answer on how to reach all women she added but weve got to try any way we can
"Women's Movement at Age 11: Larger, More Diffuse, Still Battling",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/15/archives/womens-movement-at-age-11-larger-more-diffuse-still-battling.html,Eleven years ago this month a handful of women met in Betty Friedans ruby and sapphire Victorian parlor on the West Side and announced they were seeking true equality for all women in America They were members of a new group with an urgent acronym NOW for National Organization for Women and many feminists point to that meeting as the birth of the modern womens rights movement Now 11 years later as 10000 women from all over the country prepare to converge on Houston for the National Womens Conference opening Friday the womens movement has mushroomed from that small group in Betty Friedans parlor into a diverse and unwieldy group comprised of dozens of organizations with hundreds of thousands of members Mothers daughters and grandmothers pledge allegiance to the movement as do married women and single women heterosexual women and lesbians white women and minority women professional women homemakers and women on welfare Some prostitutes are movement sympathizers and the Girl Scouts of America openly endorses the movements goals What used to be a minority movement is now thousands and thousands of women all woven through the fabric of society said Miss Friedan author of the trailblazing The Feminine Mystique Its not just one group anymore and thats why you cant see The movements major adversary is a wellorganized coalition of antiabortionists some religious groups and political conservatives who call themselves collectively the profamily movement They too will be out in force in Houston Among the issues to be debated at the fourday conference financed by 5 million provided by Congress are such key womens issues as abortion the equal rights amendment and lesbian rightsconsidered to be the three most controversialplus homemaker rights child care credit employment education health minority women media older women rape and battered wives Two of theseabortion and the equal rights amendmenthave been the most vulnerable issues of the movement with feminists suffering major setbacks in both areas The Supreme Court ruled last June that states can refuse public financing for elective abortions and Congress is currently haggling over bill that will probably ban the use of Medicaid funds for most abortions A conservative backlash has stalled passage of the equal rights amendment three states short of the 38 needed to ratify it Still few people would disagree that the womens movement has had a profound impact on American societyespecially in the areas of work education and malefemale relationships Some feminists say that the most significant change has been the flood of women out of the kitchen and into the labor market where 4u million of them now hold jobs comprising around 42 percent of the total work force Of married women more than 50 percent now have to juggle a job with a family The impact of the womens movement is also reflected in the 64 percent of American men and women questioned in a recent Harris Poll who said they favored efforts to strengthen and change womens status in society It is also measured in the 70000 members of the National Organization for Women which in 1970 had only 3000 members Approximately 80 percent of the 2000 official voting delegates to the Houston conference are committed to the movements goal of improving the status of women and eliminating barriers to equality A Major Test Despite this broad spectrum of support many people inside and outside the movement regard the Houston conference as a major test of the movements strength and of its future Some predict the conference will bestow on the movement an everlasting life while others say it will send it to an early grave As Bella S Abzug the former New York Representative who will preside over the conference sees it the meeting will result in a new stage of the movement a coalescence of everything that has been done in the past Betty Friedan on the other hand C S the potential for a female Nuremberg fire if members of such conservaIve opposition groups as Stop ERA the Eagle Forum the John Birch Socioty and the Ku Klux Klan disrupt the conference as threatened creating an inflamed hysteria that she thinks will encourage legislators from the 15 unratified states to vote against the equal rights amendment Phyllis Schlafly the Alton Ill liciesetvile and law student who is the main visible leader of the rightwing opposition forces predicts the Houston conference will be the death knell of the womens movement Oh they will pass all their resolutions through she said But the resolutions will be perceived as radical and not in the mainstream and the libs will learn that lesbian privileges and child care and the equal rights amendment and abortion are antifamily goals and not what the American people want Where exactly is the movement right now on the eve of the historic convention believed to be the largest convocation of women in this country How and why did such a vocal and wellorganized opposition spring up And what are the movements achievements and failures The movement has in the words of one of its most popular slogans come a long way baby since its turbulent infancy those years from 196S1972 that verti marked by rhetori marches aryl militmcv The early 1970s saw the rapidly growing movement brutally split by what became known as the lesbian issue Heterosexual women who felt uneasy about the new openness and militancy of deshians began to withdraw from the movement At the same tame a group of lesbians led by Rita Mae Brown and Charlotte Bunch both writers angrily left the womens movement and forged a lesbian feminist separatist ideology The heart of this movement was the Furies a lesbian collective in Washington DC Today the split seems almost healed although Jean OLeary of the National Gay Task Force said she thought some black and other minority women still had difficulty accepting lesbians in the womens movement The split has healed within the movement said writer Kate Millett an early movement leader who announced in 1970 that she was bisexual But Im sure it will come up again as the sticky wicket in Houston where Phyllis Schlafly and her rightwing people are all followers of Anita Bryant and rabidly bigoted about gay people and will have a fit about gay rights Issue Has Alienated Many The lesbian rights issue perhaps more than any of the other feminist issues has alienated many men and women from the movement One extreme example of male hostility is the reaction of the Ku Klux Klan Robert Shelton imperial wizard of the Klan said recently that the organization had infiltrated the womens movement and that Klansmen would be in Houston to protect our women from all the militant lesbians who will be there While the lesbian issue was receiving nationwide publicity between 1970 and 1973 womens groups with philosophies completely opposed to the feminist movement were beginning to spring up Marabel Morgans group The Total Woman which started in Florida in 1971 taught its members to admire and appreciate their husbands even to the point of greeting them at the front door now and then wearing seethrough baby doll pajamas Opposition to the womens movement grew rapidly after the Supreme Court legalized abortion on Jan 22 1973 While feminists claimed the decision as a major victory many women who were opposed to the movement before mainly because of its proabortion stand joined such antiabortion groups as the National RighttoLife Movement and March for Life Were getting stronger every day because we see euthanasia coming said Nellie Gray a Washingtonlawyer who reads March for Life But the biggest blow of all to the movement occurred in November 1975 when state equal rignts amendments were stunningly defeated in both New York and New Jersey Those defeats are believed by many to have led directly the present impasse of the national equal rights amendment The success of local antiERA forces in defeating the two amendments led to the formation or strengthening of many similar groups across the country most of them coordinated by Mrs Schlaflys Stop ERA group whose members will provide much of the opposition in Houston The ERA is the centerpiece of their whole design said the 52yearold Mrs Schlafly who plans to lead a separate profamily rally in Houston while the official Governmentsponsored conference is taking place Under their rationale it would give them the opportunity to litigate for their other goals This is one area where Mrs Schlafly and her counterpart in the womens movement Betty Friedan agree The crucial issue for women in 1977 is the ERA Miss Friedan said There is no question about it Its the constitutional underpinning for what weve done and what we want to do If they succeed in blocking it they would be taking back with one hand what we took years in winning Members of Mrs Schlaflys profamily movement seem especially threatened by the equal rights amendment because they view it as harmful to the homemaker and the family I just dont think it would be healthy for family life said Annetta Stern a Westchester County housewife who founded the group Operation WakeUp that led the opposition to the state equal rights amendment in 1975 For one thing it would allow gays to marry and adopt children If anything ever happened to me I dont want to thank that gays could adopt my children The possibility of homosexual marriages is just one of what the amendments proponents call scare tactics used by the antiERA forces Those opposed to the amendment also say It would lead to unisex toilets increase the power of the Federal Government take away more rights from women than it would give them and dilute alimony and child support laws The proponents say the amendment would do none of these things Profamily members who make up an estimated 20 percent of the delegates to the conference believe that a womans place is in the home that a man should be legally forced to support his family and that school textbooks should portray woman as wife and mother man as provider and protector With For God Home and Country as its motto the coalition opposes abortion daycare centers school busing and pornography The scope of that opposition is one indication of how pervasive the womens movement has become Another indication is that some younger women according to other feminists seem to be taking the decades victories for granted and accepting certain equalities as given Theres an indecent lack of gratitude Catherine Stimpson a professor of English at Barnard College and the editor of Signs a feminist scholarly journal said of some of her students They accept its benefits but God forbid they should make the ideological commitment They look at it as history as a kind of distant auntpart of the family a little eccentric something thats just around Perhaps you can only be a good feminist over 30 youve been knocked around and you have a strong enough sense of sexual identity Although NOW remains the premier feminist group dozens of other smaller groups have sprung up around specific issues They include Stewardesses for Equal Rights Dykes and Tykes the Coalition of Labor Union Women the National Black Feminist Organization and the National Conference of Puerto Rican Women There are several areas where the movement has accomplished little or nothing Out of 435 members of the United States House of Representatives only 18 are women There are no women Senators and no women members of the Supreme Court Nationally women hold only 6 percent of elective offices And although women are entering the work force in unprecedented numbers they are still a long way from achieving pay parity with men In 1976 according to the Bureau of the Census men working full time earned a median income of 13859 compared with 8312 for women Another shortcoming of the womens movement is that it has never appealed to significant numbers of black or other minority women who tend to view the movement as racist and elitist Despite the movements weaknesses Kate Millett views the Houston conference with optimism Its sort of wonderful she said because its not just the movement women but womenwomen from all over the country librarians women in real estate farm women women who have never been to a meeting before Theyre the ones she said who are going to save the situation in Houston The libs will learn that lesbian privileges and child care and the equal rights amendment and abortion are antifamily goals and not what the American people want Phyllis Schlafly What used to be a minority movement is now  woven through the fabric of society Its not just one group anymore and thats why you cant see it Betty Friedan
Five Pioneers In Medicine Get Lasker Awards,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/17/archives/five-pioneers-in-medicine-get-lasker-awards.html,Two pioneers in the development of an important diagnostic technique and three world leaders in the study of the vital body substances called prostaglandins were named yesterday as winners of the Albert Lasker Awards in medicine Two Swedish scientists Dr Inge G Edler and Dr C Hellmuth Hertz shared the 815000 Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award for their pioneering work in applying ultrasonic vibrations to the effective diagnosis of heart disorders and other erloo illness The technique has advantagas in that it requires neither radiation oor surgery The Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award also 15000 was shared by two other Swedish scientists and one from Great Britain Dr K Sane D Bergstrom professor of chemistry and former chancellor of the Karolinska Institute Dr Bengt Samtieeaain chairman of the department of chemistry at the same institute and Drlohn R Vane Of Wellcome Research Laboratories Beckenham Kent England  The three were cited for discoveries and other pioneering research concerning prostaglandins a group of natural body substances that have widely varied and important effects in regulating such things as blood clotting blood pressure stomach acids and some aspects of pregnancy Announced at St Regis The awards were announced at a news conference at the t Regis Hotel in Manhattan by Mrs Albert 1 Lasker president of the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation The Lasker Awards are among the most prestigiouS in American medicine Since they were established in 1944 28 of the award winners have later won Nobel Prizes In the1977Lasker Award citation Dr Bergstriim was described as the acknowledged world leader in prostaglandin research The importance of the hormonelike substances of which about 50 natural types are known has been appreciated only in the past decade One prostaglandin prevents the clotting action of platelets which are normal blood constituents for that reason the appropriate prostaglandin or an artifical variant is considered promising for treating heart attacks and strokes that are caused by blood clots Another closely related prostaglandin is a powerful dilator of blood vessels and has been used in animal experiments to reduce blood pressure Dr Michael E DeBakev chairman of the award committee said that clinical experiments were being done in Europe to test the value of prostaglandins or their variants in improving the circulation of patients suffering from obstruction of arteries of arms or legs Yet another prostaglandin has a strong effect in causing the uterus to contract and is coming into medical use for inducing labor and for purposes of abortion The citation noting that Dr Bergstrom developed the clinical use of this particular prostaglandin said that it has major implications for future research into the regulation of human fertility Fertility Control Tests Dr Bergstrom chairman of the World Health Organization Advisory Council on Medical Research said that 15 nations are currently testing the potential of prostaglandins for fertility control In discussing prostaglandins in general lie said they appeared to be among the earliest regulatory substances to arise and had been found in organisms as ancient as coral Dr Samuelsson was cited for exceptional accomplishments in discovering and explaining the process by which prostaglandins are produced and metabolized in living things In related work he determined that compounds called endoperoxides essential to all prostaglandin metabolismcause blood platelets to aggregate a step in the clotting process New Avenue of Study This information provides a new avenue of study for the causation of coronary occlusion [heart attacks] and stroke the major killers in the western world the citation said Dr Vane was cited for his discovery of prostaglandin X now called prostacyclin which prevents the kind of blood clots that may lead to heart attacks and strokes Dr Vane also discovered that aspirinlike drugs inhibit th formation of prostaglandins thus providing a longsought explanation of aspirins therapeutic effects and suggesting that some prostaglandins are involved in or contribute to such aspects of illness as fever pain and inflammation In the clinical awards citations Dr Edler head of the department of cardiology University Hospital Lund Sweden was described as the father of echocardiography This is the diagnostic technique in which ultrasound is used to visualize structure and action of internal body organs such as the heart by the use of the echoes generated when the ultrasonic waves are reflected back from solid tissues Applied Knowledge of Physics Dr Hertz head of the department of electrical measurements Lund Institute of technology was cited for bringing extraordinary technical knowledge and imagination from the field of physics to diagnostic medecine and thus laying the foundation on which many of todays ultrasound advances have been built The Lasker award jury said ultrasound technology had proved to he valuable not only in diagnosing heart conditions but also in studying other regions of the body as well including the pelvis abdomen brain eye blood vessels and even the embryo within the mothers body One of the major advantages of ultrasound as a diagnostic tool is that it is noninvasive that is it provides information without the need of injection surgery or the potentially damaging effects of Xrays 4 the news conference yesterday the vise of ultrasound was demonstrated in a 312yearold boy Anthony Corbett the son of Mr and Mrs William Corbett of Pelham for whom the technique had earlier been used in actual diagnosis of a heart condition which was corrected later by surgery

both Korea and Southeast Asia American presence and commitment are vital to the maintenance of peace United States military presence and commitments in the Far East may mean peace to Japan but to Americans during the past 32 years they have meant two long unwon wars over 14 years of wars that cost Americans enormously in lives limbs and less precious but very valuable resources Japan felt none of those years of conflict except to grow fabulously rich on war profits Japan has had neither an army navy nor an air force of her own since the end of World War 11 being satisfied with a small home defense force so long as the United States is committed to defend her For years Washington and the news media have been telling the American people that the United StatesJapanese Treaty is a mutual defense pact Flexible Work Hours And the PartTimer To the Editor Your Nov 9 report from Washington by Steven V Roberts Flexible Work Hours a Success Study Says deserves readers appreciation for calling attention to corporations and companies throughout the country now swinging into flextime and flexwork to make work hours less rigid for employees These new developments on the work scene have also opened up opportunities for parttime employees With two employees parttime on one joban idea of special appeal to mothers older women and retirees who may need to supplement their incomeflexwork is a congenial way to remain productive to industry and to themselves The more than 2000 organizations which have adopted the system include Control Data which gave it its impetus in 1960 Chrysler Sun Oil General Electric banks insurance companies pharmaceutical houses and the US Geological Survey Many state governments too are instituting it In April of 1976 the US Senate Committee on Human Resources held hearings to weigh the advantages and possible legislation to implement these new work plans The first senator to testify support was Walter F Mondale He described everybodys ideal job as a job that satisfies our needswhether by providing enough money flexible work hours good benefits or just plain satisfaction Presumably he found his As reporter Roberts indicates unions may not be overly enthusiastic about taking jobs out of longfixed hardwon time frames But the push for greater job freedom flexibility workers satisfaction and attention to retirees too is on Californias Association of Bay Area Governments put it in a nutshell Why should the 40hour workweek be more sacred than the 50to60hour workweeks that preceded it HELEN ALPERT New York Nov 10 1977 The treaty is in fact a onesided commitment on the part of Washington to defend and it should be abrogated The United States stands alone in the Far East committed in case of war to fight in defense of nations there unwilling to prepare to defend themselves Japan being one of them When Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda arrived in Washington last March he first held a news conference at which he defended Japans trade practices and objected to President Carters plan to withdraw some United States troops from South Korea Two days later at the end of talks with Mr Fukuda President Carter announced that he had recommitted the United States to defend Japan and that the two countries would work for increased trade To Japan increased trade is a oneway route exports to the United States no imports to Japan except ores and raw materials As we come to the end of the year we read that the United States trade deficit with Japan is expected to jump 2 billion to a staggering 76 billion Thats not half the true deficit_ A nation with little or no resources of her own Japan imports from the United States massive quantities of ores other raw materials fuel and scrap valued in the neighborhood of 10 billion annually Add to the United Statess unfavorable trade balance the value of our natural resources imported by Japan and we come closer to the true deficit for 1977 176 billion It also gives us a better idea of the economic licking the United States is taking from Japan Prior to World War II when trade between the two nations was on more reciprocal basis Japan was always the one with the unfavorable trade balance as she should be in this year 1977 Prime Minister Fukuda Ambassador Togo the Japanese public and President Carter cannot expect American young men to go across the Pacific and lay down

morality were to be the ultimate guide in hiring teachers as Msgr Eugene V Clark advocates in his Nov 3 letter a dangerous precedent would be set Would it not give the millions of Americans who are morally outraged at the Catholic position on abortion birth control and womens rights the right to insist that no Catholic be allowed to teach im pressionable young children Some kinds of personal morality are best kept personal CAROL COGSVILLE Trenton NJ Nov 7 1977  To the Editor In answer to Rabbi Abraham Hechts Nov 9 letter I do not understand your fear of children growing up to he homosexuals because they may emulate the life style of their teachers that were the case I should have grown up to be a nun Remember also that Hitler issued the Law for the Restoration of the

Island NY Nov 10 1977  To the Editor Further on the matter of homosexual teachers Two of my high school teachers in Florida were male homosexuals One taught Latin and the other English and both had a great effect on my life Because of their intellectual interest in me they encouraged me to develop my writing talents Today I make a very comfortable living by the use of the English language During my years in that high school not one faint hint or suggestion of improper conduct was made to me by either of those teachers 1 was however seduced by a 30yearold lady who taught appropriately biology JOHN W CONNOR Pittsburgh Nov 6 1977 City Finances and the Banks About Spreading the Bad News To the Editor When I called the attention of the New York State Assembly Committee on Banks last month to the news medias exhaustive coverage of New York Citys financial difficulties in 1974 and 1975 it was not my intention to embarrass The New York Times with an excess of praise Without naming names I was saying that it and other organs of news and comment had done their job effectively the fact that they had done so proved a point I wished to make I was responding to allegations that underwriters of New York City notes including the bank of which am chairman failed to make adequate disclosure of adverse information about the citys financial condition My point was that the adverse information was widely and prominently displayed in print and on the air and that this constituted broad and effective disclosure The Times demurred In an editorial on Oct 29 it quoted my comment on the medias coverage and then said Well now much as we prize the power of the press and worrisome as the citys fiscal news became that winter we rise to reject the honor Further on the editorial conceded that information was available but added That does not mean it was understood Was that a chop one wonders at the readers or at the writers If the latter three Times reporters who had been responsible for much of the papers coverage of the citys financial troubles in 197475 wererightly believeless selfdeprecating in the letter they addressed to the Columbia Journalism Review early in 1976 They were responding to an article by Martin Mayer which severely criticized The Timess coverage The letter signed by Steven R Weisman Fred Ferretti and John Darnton rebutted Mr Mayer in great and convincing detail citing story after story that had documented the citys financial problems Mr Mayer had written Nobody who read the news stories or the News Analysis that often runs beside them could have discovered how bad things were The reporters said of that The most charitable thing to be said about his comment is that it disingenuous The last place I had ever expected to find myself was in the crossfire of an argument between professionals over a question of journalistic performance But here I am and since The Times used my testimony to introduce not only its own disclaimer but also a generalized attack on the good faith of all the banks that underwrote New York City notes I will deal with the second point as well The main question said the Oct 29 editorial is why these major financial institutions continued to underwrite and sell city securities when they knew or had reason to believe that the whole financial house of cards was about to tumble What our bank knew was that the city needed to maintain access to the public market as a source of funds What we believed was that the city officials would take the steps required to improve the citys fiscal practices and sustain investor confidence That is why we continued to underwrite and sell the citys notes We had confidence in them as investments our bank increased its investment holding from 50 million in early March 1975 to 98 million at midApril When the public market closed to the city because the necessary fiscal reforms had been too long delayed we continued to work to help the city pull through doing our part along with the aid that came from Albany and later from Washington The city did pull through not by the efforts of the banks alone but importantly with their help And all niocs bought by the

Excerpts From New National Catechetical Directory Adopted by Bishops for Roman Catholics in the,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/18/archives/excerpts-from-new-national-catechetical-directory-adopted-by.html,WASHINGTON Nov 17  Following are excerpts from an unedited version of Sharing the Light of Faith the newly approved National Catechetical Directory for Roman Catholics of the United States Hopeful Signs in Catechetics in the United States While catechetical ministry in the United States faces many problems there are also many hopeful signs and trends These will be discussed first before some of the contemporary problems affecting catechesis are examined Catechetics is taking increasingly into account significant contemporary developments in the sacred and human sciences For some time it has also given particular attention to social justice prompted by Scripture and the social encyclicals of the popes especially since Leo XIII Catechesis is recognizing the con temporary concern for education in morality and values encouraging this within the framework of the teaching of Jesus and His church the influence of Gods spirit and parental guidance In many places lay people are assuming increasing responsibility and leadership in catechetical work Women especially women religious have made impressive contributions to catechetics for a long time now their role is expanding further as they assume new responsibilities and roles of greater leadership in the church Lay involvement is receiving significant impetus from representative and advisory bodies developed since Vatican II Theological Pluralism Pluralism in theological expression of faith common today is not new in the history of the church Found in the New Testament and present in the early centuries in the great theolog ical currents of the West and the East pluralism grew and manifested itself in the course of time in a variety of theological schools Catechists must be sensitive to the distinction between faith and theology There is one faith but many theologies In regard even to matters which admit of a legitimate variety of theological opinions the common doctrine of the church and the belief of the faithful are to be respected The unequal value of various theological systems should be recognized Which particular topics should be raised in catechesis and when they should be raised are questions to be determined by the readiness of the learners and the preparation of the teacher When engaged in the teaching dimension of their ministry catechists teach not in their own names but in the name of the church From the church they receive a commission and under the direction of its hierarchy they are to carry out their ministry Problems There are also serious problems Many Catholics express little or no confidence in organized religion say their religious beliefs are of limited or no importance to them and are registered in no parish Surveys indicate that with respect to doctrine many Catholics are poorly informed about their faith or have deliberately rejected parts of it Many express doubt that the Pope s infallible when he teaches solemnly in matters of faith and morals that there can be such a thing as eternal punishment for evil that the Devil exists that the church has a right to teach on racial integration There is widespread acceptance of remarriage after divorce of sexual relations between engaged persons of artificial birth control of legal abortion in certain cases Even many churchaffiliated people Catholics and others make no conscious connection between their religious beliefs and their moral choices While most Catholics have not seriously thought of leaving the church a growing number have abandoned active membership This phenomenon varies considerably with age and education generally decreasing with age and increasing with the level of education People under 30 who have attended college have been most affected Catechetical Criteria Since catechesis seeks to foster mature faith in individuals and communities it is careful to present the Christian message in its entirety In practice this means recognizing a certain hierarchy of truths These truths may he grouped under four basic heads the mystery of God the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit Creator of all things the mystery of Christ the incarnate Word who was born of the Virgin Mary and who suffered died and rose for our salvation the mystery of the Holy Spirit who is present in the church sanctifying it and guiding it until the glorious coming of Christ our Savior and Judge and the mystery of the church which is Christs Mystical Body in which the Virgin Mary holds the preeminent place All truths taught by the magisterium pertain to faith but some central to the Gospel message and necessary for salvation enjoy a higher priority in that they shed light on the others Catechetical Guidelines for Ecumenism While Christians are called to support and encourage ecumenism catechesis should point out that human efforts alone cannot restore Christian unity Catechesis can however foster ecumenism in a variety of ways by clearly explaining Catholic doctrine in its entirety and working for the renewal of the church and its members by presenting information about other Christians honestly and accurately avoiding words judgments and actions which misrepresent their beliefs and practices by communicating the divine truths and values Catholics share with other Christians and promoting cooperasion in projects for the common good Catechesis should he especially sensitive in dealing with the Orthodox churches which have so much in common with the Catholic tradition The Jewish People For several reasons Catholics in the United States should be especially sensitive to relationships with the Jewish people First Catholics share a common heritage with them a heritage not only of biblical revelation rooted in faith in the one true God and the liberation of th Exodus event but also in the family origins of Jesus Mary and the apostles Second the largest Jewish populations in the world are our fellow citizens Finally the tragic and scandalous persecution of the Jewish people over the centuries including the terrible holocaust in Central Europe and active persecution up to this day calls for specific and direct repudiation of antiSemitism in any form and determination to resist antiSemitism and its causes Christs passion and death cannot be blamed on all the Jews then living without distinction nor upon the Jews of today the Second Vatican Council explicitly repudiates the hatred persecutions and displays of antiSemitism against the Jews at anytime and from any source

Shah Visit Was Marked by Oil And Tear Gas,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/20/archives/shah-visit-was-marked-by-oil-and-tear-gas-woman-power-in-houston.html,The visit of the Shah of Iran to Washington last week was not forecast as a routine affair but it exceeded expectations  The capital was rocked by violent demonstrations A grassy park near the White House became for a tumultuous few minutes a battleground as opposing Iranian factions clashed  In a striking turnabout the Shah announced before flying on to Europe that he would do the United States and the rest of the industrialized world a favor and actively support a freeze on 1978 oil prices After perusing the world economic situation we have come to the conclusion to give you a break he declared From the Carter Administrations point of view it was wellnigh mandatory for the President to court the Shah however unseemly it might appear because of Irans strategic importance as a big producer of oil and as a Middle Eastern neighbor of the Soviet Union But there was obvious concern about how it would all look as the President who professes to be disturbed about human  rights infringements and weapons sales abroad set about to woo an absolute monarch whose country is already the United States best arms customer and who is in the market for still more military hardware Concern about appearances acceleraged as soon as the Shahs limousine pulled up Police lines collapsed and several hundred pro and antiShah demonstrators many of them armed with nailstudded boards began fighting in a park near the White House Nearly 125 people including 28 police officers were injured President Carter the Shah their wives and others involved in the ceremonial greetings dabbed at their eyes as tear gas wafted their way Throughout the Shahs twoday stay chanting mobs crisscrossed the city There were reports that some of the Shahs supporters traveled great distances to reach Washington and that their expenses were covered by the Iranian Government For all the furor the Shah at a predeparture news conference gave his host a goingaway present Specifically the Shah promised that when the 13 oilexporting nations meet in Caracas a few days before Christmas his will be a vote for no price increase next year The Shah who had earlier said he would go along with the majority at the meeting or at best remain neutral insisted that his abrupt shift was motivated by compassion not by his keen interest in buying 140 more F16 fighters and other Americanmade arms as part of a longterm weapons agreement At the White House a spokesman noted that Irans security was of course a highpriority matter But there were no signs that Mr Carterwho already has problems aplenty with Capitol Hillis in any hurry to rush into yet another dispute with lawmakers who in the past have been decidedly reluctant to give the Shah everything he wants Woman Power In Houston The impact of the womens movement is everywhere and for proof a growing number of Americans have to look no further than their own households Organized evidence can be found at the National Womens Conference being held this weekend in Houston If the movement began among a few relatively privileged women it has since developed grassroots consciousness and that is made plain by the 2000 delegates to the conference who fairly accurately reflect the general female population But gauging the movements political success is harder and proof of that is also in Houston By tomorrow the conference an outgrowth of the 1975 International Womens Year will draw up an agenda of womens issues proposing legislative action in areas such as child care equal opportunity homemaker rights and rape The Government though can simply ignore the agenda It is not even binding on any womens organization and within the conference there are serious potentially explosive disagreements The most divisive issues are abortion lesbian rights and the equal rights amendment and while feminists are likely to prevail they might do so only after long disputes with profamily delegates some of whom have challenged the 5 million spent by Congress for the conference as part of the United States contribution to the womens year These delegates tend to be politically conservative but they also include members of more extreme groups such as the John Birch Society and even the Ku Klux Klan The equal rights amendment perhaps best demonstrates the depth of emotions its passage or defeat may be as important for what that reveals of the movements strength as for what the amendment actually says Now with the amendment mired three states short of the 38 needed for adoption some womens groups with Carter Adminisration support want to extend the deadline for ratification beyond March 1979 Whether that can be done legally is in dispute A Settling Of Accounts The circle has come round on tragic episode of the civil rights movement Fourteen years later someone was held accountable last week for the dynamite bombing in 1963 that killed four black girls in a Birmingham Ala church used as a headquarters by civil rights demonstrators For some people in Birmingham the fact that Robert E Chambliss even stood trial for firstdegree murder showed bow far the city and state have come on racial matters Three blacks were on the jury that convicted Mr Chambliss once an active member of the Ku Klux Klan in the South of the early 1960s blacks almost never served on juries The Alabama Attorney General Bill Baxley prosecuted the case and apparently he has not been hurt politically in his expected race for Governor next year More indictments may be returned in the case and other Birmingham bombings as much as 20 years old but evidence is hard to find Most of the evidence against Mr Chambliss was circumstantial including testimony that he had boasted before the bombing After Sunday morning theyll beg us to let them segregate Mr Chambliss 73 years old was sentenced immediately to life in prison More Rubles Fewer Bushels A farmer who isnt making money is an unhappy farmer But a consumer paying higher food prices isnt happy either Last week President Carter convinced that he wouldnt be treating any pain for the average consumer took steps to ease the pain of the American farmer And the Soviet Union looks like it is about to give an unintentional assist Farmers are unhappy because three years of bumper crops have meant record grain surpluses and record low prices Meanwhile production costs have risen In the first nine months of this year costs were up 4 percent and prices down 7 percent To relieve the pressure President Carter last week ordered set aside 10 percent of the acreage on which corn and other animal feed grains are usually cultivated That means that 108 million acres could lie fallow and feedgrain surpluses could be reduced Farmers dont have to idle any land but if they dont they wont get price supports or other Federal agriculture subsidies The Soviet Unions contribution to American farmers was two more big grain orders and nicely timed The new crop year is only six weeks old and already Russia has bought twothirds of the 6 million metric ton limit set by the 1975 SovietAmerican grain trade agreement That fact combined with recent reports that the Russian harvest was off this year may mean Moscow will buy up to this years 15 million metric ton limit American surpluses would go down even further but not far enough to raise consumer prices The Agriculture Department insists that grain prices would have to at least double before a loaf of bread would cost a penny more in the store The Economy Up Down Sideways When President Carter pulled back from presenting a tax reform package this year he said he needed to weigh the impact on the economy of the new Social Security and energy taxes now being debated in Congress before deciding what to propose And so he does But the President and his advisers must also consider the signals the economy is sending about its present state Unfortunately last weeks important statistica revision in the Gross National Product for July August and Septemberwasnt much help on the big question that of the recoverys staying power even though the number was revised upward That is because the increased rate of growth from 38 percent to 47 percent of the countrys total output of goods and services reflected among other things a onetime shot in the arm from an unusual jump in United States exports They grew it turns out 119 billion not the projected 95 billion because manufacturers stepped up deliveries to shippers to try But even a 24 billion increase in exports wont make much of a dent in one of the more worrisome features in the economic picture The countrys mounting trade deficit is now projected at nearly 30 billion for this year the previous high was 64 billion in 1972 The Carter Administration is considering a number of measures aimed at making domestic industries hard hit by imports more competitive Energy the Current Way Forced to decide whether to put the Federal Government in the business of setting standards for electric utility rates Congressional conferees have adopted a principle of electricity They took the path of least resistance last week agreeing because of Senate firmness that state regulatory commissions would only have to consider new ideas for rates that President Carter recommended as significant oilsavers Utilityrate reform was important to the President whose energy package is meandering through the conference committee at a pace that makes a question of whether it will finish work by the end of the year And if Mr Carter had hoped to hurry the committee along by postponing the foreign trip he was supposed to begin on Tuesday he has failed The conferees decided to take this whole week off The proposed utility reforms would create incentives against waste One time of day pricing would make it more expensive to use electricity during peak hours a concept already being tried by power companies in 26 states though mainly on an experimental basis with a few commercial customers Another idea seasonal rates would penalize consumptiOn during busy times of the year as the Consolidated Edison Company does in New York during the summer As a group however utilities lobbied hard against the Carter proposals out of fear that their profits would shrink What the conference did was accept the principle of reform but not of rigid Federal pricing standards But it also helped the Government and utility customers who want to go to court on the issue of rate reform so consumer organizations could claim a measure of victory Clyde Haberman and Caroline Rand Herron Photo by Martin Adler Levick Associated Press The New

Women's Parley Begins Action Over a Rights Agenda for Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/20/archives/womens-parley-begins-action-over-a-rights-agenda-for-nation-no.html,HOUSTON Nov 19The 2000 delegates to the National Womens Conference gut to work today on a national agenda on issues affecting the health homes jobs and institutions of American women and quickly approved several items on a 26point agenda including a resolution in favor of the ratification of the equal rights amendment Approval of the resolution by an overwhelming margin came after an hours lively debate The conterence whose purpose is to make recommendations to the President and Congress for the elimination of barriers that still prevent womens full participation in all aspects and areas of American life opened this morning with addresses by Rosalynn Carter Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson and Representative Barbara Jordan whose district includes Houston In the afternoon and evening as the delegates elected by 56 meetings around the nation met in their first plenary ses sion they ratified the first eight of the 26 feminist resolutions drafted by the International Womens Year Commission and endorsed in some form by a majority of the statelevel meetings of women sponsored by the commission earlier this year The delegates expect to leave here early next week with a National Plan of Action to be submitted to President Carter and Congress as a blueprint for Government policy Approved were resolutions recommending more Federal support to assure equal opportunity for women in the areas of art and the humanities Federal and state and local legislation that would aid women beaten by their husbands Presidential action to further the role of women in business Government financing and support for childabuse programs assumption by the Federal Government of a major role in providing for and overseeing child care equal access to consumer credit support for physically disabled women and nondiscrimination at all levels in the schools No Confrontations Materialized Despite widespread early reports of a possible confrontation between the delegates and the thousands of observers at the conference at the Albert Thomas Convention Hall who are divided into profeminist and antifeminist factions there were no confrontations between the groups On the convention floor they traded jibes and barbs About 300 delegates calling themselves prolife and profamily voted unwaiveringly against the several resolutions that were passed A Pennsylvania delegate questioned the seating of the conservative Mississippi delegation with an allegation that there were Klansmen in their midstwhich Mississippi denied and on which Pennsylvania lost  delegate Joan Cuhhins  of went to the microphone to convention a railroad Earlier some delegates had wondered if the pomp and processionals of the moring sessiong which had as presiding officor Bella S Ahzug former on Manhattan was the calm before A stormy floor fight over procedural issues Among the 26 resolutions are a call for ratification of the equal rights amendAnother resolution advocates Federa financing for abortions Alcetings called by a variety of caucuses fast night indicated that some of the real disagreements were arising between groups with special interests and v omen who believe that with the of America upon Texas feminists Should try their best to show their solidariy by supporting all 26 items with be dispatch riecessary to complete the approval process in only two full days of deliberation That attitude seemed to have prevailed in the afternoon sessions yesterday The resolutions that passed did so with relative ease particularly at the very beginning of the plenary session Those planks would provide for the following things Art and humanities Equal opportunities for women in upper level positions in Federally funded cultural institutions such as libraries museums universities and public television and radio as well as more equitable representation on commissiors and in the awarding of Government grants Battered women Women who have been beaten by husbands and male companions should have shelters available Federal local and state governments through news media campaigns and training programs should make those shelters possible and widely accepted Business All Federal agencies involved with business should be directed by the President to increase the participation of women and programs to increase that participation should he encouraged Child abuse Centers for the treatment and prevention of child abuse should be Government financed and fostered Child care The Federal Government should assume a major role in providing lowcost child care centers and private industry should he encouraged to provide child care programs for their employees Credit The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 should be enforced and a campaign conducted to educate women of their credit rights Disabled women The disabled should he integrated into all aspects of American life through education full employment and other means Education Discrimination in academic and sports programs should be eliminated in the schools at all levels Bilingual programs should be expanded and textbooks and curricula reviewed to eliminate sexual and racial stereotypes Carol Bellamy heads the New York State delegation which has voted overwhelmingly to support the entire plan and leave most of the amending to the new husines section at the final session Monday The overriding interest she said yesterday is in passage of all 26 resolutions Thats not aimed at denying debate but if you start amending you could go on forever The arts plank is important and it needs more teeth in it So does welfare But I think if amending would make things very difficult it should be a secondary concern An array of organizations ranging from representatives of the handicapped to welfare mothers disagree saying that there are specific parts of the plan that affect them and should be changed In fact some delegates said they believed that the conservative opposition to the plan was exerting a more important force than the tedious amending it was expected to attempt Advocates of the right to abortion find their cause under the heading Reproductive Freedom at No 21 on the list The equal rights amendment is No 11 Welfare is just before the last item the Womens Department a plank advocating a Cabinet  level department for womens affairs This proposal has drawn unexpected fire over charges that it would mean tokenism and separatism in the executive branch Jean OLeary the only one of the conferences 46 commissioners who is a selfproclaimed lesbian is deeply concerned about the placement of the sexual preference plank a resolution for lesbian rights that is No 23 on the list Were looking for this conference to give us a mandate or a wcmandate whatever she said If it looks like we wont get to it we may amend other resolutions like employment to include lesbian rights questions Betty Friedan an atlarge delegate disagreed strongly with that tack Realistically she said there is only one issue for women this year and thats the equal rights amendment Any group that puts their issue ahead of that is playing right into the hands of the right wing I think everything else is subsidiary We cant quibble at this point The conference is sponsored and paid for by the Presidentially appointed Commission on the Observance of International Womens Year The delegates each of whom received travel expenses and a living allowance of 50 a day This morning at the opening ceremonies of the conference Mrs Carter and two of her predecessors Mrs Ford and Mrs Johnson praised womens rights their husbands and one another They were followed to the platform by Representative Jordan and she began and ended her speech to standing ovations Mrs Carter who said that she had been sent as a personal emissary by the President spoke about the growing opportunities for women in the Carter Administration as well as the achievements of Mrs Johnson and Mrs Ford I think it is significant that the three of us are here in Houston together on this platform today to affirm the continuity in our Governments efforts to improve life for all she said The New York TimesTeresa Zabala At yesterdays opening of the National Womens Conference in Houston were from the left Rosalynn Carter Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson
Losing Still Hurts,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/20/archives/losing-still-hurts-lobbying-in-the-public-interest-is-more.html,WASHINGTON It had to be the atmosphere that was created around the bill the issue of campaign contributions says Representative John M Murphy a New York City Democrat explaining the recent defeat of his cargopreference bill The bill would have required that 95 percent of imported oil be carried on United States ships Throe years ago a tougher version requiring 30 percent of imported oil to be brought in on American ships breezed througb Congress though it was vetoed by President Ford The difference this year was that Common Cause the publicinterest lobby took aim at the legislation and published a list of 215 House members who had receivat 449410 from maritime unions in their 1976 campaigni Common Cause called the bill a political payoff one that also would have increased the cost of oil to the consumer The defeat of cargo preference which had White House and labor support illustrates both the growing influence of publicinterest lobbies and the way concern for procedures of accountability has affected legislation It was Corn mon Cause for example which led the successful filth for disclosures of campaign contributions and it was thoso disclosures that the lobbying group used effectively to kiIs the Murphy bill Its selfperpetuating says Representative Benjamin S Rosenthal Democrat of Queens They support measures that provide for more information and spotlights and then the information produces more reforms As a class these lobbying organizations claim to spell for consumer interests as opposed to specialinterest lobbies which generally represent producersbusiness an labor groups or trade and professional organizations The specialinterest lobbies reward friendly Congressmen with campaign contributions still important despite the trend toward public financing of elections and they rely on businessmen and union leaders in a Congressmans district to apply pressure Publicinterest lobbies concentrate instead on the press and television their weapons are the news conference and streams of studies and reports And as with the energy bills still being debated last week by a conference committee both types are much in evidence as important legislation reaches the final stages The broadbased organizations tend to be better known Common Cause the Consumer Federation of America the various Ralph Nader groupsbut singlepurpose lobbies also have proved effective These are organizations such as Energy Action Friends of the Earth Bread for the World and the National Clean Air Coalition Sometimes they conflict with each other the Committee for Handgun Control for example opposes the Citizens Committee for the Right to Bear Arms and the National Abortion Rights League works against the National Committee for a Human Life Amendment This generally has been a good year for these lobbies They have been important to the passage of ethics codes in both the House and the Senate the Clean Air Act a strip mining bill a water pollution control act and legislation to create a Legal Services Corporation and a Consumer Cooperative bank Some lobbies regard the air and water pollution standards approved in conference this month as too lax and they oppose delays in enforcement but they regard the bills as progress nevertheless They did however lose the consumer protection bill and a battle for public financing of Congressional elections legislation which was postponed They were defeated on a bill to provide managerial reforms in the House and to give consumers standing in various lawsuits Part of the overall success can be attributed to the political climate Given Watergate and the Korean influencebuying scandal Congress and the public probably were ready for such legislation as a strong Congressional code of ethics But the right atmosphere doesnt necessarily lead to any results says Fred Wertheimer vice president of Common Cause His organization and others took advantage of the favorable climate to intensify their media campaigns and increase the outpouring of information their primary stocksintrade Still some publicinterest lobbyists had expected more this year largely because of President Carters campaign commitments to open government and consumer issues A number of highlevel jobs in the Administration were given to alumni of the publicinterest lobbies For instance Carol Tucker Foreman former executive director of the Consumer Federation of America the nations largest consumer lobby is now an assistant secretary of agriculture Joan Claybrook who headed the Public Citizen Congress Watch a Nader group is administrator of the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration But some of these people now say it is harder to move the Federal bureaucracy than they had anticipated and others even question the support they have received from the White House on consumer Issues One difficulty according to James Flug director of Energy Action is that while publicinterest lobbies have gotten stronger so have the business lobbies who have a lot more money to spend on advertisements mailings and grass roots work Critics however say that the failings of the publicinterest groups are of their own making At the White House and on Capitol Hill there are complaints that the lobbies have become arrogant and heavyhanded that they generate and then exploit Congressional fears that they are insatiable and perhaps ungrateful Youll come up with a massive reform package and they snipe at you on secondary issues says a liberal Congressman who often supports these groups Another Congressman complains that the lobbyists spend too much time on public relations and not enough on cultivating the sort of personal relationships that special interest groups understand help get bills passed The public interest lobbyists are unmoved by such criticism Some are flattered by it If they are unloved they feel at least they are respected and much of the criticism is the kind directed against those who wield power Martin Tolchin reports on Congress for

misfits and perverts he said Im sick and tired of the Presidents wives flimflamming with these perverts he added in a reference to the fict that Rosalynn Carter Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson appeared at the opening session of the womens conference Like a Black Baptist Church When the crowd began interrupting almost every sentence with applause and cheers Mr Smothers said It seems like we are inside of a black Baptist church The speakers sat on a bluecarpeted platform in the front of the huge arena underneath a large American flag and big red letters that spelled out the words From us

Women's Conference Approves Planks On Abortion and Rights for Homosexuals,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/21/archives/womens-conference-approves-planks-on-abortion-and-rights-for.html,HOUSTON Nov 20Resolutions advocating legal abortions and homosexual rights both highly controversial national issues were approved tonight by the National Womens Conference There were tears jeers bitter disagreement and radically polar speeches before the resolutions on reproductive freedom and sexual preference were passed and made part of the national agenda for womens equality that is being worked out here The only resolution remaining to be considered tomorrow proposing the creation of a cabinetlevel Womens Department is facing unexpected opposition froM some longtime feminist leaders During the debate on the sexual prefence resolution which proposed legislation to forbid discrimination against homosexuals thousands of observers in the gallery held balloons with the slogan We are everywhere Both conservatives who consider lesbianism morally wrong and feminist delegates spoke against the proposal One of the latter called the resolution an albatross But the motion carried and the balloons went up The debate and aftermath of the reproductive freedom resolutiona plank supporting Government funding for abortions as well as sex educationwas more emotional When the cheers went up from those who had voted yes some women who had opposed the resolution rushed to the stage with a blownup photograph of an aborted fetus Many of those women sobbed and shouted All we are saying is give life a chance Those in favor of the resolution chanted Choice Earlier Harmony The bitter looks exchanged between the two groups were in great contrast to the moment of unity earlier tonight when substitute resolution on the rights of minority women stronger and more specific than the one proposed by the leadership was overwhelmingly approved by the delegates The substitute motion lauded by some delegates as the most comprehensive plank in the national agenda for womens equality that is being prepared here was put forward by a coalition of minority women It speaks individually to the problems of Hispanic black American Indian AsianAmerican and Alaskan native women as well as decrying the double discrimination experienced by women from all these groups Coretta Scott King one of the 46 commissioners leading the conference delivered the substitute to the delegates After joining in the singing of We Shall Overcome she said We have come a long way We still have a long way to go Like the resolution supporting the proposed equal rights amendment which was approved late last night the minority plank is a cornerstone of the 26 recommendations that would if enacted into law entitle women to equal opportunities in education employment and their personal lives and would help them take advantage of those opportunities Except for the minority womens plank the 25 resolutions adopted by this evening were those drawn up in state womens conferences and by the National Commission on the Observance of International Womens Year which is sponsoring the conference The voting patterns too have been those made apparent when the 2000 delegates were elected in state meetings earlier this year About 80 percent support the commissions National Plan of Action while about 300 delegates calling themselves prolife and profamily vote unwaveringly against each of its provisions These delegates whose satin lapel ribbons proclaim them members of the Majority expressed bitterness today over the strict enforcement of parliamentary procedure saying it deprived them of a voice in the conference They contended heatedly that the resolutions had in the words of Joan Gubbins of Indianapolis chair of the Indiana delegation been shamelessly railroaded through The leadership retorted that dispatch was needed to work through the agenda in the allotted time The conference empoWered by Congress to identify the barriers to equality for women and to make recommendations for remedies and provided with 5 million in Federal funds for that purpose is to complete its work tomorrow The resolutions will be forwarded to the President and Congress for legislative action Margaret Costanza assistant to the President for the Office of Public Liaison was noncommittal today about what action the President could be expected to take on the plan She said that Mr Carter would restate his support of the equal rights amendment in his next fireside chat Resolutions Approved The resolutions approved so far in addition to the equal rights amendment and the minority plank deal with the following  Art and humanities Women should have equal opportunities in upperlevel positions

Government should also vigorously oversee questionable drugs and methods of surgery used oh women  Homemakers Laws relating to marriage should be based on the assumption that it is an equal partnership The responsibility accompanying divorce should be shared effective methods for the collection of child support should be adopted and widowed or divorced homemakers should be aided through Government programs  Insurance The state should insure the equal treatment of women in this field The model regulations to eliminate unfair sex discrimination drawn up by the National Association of

programs on women Welfare Welfare and poverty should be considered major womens issues Programs should provide women on welfare as well as poor working women with employment opportunities continuing career education and practical job training While the passage of each of these resolutions in alphabetical order produced widespread clamor and cheeTs jubilation at the success of the 11thsupporting the proposed constitutional amendment giving women equal rights still three states short of enactmentwas greater than all the rest There was an hour of debate that ineluded a loud and impassioned plea for passage from Betty Friedan the feminist leader and a pleading question from a Montana delegate who said softly Were not really sure where the ERA is going to take us you see Then the resolution passed just before midnight producing a roar which the chair Mary Anne Krupsak Lieutenant Governor of New York could not silence even though the gavel she pounded was one used by Susan B Anthony borrowed from the Smithsonian Institution for the occasion The cheering eventually became a spirited rendition of The ERA Was Passed Today to the tune of Deep in the Heart of Texas On the other side of that question deep in the heart of delegations that termed themselves profamily there was no singing only complaints that parliamentarians at the conference were denying them debate Sarah Lore of Normal Ill said bitterly on the convention floor This is a sham This conference is run by lesbians and militant feminists

were men at the National Womens Conference which ended here today They were small in number but they made their presence felt as delegates commissioners and behindthescenes officials Nobodys ignored us thats for sure said Mark A Godbold a 22yearold Mississippi delegate In fact some of the women didnt treat me so well They called me all sorts of names that a gentleman wouldnt repeat Mr Godbold a prelaw student from Jackson was a member of the group of men who received the most attention at the conferencethe six male members of the allwhite 25member Mississippi delegation a conservative profamily group who opposed abortion the rights amendment and lesbian rights as well as other issues The biggest controversy concerned the mens room Mr Godbold said today in his soft Southern drawl Some feminists kept putting a homemade sign that said Women over the only mens room because theirs was so crowded Once when I was in there some of them came in and said I was in the wrong place I asked them What do you suggest I do Thats when they cursed  Another member of the delegation William T Billy Temple of Jackson a retired Army lieutenant colonel said he felt bad when a group of young women delegates in the Hyatt Regency Hotel called him a male chauvinist pig when he offered to help some older women delegates with their luggage I was very disheartened seeing the elderly ladies struggling with their bags while younger women nearly ran them down the husky silverhaired man said Ive never seen such a lack of concern as I saw here When you try to speak with someone they come back at you with sonic smart remark just because youre a male There was a total of seven male delegates at the conference the six from Mississippi plus Oliver Willis an alternate delegate from South Carolina who registered for the conference but was not seen once by his delegation inside the convention hall Voted as a Bloc As a result the 27member delegation today issued a statement asking Mr Willis and two other profamily alternate delegates from South Carolina to return the airfare and the 50aday per diem paid to each delegate by the conferences national commission We werent against every resolution they introduced Mr Godbold said We all voted for credit and for child abuse and we split on all of the other issuesexcept for the ERA abortion and homosexual rights We voted as a bloc against those three In fact the Mississippi delegates were so disappointed by the passage of those later three resolutions that today they issued an enigmatic statement saying To all those here assembled be it known and remembered as the Federal chain forged at this time and place in the history of our great republic binds more tightly in the years to come that the great sovereign state of Mississippi did not forget its links Dr Curtis Caine a Jackson anesthesiologist who was half of one of three husbandwife couples in the Mississippi delegation said he was dismayed that the women in America were represented by the elements here More than 60 percent of my patients are women he said and they dont feel the way the majority here feels To them lesbian rights is a shocker and being for murder is a shocker The feminists here spit on God by flagrantly renouncing hid Decalogue and his plans for creation Homer G Morgan Jr a 26yearold accountant from Hattiesburg Miss said his biggest disappointment about the conference was that he thought the minority Viewpoint had not been adequately expressed Many times after the resolutions were introduced not enough debate was allowed before the question was called he said Or else we werent allowed to get to the microphone to express our point of view And when we asked that some of our people be allowed to speak the conference officials said no Among the other men who played important roles in the conference were three of the five male members on the 45member National Commission on the Observance of International Womens Year who showed up for the conference They were Sey Chassler of New York Senior Vice President and editorinchief of Redbook magazine John Mack Carter of New York editorinchief of Good Housekeeping magazine and Harry T Edwards of Ann Arbor Mich professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School The two other men on the commission Senators Birch Bayh Democrat of Indiana and Charles Percy Republican of Illinois did not attend I didnt feel in the minority here I felt very much a part of the renaissance of the womens movement Mr Chassler said In fact I probably received more undeserved congratulations than I would have if I werent a man Thats because so few men are visibly involved in the womens movement that one reaches out to whatever man is there Behind the scenes Rocky Pomerance the former Miami Beach police chief who handled security arrangements for the 1972 Republican Convention served as the conferences security consultant and Ruben Bob Lev foreign service officer with the State Department served as the conferences executiveofficer or moneyman as he was known He was in charge of allocating the 5 million budget and handling the money taken in at the conference I felt like a bull in the cow barn he said but I dont think any of the women resented me We all got along very well

The Women's Work Is Not Yet Done,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/23/archives/the-womens-work-is-not-yet-done.html,The National Womens Conference in Houston has left its imprint largely on the minds of those who were there It will be their task to make the experience meaningful to the nation The 2000 women who attended the meeting as official delegates of their states voted overwhelmingly for 25 proposals to promote the equality of women That was no surprise The Government need not have spent 5 million to learn that women at such a conference would endorse the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution vote for Government help with the problems child care child abuse wife beating equal credit opportunity access to good jobs and the like Beyond that we found one value in the meeting and one risk The value lay in the election of convention delegates through open state meetings bringing hundreds of new faces into the political arena There were more old and young women more blacks more Hispanics in Texas last weekend than is usual at events promoting womens rights There were also a few hundred delegates who opposed almost all the resolutions The familiar star writers and politicians of the womens movement remained largely in the background to let the new voices be heard But such stabs at democratization fell considerably short of producing an assembly representative of the women of America Politicians in Washington and state capitals will still look to their mail boxes and not to Houston for guidance on how to vote on the issues the women put forward The conference therefore also represented a risk to its organizers and to the cause of womens rights There was little to gain from the fourday pep rally except perhaps a stirring of tired blood for battles ahead There was however something to lose For Houston gave forth a contrary assessment of the needs of women at a counterrally staged by Phyllis Schlafly the leader of the opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment Mrs Schlafly condemned the amendment as well as publiclypaid abortions and rights for homosexuals as antifamily and antiAmerican She too claimed to speak for a majority of women The strength of this backlash is a tribute to the movement that spawned it The Schlafly attack is worrisome however because it sees a denial of womens rights as the essential prop of the family The womens rights movement did not cause the undeniable erosion family life Rather it is more nearly the result of that erosion Mrs Schlafly may dream of a Norman Rockwell world that no longer exists in most places but she has aroused inordinate fear among some women about evolving life styles To her supporters ERA is an outrageous attempt to integrate restrooms and to force women into the front lines of the next war To them governmentprovided day care for the poor is a rude intervention of the state into the intimate relationship befween mother and child They are wrong But the women who are frightened by such rhetoric need to be reassured The Houston gathering was only one phase of a long educational process
Women's Conference: The Follow‐Up Is Next,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/23/archives/womens-conference-the-followup-is-next.html,When it was all over the delegates at the National Womens Conference in Houston had to keep reminding themselves that they had not made law The motions to amend and the points of inquiry the sitting and the standing had produced a long list of specific programs for battered wives and abused children for working and minority women and for the equal rights amendment But the delegates had not made law they had only made recommendations to be forwarded to the President and Congress News Analysis The members of the National Commission on the Observance of International Womens Year most of them leaders of major womens groups will lobby for legislative action based on those recommendations They have also enlisted the aid of a White House assistant Margaret Costanza to keep their cause before the President State Actions Planned The delegates will continue state actions planning vacation and convention boycotts of states that have not ratified the equal rights amendment and campaigning and voting for legislators who support their resolutions But both groups realize that no one is bound to follow their suggestions and that affirmative action will depend on how well they follow up their efforts and how seriously those efforts have been taken to begin with Some were made hopeful of that action by the presence at the conference of Rosalynn Carter and her daughterinlaw Judy who has become the Administrations spokesman for the equal rights amendment Others were pessimistic because of the Presidents recent stand against Government financing of abortions And those delegates about 20 percent who objected to the agenda drawn up here because of the issues it supportedparticularly lesbian rights legalized abortion and the amendmentand the Government intervention it espoused shrugged and said that Mr Carter had always been sympathetic to the radicals and the lesbians It was all of a piece with his giving away the Panama Canal they said Disappointments for All In some ways the conference with Federal funding and a Congressional mandate was the sort of situation in which there was something to disappoint everyone The conservatives thought it was determinedly radical the radicals thought that some of the actions taken were too mild and the moderate vision prevailed The equal rights amendment sometimes thought of by radical feminists as essentially reformist was the centerpiece of the convention The sexualpreference platform which guaranteed lesbian rights passed by a decided majority But before it did one woman asked that its last section approving lesbian custody of children he considered apart from the others and two delegates who had fervently supported the rights amendment asked that the measure be defeated One of them called it an albatross around the vulnerable neck of the womens movement Many of the women who supported the abortion resolution classified themselves as the Id never have one myself but variety Populism prevailed and tokenism went down to defeat at the closing session when the final part of a national plan of action prepared by the American commissioners of International Womens Year did not pass A resolution calling for the creation of a Cabinetlevel womens department it was resisted by the 2000 delegates because it did not originate in the state meetings at which most of the delegates were elected because many of them thought it would permit the Federal Government to shunt women into a corner of its concerns and because there was some suspicion that it wag designed to provide a job for one of the commissioners It was the only resolution not passed But like all such gatherings the impact of the meeting on the nation and on the womens movement must be measured not only in its suggestions but also in its spirit Inefficient hotel operatons and a sudden decision to attend the conference to see history being made resulted in women who had never met before sharing rooms Old acquaintances were renewed and new ones forged and the final hours of the conference were spent passing around copies of the national plan Perhaps most important two groups of people who had long seen each other as twodimensional spent three days together in one convention hall Conservative delegates were surprised to learn that some of the liberal delegates were as pleasant and carefully coiffed as they Some of those supporting the equal rights amendment turned in their seats to make idle conversation about the resolutions that was often more fruitful than confrontation had been in the past Bella S Abzug presiding officer insisted that the antiabortion bloc have a chance at the microphone That bloc complained bitterly of being muzzled but lauded the chairman of the Saturday session an Ohio member of the National Organization for Women as honest and fair Why the predicted fullscale altercation between the two sides never took place is debatable Bringing in the socalled profamily delegates who were meeting in town to protect the conference could have produced an image of divisiveness that might have been disastrous for the womens movement in general and the conference in particular The fact that it did not take place may not change anyones mind about the universality of the goals of either but in a bad year for feminists with the equal rights amendment stalled three states short of passage and the prospects of Government funds for abortion poor even the appearance of reason was regarded as an advantage What shall you sow What shall you reap asked representative Barbara C Jordan at the conclusion of her keynote speech The first question has been answered in part here The answer to the second will depend on whether the men in power think that the women in power here spoke for theft constituencies
Campus Mood: The Focus Is on Grades,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/23/archives/campus-mood-the-focus-is-on-grades-campus-mood-focuses-on-grades-as.html,Shortly before noon one day recently 18 members of the Spartacus Youth League gathered near the sundial at Columbia University and chanting slogans and carrying placards began marching in a circle to protest a visit to the campus by recruiters from the National Security Agency About 100 yards away a larger group of students apparently oblivious to the demonstration gathered quietly in line to await the flacon Opening of the new studentrun cooperative grocery store The relative size of the two groups suggested much about the interests and priorities of the current generation of students of campuses throughout the metropolitan area  In contrast to the 1960swhen student activists such as MarkRudd at Columbia were drawing large numbers of students to antiwar demonstrations and leading takeovers of campus buildingsstudents now show little outward interest in social and political issues  Libraries and study areas are populated into theearly hours of the morning and the main priority an most students minds would seen to be what the Columbia College dean of students Henry S Coleman termed the almighty grade point average The Silent Generation The common Wisdom is that the pendulum of Campus life has swung back to where it was in the 1950s when writers spoke of the pervasive apathy of the silent generation In fact interviews by The New York Times at a dozen local colleges and universities suggest that the sittation is not quite that simple If there is a new silent generation today it is one whose character has been profoundly shaped by the turbulence of the intervening decade Though outwardly inactive ttudentS who grew up watching a war on their livingroom television sets seem to be far better informed about current issnes and injustices in the world than their predecessors of two decades ago Its just that were much more cynical about our ability to change things said Gary Cohen a senior at Columbia With all of the political protest of the 1960s very little happened The economic situation means that even relatively affluent students must now help support themselves and the intense competition for jobs and places in graduate schools has put pressures on presentday students that were unknown in the 1950s Most of them are so weighted down by the academic challenges fhey face that they dont seem to enjoy college said Howard Crosty dean of students at Rutgers I dont think todays studentshaVe enough fun  Generalizations aboutthe mood of an entire campusmuch Jess that of an entire college generationare always dangerous but the themes of declining political activism and increased academic seriousness run through interviews on all of the campuses surveyed The Kent State Issue At Rutgers for example only 200 students showed up for a recent appearance sponsored by the student goverment of one of the students wounded by National Guardsmen at Kent State in 1970 and a group of students at Barnard College recently abandoned plans for a rally in favor of elective abortion We were afraid that no one would show up said Joan Storey one of those involved Polls indicate that students are informed about issues such as the racial situation in South Africa but many did not know who Mark Rudd was when he recently surrendered to the police after years of hiding And efforts to encourage divestiture by the colleges of stocks in companies doing business in South Africa will often draw considerable support By and large though the issues that inspire student action are local Students at Queens College for example have Organized lobbying efforts in behalf of low tuition and increased support for the City UniVersity and a oneday boycott of the food service at Columbia fait spring to protest its quality was 95 percent effective People are more concerned with what affects them directly said Howard Leib a sophomore At Cornell a student recently started a campaign of civil disobedience urging people to violate parking regulations to protest inadequate parking space on the campus The dome of Sib ley Hall now bears the painted inscription Protest Student Activism A search for security seems to dominate much of student life Theres a trend toward nice safe curriculums said David Alexander a law student at the State University Center at Buffalo Placement offices have extended their hours and last spring at New York University more than 500 juniors signed up for workshops on topics such as resumewriting and interviewing skills At Rutgers tines begin forming the night before when such major companies as Bell Telephone announced job interviews A Lesson in Frugality Theres a sense of scarcity around said the Rev William Starr Episcopal chaplain at Columbia The idea of dropping out and dropping intaking a year off to do tenant organizing or somethingis really gone At Columbia the children of the middle class are getting a lesson in frugality Such attitudes affect social activism We circulated a petition on [stock] divestiture and some students told us they wouldnt sign because they didnt want trouble from the CIA said Mr Starr Maybe theyre right Students suggested other factors in the social attitudes of the mid1970s including the absence of leaders and the lack of a single overriding issue like the war in Vietnam Theres so much ambiguity today said Marianne Goldstein a junior at Barnard Everyone was against the war but on an issue like abortion you can find right and wrong on both sides Students on local campuses are clearly part of the turning inward that seems to be evident in society as a whole The bestseller lists at campus stores invariably include the popular selfhelp works such as Your Erroneous Zones The key is finding a place for your selfanswering the question Where do I go in a huge world said Sari Sweden an 18yearold student at the State University of New York at Buffalo Some see the developing pragmatism as unfortunate In turning inward there is a danger people may be becoming more selfish said Richard Cheshire vice president for public affairs at Colgate University Others take a somewhat longer view and suggest that todays students are no different from those of the 1960s Kenneth Goodsell a Columbia sophomore argued that the antiwar youth of the last decade had a life and death stake in the waft being ended The sellout came not in the 70s but in the 60s when the civilrights movement gave way to antiwar protests and students began to overlook what was still happening on the domestic front ExtiaCurricular activities such as glee clubs and campus radio stations seem to be doing relatively well though here again some significant changes have taken place College students are more interested in smaller more specialized groups than in large national movements said Brian Guillorn president of the Student Union Polity which coordinates student activities at Columbia I imagine its because in a smaller group they have more control The gymnasium at Columbia which was the focus of bitter controversy when it was built a decade ago draws large numbers of students for jogging and intramural sports and spectator sports are making a big comeback on some campuses Escape From Pressure People here go nuts over sports said Rob Gleaner a studentgovernment official at Rutgers The reason is simpleescape from the growing pressures associated with high academic standards and the demands of tightening job market Escapism is a word that tends to pop up frequently in discussions with students and faculty members Sciencefiction clubs are thriving at several local colleges Asked why his own group seems to be doing so well Richard Lappin a junior who heads the one at Columbia replied Its entertainment It fits in with the times The consumption of alcohol is clearly on the increase and it now ranks alongside marijuana and cocaine at the top of student preference In private students use dope but at public events alcohol is taking over said Miss Storey at Barnard The use of hard drugs is said to be rare all marijuana has taken on a different function than in the past Ten years ago pot smoking was a radical political act said Tim Weiner a Columbia senior Now everyone does it and its become personalized and depoliticized If it can be said that there is a cogent reason for smoking pot its inwarddirectedness Students at some colleges reported that it was customary now to serve wine at campus gatherings and that its presence or absence would some times determine the attendance level Drinking is an occupational hazard of being a student activist said Ellen Doherty a student member of the Barnard board of trustees I could easily get drunk three or four times a week just going to meetings Some universities have become concerned about the level of student drinking Colgate for example recently sel up a committee of students faculty members and administrators to study the question of alcohol abuse on the campus College students have always beep known for their penchant for beer and many faculty members believe that de spite some problems the trends of the last few years have essentially consisted of what some called a healthy return to normalcy Others though are disturbed by what they see happening especially in relation to academic work For example Charles R Decarlo president of Sarah Lawrence College expressed fear that education had become a process for earning credentials to the exclusion of any sense of a joy in learning for its own sake Theres a curious paradox he said Students work hard but there is a decline in serious intense intellectual focusing They dont know how to concentrate They are full of anxiety about getting a job but there is no motivation that proceeds from within Mid when that happens there is a decline in quality The only goal seems to be to get enough work togetherto pat some sort of mental act together to go out and get a job

ambiguity today said Marianne Goldstein a junior at Barnard Everyone was against the war but on an issue like abortion you can find right and wrong on both sides Students on local campuses are clearly part of the turning inward that seems to be evident in society as a whole The bestseller lists at campus stores invariably include the popular selfhelp works such as Your Erroneous Zones The key is finding a place for yourselfanswering the question Where do I go in a huge world said Sari Sweden an 18yearold student at the State University of New York at Buffalo Some see the developing pragmatism as unfortunate In turning inward there is a danger people may be becoming more selfish said Richard Cheshire vice president for public affairs at Colgate University Others take a somewhat longer view and suggest that todays students are no different from those of the 1960s Kenneth Goodsell a Columbia sophomore argued that the antiwar youth of the last decade had a life and death stake in the wart being ended The sellout came not in the 70s but in the 60s when the civilrights movement gave way to antiwar protests and students began to overlook what was still happening on the domestic front Extracurricular activities such as glee clubs and campus radio stations seem to be doing relatively well though here again some significant changes have taken place College students are more interested in smaller more specialized groups than in large national movements said Brian Guillorn president of the Student Union Polity which coordinates student activities at Columbia I imagine its because in a smaller group they have more control The gymnasium at Columbia which was the focus of bitter controversy when it was built a decade ago draws large numbers of students for jogging and intramural sports and spectator sports are making a big comeback on some campuses People here go nuts over sports said Rob Gleaner a studentgovernment official at Rutgers The reason is simpleescape from the growing pressures associated with high academic standards and the demands of tightening job market Escapism is a word that tends to pop up frequently in discussions with students and faculty members Sciencefiction clubs are thriving at several local colleges Asked why his own group seems to be doing so well Richard Lappin a junior who heads the one at Columbia replied Its entertainment It fits in with the times The consumption of alcohol is clearly on the increase and it now ranks alongside marijuana and cocaine at the top of student preference In private students use dope but at public events alcohol is taking over said Miss Storey at Barnard The use of hard drugs is said to be rare and marijuana has taken on a different function than in the past Ten years ago pot smoking was a radical political act said Tim Weiner a Columbia senior Now everyone does it and its become personalized and depoliticized If it can be said that there is a cogent reason for smoking pot its inwarddirectedness Students at some colleges reported that it was customary now to serve wine at campus gatherings and that its presence or absence would some times determine the attendance level Drinking is an occupational hazard of being a student activist said Ellen Doherty a student member of the Barnard board of trustees I could easily get drunk three or four times a week just going to meetings Some universities have become concerned about the level of student drinking Colgate for example recently set up a committee of students faculty members and administrators to study the question of alcohol abuse on the campus College students have always been known for their penchant for beer and many faculty members believe that despite some problems the trends of the last few years have essentially consisted of what some called a healthy return to normalcy Others though are disturbed by what they see happening especially in relation to academic work For example Charles R Decarlo president of Sarah Lawrence College expressed fear that education had become a process for earning credentials to the exclusion of any sense of a joy in learning for its own sake Theres a curious paradox he said Students work hard but there is a decline in serious intense intellectual focusing They dont know how to concentrate They are full of anxiety about getting a job but there is no motivation that proceeds from within and when that happens there is a decline in quality The only goal seems to be to get enough work togetherto put some sort of mental act together to go out and get a job
Faulting the Italian Reds,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/24/archives/faulting-the-italian-reds.html,ROMEThe Christian Democrats are in the main responsible for Italys current crisis a crisis that is not only economic but also moral political and institutional More and more the Christian Democrats have taken on the trappings of a power machine based on an extended network of patronage and corruption that tends to confuse itself with the state The Italian Communist Party has entered the Government if not formally then de facto by its abstention on key votes in Parliament by the Christian Democratic Government of Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti formed in August 1976 and by the July 1977 agreement among six parties for a limited legislative program But Communist participation in its current form has not brought about the political and institutional reforms judged necessary by liberal public opinion and radical groups and indeed could undermine democratic institutions Rather the agreement reached with the four other smaller parties in which the Christian Democrats and Communists dominate has accentuated the illiberal characteristics of those two parties and could endanger parliamentary democracy in Italy In the last 10 years the country has clamored for changechange in schools and universities in national and local government in the large public sector of the economy in welfare the cities and the environment and In the distribution of jobs in the country and has demanded a turnover in its ruling class The Communist Party has begun to take on the characteristics of its Christian Democratic partner disappointing those electors who voted not for ideological Marxist reasons but in the hope of a moral regeneration and of political change The Communists voting as part of the parliamentary majority do not pose a threat for the reasons usually cited by the Western democratic world and American public opinionthat is that they would represent a revolutionary agent tied to the Soviet Union With 34 percent of the popular vote the party is a large organized force of workers and other citizens who have seen it as the hope for democratic change Instead in association with the Roman Catholics the Communists represent a risk for civil liberties Rather than carry forward the necessary changes the agreement has up to now aggravated the crisis for a number of reasons First any and all opposition has virtually disappeared In its place we have a socalled controlled democracy with the consent of all parties representing 95 percent of the parliament There is no longer parliamentary debate and mutual control between majority and opposition touchstone of all Western democracies An emergency program that would have justified the agreement in order to carry out the most urgent popular or unpopular reforms has been neither planned nor implemented There is no room for opposition or dissent This has continued to determine increased social unrest rebellion and revolt by the students the young and the unemployed and other social strata Second it is well known that two of Italys wcrst problems are the patronage and the spoils system that prevail in all public and semipublic institutions economic financial mass media civic cultural After only a year it is already clear that the Communist Party instead of reversing this trend has been caught up in the same game Thus the dictatorship of parties over Italian society is being extended Third no significant reform has been proposed or carried out Little or nothing has been done toward economic recovery to restore confidence in our institutions there has been no change in the methods of managers public administrators and the public sector of the economy The school system has been left virtually untouched Unemployment is increasing Those who voted for the Communists in 1976 in the hope of a change have been disillusioned last year the Communists increased their share of the vote from 28 percent to 34 percent As a result faith in the countrys institutions has been further eroded Fourth the Communist Party has itself proposed supported or allowed illiberal measures in the fields of constitutional rights and public order For example the Communists proposed a bill that in effect makes popular referendums almost impossible They have supported restrictive lawandorder measures the penal code prison rules preventivearrest and penal procedures The referendum is the only tool in Italy for expression outside the parties True a referendum can only abrogate an existing code as was the case with divorce law But as it is impossible for public opinion to influence new laws through the normal parliamentary procedure the referendum is the only channel left open to the public to put pressure on the parties To prevent referendums is equivalent to suffocating popular movements and ad hoc campaigns Tightening penal laws violates civil liberties At the same time it does nothing to solve social problems that are at the root of current violence All these proposals would only make the country less democratic and more authoritarian and therefore generate more conflict The real reasons for the Communists failure in reforming the country is that they have allowed reform to playa third fiddle to the reasons of party and reasons of power in order to establish at any price links between themselves and the Christian Democrats and even in the attempt to share control over education health and welfare with the Roman Catholic Church This has been a constant theme of the Radical Party Although it represents a tiny minority in Parliament 11 percent of the popular vote with four Deputies it has exercised a great influence on public opinion by organizing campaigns and nonviolent direct action for specific reforms on issues such as divorce abortion expansion of civil rights and liberties reforms of codes and the democratization of the state monopoly of television The Radicals together with democratic and liberal opinion of the country hold that strengthening of the democratic process is the only alternative to the crisis produced by social violence and at the same time to the dictatorship by parties that tends to subvert the constitutional principles of the country

But Now There Is Pressure of Time and Money to Reach Agreement,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/27/archives/but-now-there-is-pressure-of-time-and-money-to-reach-agreement-on.html,WASHINGTONHe is an unobtrusive man who makes his unofficial home on Capitol Hill in the office of Representative Henry Hyde Republican of Illinois and author of the ban on Federal funding of abortions for lowinincome women through Medicaid The visitor is first in line outside the Senate chamber where the HouseSenate conference on Medicaid abortions meets queuing up more than an hour before the sessions begin He is no idle spectator His name is Mark Gallagher and he represents the National Committee for Human Life Amendment which is funded by the United States Catholic Conference representing the nations Roman Catholic bishops Every time the Senate conferees make a compromise offer Mr Gallagher quietly walks to the conference table to tell a staff aide to the 11 House conferees whether the proposal is acceptable to the bishops His recommendations invariably are followed Mr Gallaghers presence is one of the reasons why the conferees have been deadlocked for more than four months in one of the more intense disputes ever to divide the two chambers There have been hours of passionate rhetoric and probably there will be still more when the conference resumes this week under severe pressure of time The House had adopted its ban on Medicaid abortions as a rider to 601 billion in appropriations for the Departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare Because of the deadlock the two departments have been funded for the last two months on a temporary basis On Wednesday this method of financing expires and Senate and House leaders have agreed not seek further extensions At a time of generally more liberal attitudes toward abortions the House unbending insistence on a ban has been particularly striking and as might be expected it has led to emotional arguments Supporters of the ban refer to opponents as murderers Opponents say the constitutionality of abortion has been settled by the Supreme Court and they criticize the Catholic Churchs intervention Each side has accused the other of bias against the poor To some of those who favor a freer choice on abortion their opponents are simply exploiting the abortion question essentially to make an antipoor antiwelfare statement Representative David Obey Democrat of Wiscosin points out that the Federal Government pays for abortions in health programs other than Medicaid including those for military personnel and their dependents and even health plans for officials who administer the Medicaid abortion ban This argument is rejected by the antiabortionists some of whom accuse the other side of promoting genocide of the poor Representative Hyde says some supporters of Governmentinpaid abortion regard as a method of controlling the population of blacks Puerto Ricans Chicanos and other poor people It is a dispute in which as some conferees have noted with irony all 27 participants are men some of whom casually use terms such as hardware for intrauterine devices and a quick scrape for dilation and curettage The conferees generally have displayed ignorance about birth defects and genetic testing and counseling The issue is very simple says Representative Daniel J Flood Democrat of Pennsylvania and chairman of the House conferees who as a former actor orates rather than speaks The Senate wishes to pay for as many abortions as possible whereas the House wishes to pay for as few abortions as possible But there are other more complicated reasons foe the Houses strong stand The sponsor of the abortion ban Representative Hyde is a Roman Catholic So are Mr Flood and 6 of the other 10 House conferees They were selected as conferees only because they were members of the House subcommittee with jurisdiction over the bill the luck of the draw nonetheless produced a far higher Percentage of Catholics in conference than the 302 percent of the full House and 13 percent of the Senate Their religion would be irrelevant had not the Catholic Church strongly supported the abortion ban and through Mr Gallagher played a significant role in the dayintoinday negotiations It is estimated that 120 Congressional districts have sizable Catholic constituencies whose representatives can be counted on to vote against Medicaid abortions Of course not everyone in the House is responding to religious pressure Many regard it as a matter of conscience To Representative Thomas N Kindness Republican of Ohio and a Presbyterian if you want to help poor women eliminate poverty dont eliminate humans Nor can the intransigence of the House conferees be attributed simply to fear of retribution at the polls Nine of the 11 had no primary opponents in 1976 and all won in the general election with at least 58 percent of the vote Still abortion clearly is a highly emotional topic among voters and representatives are particularly vulnerable to pressures Senators are relatively insulated not only because their statewide constituencies transcend intense local sentiment but also because they face the voters only every six yearsplenty iof time for passions to cool There has been some giveinandintake on both sides though not much Mr Hyde had proposed a total ban and this was modified by an amendment offered by Representative Silvio Conte Republican of Massachusetts and also a Roman Catholic to allow Medicaid abortions when the mothers life was endangered This was a restatement of the presentinlaw which the Senators accepted last year without fight under the mistaken belief that they would be vindicated in the courts Instead last June the Supreme Court upheld the legality of the ban Now the Senate would allow Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest and when medically necessary a term the House conferees consider deliberately vague After four months at the negotiating table each side has relented slightly on questions of medical procedures and definitions of what is medically necessary However each basically has voted overwhelmingly at least half a dozen times for its own position OIL both sides there is a sense that a highinstakes contest is under way From the start many have considered abortion to be the kind of issue that could destroy a Congressional career They can agree with you on everything else says Senator Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon and an opponent of the ban But if they disagree with you on abortion theyll vote against you Sygma Martin Adler LevIckBlack Star

Abortion Ruling Due,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/27/archives/new-jersey-weekly-abortion-ruling-due.html,TRENTOF THOSE people in New Jersey in favor of legitimate abortions of having each woman make her own choicemay be looking in the wrong place for help The law that apparently irks the most women is the one that prohibits the spending of state tax money to help pay for elective abortions This measure became effective in December 1975 and since then has been under attack in Federal courts by family planners Those in favor of elective abortions tend to call themselves family planners while those opposed call themselves proinlifers The suit asking the Federal courts to strike down the New Jersey law prohibiting the spending of tax money on elective abortions is pending before the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia A ruling is expected before the first of the year Many legal experts do not believe that there is much chance that the suit will prevail in light of the United States Supreme Court ruling that it is constitutional to forbid the spending of Federal tax money for such abortions In a recent decision in New Jersey State Supreme Court Justice Morris Pashman seemed to be inviting those favoring abortions to bring the same suit in New Jersey courts It may well be Justice Pashman said that the New Jersey Constitution provides more protection for individuals than does the Federal ConstitutionThe Federal protection is centered mostly on the 14th Amendment which was passed after the Civil War to give equal treatment under the law to blacks and Indians The amendment provides for equal treatment of all Americans Although New Jersey hasno similar clause in its Constitution Justice Pashman said that Article I embodied the equalintreatment provision and perhaps more The United States Supreme Court has itself recognized the legal principle that what may not be prohibited by the Federal Constitution may well be prohibited by state constitutions The reliance on local property taxes to pay for public schools is an example In 1973 in a case involving the San Antonio Tex School District the Supreme Court held that this did not violate the 19th Amendment However state courts in Texas California and New Jersey Robinson v Cahill have held that it does violate their state constitutions In his ruling which came in a case involving whether the state of New Jersey is liable for abortions performed in New York Justice Pashman said I have serious doubts as to the constitutionality of the state regulation The effect of the state regulation is to ban Medicaid abortions for the poor he wrote adding It may well violate the equal protection guarantees inherent in Article I Paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution by making an irrational distinction betweens groups of pregnant women Mr Pashmans seeming invitation for those favoring abortions to file a state court suit may be taken up Attorneys interested in this subject are waiting to see what happens in Philadelphia The situation has some politicial im plications A number of legislators who voted for the law to prohibit the use of state funds for elective abortions do not really object to this but because of the active proinlife group felt constrained to vote for it No one seems to know how many abor tions New Jersey women have each year and whether there has been a dropinoff since enactment of the 1975 law The states Department of Health is compiling statistics but spokesmen for the department claim that it is practically impossible to get such data out of the computers The New Jersey delegation to the National Womens Conference in Houston last week strongly endorsed the prochoice plank Despite all this the antiabortionists remain very active in the state and are not expected to go into retirement They are not so much opposed to the spending of 2 million a year to help pay for abortions for poor women as they are against abortions themselves  MARTIN WALDRON

ABORTION PANEL DISBANDED BY CHIEF,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/27/archives/us-abortion-panel-disbanded-by-chief-head-of-administration-group.html,WASHINGTON Nov 26 The head of the Carter Administrations study group an alternatives to abortion has disbanded the group after concluding that the only real alternatives are suicide motherhood and some would add madness In a memorandum sent to Joseph A Califano Jr Secretary of Health Education and Welfare Connie J Downey who headed the panel said that it did not have the direction scope authority or money necessary to attack the problems underlying unwanted pregnancies Califano who like President Carter personally opposes abortion has pledged to come up with alternatives He received the memo several weeks ago but apparently has not responded and the department has attempted to keep the document from the public Connie Downey acting director of special project planning at the Department of Health Education and Welfare confirmed that she had written the paper But she said it was tended as an ternal working paper with no substantive proposals or program suggestions tended for the public Eileen Shanahan Assistant Secretary for public affairs who is Secretary Califanos spokesman denied a request for the memo saying that it was an ternal document The Associated Press obtained a copy from ciher sources while awaiting the butcom of a formal request for the material under the Freedom of Information Act The abortion issue has provoked an emotional disagreement  recent months both within the Carter Administration and  Congress where the House and Senate have been deadlocked for several months on the question of Federal financing of abortions for poor women Several members of the Administration most of them women met earlier this year to draft a memorandum for the President expressing disappointment with his views on abortion The group later dropped the idea of sending a memorandum and some of the aides decided to send letters to Mr Carters In her fiveinpage document which had Several attachments Connie Downey said that women who sought abortions financed by the Government had many problems ranging front concerns for their health to fears for the future of their families But One Alternative Solution Abortion is but one alternative solution to many of the problems  she wrote It is an option uniquely which is exercised between conception and live birth As such the literal alternatives to it are suicide motherhood and some would add madness Consequently there Is some confusion discomfort and cynicism greeting efforts to find or emphasize or identify alternatives to abortion After Secretary Califano ordered the teragency study group set up his office created another team to deal with teenage pregnancies The memo said this second team had been variously viewed as overlapping supplanting or superseding the alternativesintoinabortion efforts Connie Downey said that the teeninage pregnancy itiative wasnan effort guaranteed to succeed since statistically the problem has peaked and the momentum of the issue itself bodes well for an easy win for these efforts irrespective of whether or not they are effectively programmed She recommended that if Mr Califano reconstituted her group or continued the effort  some other manner the title Should be changed to Alternatives for Unwanted Pregnancies  This effectively removes the discussion from the emotional climate surrounding the abortion issue and allows a rational search for a broader spectrum of solutions to a serious problem the memo said
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/27/archives/the-nation-in-summary-lets-cut-the-cards-and-deal-on-energy-bill.html,From the start it has been evident that if there is to be a national energy program the President and Congress must employ that familiar midwife of legislation the compromise Last week Secretary of Energy James R Schlesinger made that obvious point and for the first time suggested possible areas of Administration tradeinoffs For his trouble he got only more trouble In Summary Lets Cut the Cards and Deal On Energy Bill House Democrats who have been guarding Carter energy proposals against a Senate paring knife reacted as though they had been abandoned in midfight I really honest to God think that they have to shut up complained Representative Thomas L Ashley chairman of the House Ad Hoc Energy Committee To Mr Ashley and others the Administration violated basic rule of poker and politics Dont show your hand too soon Whatever Mr Schlesingers motives for speaking out he merely mentioned possible compromises that have been apparent for some time One effect may be to remind slowmoving Congressional energy confereesin particular the influential chairman of the Senate Finance Committee Russell B Longthat it is time for serious negotiations The Administration he suggested would agree to production incentives in the form of higher oil and natural gas prices and to extra tax credits for businesses converting to coal In return it would insist on wellhead tax on domestic crude oil new taxes on businesses using oil and gas and an extension of Federal price controls to gas sold in the same state it is produced The White House insisted it would not retreat on essential energyinsaving measures by accepting a bad bill just to get any kind of bill out of Congress But it also did not dispute the inevitability of compromise and thus a more dovish approach to President Carters moral equivalent of war The 2000 delegates to the National Womens Conference left Houston last week feeling much as one might have expected they would Profeminists who were in the overwhelming majority were aglow with sisterhood and a conviction that the womens movement had come successfully through an important political rite of passage Profamily delegates as they called themselves said they knew what would happen all along The conference was stacked against them and did not represent most American women But whether good or bad feelings tend to fade quickly The true test of what Houston means will come when the men who dominate Congress and the Administration respondinto the agenda approved by the conference What they are thinking is not clear even if President Carter has been generally sympathetic to the womens movement and one of his aides Margaret Costanza promised a substantive Presidential statement With surprisingly little rancor the conference voted a 25point plan of action rejecting only a proposal to create a Cabinetinlevel womens department out of fear it would become less a source of significant policy than of patronage Though resolutions endorsing the equal rights amendment legalized abortions and lesbian rights stirred the greatest passions the emphasis was on breadinandinbutter issues such as credit and employment discrimination child care and health benefits Translating these ideas into legislation will be difficult There is no central lobbying group If it wishes Congress can simply dismiss the agenda Many proposals require state action and feminist groups would be har pressed if they have to deal with 50 legislatures The equal rights amendment underscores the feminists political plight Three states short they have only 16 months left to get the 38 needed for ratification of the amendment unless Congress extends the deadline But only four states can even consider the amendment next yeaxIllinois Florida South Carolina and Oklahomaand at one point or another all four have said no Even in the heavily expurgated version it is one of the most formidable dossiers the Federal Bureau of Investigation ever released52648 pages from its own files of fact fantasy and internal politics that motivated the bureau as it harassed what it deemed subversive domestic groups through a program called Cointelpro After three years of disclosures about intelligence abuses there was a certain familiarity about some od the revelations Nevertheless some new details were fascinating One plaintive example of the pressure on field agents to produce data came from a special agent in Mobile Ala in the 1960s As previously noted the only Black Nationalist organization active in this division is the Youth Progressive Committee in Montgomery Ala which has a reported membership of eight two of whom are informants A newsletter called Chevara News after the Cuban revolutionary hero Che Guevara was to contain false ideology to confuse the Students for Democratic Society An anonymotis letter charging a political dissenter at a New Jersey state teachers college with sexual liaison with his 13yearold stepdaughter was sent to educational authorities J Edgar Hoover himself took a guiding hand in Cointelpro He for example suggested turning off the power during the meeting of the American Communist partys 1966 convention The bureau released the Cointelpro files without comment and is planning to release 80000 pages on its investigation of the assassination of Presiaent Kennedy next week It never would have happened to the Boss they said and probably they were right Mayor Richard J Daley wouldnt have permitted his Commissioner for Consumer Sales or any other commissioner for that matter to accuse him publicly of being in cahoots with Chicago taxi companies to get their fares raised He certainly wouldnt have dignified the charges by going on television to deny them or taken a lieindetector test to disprove them But under Michael A Bilandic the former alderman for Mr Daleys own South Side ward city government in Chicago is not what it was once was When Jane M Byrne a 1968 Daley appointee and protegee charged that Mayor Bilandic had greased the way for an unwarranted 117 percent fare increase he took to the air and then to the polygraph He passed the test So did Mrs Byrne who took one too Mr Bilandic then reverted to his mentors manner He fired Mrs Byrne A special committee of the City Council is looking into the circumstances of the fare increase as is a Federal grand jury Bert Lance may be out of sight in the Government but he is not out of mind The legal troubles that led to his resignation last September as director of the Office of Management and Budget worsened last week First it was disclosed that a special Justice Department team that has been examining the Georgia bankers affairs for two months wants a grand jury in Atlanta to also take a look particularly at his large bank overdrafts and personal use of corporate airplanes If the grand jury does get involved as expected that could make Mr Lance vulnerable to criminal charges Then it was learned that investigators for the Securities and Exchange Commission are so unhappy with Mr Lances dealings that they want the Government to temporarily prohibit him from handling other peoples money Both the commission and Mr Lances representatives are looking for disciplinary action that falls short of suspension from banking One possibility is an agreement that he repay two Georgia banks for uncollected loans that he authorized and for disallowed usiness expenses So far Mr Lance has not returned banking though he owns large ticks of stock in the First National ank of Calhoun and the National sank of Georgia He has spent a good deal of time on the lecture circuit and he is an unofficialinand apparently still influentialinadviser to his old friend President Carter
Compromise Efforts on Issue of Funds Were Only Tentative and Sporadic in 3‐Week Recess,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/28/archives/conferees-still-fail-to-agree-on-abortion-compromise-efforts-on.html,WASHINGTON Nov 27Despite the hopes of the Congressional leadership House and Senate conferees failed in the threeweek Congressional recess to make a serious attempt to iron out their differences on Federal funds for abortions for lowincome women Soocial to The New York Times We agreed that during this interim period wed work on some language that could be acceptablesaid Senator Edward W Brooke Republican of Massa chussets who is a leading opponent 01 the ban on funds for such purposes Not only did the conferees fail to meet during the threeweek recess but also compromise efforts made in that period were only tentative and sporadic The House seeks a stringent prohibition of Medicaidpaid abortions while the Senate wants amore limited ban  The conferees will return to the conference table when Congress reconvenes this week Before the recess both Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr and the Senate majority leader Robert C Byrd of West Virginia told newsmen that they hoped that the recess could be profitably used to end the fivemonth deadlock Negotiations during the interim period had seemed necessary because the deadlock held up 601 billion in salaries and programs for the Departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare The ban on funds for Medicaid abortions had been attached as a rider to the funds provided for the two agencies The appropriations expired Sept 30 and have since been continued on a monthtomonth basis The C0Agressional leaders have agreed OA no mfea temporary financing measures will bb zonsidered after the expiration of the current measure on Nov 30 The departments will not actually be pressed for funds until Dec 8 During the recess Representative George Mahon Democrat of Texas who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and Representative Don Bonker a Democrat from Washington formulated various compromise proposals However none were shown to Representative Daniel J Flood Democrat of Pennsylvania chairman of the House conferees who is the strongest advocate of stringent prohibitions against the use of Federal funds for Medicaid abortions This raised the possibility of a move to circumvent Mr Flood although this was vehemently denied by Mr Mahon The Texan who will retire next year has received short shrift from Mr Flood at the conference meetings Mr Mahon said that he was involved in district matters that had taken priority over the abortion dispute He added that rt the present stage there was nothing to show Mr Flood Exemptions for Victims At their last session on Nov 3 the House conferees relented to the extent of being willing to allow prompt medical procedures such as dilation and curettage for victims of incest and rape with the exception of statutory rape provided that those crimes were duly reported to law enforcement authorities The compromise language formulated by Mr Mahon and Mr Bonker would allow victims of those crimes to report them to a public health agency This language includes an exemption for both forcible and statutory rape The House conferees have opposed exempting statutory rape which is any sexual intercourse involving a minor Minors accounted for onethird of all 260000 Medicaid abortions The House conferees also agreed to allow Medicaid abortions for women who would suffer grave permanent physical damage if the pregnancy were carried to term which the Senate conferees regarded as a mere restatement of the original House ban which exempts cases in which the life of the mother is endangered The new compromise language would exempt those who would suffer severe and longlastiing physical health damage a phrase that House conferees consider too liberal Despite the failure of the conferees to make any real progress Senator Brooke and Representative Mahon both said that they expected that the issue would be resolved next month Im very optimistic Mr Brooke said You can call it cautious optimism Mr Mahon remarked simply Something has to be done
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/28/archives/letters.html,To the Editor John Darntons Nov 14 news analysis contains a statement that is worth commenting on He asserts that the dramatic diplomatic turn from a nation that had been Moscows prime ally in East Africa for the last eight years was a result of Somalias anger over Soviet support for Ethiopia in the fourmonthold war in Ogaden the eastern region of Ethiopia that Somalia claims This dramatic turn represents more than merely the result of Somalias anger over Soviet support to Ethiopia It grew out of a fundamental incongruity between Soviet aims and attitudes and Somali culture After the present military regime in Somalia came to power 1969 the Soviets sought to persuade the Somali leadership to adopt government on the Soviet model in the name of selfsufficiency Every effort was made in Somalia to imitate the Soviet system These efforts failed because the TowAway Alternative The 90 Parking Ticket To the Editor City Towing Inc the agency hired by the City of New York to tow away illegally parked cars can easily and economically be eliminated as one more abrasive aspect of life in Fun City The total cost to the errant victim is 9065 for towing and 25 for the parking violation If the city benefits from the cash inflow why not eliminate the middleman by affixing a fine of 90 thereby doing away with smogproducing tow trucks and their concomitant noise True some private business toes will be stepped on but the air will be a little less polluted and the anguish of reclaiming the impounded car avoided Some of the revenue earned can go into a program of revising the system of warning signs which at present are both confusing and contradictory RALPH J APPLETON Douglaston N Y Nov 20 1977 About Excess Surgery To the Editor Today one cannot make a name for oneself by coming to the defense of doctors Your Nov 16 editorial Excess Surgeons Excess Surgery simplifies a complex issue by finding greed at the bottom of the rapidly increasing number of operations in this country And the rate of hysterectomies is given as a principal example This example is fortuitous because here we see factors other than doctors greed clearly determinative The dirty little secret here is that hysterectomy is the only birth control available to women whose religion forbids more civilized means So while it is true that no surgeon can be forced to wield his scalpel he often must respond to the needs of his community needs as much social as medical HEW in its superstitious position on abortion and other birthcontrol programs should be the very last to throw stones for it is thus adding to this problem Mr Califano et al shouldnt be heard to complain as the rate of hysterectomies continues to skyrocket He clearly has his choice Continue his hysteria on this issue or pay for hysterectomies ROBERT SEIDENBERG MD Syracuse N Y Nov 16 1977 Hope for Fred To the Editor Your Nov 14 editorial about Fred the Newsboy highlighted a current problem in our immigration law Freds exposure to deportation for conducting his newspaper route which nets9 a week results from a much too strict enforcement of the letter of the law with respect to foreign students There is now a proposal recently published in the Federal Register to allow immigration judges for the first time the discretion to waive such minor violations of immigration status as Freds Those of us involved in helping aliens like Fred with their problems heartily support the proposed change The Timess sensitivity to Freds problem is commendable LEON WILDES New York Nov 21 1977 basic elements of Soviet Communism totalitarianism and the destruction of religion could not be forced on the Somali people In the Soviet Union the Government cannot be opposed the Soviet public has the right neither to oppose nor to criticize what the Communist Party may dictate whether for good or ill In the Somali Republic unlike the Soviet Union the Government cannot impose anything upon the people without their consent this is the assumption of Somali tradition In that Somali tradition all matters of common concern should be shared by all adult persons In the Soviet Union the socialist founders believed that religion was destructive to their aims and this belief is still officially held by Communist Party members Every effort to eliminate religion and its believers has been made by the Soviet leadership In the Somali Republic Islamic thought is the cornerstone of all law and tradition Religion is ingrained so deeply in the Somali tradition that it is difficult to draw a line between that tradition and Moslem thought Somalis believe in the Koran to the point one might say of choosing death over becoming nonbelievers Because of the differences in religion and in culture among other things it was impossible for the two Governments to force a Soviet model on Somalia Therefore the dramatic diplomatic turn was not only a result of Scmalias anger over Soviet support to Ethiopia in the fourmonthold war in Ogaden but also the failure of Soviet foreign policy in its attempt to transplant the Soviet socialist model among Somali nomads where each individual is convinced that he is subject to no authority except that of Allah for that reason even the previous republican Government found that it was no easy task to collectivize nomads ALI HAGI IBRAHIM ADEN Amherst Mass Nov 18 1977 Mideast Washington Would Do Well to Relax To the Editor The Carter Administration can take full credit for creating the climate that made Sadats visit to Jerusalem possible President Sadat if all goes well will be able to claim that he got the Carter approach off dead center For the moment the initiative remains with Jerusalem Cairo and perhaps other Mideast capitals Washington would do well to relax keep out of the news and say in effect See how nicely we have got them talking to each other Sadat after winning the deadly struggle for Nassers succession and surviving several Libyan plots and recurrent fulminations from Damascus needs no advice on how to stay in power Begin and Dayan with their remarkable blend of toughness and histrionics need no prompting about keeping up the dramatic momentum Washingtons initiative since Secretaiy Vances trip this summer has concentrated on removing roadblocks on the way to Geneva Quite properly it stressed that there could be no peace without resolving the Palestinian issue but the President only belatedly recognized that the PLO is no more than a group that represents  a substantial part of the Palestinians press conference Sept 29that is not all of them and not necessarily those on the West Bank and in Gaza who through four wars and a decade of occupation have remained de facto Palestinians This proceduralcumPalestinian approach risked giving pocket veto to those least interested in peaceSyrians PLO radicals and Sovietsand frustrating those with the greatest stake in a settlementEgyptians Israelis and Jordanians President Sadat by earnestly proclaiming to Israelis from the Knesset rostrum that we welcome you among us with full security and safety has cut through these procedural tangles to what for Israelis is surely more than 70 percent of the substance But the next move as Sadat stressed on departing is up to Israel Since Israel has no major issues with Egypt and those with Syria are both minor and intractable the logical next move would be direct but secret contacts with Jordan These should explore both the serious territorial issues West Bank East Jerusalem perhaps Gaza that stand between them and the even more serious issue of avoiding the creation of a revanchist PLO state that unites them Once Sadat Begin and Hussein all began to agree on the rough outlines of a settlement there would be a better chance of bringing around the Syrians and the more moderate Palestinians And in that process the Washington Administrationand its friends in Riyadhwill once again be able to play a major constructive role And once all the parties in the Middle East began to agree even the Russians could not stop the ultimate signing of peace treatiesat Geneva or wherever else DANKWART A RUSTOW Distinguished Prof of Political Science City University Graduate Center 1977 Of Herbert Marcuse and Anarchy To the Editor The tone and the claims contained in the Nov 15 letter by Professors Norton Wolff and others in defense of Herbert Marcuse may not have surprised the informed but to most others they could be highly misleading When I wrote in my Week in Review report on Oct 30 that if the German BaaderMeinhof gang had a political outlook it was one expressed by Herbert Marcuses philosophy of anarchy I based it on a conversation I had with Marcuse in October 1966 at the University of California in San Diego He then acknowledged that the extreme Weatherman student movement got some of its inspiration from his writngs He also stated that while he did not advocate anarchy but revolution there was nothing wrong with the former because even out of anarchy would emerge something new and better In an interview published in The New York Times Magazine on Oct 27 1968 when asked whether he relied on anarchy to bring about the revolution he desired he replied No But I believe that the anarchist element is a very powerful and very progressive force and that it is necessary to preserve this element as one of the factors in a larger and more structured process Martin Greiffenshagen professor of political science in Stuttgart writing about the BaaderMeinhof gang in Der Spiegel of Oct 31 calls Herbert Marcuse the crown witness of the politics that are directed against civilization technology rationality parliamentarianism pluralism and thereby against the rational political comprehension of the Western model HENRY BRANDON Chief North American Correspondent The London Sunday Times Washington Nov 16 1977 Phony Statistics on School Dollars To the Editor Bad statisticslike bad pennieshave an unfortunate way of turning up in prominent places A recent example was the false statistic from a report by the City Comptrollers office that only 41 percent of school funds are spent on classroom services It was quoted by John B Oakes in a Nov 2 column and elsewhere by others Upon examination the report by the Comptrollers office proved to be such shoddy work that Mr Goldin would have been the first to condemn it if had been prepared by one of the agencies that he audits instead of by his own staff The Board of Education has prepared a detailed analysis of the education budget that states clearly where every dollar goes including the rationale for assigning costs This analysis demonstrates that 65 percent of the total budget 647 percent to be exact is spent on schoolbased instructional programs such as attendance services guidance and counseling planning testing research and development I would hope that for the sake of the city and its one million public school children the new Mayor will reject the campaign rhetoricand the phony statistics on which much of it was basedand take a firsthand look at the schools and the real figures before he makes important decisions affecting education STEPHEN R AIELLO President New York City Board of Education Brooklyn Nov 9 1977

Supreme Court Roundup,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/29/archives/supreme-court-roundup-test-pilot-dismissed-as-overage-at-52-wins.html,WASHINGTON Nov 28A jet test pilot who was discharged as overage at 52 by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation won a sixyear fight for reinstatement today with the aid of the Supreme Court The Justices declined to upset a lower court ruling that Phillip W Boughton had been a victim of illegal age discrimination when the aircraft manufacturer grounded him as its chief production test pilot in 1971 on the ground that he had become a safety risk Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall had urged the high court to let the ruling stand In a brief filed by the Department of Justice he said that professional fliers between 45 and 74 had a lower accident rate than those between 16 and 44 A Federal district judge had ruled that the aircraft manufacturer had reasonable cause to believe that Mr Houghton at 52 would not be able to perform safely and efficiently as a test pilot But the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed saying that there was insufficient evidence that pilots in their 50s could not do their jobs The appeals court ruled that McDonnell Douglas must reinstate Mr Houghton as a test pilot if he was still physically capable In any event it must pay him back salary for the years since he was discharged The Justice Department brief conceded that older people were more subject as a group to heart attacks and strokes but said that these ailments were caused by disease not age and were detectable by physical examinations The high courts decision not to accept the case McDonnell Douglas Corp v Houghton No 77309 was made without participation by Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun who is in Minnesota recovering from a prostate operation Water Rights The high court accepted for review decision classifying water as a mineral to which surveyors may lay claim when it is found under public land The case Andrus v Charlestone Stone Products Co No 77380 originated with a 1965 attempt by the Secretary of the Interior to invalidate two dozen mining claims near Las Vegas Nev for failure to produce any minerals of value A Federal district court had ruled against the Secretary and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in affirming went beyond that decision to hold that water was a locatable mineral a decision the Justice Department termed startling The novel holding below if allowed to stand the Justice Department told the high court in its brief will unsettle the law of water rights throughout the Western states drawing into question the validity of private rights long thought to be established If water is a locatable mineral the department continued it is presumably possible to perfect a mining claim to the same water before it reaches the land of the present user or in the case of an underground basin before the water is used by whoever presently has the right to such use Libel The Justices declined to disturb lower court rulings in three libel cases In one Houston Belt  Terminal Railway v Wherry No 77419 a trial court awarded 20000 to a railroad switchman because after he had fainted on the lob his employer reported that his blood had contained methadone and associated the drug with heroin addiction Also left standing was a ruling that The St Louis Globe Democrat was not liable for an article attributing to the wrong city councilwoman a statement that she had had two abortions An appeals court reversed a 7000 verdict against the newspaper oh the ground that no malice had been involved Glover v Herald Co No 77248 The Justices also refused to review decision denying damages to Dominic S Rinaldi a New York State Supreme Court Justice who had been identified as probably corrupt in a book by Jack Newfield an editor of The Village Voice Rinaldi v Holt Rinehart No 77553 Criminal Law The high court agreed to review a robbery conviction in which the prosecutor had read the indictment to the jury during the summation but the judge had refused to charge the jury that such official accusations have no evidentiary value Taylor v Kentucky No 775549 Also accepted for review was a challenge to juvenile court procedure in Maryland In the case of Swisher v Brady No 77653 a convicted juvenile contended that the states right to object before a judge to the findings of a master assigned to his case subjected him to unconstitutional double jeopardy Minority Rights The Justices left standing a lower court decision rejecting an apportionment plan for Hinds County Jackson Miss that reduced the percentage of black voting age population in the only two of five supervisory districts in which blacks had any chance of electing a representative Board of Supervisors v Kirksey No 77499 In a school desegregation dispute Sweeney Independent School District v Harkless No 77392 the Court declined to review a ruling ordering the Sweeney Tex school system to rehire 10 black teachers it discharged 10 years ago Mental Hospitals The Court left standing a decision that a state hospital may give tranquilizing drugs to a patient who has been committed involuntarily despite her religious objections without incurring liability Winters v Miller No 77536 Negligence The Justices declined to review a ruling that a child whose sled was struck by an automobile cannot recover damages when state law requires all vehicles to carry head and tail lights and the sled did not Moon v Weeks No 77563

What Alternatives to Abortion?,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/30/archives/what-alternatives-to-abortion.html,The Administration has repeatedly promised new Federal programs to soften the blow of its antiabortion policy But two disclosures in Washington this week underline the hard reality For those who want or need to terminate a pregnancy there are no alternatives to abortion Early in the current abortion controversy Connie Downey director of special project planning at the Department of Health Education and Welfare was selected by Secretary Califano to head a study of alternatives to abortion Now a memo ending the brief life of that research project has come to light There are no alternatives to abortion the study concluded except suicide motherhood or madness To suggest otherwise it added is to invite confusion and cynicism A second memo from Peter Schuck who heads an HEW study on teenage pregnancy has now reached the public According to advance billing that study is to be the major Administration response in the abortion controversy It calls for more sex education more birth control researchand birth controland more help for young unwed mothers It does not call for Federal funding of abortions for teenagers But Mr Schuck considers abortions essential to protect the health of some young women In his memo he wrote that if Federal money is not available for the operation abortion information and referrals should be provided by public health officials Though these memos speak well for their authors they speak more loudly of the futility of a Government policy that forbids spending Federal funds on abortions for the poor Mr Califano could relieve the harm done by that policy if he would offer a substantial national program to disseminate birth control information and devices to people of every age That would not undo the present injustice that permits women to get abortions it they can afford them while prohibiting use of Medicaid funds for those who cannot But it could at least mitigate the tragedy of thousands of unwanted children
House Defeats Abortion Proposal After Senate Passes Compromise,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/30/archives/house-defeats-abortion-proposal-after-senate-passes-compromise.html,WASHINGTON Nov 29The Senate and the House of Representatives remained deadlocked on the abortion issue today despite extraordinary efforts by Congressional leaders to reach a compromise The leaders hoping to take the lobbyists from both sides by surprise arranged a compromise this morning and rushed it to the floor of both chambers this afternoon But although the Senate approved the proposal by a vote of 44 to 21 the House rejected it tonight by a vote of 205 to 183 The margins in both houses were little different from those on several previous votes on the issue The House thus remained adamant against the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions except to save the lives of expectant mothers and the Senate continued to insist on exceptions that would allow some poor women to receive abortions under Medicaid the Federal program that pays medical costs for the poor Tied to Appropriation Bill The abortion language is tied to a 601 billion appropriation bill for the Departments of Labor and of Health Education and Welfare for the fiscal year that began Oct I In recent weeks the departments have been operating on money provided under a special resolution but that resolution expires at midnight tomorrow It was expected although not certain that the resolution would be extended It allows spending for public service jobs education and hundreds of other programs The compromise drafted by the leaders Would have permitted the use of Federal funds to pay for the abortions of poor women who were the victims of rape as well as statutory rape Statutory rape Is defined as intercourse with a minor whether or not it is compelled Thus the measure would have allowed doctors to perform abortions on minors and be paid by Medicaid The age of majority varies in the states but in most of them it is 18 According to the Department of Health Education and Welfare 260000 abortions were performed under Medicaid last year at a cost to the Federal Government of about 50 million No one knows how many of those women were minors but according to Government statistics about onethird of the women who became pregnant last year were teenagers Thus while it is impossible to estimate how many abortions the compromise measure would have permitted the figure clearly would have been in the tens of thousands Senator Richard S Schweiker Republican of Pennsylvania an ardent opponent of abortion said that he believed 100000 or more Medicaid abortions would have been performed a year

few weeks a dozen or so men and women gather in a large luxuriously furnished suite on the top floor of a nondescript office building in this Washington suburb Over cocktails and sometimes dinner they map nationwide campaigns against busing racial quotas publicly funded abortions homosexual rights and other things that they believe are contributing to disintegration of the American family and way of life These young people are the leaders of the New Right a group of conservative activists who are determined to forge an effective farright coalition in American politics Their longterm goals are to build a grassroots conservative lobby throughout the country elect a working majority of conservatives of both parties to Congress and eventually place a conservative in the White House The New Right differs in organization style and tactics from the old right that supported Barry Goldwater in 1964 The new generation is more tightly organized better financed more sophisticated and more pragmatic than their predecessors They are prepared to accept partial victories that the old right with its kamikaze instincts would have considered ideological defeats DirectMall Blitz The political

off year for conservative causes and candidates Next year he confidently predicts a total of well over 40 million which he says will be used to finance the campaigns of hundreds of conservative candidates for congressional and state offices Those are the gross figures of course expenses and Mr Vigueries controversial profit margin often consume as much as 75 percent of the total contributions brought in by his mailings For example of the 16 million he has raised this year for the reelection campaign of Senator Jesse A Helms of North Carolina a leading New Right hero probably no more than 200000 is left for actual campaign spending Much more will come in next year however and when that effort is dupli cated in campaigns all over the country the impact is major And since the Viguerie operation is entirely outside the established parties it poses a potential threat to the fundraising prospects of both Republicans and Democrats A lean intense 43yearold who keeps a Bible on his desk and an electric golf nutting game in a corner of his office Mr Viguerie talks passionately and openly about his ambitions for the New Right We want to turn the thinking of this country around he told a visitor We have a chance to bring a conservative to power to the White House not just delay socialism for a few years Reaching out from Mr Vigueries office like the spokes of a wheel from its hub are a dozen or more New Right organizations most of which have been founded in the last three years The most important include the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress created in 1974 by the Colorado brewer Joseph Coors to help elect conservative congressmen and the Conservative Caucus headed by Howard Phillips the former member of Young Americans for Freedom whom Richard Nixon appointed as Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity with the mandate to scuttle the antipoverty program Another is the National Conservative Political Action Committee GrassRoots Lobbies The Caucus hopes to create conservative lobbies in all 435 Congressional districts while the Committee for the Survival extends campaign assistance to conservative incumbents and prospective candidates Other New Right organizations Include Phyllis Schlaflys Eagle Forum the 50000member group organized to fight the proposed equal rights amendment and the National Organization of State Conservative Parties which is meeting this weekend in Kansas City Mo to form a new national Conservative Party Several of these groups are in debt to Mr Viguerie whose directmail operation provides most of their funds Mr Viguerie who has political ambitions of his own flirted briefly with the thirdparty idea in 1976 when he tried to get the vice presidential nomination of the American Independent Party originally formed by George Wallace The party selected Lester G Maddox instead and convinced Mr Viguerie that his future at least for the moment lay in attempting to gain control of the Republican Party His target in 1978 he says is to replace as many liberals of both parties as possible with leverage conservatives men who can influence policy and help elect other conservatives These include such rightwing favorites as Senators Helms Orrin G Hatch of Utah Paul D Laxalt of Nevada and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina The New Right is moving Mr VIguerie says with a broad grin Theyre organized theyve got talent in spades and theyre going to have an impact
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/04/archives/the-nation-in-summary-yes-virginia-and-congress-is-trying-for.html,In Summary Yes VirginiaAnd Congress Is Trying A threeweek recess made sense Congress thought to give its conferees a chance to develop fresh approaches Aat would break impaSses on importent legislation before the holidays Last week Congress returned from the recess refreshed perhaps but also still at odds on three key issues The Congressional leadership underestimated the depth of antiabortion feeling in the House For months House and Senate conferees have been unable to agree on whether Medicaid should finance abortions for poor women The House opposes ell such iiirpoedures except when the mothers life is endangered the Senate wants a more liberal standard Without warning the leadership arranged cOmpromise and rushed it to the floor last week The result was predictable the Senate passed it the House turned it down Because the Medicaid funds were attached to a 601 billion appropriations bill the Departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare will run out of money on Thursday unless Congress again extends the temporary financing that has kept the two departments going since Septem  Amid a request for fiscal restraint from President Carter another conference committee began work on a bill that would raise payroll taxes to keep the Social Security trust fund solvent The two houses disagree on the share of new taxes that should be paid by employers and on the limits on retired persons earned income before they begin losing Social Security benefits Now they lose 1 in benefits for every 2 earned above 3000 This ceiling is sure to be raised and the Administtation is worried about the 2 billion et more that might cost the Governtent The House had voted to elimiRate the ceiling the Senate merely to raise it to 6000 by 1979 In a conciliatory gesture the House voted not to instruct its conferees last week to insist on outright removal of the ceiling  Capitol Hills longest running Show the conference on energy put the final touches on a watereddown version of the Presidents proposed Utilityrate reform That leaves the conferees with the most controversial Segments of the energy package taxes And naturalgas pricing and the persistent question of when they will finish Christmas may be optimistic When Mr Carter dropped his Thanksgivingtime foreign tour hed said he was not going to leave the country until the package passed But the trip is on again anyway though in an abbreviated version starting Dec 29 with Poland For Miners Its the Pits On Tuesday the nations 130000 miners almost certainly will go on strike for practical purposes many of them worked their last shift yesterday But rather than a display of strength by the United Mine Workers the walkout points up critical weaknesses in the unionan embattled leadership and an unhappy militant membership Unless the strike lasts for months the real hardship will be on the miners themselves Steel plants and electric power stations the two largest coal consumers have stockpiles that will last for at least three months other industries have fourmonth supplies The unions influence also has deteriorated because the coal industry relies increasingly on nonunion or other union strip mining in the Far West Unionized workers accounted for 70 percent of total coal production in 1974 when the current contract was signed That is down to 50 percent The workers will lose more than their average 60 a day in salary Health benefits which were reduced last summer will be cut off as soon as the strike begins and in January pension benefits to 80000 retired miners will have to be trimmed or ended Worker dissatisfaction union difficulties and reduced benefits run in vicious circle Despite a nostrike provision in the contract wildcat coal strikes in each of the last three summers have affected as much as twothirds of all miners In many instances the workers were rebelling against arbitration machinery set up by their own leaders that they consider qumbersome allowing mine operators to ignore grievances With each walkout contributions to the workers Health and Retirement Fund dropped off further One result is that arbitration is the most important and divisive issue The union wants to allow local strikes on the theory that nostrike clauses obviously do not work but perhaps safety valve in one mine would prevent walkouts from spreading elsewhere Mine operators disagree They want not only to renew the nostrike provision but dock the pay of miners who do walk out The prospects for a quick settlement are poor but because the national economic impact will not be felt immedlately the Federal Government is not likely to press for a coolingoff period Tax Reform Will Wait For President Carter and tax reform tomorrow seems never to come The comprehensive package he promised for this year and then only a month ago postponed until next year has now been put over until 1979 In the interval there will be more tax reduction than tax reform The operational word for next years proposal is apparently adequate although at his press conference last week Mr Carter clung to comprehensive The tradeoff had already been explained by Secretary of the Treasury W Michael Blumenthal and other Administration officials It is between the need to stimulate the economy with a quick tax cut and the risk of stimulating too lateor not at allby tying a cut to timeconsuming proposals for overhauling the Internal Revenue Code The tax cuts size and timing depends on the size and timing of newand higherenergy and Social Security taxes still in Congress and on an assessment of how soft the economy really is Novembers job figures released last week showed little change in a basic pattern Workers are entering the labor force faster than jobs are being created Total employment rose by 950000 jobs unemployment stayed essentially the same 69 percent Octobers rate was 7 percent Big Skirmish In Labor War The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union got an assist from the National Labor Relations Board last week in the unions longrunning war of attrition against J P Stevens  Company The nations second largest textile manufacturer is the unionists symbol of management recidivism It is also the key to textile unionization in the South where most of its 85 plants and 44000 workers are located The board decided last week to seek a nationwide injunction against Stevens unlawful conduct If necessary The NLRB has found the firm guilty 15 times of violating labor law by intimidating employees or refusing to bargain in good faith the firm has paid 13 million in fines and back wages since the early 1960s But it continues to block union activity

"Opinion in U.S. Swinging to Right, Pollsters and Politicians Believe",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/04/archives/opinion-in-us-swinging-to-right-pollsters-and-politicians-believe.html,WASHINGTON Dec 3In Houston 300 women protesting the equal rights amendment legalized abortion and lesbian rights march out of the National Womens Conference singng God Bless America In Orlando Representative Robin L Beard Jr of Tennessee brings Southern Republican Party officials to their feet when he declares Youre looking at a hardcore rightwing conservative reactionary In California the Legislature overrides by a commanding margin the Governors veto of the death penalty And here in Washington White House pickets chant Keep the American Canal A wide sampling of pollsters political scientists and Democrats and Republicans around the country agreed that those were not unrelated developments 1 They saw those events and others as evidence of a subtle but perceptible shift to the right in political opinion on a broad range of social economic and foreign policy issues While opinions differed on the causes and dimensions of the trend there was a consensus that the nation has entered a cautious period that has major implications for the 1978 Congressional elections and thereafter It was also agreed that this more conservative mood was being exploited more effectively than ever before by a new breed of farright activists Financed partly by the computerized directmail fundraising of Richard A Viguerie the far right has grown more effective on a wider range of issues The far right has adopted the tactics of the left observed Senator Gary Hart the Colorado liberal who as manager of II the George McGovern campaign in 1972 learned about political infighting It doesnt mean the country agrees with their politics he said but it does mean that they are better organized better financed and more effective than they were before Skepticism About Old Solutions Politicians differ in their characterizations of the current political mood To Senator Hart it is a nonideological skeotici m about the old Rooseveltian solutions to social problems To Senator Howard H Baker Jr the Minority Leader who concedes he has an eye on the 1980 Republican nomination it is a definite measureable shift to the right that I and my colleagues must take account of To Fred Wertheimer chief lobbyist for Common Cause It is a wary prudent mood among the public about the capacities and limits of government To John Sears manager of Ronald Reagans drive for the 1976 Republican nomination it is a new pragmatism that cuts across party and ideological lines from Great Society liberals to oldfashioned conservatives The American voter today he says is more pragmatic than ever more inclined to judge both issues and candidates indivdually without regard to party label or ideology The shift in public sentiment seems most striking on social issueswelfare busing abortion affirmative action gay rights and the equal rights amendmentissues on which Government action seems to threaten the status of the individual and the nuclear family This new social conservatism as some politicians call it has given rise to a rash of phenomena including the antiabortion backlash the demand for unrestricted use of laetrile the antiERA drive and the indignation aroused by the Bakke case the socalled reverse discrimination case now before the Supreme Court Many politicians believe these movements reflect a broad change in public attitudes toward the role of Government The trend that so many politicians sense is documented by recent Gallup public opinion polls In their most recent survey on the question a striking 47 percent of the respondents described themselves as right of center 32 percent as left of center and only 10 percent as middleoftheroad This is in sharp contrast to a similar Gallup survey in 1964 at the outset of the Johnson Administrations War on Poverty and the largescale American involvement in Vietnam when 37 percent characterized themselves as liberals 34 percent as conservatives and 29 percent had no opinion Figures Can Be Misleading Clearcut as they seem these figures can be misleading in the opinion of Warren E Miller director of the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan Rather than shifting to the right he believes the country is regaining its political equilibrium after a period of abnormal activity on the left The bulk of American political opinion in his view has always been to the right of center and is merely reasserting itself after the progressive activism of the 1960s Regardless of how they characterize the trend most politicians concur on two basic explanations for it On domestic issues they generally believe the public has been disillusioned by the cost and relative ineffectiveness of the bigbudget social programs of the Great Society On foreign issues most of them believe that the final debacle in Vietnam created a deepseated concern about the countrys image as a world power This they feel lies behind a new hawkishness that finds expression today in the opposition to the Panama Canal treaties the cancellation of the B1 bomber and to a lesser extent the proposed withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea Sees Responses As Emotional Emotion explains the opposition to the Canal treaties not logic Mary Louise Smith the former Republican national chairman said at a recent party conference Most of the opponents have not read the treaties and have only vague ideas of what is in them But they know they are concerned about the countrys image after Vietnam and they are afraid that any pullback will be seen as a sign of weakness Doubts about the desirability of Big Government solutions to social problems are as widespread among Democrats as Republicans In fact the intellectual leadership for the new pragmatism has been provided by a group of onceliberal writers and academies nearly all Demorats dubbed the neoconservatives They include established Democrats such as Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Henry Jackson the author and political activist Ben J Wattenberg and social theorists such as Daniel Bell Edward Banfield Nathan Glazer Seymour Martin Upset Irving Kristol Norman Podhoretz and James Q Wilson Many of these men worked in Government and became skeptical about the efficacy of largescale social programs as a result of firsthand experience Solution In Free Market System In such small but influential magazines as Commentary edited by Mr Podhoretz and The Public Interest edited by Mr Kristol and Mr Glazer they argue that the solution to the nations problems lies in the free market system They would replace welfare with a negative income tax for example and environmental regulations with pollution taxes Affirmative action quotas are demons of the highest order to neoconservatives Many of them are Jews of modest origins who see a latent antiSemitism in the organized assaults on the meritocracy in which they rose to prominence Isidore Silver a professor of constitutional law at John Jay College of Criminal Justice argued in an article in The Nation recently The development of NeoConservatism in the last 20 years has consisted of a reaction to one major traumathe fear of antiSemitism On the practical political level the neoconservatives have banded together in the Coalition for a Democratic Majority an assemblage of centerright Democrats who organized after the McGovern defeat The original goal according to its honorary cochairman Senator Jackson was to help bring the Democratic party back from the edge of extremism to its historical role as the party of the progressive center Coalition Has Been Revised Mr Carters election seemed to fulfill that goal and the Coalition briefly considered disbanding Instead however it has revived an effort to push Mr Carter to the right on sensitive issues such as the Middle East_ negotiations with the Russians and the Bakke case Nonetheless in the opinion of Mr Wattenberg the great bulk of American public opinion lies in our right on most of these issues In the last 15 years he continued many liberal positions on environment the womens movement and civil rights have been adopted by the mainstream But today social engineering is a bad word and the rhetoric of the right is what you hear Sensing this President Carter has so far tempered his more liberal proposals for sociala ction with talk of fiscal restraint The result has been a public confused as to where he stands In a recent Gallup Poll 45 percent of the respondents said they view him as a conservative while 36 percent said they regard him as a liberal The key to future political success for Mr Carter or any Republican opponent in the opinion of John Sears will be an ability to capitalize on the nations pragmatic mood with programs that actually work The public will endorse anything that produces results he said especially the music is different from what theyve ward from Washington in the nest
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/05/archives/letters.html,To the Editor In the long debate over Medicaid payment for abortion very little attention has been paid to the relation of this question to national health insurance Most of the other argumentspro and conseem almost to cancel out For example if it is immoral to terminate life at any stage it is also immoral to condemn an unwanted baby to a life of misery If abortions are often medically unnecessary expensive and a waste of taxpayers money the same is true of many other medical procedures that are paid for without question under Medicaid Medicare and private health insurance which also includes a largearound 30 percenttax subsidy Both sides claim the health argument within limits both are correct Under certain circumstances abortion is essential to the health of the mother andor to prevent the birth of a seriously handicapped child under other circumstances it has been abused to the detriment of the mothers health and welfare One pro argument that cannot be adequately countered so long as we depend primarily on Medicaid to fi nance health care for the poor is that of equity Since abortion is now generally accepted as a legal and under numerous conditions essential medical procedure it is inequitable that it should be available to the rich and denied to the poor Moreover the same inequity applies to other health measures including many essential preventive and health maintenance services What this nation desperately needs and does not have is some mechanism for establishing health priorities acceptable to the majority of both consumers and providers and of assuring access to such priority services to all Americans This is the major purpose of national health insurance Under some circumstances abortion would fall into the priority and thus reimbursable category under other circumstances it would not But the decision should be made on the basis of healthrelated criteria not whether the bill is being paid through a welfare program or not The same would be true of some forms of cosmetic surgery contact lenses fetal monitoring coronary bypass surgery and other semior quasielective procedures Unless one believes that resources are unlimited some limits will have to be placed on national health insurancecovered services Given such limits it is impossible to justify payment for unlimited abortions But the boundaries between health related and nonhealth related circumstances must be the same for all segments of the population Our failure to come to grips with the problem of universal health insurance and our condonation of a double standard of care are major factors in the present deadlock As a way out it seems best to accepton a oneor twoyear basiscontinued payment of Medicaid funds for abortion when deemed healthrelated or medically necessary and to use this time to 1 force the Administration to come forward with an insurance proposal that addresses the basic issue of equity in a context of limited resources and 2 force the medical and public health Nofessions to come up with acceptable criteria for determination of health relatedness or medical necessity in this complex and highly sensitive area Prof ANNE R SOMERS College of Medicine and Dentistry of N J Piscataway N J Nov 24 1977 Pornography Where Judgments Should Be Made To the Editor In Dissenters and Pornographers in the Nov 22 Editorial Notebook Walter Goodman takes PEN to task for mindless evenhandedness in issuing a Freedom to Write Global Report which includes a number of Americans prosecuted for violation of obscenity statutes While he does not object to PENs plea that prosecutors desist from use of these statutes to harass and arrest publishers editors and bookstore owners he is dismayed that an organization devoted to the written word should place a handful of hustling pornographers in the company of some of the bravest people of our time We believe that any interference with freedom of expression endangers all freedom of expression As you indicated in your own editorial of Feb 10 on the Larry Flynt arrest There is little virtue in leaping to the defense of admirable publications The test of our commitment to a free society lies in the courage to defend the disreputable or the vulgar in the service of a higher goal The distinctions Mr Goodman calls for are important and we attempted to make them in a statement issued with the report More important Mr Goodman should understand as a member of our organization that our charter commits us to the principle of unhampered transmission of thought within each nation and between all nations In pursuit of that principle we prefer that judgments of pornography be made in the marketplace of ideas not in the courtroom and that judgments of bravery not be contingent upon individual assessments of literary quality RICHARD HOWARD DORE ASHTON New York Nov 23 1977 The writers are respectively president of PEN American Center and chairman of its Freedom to Write Committee Of Science and a Church To the Editor The statement of MIT sociology professor David Lerner reported in The York Times of Nov 28 that accepting money from Sun Myung Moons church is no worse than accepting grants from the Carnegie Ford and Rockefeller Foundations misses the point and must be challenged Whatever the original source of these foundations money and the nature and motives of the donors the point is that the current practices of these foundations is to support true scientific research Moons church has nothing in common with true scientific inquiry the difference between his evangelistic mystical extreme rightwing and Korean CIAconnected demogoguery and the policies of the Carnegie Ford and Rockefeller Foundations  however one may criticize those policies for too often being on the safe sideis vast Science and the society which it serves will benefit only from the relentless pursuit of the facts The policies of the Moon church are the direct opposite in fact the conference about which The Times article is written is called only to make a religious and political point not further the cause of science It is a bad mistake to confuse the issue ALAN MCGOWAN President Scientists Institute for Public Information New York Nov 29 1977 On Giving Long Island Rater From the Hudson To the Editor The Corps of Engineers 8 million plan to design a 4 billion system to provide Hudson River water to New York City and to Nassau County represents a wasteful expenditure as far as the latter is concerned Nassaus substantial groundwater supply is far superior in quality and projections indicate adequate reserves for at least 50 years The system may cost Nassau an estimated 800 million for unneeded and unwanted water An additional fiscal trap might be involved if the city were to declare bankruptcy before the bond issues were paid off and if Nassau would be obligated to assume a larger share of the entire cost It seems odd that the Corps would want to spend millions on a plan to tap drinking water from the Hudson when fish from that river are considered unsafe for human consumption because of highly toxic substances absorbed therein JULIAN KANE GREGORY FARLEY Great Neck LI Nov 20 1977 Our One Language To the Editor One country one languageEnglish The decision of a District Court judge mandating bilingual education in New York schools was in my opinion a gross error Those who lose most by that decision are the children it presumed to aid The United States is their country now and they should be educated in the one language of this nationEnglish Without a fluent command of English the children will be limited as they grow in educational and employment opportunities Since the earliest days in our national history millions of immigrants from all over the world have come here come and accepted English as the language of their country The first generation had in many cases difficulty with English for a time but they made sure their children learned well to speak and write the language of their adopted country The school board should seek aggressively to overturn the present mandate for bilingual education W EARL McCoaracK Bronxville N Y Nov 26 1977 Westway Questions To the Editor There are many unfortunate side effects which proponents of the Westway ignore Unquestionably the Westway will speed automotive traffic allowing goods to move into the city and businesses to move out Your economic analysis editorial Nov 14 does not tell us how many fewer people will be on mass transit how the city should scale down its revenue needs to compensate for reduced employment or how the schools should adjust when middleclass parents and students go up the Westway and out of the city Before building this highway we should be told where the fuel is corning from and how much it will cost us economically and politically ROBERT E FELDMAN Jamaica NY Nov 14 1977 Social Security Misconception on Employers Tax To the Editor Your Nov 4 editorial A Social Security Fix but Not A Solution correctly emphasizes the importance of keeping the Social Security taxes as visible as possible and encourages a gradual rise in the basic retirement age to 68 Unfortunately the editorial lends currency to what I believe is a misconception A the employers Social Security payroll tax is deductible in determining the employers Federal income tax and B the employer therefore bears only about half of the cost of the payroll tax Statement A is obviously correct in normal situations Economists and others knowledgeable in the field generally reject statement B They agree that as stated elsewhere in your editorial There is strong evidence that the employers share of the tax whatever it is will be passed back to employees through lower wages or forward to consumers through price increases If thus passed forward or back it will not affect profits and therefore will not reduce Federal income taxes It is economic common sense that the sale price of any product must reflect all of the applicable costs The cost of employees salaries and of raw materials Is deductible in calculating a companys Federal income tax However no one has suggested that such costs are therefore being largely borne through Federal general revenue operations Such a suggestion is similarly implausible when applied to Social Security payroll taxes Is this point significant Your editorial says Uncle Sam would absorb about half the new employer payroll tax in the form of reduced corporate income tax revenuesland argues that this is a benign form of concealed general revenue financing I believe this Invites misunderstanding A more dangerous suggestion appears in a recent letter to the Editor from Prof Arnold J Olenick Because the employer tax is subsidized Professor Olenick argues parity requires that employees should pay about half as much as employers The premise is fallacious The same fallacy has just appeared in another letter to the Editor from Eveline M Burns a retired Columbia University professor of social work The letter states as to employer payroll taxes and the deduction thereof The general taxpayer must make good the lessened tax yield A misconception The tax yield is lessened very little if at all The Times should publicly reject the thesis that the Federal Government is paying for half of the cost of the employer payroll taxes through the deductibility feature in the corporate income tax This would be a marvelous contribution to straight thinking on these confusing issues ROBERT F LINK New York Nov 28 1977 The writer is chairman of the Committee on Social Insurance of the American Academy of Actuaries

House Liberals Join Conservatives In Rejecting a New Abortion Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/07/archives/house-liberals-join-conservatives-in-rejecting-a-new-abortion-plan.html,WASHINGTON Dec 6Liberals and conservatives united in the House of Representatives today to defeat a proposed compromise on the abortion issue that was considered too permissive by those opposing abortion and too stringent by those who support freer access to abortions Todays vote marked the 14th effort to obtain a compromise on the fivemonth stalemate between the House which seeks a stringent abortion ban and the Senate which would make some exceptions It was the first time that liberals voted with conservatives against a compromiseeffort The vote was 200 to 170 Carter Administration officials warned today that unless a compromise was reached by 8 AM Friday 240000 Federal employees would receive only partial paychecks next week The officials added that if the deadlock persisted there would be no Federal funds in January for 11 million welfare families two million elderly recipients of supplemental welfare payments and 24 million Medicaid recipients Rider on Appropriations Bill These funds are imperiled because the ban on Federal financing of abortions for lowincome women was attached as a House rider to 601 billion in appropriations for the Department of Labor and the Department of Health Edcation and Welfare and has prevented passage of the bill To avert this predicament the House voted today to continue to finance the two agencies but with the existing prohibition against Medicaid abortions except when the mothers life is endangered The Senate as expected rejected this proposal tonight and returned to the House a proposal similar to the one rejected earlier today by the House Both Democratic and Republican leaders in the House supported todays compromise effort although the Speaker Representative Thomas P ONeill Jr of Massachusetts told reporters that he was taking no part in the proceeding The leaders stressed the plight of employees of the two Federal departments facing payless paydays before Christmas Representative Robert H Michel of Illinois the Republican whip sponsored the compromise proposal This provided for a ban on Medicaid abortions except in cases of forcible rape and incest that had been promptly reported to the law enforcement or public health authorities and cases in which a woman would suffer severe and longlasting injury if the pregnancy was carried to term Representative George Miller referring to the South Bronx asked What happens in Fort Apache where a girl is gangraped and told she will be killed if she reports it

COMPROMISE 15 VOTED BY HOUSE AND SENATE IN ABORTION DISPUTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/08/archives/compromise-15-voted-by-house-and-senate-in-abortion-dispute.html,WASHINGTON Dec 7The House and Senate compromised today on their dispute over the use of Medicaid funds for abortion ending a fivemonth impasse that had held up appropriations for two major Government departments The compromise liberalizes current law by allowing Medicaid to finance abortions for physically ill women and certain medical procedures to avert pregnancy for some victims of incest and rape The measure passed in the House by a vote of 181 to 167 and in the Senate by voice vote with just three Members present was a joint resolution that superseded a bill appropriating 601 billion for the Department of Labor and the Department of Health Education and Welfare Its passage and President Carters expected signature will end financial uncertainties for the two departments which had been financed on a monthtomonth basis since Oct 1 The compromise was considered likely to set a pattern for state legislation on the controversial subject although both supporters and opponents vowed a renewed fight when the ban is up for renewal next spring Abortions for poor women in this country have been liberalized under the compromise language said Senator Edward W Brooke Republican of Massachusetts who is a leading opponent of the stringent ban sought by the House The compromise was opposed however by Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois who is the author of the ban on the use of Medicaid funds for abortions The compromise came after 72 hours of intensive negotiations between leaders of the House and Senate under the threat of payless paydays for 240000 employees of the two departments unless the stalemate was ended by 8 AM Friday The impasse was broken when the House voted to accept a Senate compromise proposal with one minor modification The proposal was offered by Representative Robert H Michel of Illinois the Republican whip as members of the Senate Appropriations Committee stood by awaiting the outcome The House had steadfastly adhered to its position a restatement of the present law which allows the use of Medicaid funds for abortion only when the life of the mother would be endangered she were allowed to give birth The compromise provided however that abortions would be allowed when the mother would suffer severe and longlasting physical health damage she were allowed to give birth The compromise also allowed the use of Medicaid funds for medical procedures such as dilation and currettage in cases of rape and incest that had been promptly reported to a law enforcement agency or public health service The House yielded on its previous insistence that such procedures be allowed only before the fact of pregnancy was established The House also relented on its previous insistence that only victims of rape as opposed to statutory rape be allowed these procedures The compromise thereby allowed such procedures in cases of statutory rape or intercoursee involving a minor because minors are deemed legally incapable of giving their consent About onethird of the 260000 Medicaid abortions last year were performed on minors Prompt Reporting Defined As for prompt reporting of rape and incest Senator Brooke and Senator Howard M Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio said on the Senate floor last night that reporting within weeks or months could be considered prompt The House aoted after having narrowly rejected a Senate compromise offer similar in all but one respect to the one finally accepted The one difference which finally led to House approval was an addition that provided that two physicians be required to certify that womans physical health was in jeopardy Senator Brooke said that it would be fair to assume that onethird of the 260000 Medicaid abortions that took place before legislative restrictions went into effect last June would be allowed by the compromise language Thus although Medicaid funds can no longer be freely used for abortions as was the case after the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of abortions in 1973 the compromise language is not as restrictive as the present law Moreover the compromise instructs the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare to promulgate directives for the implementation of the new legislat4on that will give some latitude in interpreting the new language The compromise appeared unlikely to satisfy either those opposing abortion of those who support freer access to abortions Aryeh Neier executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union called the decision no compromise at all It is a brutal treatment of women with rnedical needs for abortions he said This law denies women the right to control their destiny it denies doctors the right to practice medicine it imposes the religious views of some groups on others it interferes with the right to privacy and it penalizes the poor Dr Robert L Kerbsbach a vice president of the National Right to Life Committee said that the committee was willing to accept the language of the House prior to this compromise but he added that we do not feel the compromise protects the unborn from abortion hardly at all

ABORTION FUND FIGHT EXPECTED IN ALBANY,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/09/archives/abortionfund-fight-expected-in-albany-but-action-in-congress-is-not.html,ALBANY Dec 8State offiials said today that the compromise reached in Congress yesterday on the use of Medicaid funds for abortions would have no immediate effect on state practices of paying for such operations and would have little financial effect for New York But legislative leaders predicted a bitter battle in the coming months over whether to recast the states policy in the more restrictive Federal language The Assembly Speaker Stanley Steincut Brooklyn Democrat said he was certain an effort would be made to change the states law which currently allows Medicaid reimbursement for abortions that are judged medically necessary The compromise reached yesterday in Wasington would allow Federal Medicaid financing for abortions for physically ill women and certain medical procedures to avert pregnancies of victims of incest and rape Asked how effective he felt an Assembly effort to tighten New York States law would be Mr Steingut replied Im not so sure and he added Its going to be a knockdown dragout fight In the Republicancontrolled Senate the majority leader Warren M Anderson of Binghamton called Medicaid financing of abortions an issue were going to have to raise early in the session and he also predicted a major fight but he did not indicate what he thought the outcome might be The legislative leaders seldom exercise their considerable influence on moral or social issues such as abortion and recent antiabortion efforts in the Legislature have failed although narrowly But the fact that state elections are coming up and the vacancies created by local elections last November make any predictions cloudy Senator Frank K Padavan Republican of Queens who is a major opponent of public financing for abortions said yesterday that he would take a bill he introduced last year to end Medicaid financing of abortions entirely and amend it along the lines of the Federal compromise in an effort to get it out of committee But he said that even with the broader Federal language it will be extremely difficult to get passed especially in the Assembly The current socialservices law defines a medically necessary procedure as one that is necessary to prevent diagnose correct or cure a condition that causes acute suffering endangers life results in illness or infirmity or interferes with ones capacity for normal activity A spokesman for the Department of Social Services Steven Morello said the state would continue its policy of submitting abortion claims to the Federal Goyernment and splitting with local governments any part that the Federal Goverhment did not pick up Thus if the Federal Government refused an abortion claim the state and local governments would each continue each to pick up half the cost Mr Morello said it appeared that the compromise reached in Washingtdn would provide slightly more financial aid on Medicaidfinanced abortions but he could not determine the amounts of money that would be involved
The Volatile Issue of Sterilization Abuse: A Tangle of Accusations and Remedies,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/09/archives/the-volatile-issue-of-sterilization-abuse-a-tangle-of-accusations-a.html,On April 24 1973 Valerie Cllett of Philadelphia gave birth to a son and except for her disappointment that her third child was not a girl the delivery in the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania was totally uneventful The following day the 23yearold mother was taken to the operating room and sterilized Mrs Cliett said the other day that she had not requested the surgery does not know who ordered it did not know in advance that it was to be done and did not learn until six months later that the effect of tubal ligationthe cutting and tying of the fallopian tubes to block the passage of spermwas virtually always permanent Last year Mrs Cliett underwent an operation to reverse the procedure The doctors [at the hospitals infertility service] told me that I didnt have every good odds she said in the interview but if thats what I wanted thats what they would do I told them that being that the first operation was done without my consent this operation would be done with my consent It was performed on June 22 1976 and she was told it was a success but she has yet to conceive Put Me Back Like They Found Me Now Mrs Cliett a student at a community college who has plans to become a lawyer and get off the publicassistance rolls is considering a second operation or legal action I really dont want to sue she said I just want them to put me back like they found me Dr George R Huggins director of the family planning service at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania said he could not discuss details of the case without the patients signed agreement However he said M a general policy the specific request for a sterilization is to be instituted by the patient unless there is a compelling medical reason It has always been my job to insure we make a 110 percent effort to prevent abuse No one knows how pervasive aterilization abuse is But one Government official said last week that the number of women who had been unwittingly sterilized in recent years was surely in the thousands The preponderance of those women are said to be poor or members of minority groups Doctors concede that there have been abuses but contend that they have been rare In any case the issue has become one of impassioned concern not just because of past abuse but also because of the fear of future abuse Although it was somewhat eclipsed recently by the furor over abortion financing sterilization abuse is every bit as volatile an issue It has made adversaries out of longtime allies it has pitted consumer medical institution and government agency against one another it has raised questions of economics race and class Charges covering a wide range from violation of individual freedom to genocide in the case of programs conducted among American Indian women have volleyed back and forth Authorities say that blame for abuse Is hard to affix A constellation of people Is responsible but the Major problems come from the medical and welfare establishment because they are in the strongest position to frighten said Nancy Stearns a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights Last week Joseph A Califano Jr the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare proposed a set of regulations intended to make sure that women who did not wish to be sterilized were not coerced into being sterilized and that those who did were thoroughly briefed in the alternatives to and ramificiations of their decisions The new Federal guidelines would require among other provisions CTht 30 days elapse between the time the prospective patient signs what is known as an informed consent and the actual operation 9That the physician state in writing that he has fully explained the risks and benefits of sterilization and has made it clear that the patient would not forfeit welfare benefits or other benefits if she declined the procedure 9That sterilization not be carried out on any person younger than 21 The regulations would also attempt to curtail the use of hysterectomies as a form of birth control The Califano proposals left open for public comment the highly controversial question of sterilization of the mentally incompetent who cannot be treated under the existing guidelines The proposals now subject to 10 regional hearings and a 90day period for comments would apply only to those procedures financed with Federal money which comprise an estimated 10 percent of all sterilizations done In this country According to F Peter Libassi chief counsel for the Department of Health Education and Welfare the Government is preparing to back the proposals with a strong system of enforcement and monitoring By contrast a similar law effective in New York City since June and known as the Burden Bill for its sponsor Councilman Carter Burden of Manhattan covers all sterilizations no matter where they are carried out or how they are financed For the time being city officials said monitoring of this and other sterilization regulations are at best superficial Because of the prominence of the issue authorities are hopeful that with vigilant enforcement the new laws will make abuse nearly impossible But womenparticularly those not covered by Federal funds or those who live in the many localities that do not yet have laws governing sterilizationare advised not to sign consent forms they dont understand and to ask questions Just as legislation is tightening control of sterilization litigation is proliferating Several major cases based on allegations similar to those made by Mrs Cliett are about to be heard in courts across the country Clearly such cases of alleged abuse are extreme But it has been shown sterilization abuse can also transgress common sensitivity in lesser ways But asked Nancy Stearns of the Center for Constitutional Rights What does lesser mean Letting a woman go into this so It appears to be voluntary but not telling her that it is permanent so that she cannot give informed consent is not lesser And the hardest part of all is documenting the abuse Karen Stamm of the Committee to End Sterilization Abuse enumerated other harmful practices most of which would be rendered illegal by the new regulations Its being pressured while youre In labor or about to have an abortion its being told that if you dont sign the consent your welfare payments will be cut off its being told that there is a medical necessity for a hysterectomy when thereis not its not being told that sterilization is permanent its not being offered other methods of contraception its the use of the package deal in which women are told they must sign for a sterilization to get an abortion The Indirect Ways The pressure some women contend can be applied in more indirect ways Mary Foran of San Francisco a coordinator at the Coalition for the Medical Rights of Women said With abortion funds being cut off and sterilization stilt available there will be more impetus toward sterilization As far as were concerned sterilization is not bad but when its the only option thats not a choice HEW she pointed out reimburses the states at the rate of 90 percent for family planning including sterilization and 50 percent for all other health services Women do need contraceptive services she said but when the emphasis between that and child care is unequal then thats coercion Sterilization abuse is considered not only the act of commission but the act of omission as well This was the view of Merrie Spaeth deputy director of national affairs for the Association for Voluntary Sterilization On the one hand you have the doctor who says in English to the Hispanic woman in the throes of labor Wouldnt you like me to solve your problems Sign here On the other hand you also have the doctor in Appalachia where the fee is 150 turning down the woman with 149 in her hand Sterilization she continued is virtually unavailable to the marginally poor those who are ineligible for Medicaid or other Federal assistance The more affluent may also find doors closed to them Theres still tremendous resistance on the part of doctors Miss Spaeth said The typical response to a couple in their late 20s married four years with one child is Youre too young you dont know your own mind Some people believe that one way to diminish abuse is to offer sterilization in settings other than hospitals so that candidates would have to deliberately seek out the service But efforts in that direction have further enflamed the issue Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Association for Voluntary Sterilization have put their energies into an outofhospital project in which clinics would use among other procedures a minilaparotomy which is a relatively simple operation But opponents including some feminists who on other occasions have been allies of Planned Parenthood argue that the clinics by making sterilization a simpler outpatient procedure would be minimizing the importance of a virtually irreversible step The Preservation of Rights No matter how sterilization abuse is defined arguments about it focus essentially on the preservation of rights Some people believe that its an invasion of the constitutional rights of the individual woman to have to wait those 30 days that the First Amendament grants the right of privacy between physician and patient said Denise Fuge coordinator of the women and health committee of the New York Chapter of the National Organization for Women Ideally she went on there should be no legislation at all on sexual behavior but unfortunately abuses have made it necessary Now with legisla tion moving so fast we must look at the question of personal rights versus the general good The 30day guideline must be observed because it gives women the chance to be educated Some physicians have a drastically different outlook They believe that regulations limit rather than broaden patients rights and can do more harm than good Dr James Batts director of obstetrics and gynecology at the Harlem Hospital Center said It was already difficult for women requesting tub ligation to actually get it Since the restrictions its even worse Doctorsust dont want to go through the hassle Dr Schuyler Kohl the Kings County Hospital obstetrics and gynecology chief and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Downstate Medical Center said I object to the treatment of sterilization as a totally different operation If you wish to have your head opened all you have to do is sign a piece of paper If you want your tubes tied you are not considered capable of making that decision sterilization Some regulations interfere with quality medical care he continued citing the case of a patient who was already in labor when she was admitted to his service the other day She was a visitor from Guyana here on a convention and was having her fourth or fifth Caesarean he said She was well informed and asked for a sterilization We had to say Sorry you must wait 30 more days That means another admission another anesthetic another separation from family Its not good medical practice If there is one issue that all factions agree upon it is the need for the developinent of a safe and acceptable contraceptive That more than anything else the authorities say would go a long way toward eliminating abuse As Dr Myron Gordon chief of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Metropolitan Hospital put it Were being bombarded with articles on the terrible dangers of the pill the IUD of this that and the other method And then were telling women We want you to use contraception not sterilization On the Court Docket In the coming weeks a number of cases involving sterilization abuse will reach court in State Supreme Court In Brooklyn the case of Rosalind Johnson is on the docket for Dec 22 Miss Johnson is suing the city on the grounds that in March 1976 while she was a prisoner on Rikers Island she was taken to the Kings County Hospital Center Brooklyn for a lateterm abortion and while there she underwent a tubal ligation Lee Goldsmith her lawyer said that Miss Johnson then 20 years old was told by a doctor If you become a normal citizen you can have your tubes untied Dr Schuyler G Kohl chief of obstetrics and gynecology at the hospital said the other day that he had the proper consent form signed by Miss Johnson in his possession On Jan 11 the Federal District Court in Pittsburgh will take up the case of Norma Jean Serena a Shawnee Indian who was sterilized in conjunction with the birth of her fifth child She had been abandoned by her husband and was on welfare When she became pregnant with that child said her lawyer Richard Levine the welfare authorities decided that she would be sterilized for socioeconomic reasons On Jan 31 10 Spanishspeaking women will charge in individual suits filed in the District Court for the Central District of California that they were sterilized without having given their consent at the University of Southern CaliforniaLos Angeles Medical Center According to their lawyer Georgina Torres Rizk of the Los Angeles Center for Law and Justice nine of the 10 women were legally married none was on public assistance and all hoped to hear more children All underwent Caesarean sections and all had tubal ligation Only one spoke English One Guadeloupe Acosta went through an 11month pregnancy and then had a stillborn child When she returned to the hospital several weeks later for cotraception she learned that she had been sterilized There is a consent form in her file signed by her commonlaw husband Mrs Rizk said that he thought he was signing only for the Caesarean Nancy Menzies is the lawyer for the nine physicians who are the defendants in this case Its to close to the trial date to discuss the case she said but we have filed specific answers to certain allegations

A Sad Compromise on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/10/archives/a-sad-compromise-on-abortion.html,The abortion legislation finally passed by a weary Congress last week has been hailed by some as a compromise Senator Javits went further saluting the measure as a victory for humanity and enlightenment  major victory for womens rights But the sad reality is that after five months of bitter debate Congress has endorsed an abortion law that is a defeat True the new law will somewhat expand the opportunity for poor women to qualify for federally funded abortions Under the old rules Medicaid abortions were available only when the life of the mother was endangered Now funding will also be provided for the victims of rape and incest if such cases are promptly reported to a law enforcement agency or public health service Funds will also be available if two doctors certify that the mother would suffer severe and longlasting physical health damage by giving birth to the child How is this compromise likely to be regarded by the thousands of women who each year learn that they will give birth to a seriously deformed or retarded child but cannot afford an abortion Medicaid ironically will pay for the amniocentesis test that ferrets out genetic information about a fetusbut not to end such a pregnancy Nor will Medicaid pay for an abortion for a pregnant woman who has been exposed to German measles though her baby is quite likely to be born deformed Some victory Some compromise
Berger v. Brown et al.,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/11/archives/berger-v-brown-et-al-berger.html,A PRIME task of scholarship Raoul Berger asserts is to heighten public awareness that the Court is overleaping its bounds With this mission Mr Berger has written a massive polemic against the Supreme Courts interpretation the 14th Amendment to the Constitution condemning virtually every important decision since the Amendment was adorned shortly after the Civil War Many others have criticized the Courts decisions under the 14th Amendment for interfering with state powers over legislative apportionment abortion pornography crime and the like But excluding apologists for racism Berger is almost alone in arguing that the Court erred in Brown v Board of Educationthe 1954 case that struck down laws forbidding black and white children to attend the same schools His analysis condemns not only the Brown decision but also the entire network of constitutional decisions underlying our legal commitment to racial equality only for this reason one would expect to find Bergers thesis supported by careful and objective scholarship Instead the reader is given a simplistic and myopic argument and a wrong conclusion The 14th Amendment adopted in 1868 provides No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States nor shall any State deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws The central thesis of Government by Judiciary is that all three of these broadly worded clauses serve the very limited purpose of prohibiting certain discriminatory practices listed in the Civil Rights Act of 1866discrimination the rights to make and enforce contracts to own and transfer property to sue and testify in the courts and to be subject to equal criminal punishments Segregation and the many other forms of discrimination not prohibited by the Act are therefore beyond the reach of the 14th Amendment The very text of the 14th Amendment presents an obvious difficulty for the claim that its sole purpose was to incorporate the Civil Rights Act of 1866 If so why didnt the drafters take the direct route of incorporating the Acts language into the Amendment Why instead does the Amendment prohibit the states from denying equal protection of the laws And why does the Amendment also prohibit states from abridging privileges or immunities and denying due processclauses taken from analogous provisions already in the Constitution and which had never been understood to concern racial discrimination The concept of due process rooted in English law concerned the regularity of judicial procedures and an 1823 opinion regarded as the leading judicial interpretation the phrase privileges and immunities included the rights to vote travel and pursue happiness and safety and indicated that the clause encompassed numerous other rights Berger does some fancy footwork against the text and historical understanding of these clauses but they prove stalwart opponents to his thesis In any case the Courts race discrimination cases are not based on the due process or the privileges and immunities clause but the seemingly more relevant equal protection clausewhich had no antecedent technical meaning but originated in the committee that drafted the Amendment GOVERNMENT BY JUDICIARY The Transformation of the Fourteenth Amendment By Raoul Berger 483 pp Cambridge Harvard University Press 15 Berger relies chiefly on the intent of the framers of the 19th Amendment as evidenced in Congressional proceedings to circumscribe its sweeping language In the course of debates over the Civil Rights Act of 1866 much attention focused on a proposed clause prohibiting discrimination in civil rights or immunities Opponents of the Act asserted that the clause would force states to give blacks the vote and to abandon all forms of segregation Despite sponsors assurances that the clause was merely shorthand for the specifically listed rights to make contracts etc it was ultimately deleted from the Act The same Congress that enacted the Civil Rights Act drafted and proposed the 14th Amendment One motivation for the Amendment was to provide a firm constitutional basis for the Civil Rights Act some doubts having been expressed whether the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery sufficed During the debates over the 14th Amendment opponents repeated some of the charges they had made against the proposed civil rights or immunities clause of the Act and some supporters asserted that the Amendment did not go beyond the Act Berger asserts that this legislative history together with the prevalence of racism within the Congress and the practice of discrimination throughout the country means that the 19th Amendment embodies only the limited commitment to racial equality specified in the 1866 Act Although Berger is correct that some legislators claimed the Amendment did not go beyond the Civil Rights Act otherssupporters as well as opponentsdescribed its broad clauses in equally broad terms Just as surely as the debates show that one purpose of the Amendment was to provide a constitutional basis for the Act they also demonstrate that no one could have voted for the Amendment believing this to be its only purpose or effect And if some members of Congress attributed a narrow meaning to the equal protection clause there is scant evidence that this interpretation was known to let alone shared by the state legislators who voted to ratify the Amendment Should the unqualified language of the equal protection clause nevertheless be read to insulate those discriminatory practicesincluding school segregationthat the nation was not ready to eliminate in the 1860s The beginning of an answer lies in the difference between statutes which are typically designed to deal with immediate problems and a Constitution which as Chief Justice Marshall observed is intended to endurefor ages to come and consequently to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs The equal protection clause is not a code of regulations for race relations but rather embodies a general constitutional principle an idealof racial equality As Representative Bingam the Amendments principal drafter said We are all for equal and exact justice but justice for all is not to be secured in a day That those who adopted the Amendment were not ready to make good on its promise is the tragedy of their time but hardly warrants our repeating their failure Thus Bergers argument fails on its own terms for neither the text nor the history of the Amendment supports his view that the framers intended to confine its prohibitions to the handful of practices outlawed by the Civil Rights Act But it is worth noting that many scholars and judges reject Bergers major premise that constitutional interpretation should depend chiefly on the intent of those who framed and adopted a provision They argue that whatever the framers expectations may have been broad constitutional guarantees require the Court to discern articulate and apply values that are widely and deeply held by our society and that these values though rooted in our historical traditions and beliefs may evolve over time The ultimate touchstone for this alternative theory of constitutional interpretation is not the intent of people long since dead but the consent of the living The processes of appointing judges and carrying out their decisions tend to assure this consent And if the Court errs by trying to enforce values we have discarded or have not come to hold our constitutional scheme provides a variety of correctives only the last of which is amendment Judicial review typically is not the final word but the beginning of a dialogue between the Court and other political institutions This is not the appropriate place to analyze these fundamentally opposed views of the relevance of the framers intent But Government by Judiciary is just such a place since its entire thesis rests on the assumption that the intent of the framers in the narrowest possible sense determines for all time the proper interpretation of the most broadly worded constitutional guarantees Regrettably Berger makes no coherent effort to support this controversial and problematic notion Only a few pages toward the end of the book address the issue directly And here in lieu of reasoned argument the reader finds a collection of quotations more or less favoring the authors view and brief parodies of opposing theories Despite its questionable assumptions a book of this sort might have been valuable in setting out the relevant historical materials But Berger has not unearthed anything new and his presentation of the data is so disorganized and repetitious and so persistently distorted to support his thesis that  Government by Judiciary is a frustrating and unrewarding sourcebook For the reader who seeks a balanced critical assessment of some of the judicial doctrines that Berger attacks recommend The Supreme Court and the Idea of Progress written by Alexander Bickel a few years before his untimely death III
Cutoffs on Medicaid Prompt Shift inThinking on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/11/archives/cutoffs-on-medicaid-prompt-shift-in-thinking-on-abortion-impetus-fo.html,The almost total cutoff of Medicaid funds for abortions in New Jersey and Connesut last summer has brought substantial changes in the ways indigent women deal wth their pregnancies Many poor residents of both states are obtaining abortions despite the lack of aid largely because some doctors and clinics are trying to provide them at low cost But often doctors and abortion counselors say women are going into debt or using money from their monthly welfare checks that they had earmarked for necessities Many other women are going ahead with their pregnancies often after seeking an abortion from a doctor or hospital and being turned away for lack of funds When youre getting 310 a month to take 100 out if itthats a big dent when you have to pay your rent food electricity clothes transportation said Mary Morse of the Planned Parenthood Association of the Mercer Area in Trenton It just make the situation much more difficult Its already a difficult situation Officials in both states said they did not know yet whether their state policies would have to be modified as a result of a compromise reached in Congress Wednesday that among other things allows Medicaid assistance where the womans physical health is endangered by her pregnancy The current New Jersey and Connecticut rules forbid aid unless the abortion is necessary to save a womans lifein sharp contrast to New York where state residents who are eligible for Medicaid generally can get coverage for just about any abortion The new Congressional formula though would allow the states to bar Mediaid funds for the majority of abortions Impetus for Policies The two states policies went into effectAug 15 in New Jersey and Sept 1 in Connecticutin the wake of the June 20 Supreme Court ruling that neither the Constitution nor the Federal law in effect at that time required states to spend Medicaid funds for nontherapeutic aJortions The basic impetus was the opposition by many residents of both states to abortion generally and the view of many of these people that taxpayer dollars should not be used to foster abortion About 10000 women had Medicaidfinanced abortions in New Jersey last year and about 2000 in Connecticut Only a small percentage would have met the current state criteria In Connecticut according to the Department of Social Services Medicaid paid for 144 abortions in September 1976 this September it paid for six In October 1976 there were 153 in October 1977 there was only one Presumably though at least as many Medicaid recipients will want abortions this year as last Indeed the number of women in New Jersey who received Medicaidfinanced abortions had been going up markedly each year until the cutofffrom 5500 in 1974 to 8300 in 1975 to 10000 in 1976 But government officials doctors hospitals family planning and abortion groups and antiabortion groups say it is still too early to assess the full impact of the cutoff A Significant Effect Interviews with several dozen people involved with abortion issues and services though and talks with several welfare clients seeking abortions suggested that the cutoffs are having significant effects on many women The women include some whose cases would be cited by advocates of Medicaid assistance for abortion in justification of their position and some whose cases would be cited by opponents of Medicaid help Examples of the first group include a 13yearold Camden NJ girl who became pregnant after she was raped She was afraid to tell her mother of the rape and by the time her mother realized she was pregnant she was in her second trimester or het second three months They applied to the local Planned Parenthood affiliate for help but they could not raise enough for a late second trimester abortion costanywhere from 250 to 600 or 700 depending on where it is performed and the womans condition I would assure you this is only one Up of the iceberg said Geraldine S Rosen executive director of the Camden Planned Parenthood chapter In a different kind of case a 23yearold Union City NJ woman who is on welfare went for an abortion recently to Metropolitan Medical Associates in Englewood NJ The medical group was created by Dr Robert M Livingston who was prominent in the legal challenges nver thp years to antiabortion laws Medicaid to r3 Abortions The young woman said it was her fourth abortion Each of the previous three had been paid for by Medicaid Only onceafter the third abortiondid she try to use any birth control methods she said The charge for her abortion was 100 a reduced fee that the medical group has set as its maximum for welfare clients She got the money frcm a male friend Spot checks at hospitals and clinics in both states showed that many women who before the cutoffs might have been expected to get abortions are apparently now going ahead with their pregnancies Mary Singletary director of the Planned Parenthood chapter in Newark I said her group is making more referrals for prenatal care than ever before At Martland Hospital in Newark a counselor said she had seen women in the hospitals prenatal clinic who told her they were there because they could not get the money for abortions At Hartford Hospital some women apply for abortions but are unable to pay for them The hospital provides a few reduced rates or free abortions perhaps an average of three or four a week according to Dr Joseph D Millerick the assistant director of obstetrics and gynecology But it turns other women away perhaps five a week Of those Dr Millerick sail some gc directly to the prenatal section and enroll for care I dont know whether it is a sense of frustration or whether they were ambivalent he said The sad fact is there is not enough money to take care of all the patients who might want it Opponents of abortion however are pleased that such women are going ahead with their pregnancies Betty Yerkes the New Jersey regional consultant for Birthright a national antiabortion organization that provides range of services for women who need help during their pregnancies described one such case and said that the young woman is now happy to be carrying her child The woman 22 came to the Birthright office in Dover NJ thinking mistakenly that it was an abortion She was already in her fourth month of pregnancy and had been unable to get an abortion because of the Medicaid cutoff At Birthright she was told of what help was availableinciuding a doctor and a family in whose house she could stay while waiting for the birth She decided to go ahead with it and is living now with the family She will give the baby up for adoption A Family Setting The girl is thrilled Mrs Yerkes said because she never had a family setting before There are no indications yet of any network of illegal abortionists such as existed in the days when abortion vas illegal However there are signs that at least some illegal abortions and some selfinduced abortions are taking place Non Professional Abortions At Cooper Medical Center in Camden doctors are seeing an increase in the number of women suffering from what the hospitals director Dr Robert L Evans calls nonprofessional abortions There have always been some perhaps five or six a month Dr Evans said but since the cutoff the number is up to eight or 10 a month Abortion counselors and doctors in a number of areas say they are seeing another troublesome development more and more women who seek abortions are in their second trimester of pregnancy The surgical procedure in such abortions is more complicated and therefore more costly Many vbortion clinics do not perform abortions at all in the second threemonth period Medicaid patients now read that Medicaid doesnt pay for abortions so you get people saving money and then coming in said Marie Lambert a counselor at the Planned Parenthood chapter in Camden By the time we see it its too late The group has been able to find doctors who perform firstthreemonth abortions at a reduced rate of 95 and on rare occasions for as little as 10 she said But she added you cant help anyone after the first trimeter unless they have money Among the pregnant women the group could not help and who are now carryinp their pregnancies to term she said arc a 14yearold girl and a woman with four children and no husband who is under psychiatric care There Are Just Too Many There are just so many she said all as tragic A number of hospitals clinics and referral services say that significantly fewer welfare women are even showing up to ask for abortions Nevertheless many welfare women are managing to obtain abortions often at reduced cost A number of hosiptals and medical groups reduce their rates sharply if the patient is indigent and would have been eligible for Medicaid assistance before the cutoff At Metropolitan Medical Associates for instance the largest provider in the state the standard fee for an abortion in the first thre months is 180 but for welfare women abortions are sometimes performed for 75 or 50 depending on a womans ability to raise funds Occasionally the fee is even lower The group performs 800 to 850 abortions a month Before the cutoff about 20 percent of the women were Medicaid recipients Now presumably because of the reduced price the percentage of patients at that economic level is 23 or 24 percent At the Hudson Health Center in Jersey City the fee is 100 for the first trimester abortion of 10 to 14 abortions a day 20 percent are on welfare clients as opposed to 40 percent before the cutoff YaleNew Haven Hospital if there is absolutely no other way and if the woman lives in the area will do an abortion free The women raise the money for their abortions in various waysespecially by borrowing A 29yearold Jersey City woman netting an abortion the other day for 50 at Metropolitan Medical Associatessaid she had decided against asking a male friend for the money because Id rather not get his Youre sure its mine So she asked a girlfriend who in turn asked her husband The husband provided a 50 loan to be paid back the following week when the young woman got her 132 monthly welfare check The woman who lives with her mother and her 10month old baby and gets the welfare check to pay her own and her daughters living expenses said she is not sure what she will do about the dent in her budget Some indigent women from New Jersey and an occasional woman from Connecticut are apparently coming into New York City in search of affordable abortions At least one Manhattan clinic the Eatern Womens Center gives indigent New Jersey women abortions at reduced rates f the individual case seems to require it Others however are reluctant to do this Alfred F Moran director of the Planned Prrenthood chapter in New York City says that the three Planned

"Finally, An Abortion Law",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/11/archives/finally-an-abortion-law.html,Worn by a fivemonth war of nerves the House and Senate last week compromised on Medicaidfinanced abortions but it seemed to satisfy no one except perhaps the Federal employees whose preChristmas pay checks had been jeopardized by the dispute senator Edward M Brooke ofMassachusetts who had vigorously opposed the stringent ban sought by the House said that the agreement liberalized abortions for poor women But by Mr Brookes own reckoning the compromise would have allowed only about a third of the 260000 Medicaid abortions performed in the year before legislative restrictions took effect last June Advocates of free access to abortion contended that the new measure still discriminates against the poora complaint given weight by the fact that the United States now has in effect an official double standard on the public financing of such operations While Medicaid patients can qualify for abortion payments only under certain conditions Federal employees can get them on demand under dozens of Governmentfinanced medical insurance programs The compromise passed as a joint resolution to save time on parliamentary procedure goes beyond the original House position that Medicaid funds should be used for abortions only to protect a womans life Medical procedures to terminate pregnancydilation and currettage for exampleare permitted in cases of rape statutory rape or incest that have been reported to the authorities Abortions will be authorized to prevent severe and longlasting physical health damage but in these cases certificates from two physicians will be required to prevent fraud At best however the compromise was seen as a shortterm solution to an emotional longterm issue It ended a stalemate that had tied up an appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare and it cleared the decks for work on other legislation But the abortion resolution will be in effect only until April

"Surprisingly, the Governor Turns Out to Be a Surprise",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/11/archives/surprisingly-the-governor-turns-out-to-be-a-surprise-ella-grassos.html,The nominating convention will not be held until July but powerful forces in the Democratic Party in Connecticut are already at work to unseat their Democratic Governor Ella Grasso The dissatisfaction with Mrs Grasso elected in 1974 by a majority of 200000 votes has developed over the last three years and comes from many sources Political leaders in the cities are disappointed with her parsimonious spending ways Womens groups that supported her candidacy three years ago are dismayed because the Governor did not turn out to be a militant feminist For the party liberals she has been too conservative And the party regulars who play a less important role In dispensing patronage than they once did feel they have been ignored The most vociferous of her opponents is Nicholas R Carbone a Hartford city councilman who is a powerful figure in state politics He worked hard to get her elected Now he says looking to next year Ella Grasso cannot win Many of her supportersturnedcritics really had no reason to be surprised by her performance in office Mrs Grasso has been in Connecticut politics for 22 years never having lost an election in that time and her views should have been well known Yet the Connecticut Womens Political Caucus endorsed her candidacy in spite of her unrelenting oppostion to abortion The caucus believed optimistically that as Mrs Grasso was a woman she could perhaps be expected in office to look upon their position more sympathetically But just weeks after her inauguration the Governor suspended Medicaid payments for abortions Perhaps the biggest difference between the liberals and Mrs Grasso lies in her resistance to tax reform especially the introduction of a state income tax Yet again there should have been no surprise Mrs Grasso promised over and over in her campaign three years ago that if the General Assembly passed an income tax she would veto it She said again last month that her plans to reform the financing of public schools will not include an income tax Late last month a committee of the Caucus of Connecticut Democrats the partys disillusioned liberal wing met in Woodbridge to lay plans for interviewing potential candidates for Governor We also hope to meet with the Governor and discuss what initiatives she might have in mind for a second term said Mary Sullivan the state chairwoman for the caucus and also a member of the Democratic National Committee In other words Mrs Sullivan said were not ruling out Governor Grasso Governor Grasso has ruled out any chance that she might willingly step aside With two budget surpluses behind her and a third taking shape the Governor has said that she hoped to make adjustments in the tax package she will be submitting to the Assembly in February What adjustments did she have in mind the Governor was asked Adjustments are cuts she responded Not the sort talk one would expect to hear from a Governor who about to step down She has maintained all along that her strength lay not with the traditional factions of the party but with the voters and insists despite the rumors her detractors keep floating that she will fill out her term and seek reelection Mr Carbone has commissioned a statewide poll be taken in January to determine Mrs Grassos strength He believes he will get a negative result The disenchantment is mutual Mrs Grasso said of Mr Carbone The Governor endorsed a move at a recent meeting of the Democratic State Central Committee to conduct a similar poll it will be taken in February or March But the battle of the polls aside it seems that disaffection in the party will remain especially among the city Democratic leaders and the partys liberals They have little else in common but share a feeling that the Governor should have spent more on welfare on the blighted areas and on the schools Both factions feel this cannot be done without money that is without a tax reform that includes a graduated personal income tax We think thats sort of basic Mrs Sullivan said Without tax reform the state has not been able to tackle many of the problems that need some action We have been unhappy with the level of welfare payments and we dont feel there is sufficient movement on the equalization Of school finance or support for higher education Connecticut Democrats for the most part are not especlially liberal They are cautious even conservativemore inclined to care about labor issues than education and look for ways to put people to work rather than for ways to care for them better on welfare They seem to prefer the sales tax they have to an income tax At least that is what Governor Grasso believes An income tax was enacted on July 1 1971 but aroused such anger throughout the state that it was repealed 46 days later The General Assembly is still controlled by the suburban townsgenerally more conservative than the citiesthat feel comfortable with Governor Grasso Liberal Democrats talk now about going into league with the practical old political hands in the cities The state has really been dumping the problems back on the cities Mrs Sullivan said So I think theres probably morecommon ground than there might appear to be Lawrence Fellows writes on

"Welfare Reform: So Much Talk, So Little Action",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/12/archives/welfare-reform-so-much-talk-so-little-action.html,The leisurely process by which an overhaul of the nations welfare system is to be brought to fruition appears to have become even more leisurely The New York Times reported yesterday that the Carter Administrations proposal which is slated to gointo effect in October 1980 is beUrban lieved by key members of Affairs Congress and the Administration to have no chance of being enacted in this Congress Some Congressional observers are more pessimistic and believe that the plan is already dead If it is not dead it surely appears to be in trouble And President Carters problems with this issue call to mind not only problems that President Nixon had with welfare proposals in the early years of his first Administration but also the question of why when so many people seem to talk so much about welfare reform is it so extraordinarily hard to acheve The Nixon example is instructive Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan then a top adviser to Mr Nixon on domestic affairs cites liberal Democrats in the Senate and the Welfare Rights movement a nowdefunct activist group as the reasons for the demise of that legislation Other observers cite conservatives in Congress and Mr Nixons own conservative imPulses There is no dispute however that after the Nixon proposal had been bent and twisted through two hard years of Capitol Hill bargaining it was still drawing heat from both ends of the political spectrum Ofie obvious reason is that the welfare issue touches Americans very deeply and they have not nearly come to grips with their conflicts about the problem One major element of the still persisting conflicts was pinpointed by Ellen Leitzer a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who was deeply involved In the bruising battle to achieve the compromise in the legislation limiting the situations in which Medicaid funds can be used for abortions She said that she would have expected the conservative as she termed it to welcome Medicid abortions because they would ultimately have limited the number of people receiving welfare and have reduced the nations welfare bill But They opposed abortion anyway she said It doesnt make any sense to you conclude that theyll say no to any payments for things of this kind whenever they come up  no matter what the longrange consequences of any particular position they take may be Complexity of the Issue Beyond such instinctive reactions to welfare there is the enormous complexity of the issue President Carter attempted To give Congress a comprehensive alternative to a variety of programs for the poor to rationalize those programs to provide assistance to the working poor to provide incentives to work for the nonworking poor and to provide some relief for fiscally pressed state and local governments There are a lot of issues wrapped up In this program Eddie N Williams president of the Joint Center for Political Studies said in a recent interview There is the question of adequacy of benefits for recipients There is the issue of fairnesssome studies show that urban states will actually lose under this proposal There is the problem of cost for the Federal Government and there are the personal and social consequences for the recipients With work incentives in there youve got to be very careful about who you press into employment and what kind of pressures are going to be employed Some observers say that it would have been virtually impossible for the Administration to work out all the kinks and inconsistencies inherent in such a broad proposal and that moreover serious problems do exist They note for example that all families currently eligible tor Aid to Families With Dependent Children are also eligible for Medicaid federalstate program Under the Carter program which would provide help for some of the working poor the number of people eligible for Medicaid would rise substantially thus increasing the burden the states would have to bear in meeting their share of Medicaid costs Although officials of the Department of Health Education and Welfare assert that this problem can be overcome these Observers are dubious that it can be done without cumbersome bureaucratic machinery and with any modicum of fairness Different Point of View Richard Cloward a professor at the Columbia University School of Social Work and a longtime student and critic of the welfare system approaches the Carter proposals from a different angle His views dramatize the contradictions in welfare reform efforts and the difficulties involved in achieving legislative Pgreement In the early sixties there were only about 700000 families participating in the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program a minuscule fraction of those who needed it By the early seventies there were about 3 million famittes in the program That was a major step toward eliminating the worst poverty in the society Now the people who talk about reform are either governors who want fiscal relief or a lot of other tieople who really want to reduce the relief rolls That isnt reform Nevertheless those who want the programs rationalized and the benefits expanded still want legislation no matter how difficult the obstacles It would be a great tragedy for the reform effort to die said Mr Williams And even if the needed comprehensive reforrn cant be achieved Congress Shouldnt be relieved of the obligation to attack the principal parts of the problem Jobs for the hardcore unemployed ought to be the top priority The spirit of reform at least hasnt entirely died in Congress either Reform is inevitable and it is right to do We have to do it and have to do it right to the best effect There is no excuse for delay except for other priorities such as energy This is a good year fo do it But whether or not anything happens legislatively in 1978 it is clear that the debate over welfare reform will go on and on
FEDERAL EMPLOYEES GET AID FOR ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/12/archives/federal-employees-get-aid-for-abortion-but-new-limits-could.html,Congress has legislated restrictions on abortions for the poor at a time when the Federal Government is paying for abortions for Government employees and their dependents Among the officials who are eligible for this benefit are the members of Congress Beyond that several states including some that have restricted abortion funds for the needy also contribute to employee health insurance plans that pay for abortions The wording of the new Federal restriction on abortion aid is so broad however that it may jeopardize this benefit for 250000 Government workers The Federal Government now pays directly or indirectly all or part of the cost of tens of thousands of elective abortions on Government employees and their dependents Elective abortions are performed as part of the medical care customarily provided for the military and their dependents Taxpayer funds also cover at least partial payments for abortions performed on employees covered by private health insurance plans that are considered basic employee benefits Funds Could Be Cut Off But some Congressmen maintain that ambiguity in the language of the law that awaits President Carters signature could threaten to cut off Federal financing for abortions among 250000 employees of the Departments of Labor and of Health Education and Welfare Those workers and their dependents might be affected by the measure because it was passed as part of the appropriation bill for the two departments This measure covers the salaries of these department workers and Government lawyers are studying the language of the bill to determine whether it prohibits the use of Federal funds as contributions to employee health insurance premiums that pay for abortions Before the bill was passed it was widely understood to concern only payments for abortions performed under Medicaid a Federal health insurance program for lowincome Americans A clear majorityof the Congress did not think that they were doing anything other than dealing with Medicaid said Representative Patricia Schroeder Democrat of Colorado who voted for the bill But because the language is broad said Mrs Schroeder who is a lawyer theres a real question whether that is true Its a matter for the lawyers and its probably an unanswerable question now Studied by HEW Lawyers A spokesman for the Department of Health Education and Welfare confirmed that its lawyers were studying that and other aspects of the law before Secretary Joseph A Califano Jr promulgates regulationslor Medicaid abortions Mr Califano opposes abortions but has vowed to uphold the law Department lawyers have tentatively concluded that the law does not bar abortions for its employees because the health insurance plan is governmentwide and therefore is not included under HEW funds within the meaning of the Medicaid abortion measure the spokesman said It will take at least one month for the regulations to be promulgated and longer if the opinion of the Attorney General is sought for any questions the spokesman said About 260000 Medicaid abortions were performed in the year before an abortion ban took effect last June 20 The new law is expected to pay for about onethird of that number Mrs Schroeder said that other members of Congress had said they intended to press for application of the restrictive Medicaid abortion standards for legislation affecting other Federal employees The Federal Government contributed more than 13 pillion this year to private health insurance plans for 33 million Government employees Of this total 191 million are enrolled in a Blue CrossBlue Shield benefit plan that covers most if not all of usual and customary charges for abortions The Government pays for about 60 percent of the benefit plan The remaining 14 million Federal employees are covered by 78 other health insurance plans and all but 12 pay at least part of the bill for elective abortions An official of the Civil Service Cornmission which administers a trust fund that indirectly subsidizes the health insurance plans for civilian employees said that little statistical information had been collected on claims made by Government employees for abortions A total of 12687 elective abortions were performed on military women and dependents between Sept 1 1975 and Aug 31 1976 The Government estimates the cost for an abortion in a military hospital at 360 The operation is said to cost about half as much if it is performed as an outpatient procedure For Civilians in Military The Government paid 520 million in the fiscal year 1976 to cover nine million civilian employees of the military and their dependents under the Civil Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services In 1975 the Government spent 58 million or about 1 percent of the programs funds for 13090 elective abortions Congressmen are eligible for treatment in military hospitals but they or their insurance plans are billed for such treatment Congressmen as Federal employees are offered a range of private insurance plans most of which cover their wives and daughters for abortions Data on abortions among state employees are sketchy More than half of state employees in Texas are covered by abortionproviding health insurance plans New York taxpayers spent 81 million last year for family insurance plans that allowed abortions for 120900 state workers and their dependents The Albany area Blue CrossBlue Shield reported 350 claims for elective abortions on those policies North Carolina workers who choose the family plan of Blue CrossBlue Shield are covered for elective abortions but those who select the individual or single parent plans are not The state spends 53 million ayear for such coverage
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/13/archives/letters.html,To the Editor Concerning your editorial of Dec 1 Doing His Number Numbers as names could have brighter future than your editorial suggests Using the mathematical descriptions of the numbername much more can be learned about a person than a name alone Consider the following A radical leader could be given an irrational number while a person who likes Lawrence Welktype music would be a perfect square A bore becomes a repeating decimal an undertaker is a terminal decimal But one who is immortal we give nonrepeating nonterroinaldecimal Let the military be integers but let those engaged in the arts be imaginary numbers Congressmen would retain their present designations like NY42R Roman numerals would be reserved for religious leaders the Rev XVII Economists become numbers like 2 of one percent stockbrokers can be named Up 3 If you have an operation you become a fraction but the bionic people have numbers like

programming become convergent series The two political phrties would be the Variables and the Constants Upon death they give you a negative number and cancel you out As for editors of papers like Vol CXXVII No 43779 they could have names like 4 inches by 3 columns or simply thats 30 God would be a division by 0the undefined reaching toward infinity The list goes on THOMAS b24aC KNIESER DERICK MC2 TAYLOR Newburgh NY Dec 4 1977 The writers are math and science teachers at Valley Central High School Montgomery NY To the Editor In your editorial Doing His Number you exhibit due concern for the possibility of numbers being employed instead of names Why then in the name of Numero Uno do you permit me to suffer the gross indignity of being addressed solely by street number on the heading of my monthly bill for delivery of the New York Number 2 865 MARTIN L HALKIN Valley Stream LI Dec 3 1977 Of Justice in South Africa and in the US To the Editor Justice is blind said Mr Dooley also deaf dumb and has a wooden leg In South Africa a black man is found dead in his prison cell allegedly beaten by the police Several months later an inquest is held and the police are exonerated The Times calls the proceedings a whitewash and in Washington the Stale Department denounces the South African Government and excoriates the judge who presided at the inquest In New York a prominent judge is convicted of lying to a grand jury a crime which merits a 10year jai sentence The friendly and obliging trial judge rules that the scales of justice would be in balance if his prevaricating colleague were put on probation Daily we read of defenseless old people being beaten by young thugs then robbed raped and sometimes murdered in the streets or at home If they are apprehended easygoing courts and wily criminal lawyers often cooperate in plea bargaining for light sentences or maybe none at all In Brooklyn an innocent black youth is gunned to death by a white policeman A year later a jury of his peers decides that the policeman is innocent of crime by reason of insanity No doubt this verdict will miraculously restore the officers reason So how do we differentiate between justice in America and that dispensed in the Republic of South Africa Kipling wrote a piece about the Colonels Lady and Judy OGrady He reached a conclusion that one might para phrase in this way When you get to the facts in the case theyre like row of pins for the USA and the R S A are twins in the matter of sins HERBERT B LARNER Montclair NJ Dec 4 1911 To the Editor The Crown of St Stephen has long been in safekeeping in the United States There is no question of its being the property of any other nation than Hungary but Hungary is an occupied country unable to decide its own destiny Doubtless this historic treasure symbolic of an independent Christian state that held the frontiers of the West will be as safe in Budapest as in Fort Knox but what of the implications of its surrender to a government imposed by Soviet bayonets and responsible for the judicial murder of the Prime Minister Imre Nagy and the Defense Minister Paul Mulciter There will be many to interpret the return of the crown as further recognition in the West of the legitimacy of the Soyfet empire in Eastern Europe New demands must be expected for example a claim from Prague to the Czechoslovak gold also held in the United States I urge President Carter who is identified in many minds with the cause of human rights to require reconsideration of so fateful a decision JOHN BIGGSDAVISON Member of Parliament London Nov 28 1977 To the Editor The focus of attention and consequent debate on the new organization of the executive office of the mayor has partially obscured some of the fundamental lessons the prior history of the office has taught us The City Charter changes of the early 1960s created the office of deputy mayorcity administrator at the behest of the goodgovernment groups of the time This introduction of the beginnings of a city manager system failed because strong elected mayors would not countenance such a role for a subordinate The fact is that some prior mayors gave extraordinary authority to mayoral staff members who were not characterized as deputy mayors but who acted as such We should not forget mayoral advisers situated in party positions who were in fact shadow mayors and wielded immense power and authority All attempts at structuring a mayoral office to relate to the needs of administering the citys bureaucracy must adopt as the essential criteria the needs of the elected mayor and his style of governing Mayorelect Koch has said repeatedly that he does not intend to delegate his charter of office to anyone in or out of government By eliminating a first deputy mayor title he has in fact already attracted extraordinarily talented individuals to the other deputy mayor posts he has announced as well as implementing a significant commitment Conceptually Ed Koch is putting into effect one of his most important campaign promises which is to keep his in mailbox open and not delegate the key decisionmaking to others hidden from public view whether they be deputy mayors budget directors or anyone else inside or outside his administration This perspective of mayoral administration certainly deserves a chance to be tried It will of course call for an extraordinarily active and working mayoradministrator Ed Koch certainly seems up to the task It is to be expected that the one casualty of this reorganization Ed astikyan will be brought into the incoming administration in another important capacity His demonstrated capability should not be lost to public service EDWARD A MORRISON New York Dec 7 1977 The writer served as a special assistant to Mayor John Lindsay To the Editor In Deathly Prose Topics Nov 25 you chastise judges who in holding the death penalty not unconstitutional express their personal abhorrence of such punishment Do we not expect judgesespecially those who exercise ultimate authorityto explain their decisions rather than just say constitutional unconstitutional affirmed reversed modified I suggest that particularly in emotionally charged issues on which the public is sharply divided at times with irrational as well as rational political action a conscientious judge is entitledindeed owes the public a dutyto explain if that be the case that the basis of his or her vote is legal judgment in accordance with his or her oath of office despite personal abhorrence Incidentally that has timely application to the abortion issue COPAL MINTZ New York Nov 29 1977 Higher Education What Scholastic Aptitude Tests Do Well To the Editor Its proper to be concerned about such tests as the SAT But Dr Slacks recent OpEd piece suggesting that Scholastic Aptitude Test scores are not needed misses the point The SAT is not a substitute for grades and other information but an independent measure that provides additional useful information Contrary to Dr Slacks conjectures the SAT is not biased It measures abilities needed to pursue a course of study at most colleges and universities To be useful the test must reflect the culture of our schools and society Within that context it is culturefair Its questions are all reviewed and rereviewed by minority and majority reviewers  and edited and pretested before they are used in a test Students who have suffered from social and educational neglect from the effects of prejudice and discrimination are unlikely to do well on the SAT But for these students as for the more advantaged the test is valid in its prediction of future academic success This is not a matter to be settled by debate but by evidence and the data are clear and consistent The SAT measures aptitude for college work It is not designed to measure or define intelligence whatever that may be and it doesnt It measures verbal and mathematical reasoning ability The test presents tasks with words and numbers like those encountered in college When collegelevel work stops requiring these abilities the SAT  if it is neededwill have to measure something else But right now the SAT predicts how well a student is likely to do in college and especially in the first year It does that very well Hundreds of studies relating college grades to test scores school records and other information attest to this In fact this threehour test predicts academic success in college almost as well as four years of school grades and the two combined predict better than either alone For in addition to motivation creativity stamina and host of other traits an ability to work with words and numbers is still essential to higher education and work in many careers Finally Dr Slack asks what would happen if nobody came to the SATs In that case each college could set its own entrance exams shades of 1901 or could rely more on grades and letters of recommendation But this proffered solution is not as simple as it seems Grades are at least as subject to bias and error of measurement as test scores Grade inflation is still a problem in some schools and tests like the SAT provide an independent yardstick For some of the same reasons grades have lost some of their validity and letters of recommendation have lost theirs A test like the SAT insures that students from varied backgrounds and geography are in effect running the same race when applying to the same college SAT test scores continue to add useful information to the college admissions process When they no longer do we will be the first to seek the reasons why ROBERT MOULTHROP Director Information Division Educational Testing Service Princeton N J Nov 25 1977

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/15/archives/letters.html,To the Editor The fact that the new Administration like many of its predecessors has undertaken a study for the purpose of overhauling the Joint Chiefs of Staff JCS comes as no surprise What is astonishing is the attitude about the Chiefs apparently held by the present Administration As noted by Bernard Weinraub news article Nov 11 President Carter and other civilian officials are upset because the Chiefs are concerned with protecting the interests of their separate services This parochialism is said to lead to such practices as horse trading and predictable advice and casts doubt upon the capability of the JCS to provide guidance review contingency plans and resolve differences between commands Such complaints about the Chiefs are meaningless The Chiefs are not the cause of diversity within the Department of Defense they are a reflection of it By law the department must be composed of four separate armed services This inevitably means that there will be differing views on most subjects To argue that these divergent viewpoints should not be resolved by compromise naively assumes that there is one correct approach which the Chiefs would support if it were not for their service bias Similarly to complain that the Chiefs offer predictable advice is akin to being surprised that generals act like generals The proposed solution is even more dismaying Service parochialism will be combated by reducing the size of the Joint Staff the one military staff dedicated to developing nonservice military positions If this effort is successful the Chiefs will be forced to rely more heavily on their own service staffs whose main concern must be the protection of their own service interests The Chiefs are in a difficult position Whatever they do someone will be displeased The JCS has been consciously designed to reflect a number of competing values for example urnfication and diversity within the military the efficiency and potential excesses of a general staff and executive and legislative control of the military Despite the tension caused by these competing pressures the JCS has served the nation reasonably well The real problem for this Administration is that the Chiefs are not yes men They are no doubt opposed to Carters cutbacks in defense spending and his proposed SALT II agreements From the Administrations viewpoint this is not the most economical or best advice The Administrations solution should lie not in emasculating the JCS but rather in in convincing the Congress and the American people that its positions are the right ones LAWRENCE J Kors Portsmouth RI Dec 6 1977 To Attract Investors To the Editor On the Nov 30 OpEd Page James W Davant bemoans the future of the

KAHN New York Dec 1 1977 Bilingual Aims To the Editor Mr McCormicks Dec 5 letter on bilingual education misses the point of such education which is to increase the efficiency and speed with which the nonspeaker of English learns English This can be done best by contrasting the native language of the learner with the new language he is learning Bilingual means dealing with two languages The aims of bilingual education are intensive study of English as a second language and retention and strengthening of the learners first language and its culture To treat every student in an American classroom as though he were a native speaker of English is an educational crime DONALD D WALSH Madison Conn Dec 5 1977 Of Abortion and the Hippocratic Oath To the Editor In a Nov 25 editorial Topics item The Times quotes the Hippocratic oath and laments departure from it in the case of the suffering Mr Biko in South Africa Quite properly The Times reminisces on its callous abandonment by Nazi doctors experimenting on Jews and Soviet psychiatrists diagnosing political dissent as mental illness requiring confinement The Times rightly characterizes abandonment of the Hippocratic principle as betrayal Readers will also recall that across 2400 years of Western civilization ethical physicians forswore laisseztaire abortion Indeed it required considerable judicial legerdemain on the part of seven Justices in Roe v Wade to free a noble profession from constraints against abortion on request The previously unethical was declared legal and correct The Court acknowledged in Roc v Wade that the oath represents the apex of strict ethical concepts in medicine    and its influence endures to this day Blackmun then held as sat isfactory and acceptable the jett16ning of millennia of abortion prohibition a basic part of the oath in holding with Edelstein that the oaths ancient and honorable ethic was a Pythagorean manifesto and not the expression of an absolute standard of medical conduct

believe that the Beaumont is a fine theater and would probably be even better with a proscenium arch It can be a cultural resource for the New York area And yet I have misgivings about tax subsidy to keep it goingwhen the stagehands earn about 600 week [base pay for weeks worked] and are given preference for lowcost luxury housing west of Eighth Avenue as are ushers tiernaps management should invite suggestions from the audience Ilere are mine Shutter the theater in summer months to avoid costly airconditioning and operate short weeks in February to reduce heating costs And think the unthinkable Consider hiring nextdoor Fordham Law and Juilliard students for those unskilled jobs   CHARLES E PERKINS Rutherford NJ Dec 7 1977 Black African Independence The Cuban Threat To the Editor Your Nov 23 editorial minimizing the significance of armed Cuban intervention in Africa does a grave disservice to the cause of African independence As you indicated in a partial retraction the following day some African countries have expressed their alarm over the extensive presence of Cuban military forces on the continent But even in your retraction you distort the issue by again minimizing the extent of the concern in Africa Of the countries in Africa ruled by nonwhite governments you mention only Egypt the Sudan and Somalia as being alarmed over the Cuban presence leaving the impression that the leaders of no other countries have spoken out on the issue But surely you are aware that the concern is far more pervasive since has reported it For example on Jan 29 1976 in news article reporting on the assumption of emergency powers by Zambian President Kenneth D Kaunda you quoted Kaunda as warning of a plundering tiger with its deadly cubs now coming in through the back door clear reference as you indicated to the Soviet and Cuban intervention in the Angolan civil war Last April 19 you quoted a spokesman of the Zaire Government charging that the invasion of Shaba province of Zaire was masterminded by the SovietCuban alliance using Angola as its puppet Among the other African leaders who have strongly expressed their concern over Cuban and Soviet intervention in Africa are President Leopold Senghor of Senegal President Omar Bongo of Gabon also the current President of the Organization of African Unity President Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya President HouphouetBoigny of the Ivory Coast and Moroccos King Hassan Moreover at the meeting of the OAU held in Libreville in July resolution introduced by Senegal was adopted inviting all member states of the OAU not to permit the use of their territory for foreign military bases The London Economist among other publications noted that the resolution was clearly aimed at the Russians and the Cubans Your own news report on the OAU meeting at Libreville quoted an Egyptian delegate as saying The only issue hat really matters here is that of Soviet interference in Africa Many African leaders are deeply disturbed by the silence among liberals in the West over the intervention of Cuban troops President HouphouetBoigny said recently that in less than two years they have killed thousands of Angolansour African brothers murdered in cold blood More victims fell in this short period than in the 15 years of guerrilla war against Portuguese colonialism Yet the West rarely notes this gruesome reality Regretfully I must observe that you are guilty of more than silence on this matter for you have gone a step further by attacking those who have spoken out Talking tough about Cubans in Africa you write is a cheap way to score political points It appears though that it is you who are trying to score political points against domestic opponents even if you must distort the facts to do so By casually dismissing the Cuban threat to African independence even to the extent of drawing striking parallels between the Cuban military intervention and Israels technical assistance program and by ignoring the urgent warnings of African leaders have demon grated a shocking disregard for the wellbeing and political integrity of the peoples of Africa I welcome the Concern you have expressed over the plight of blacks in the whiteruled countries of southern Africa But the sincerity of your concern for black Africa is made suspect in light of your application of a different standard to other situations where African independence is threatened BAYARD BUSTIN President A Philip Randolph Institute New York Nov 29 1977  From the Editor Like Mr Rustin we deplore the presence of so many Cubans in Angola We do not agree however that even there they threaten the independence of blackruled African states To repeat Cubans are present only at  the invitation of duly constituted African governments whose independence they support We do not have to approve of the politics of some of those governments to contend that we have seen no persuasive evidence that they or their Cuban advisers threaten the independence of other states The parallels with Israeli efforts that wediscerned referred not to the Cuban military intervention in Angola but to Cuban aid missions to 14 other African countries Israels technical aid programs in the 1960s also included military training Ugandas President Amin and Zaires Mobutu among many Africans sport Israeli para
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/16/archives/letters.html,To the Editor Dr Anne R Somers in her letter of Dec 5 has rendered an important service in clarifying some issues before the Congress in its debate and current resolution on the use of Medicaid funds for abortion These issues are also likely to arise in future debates on national health insurance The issue is how to define words such as health and disease I believe the public thinks of diseases as conditions which can kill cripple or incapacitate physically think a large part of the public also believes that the word health means the absence of disease as defined above However we must realize that others define health differently The World Health Organization defines health as not the mere absence of disease but a presence of total physical mental and social wellbeing Applied to the subject of abortion these definitions yield different results Are abortions to be performed only to prevent death crippling or incapacita tion of women physically Or are abortions to be performed for the social wellbeing of women Dr Somers has raised the issue of equity in health care and I think that is an important question to raise What is unresolved is whether we mean equity in the use of medical techniques to avert death crippling and physical incapacitation or whether we mean the use of medical techniques to foster social wellbeing think Medicaid was established to foster the former and not the latter but perhaps I am wrong That is why like so many others am left with simple questiOn How do you equate the life of an unborn infant with the social wellbeing of a mother a father or a family If it is thought that the social wellbeing of the mother outweighs the rights of fetuses with congenital abnormalities we do well to remember that more than 99 percent of abortions are done on normal fetuses The new science of fetology moreover is increasingly able to improve the physical health of all intrauterine patients For the sake of all infants we would be well advised to increase our investments in fetal research The question still remains for the 99 percent who are normal What is the equity between the right of these fetuses to life vs the social wellbeing of the mother It is clearly unfair to blame only the Congress for the recent impasse on Medicaid funding of abortions The question is deeper than one of politics The question is What price or what maternal social wellbeing is equivalent in value to a fetal life or to the life of a mentally or physically impaired infant At the heart of the question is the issue of how to define words such as health and disease EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER Washington Dec 9 1977 The writer is executive vice president of the Joseph P Kennedy Jr Foundation Kennedy Assassination An Industrys Promise To the Editor Current frontpage stories make apparent that the Kennedy Assassination Industry is living up to expectations It is said that the Lincoln Assassination Industry remained viable for 50 years With the advance in todays communications and publicity techniques over those of a century ago the KAI should exceed this span The KAI like the pornography industry will be virtually unaffected by our dwindling supplies of cheap energy This advantage plus its pre dictable longevity should make it one of the most promising fields for the young to enter While huge sums of money will be made the real opportunities lie however with the politicians It is not unrealistic to envision that some time in the next several decades some political hack will make it all the way to the White House on the Kennedy assassination issue All that is needed is another round of fear such as we had in the McCarthy era H D FAIRLIE Montclair NJ Dec 8 1977 Of Epilepsy Violence and a Myth To the Editor On Nov 30 New York City Police Officer Robert H Torsney was acquitted in the shooting death of 15yearold and the victims of epilepsy once again were unfairly stigmatized Officer Torsney was believed to have acted automatically while under the thrall of a rather unusual epileptic psychomotor seizure This 32yearold policeman had no previous history of epileptic seizures The myth of psychomotor or temporal lobe epilepsy as a wellspring of violent acts is still perpetuated in the courtroom because of ignorance of the medical literature on the relationship of violence to epilepsy Recent studies have shown that automatic behavior is a rare explanation for crimes of epileptic patients Epileptic violence says F E Dreifuss in Volume II of Advances in Neurology is usually senseless relatively unprovoked unpremeditated and is nearly always associated with amnesia on the rare occasions that it takes place Contrast this to Officer Torsneys elaborate interaction with the victim which included listening to him then pulling his gun aim ing and firing the fatal shot This Is a rather sophisticated sequence of actions to be performed by a man in psychomotor fugue In addition rather than suffering from true amnesia Officer Torsney apparently hallucinated that the victim reached for a gun This personal threatening vision suggests psychosis more than seizures Psychomotor epilepsy is a specific class of the epilepsies which is defined by wellknown clinical and electroencephalographic criteria There is no mention of abnormal brain waves in Officer Torsneys medical history in the Dec 1 account of the trial Psychomotor epilepsy does not originate from an unhappy childhood or stressful situations I think that it is vital that experts in treating and diagnosing epilepsy be consulted in cases such as Officer Torsneys when a question arises as to whether a seizure bears some relationship to an act of violence This woulu be an act of fairness both to the victims of these tragic occurrences and to the people who suffer from epilepsy FREDERICK E LEPORE MD Department of Neurology University of Virginia Charlottesville Va Dec 1 1977 The Forgotten Victim To the Editor Granted that everyone loves honeymooners and the city and some of its merchants wanted to repay the young Vermont couple whose car was stolen and used for devastation regardless of the subsequent turn of events But meanwhile another victim lies dead and forgotten and may be buried as a pauper Perhaps there isnt enough public relations value in providing an old man with a decent burial but somehow I feel that would do more to prove this city is not cold and heartless than all the dinners and Broadway shows we could give vis itors CAROLE MARTIN New York Dec 11 1977 15000 VIP To the Editor Regarding your Dec 7 editorial Managing a Raise for City Managers a correction or clarification appears to be in order The present chairman of the New York City Transit Authority who is first and foremost the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority earns only up to 15000 a year at his own request As I recall reading in The Times he did not want to receive any amount greater than the other MTA board members I assume that whoever is chairman of the MTA will never be viewed as a Santa Clans but such consideration of public funds on the part of Harold Fisher to the tune of at least 65000 does merit a comparison to jolly old Santa and our thanks HUGH A DUNNE New York Dec 7 1977 UN The PLOs New Propaganda Instrument To the Editor The UN General Assembly resolution of Dec 2 to create a special unit within the Secretariat that would propagandize the views of the socalled Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People was an act of irresponsibility and mischievousness The committee threequarters of whose members have no relations with the state of Israel issues flagrantly tendentious and biased reporti which are almost wholly inspired by the terrorist Palestine Liberation Organization Since the PLOs National Covenant declares the establishment of Israel null and void Article 19 and announces the intention to liquidate the Zionist presence Article 22 it can be expected that the spezial unit will find it difficult to avoid promoting views antithetical to the UN Charter itself Indeed it is apparent that the new organ will become a major propaganda instrument for the PLO thereby undermining the professed peacekeeping aim of the international organization and seriously compromising the professional function of the UN Secretariat The latter for example is obligated under the resolution to produce an 80000 film trumpeting the Palestinian cause The special unit will cost almost onehalf million dollars which given the current UN deficit of nearly 100 million constitutes a financial scandal of not insignificant proportions In addition the Palestine committees activities cost more than 300000 These swollen figures should attract the attention of the US public whose taxes pay for onequarter of the regular UN budget Indeed the voting pattern revealed in this General ASsembly decision highlights ati extraordinary paradox The 95 countries which voted for the resolution together contribute approximately 25 percent of the regular UN budget the 20 countries which opposed it pay more than twice that amount Such taxation without representation for a program subversive of the UN Charter defines an irresponsibility that must not go unnoticed DAVID M BLUMBERG President Bnai Brith Washington Dec S 1977 Perilous Exports To the Editor A recent editorial in The Times drew attention to the problem of Guatemalan cotton pickers Profithungry cotton growers the editorial points out are using pesticides in excessive and destructive amounts leading to illness and death among the farm workers The Times calls upon European and Japanese consumers who buy the cotton to put pressure on the Guatemalan growers for reform I only wish to point out that those pesticidesmany of them banned from use in our own country because they cause cancerare produced by US chemical companies for export to the third world It is not only Guatemalan cotton growers who are profithungry Certainly it is the responsibility of this country to regulate the export of dangerous chemicals CHRIS JENKINS Berkeley Calif Dec 2 1977 Oil vs the Dollar To the Editor The joint campaign by govermbent and industry to blame the dollars problem on the Japanese is a combination of selfdelusion and hypocrisy The fact of the matter is that if you except oil imports we have a huge balanceoftrade surplus with the rest of the world Consequently it is unfair and erroneous to claim that we are being swamped by lowcost foreign competition although it is true that real dumping may at times hurt particular industries The source of our trouble is unique and singular a terrible irresponsible waste of power and fuel leading to excessive oil imports No increase in alternative power sources no bullying of foreign friends who are more diligent in their efforts to economize no statement by Secretary Blumenthal no intervention by central banks or international funds will make any difference All is persiflage an unwillingess to face this fact either we cut oil imports drastically or we bring the whole world tumbling down on our heads EDWARD G SHUFRO New York Dec 9 1977
Leaders Call Record of Congress Moderate,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/18/archives/leaders-call-record-of-congress-moderate-congress-record-called.html,WASHINGTON Dec 17Congressional leaders and political scholars are generally agreed that the first session of the 95th Congress which ended Thursday was only moderately productive The major reasons they cited were a lack of strong Presidential leadership the complexity of many issues before Congress the lack of a national consensus and an increased Congressional skepticism over the ability of the Government to improve many national situations There was general agreement on both Capitol Hill and in the White House that the erosion of Presidential power and the ascension of Congress begun in the last dark year of Richard M Nixons Presidency has continued although Democrats now control both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue This continued trend toward a restoration of a balance between Congress and the Presidency was hailed as desirable by politicians as diverse as Hamilton Jordan the Presidents political aide and Senator Jacob K Javits RepublicanLiberal of New York OneParty Situation No Guarantee Forceful new Congressional leadership an inexperienced President the enhancement of Congressional selfreliance and selfassertion that was part of the Nixon legacy and an influx of assertive younger Congressmen with broader

Curbs on Medicaid Abortions Posing Perils and Problems for the Poor,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/19/archives/curbs-on-medicaid-abortions-posing-perils-and-problems-for-the-poor.html,ENGLEWOOD NJLaura Green is a large woman tall and bigboned At 18 weeks into her pregnancy she was downright bulky She shifted in the narrow chair searching for a comfortable spot Then she leaned back settled in and began to tell about being pregnant and on welfare and wanting an abortion in New Jersey a state where almost all Medicaid funds for abortion have been cut off Its like frightening she said when you actually sit down and look at a coathanger and think Do I actually have to mutilate myself  She was finally having an abortionshe had just made the appointment and was sitting in a little room in the offices of Metropolitan Medical Associates the biggest provider of abortions in New Jersey and a place decorated with bright colors and warm wood paneling because as the director of patient services Enid Bondy puts it Its frightening enough anyway But since Miss Green was 18 weeks pregnant the procedure would be much more difficult and unpleasant than the one she would have had she had found an abortion in her first three months of pregnancy She had to borrow 250 to pay for it at a time when her total income each month is her 310 welfare check She had spent nearly two months of fear anguish and frustration in seeking the abortion Not an Unusual Situation Her experiences are typical of those of many women since the cutoff of Medicaid financing  especially the search for an abortion she could afford The delay of well past the first three months is also typical so too her boyfriends view that she should keep the child And she herself is typical of many of the women who have been affected by the Medicaid situationshe is black unmarried and the mother of small children in her case a 1yearold girl and a 2yearold boy Laura Greennot her real namegot a standard form letter from the welfare authorities last summer when the rules were tightened saying that Medicaid would no longer pay for an abortion unless it was necessary to save the life of the mother Under a bill signed into law by President Carter on Dec 9 Medicaid assistance might be provided where womans health is endangered by her pregnancy When she began to suspect she might be pregnant Miss Green thought she should have an abortion She had been going parttime to Jersey Cit State College so she could get a degree and find JD job and get off welfare and she had only six credits to go Having another baby now would mean delaying once again the day she could graduate She told her suspicions to her boyfriend who is unemployed except for an occasional odd job and who lives with her and her two children in her 198amonth apartment in Jersey City She also told him that if she was in fact pregnant she thought she should have an abortion He told me Ill Oreat your legs she said He was laughing but he meant it Hes one of those macho men She decided to go ahead anyway I just took it on myself to do that because when hes gone the child will still be there Because another child will set me back another two years as far as career getting off welfare Miss Green went to her gynecologist who confirmed the pregnancy She told him she was thinking of having an abortion The doctor said Come back to me when everythings over and Ill give you a checkup She did not however suggest to Miss Green where to find an abortion A friend referred her to another doctor who agreed to do the abortion but told her that it would have to be done within the next few days because it was so late in the pregnancy He also said that Miss Green would have to pay the full fee about 175 in advance She did not have the money so as she puts it that was that Then a friend referred her to a woman who supposedly knew how to get free abortions The woman told Miss Green she knew a doctor in Jersey City who did abortions No money was required she said but you might have to do some odd jobs Wallet and Food Stamps Stolen Miss Green went to the doctor It turned out that his technique was to fill in a Medicaid reimbursement form saying he had provided some other type of service that Medicaid did cover That was fine with Miss Green But then the doctor announced his real fee Either Laura or a friend would have to have sex with him Miss Green left and as she tells it she pretty much gave up She figured she could not get a bank loan because she was on welfare Her financial situation was even worse than usualher wallet was stolen one day after that in the grocery store her food stamps were stolen Weeks went by She finally managed to arrange an abortion almost by chance Thanksgiving week she went to visit her parents and brother in Hackensack near here She said she decided to give it one last chance She picked up a local tele phone directory looked up the word abortion found a number and called it It turned out to be the number of Metropolitan Medical Associates the medical group started by Dr Robert M Livingston who was a leader in the effort to have abortion legalized in New Jersey It is one of the very few places in the state that does middleofpregnancy abortions Such abortions involve the injection of a saline solution to induce miscarriage It normally costs 400 but for women who rely on Medicaid for their health services the fee is 250 Miss Green asked her brother for help he was her last resort she saysand he agreed to lend her the money She has not told her boyfriend and does not plan to Asked what he would think she replied As far as hes concerned Ill just have had a miscarriage She paused and shook her head I dont know what hell think she said  but the

CONGRESS IS BALKING ON ELECTION REVISION,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/19/archives/congress-is-balking-on-election-revision-administration-losing.html,WASHINGTON Dec 18The Carter Administration still hopes to win Congreessional approval of some of the proposed election law revisions that it announced with such fanfare last March but the most ambitious and controversial Proposals appear to be dead Election Day registration and direct election of the President two of the more sensitive issues seem to be doomed as a result of Republican opposition and Democratic indifference in the session concluded last week Politically the 1977 session was a minefield filled with such problematic nowin issues as abortion and the huge Social Security tax increase The effect in the opinion of Congressional leaders was to dampen the appetite of both Democrats and Republicans for any sweeping changes in the electoral laws In addition something akin o backlash developed in Congress his year after the new restrictions on campaign financing and public disclosure went into effect in March A lot of members feel were about to reform ourselves out of business said Representative Frank Thompson Jr Democrat of New Jersey chairman of the House Administration Committee Theyre still trying to adjust to all the reporting and disclosure requirements that followed Watergate A senior White House aide echoed this view The further we get from Watergate he said the less enthusiasm there is for reform in either party A whole new body of Federal election law passed as a result of the Watergate disclosures includes spending limits and public financing of Presidential campaigns limits on individual union and corporate contributions and the creation of the Federal Election Commission to enforce the new rules The 1976 Presidential campaign was the first fullscale test of the new system Most politicians felt that it functioned well but shortly after the election further refinements were called for Just two months after taking office President Carter proposed a package of revisions that Administration officials felt would complete the process It included public financing of Congressional elections simplified registration procedures dissolution of the Electoral College and modification of the Hatch Act which prohibits political activity by Federal employees Initial Reaction Positive The initial reaction of Republican Senate and House leaders was positive but this was reversed within two weeks after virulent opposition developed within the right wing of the party Conservative organizations began intensive directmail campaigns to combat the public financing and simplified registration procedures both of which they were convinced would help elect more Democrats There were objections to the provisions even among Democrats however Bigcity congressmen were unhappy about the proposed Election Day registration which would tend to reduce the power of the city political machines while representatives from all over the country were nervous about the effect of public financing Nobody wants to tamper with the status quo Mr Thompson said They fear the unknown particularly as far as financing is concerned Its the system under which they were elected they understand it and feel secure with it This attitude cuts across party lines Mr Thompson said and is endemic to incumbent politicians In 1976 more than 95 percent of the incumbents who sought reelection under the existing system won At the White House officials seem chastened by the battering that the Administrations package has received but they insist that they have not given up Unexpected Resistance Were not finished by any means said Richard Moe staff director for Vice President Mondale who

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/24/archives/letters-social-security-the-bad-bargain-doctors-and-the-poor-the.html,The bill to rescue Social Security accomplishes its goal of correcting the past fiscal irresponsibility of Congress by placing an inflationary and onerous burden on both business and worker alike The present and future generations of workers will be especially burdened since they will in effect be paying for the overgenerous benefits provided in the past without hope of ever receiving an equitable return on the high contributions required by the present act To the Editor To illustrate an individual contributing 1500 per year to an individual retirement account beginning at age 30 would accumulate 290641 by age 65 This would yield interest of over 20000 per year if invested in Government bonds In addition the principal would remain intact and be included in ones estate at death Certainly this example points out the bad bargain provided by Social Security Furthermore the refusal of Congress to employ general tax revenues because it wanted to preserve the insurance aspect of Social Security is exposed as a falsehood by President Carters promise to reduce income taxes in order to counteract the damage to our economy from the higher Social Security taxes In addition raising the taxable base in steps to 42600 is in effect admitting defeat of our hope to ever control inflation Failure to include the millions of Federal state and city employees not voluntarily covered by Social Security continues the favored status for a group which includes the Congress itself With the generous early retirement benefits provided many in this group subsequently enter private employment and gain a Social Security check with the minimum contribution This doubledipping and the liberal granting of taxfree disability pensions are abuses which have not been addressed by the Congress Since the major provisions of the new legislation are to take effect gradually there is time for the Congress to reconsider this legislation I would suggest that new legislation be enacted to gradually phase out the present Social Security system with help from general tax revenues substituting instead the concept of the individual retirement account modified to provide both mandatory and voluntary contributions This would enable people to plan retirement to suit their individual needs I can foresee eventual integration of private pension plans into such a system thus eliminating the problems such as mismanagement fraud and portability associated with the plans The Congress after long delay has acted in haste and prescribed overdoses of the wrong remedy This complex subject certainly deserves a more thorough and open discussion and debate so that we may arrive at a truly equitable and perhaps permanent solu tion Kathe Kollwltz Doctors and the Poor To the Editor I read with interest the Dec 14 news report which rediscovered that doctors like other middleclass people stay out of poverty areas Any attempt to deal with this by bureaucratic solutions will result in a situation which will make present Medicaid difficulties seem trivial The answer lies not in bringing doctors into poverty areas but in bringing the poor into the middle class A multifaceted approach including health services is needed to do this Most important however are jobs family planning services including abortion and available but not intrusive guidance akin to mental health services NORMAN SHER MD Brooklyn Dec 14 1977 To the Editor The Times of Dec 15 featured a heartrending tract complete with woeful pictures headed No Doctor Hears Cries of the Ailing in South Bronx When one is sent to ask why tell himher that the nice old ethnic doctors who served such communities have been killed or maimed Tell him her that the young minority doctors have elevated themselves to Park Avenue Westchester etc KARL E SANDBANK MD Pleasant Valley NY Dec 15 1977 The Hunters Task To the Editor Rather than characterizing the hunter mentality a lust for killing reflects a depravity which concerns us all game warden hunter or no The old fellow described in the Nov 22 game warden article and the Rosenblooms Nov 30 letter was not a hunter but a poachera lawbreaker by persuasion and of long practice Lieutenant Cailey was no more a hunter than the diplomats responsible for his presence in Southeast Asia I deny kinship with either or any of them Moonlight evokes in me feelings of beauty mystery and wonder Yet I am a hunter and I write this very few days after the regretfully sanguineous conversion of art eighth deer in 24 years of hunting to a freezer full of prime venison Not a task which I undertake with great relish but the satisfactory conclusion to a successful experience Nor do I regard as unsuccessful or unsatisfactory the 16 years in which I did not score I fully respect the rights of landowners urban dwellers and those who may not wish to hunt or even own firearms Why then am I feared scorned and abused rather than respected in return PHILIP P KING Seneca Falls NY Dec 10 1977 Why Horses Buck To the Editor The picture of the bucking bronco illustrating your Dec 5 news article on team rodeo clearly shows one of the reasons why the horse is bucking A bucking strap has been cinched tight across its genitals and tender intestinal area Chances are it has also received the customary prod up its rectum with an electric cattle prod Rodeo horses buck because they are terrified and in extreme pain When the bucking strap is loosened they stop fighting the pain and become ordinary horses again Bulldogged steers and calves suffer sprained necks and internal injuries from being slammed to the ground from a full gallop The effects must be even worse in team rodeo when the back legs are lassoed at the same time the neck is twisted As more people begin to understand the cruelties inherent in rodeo more cities are choosing other events for mass entertainment St Petersburg Fla has declared them illegal Perhaps the reason the Denver Coliseum has not been filled to capacity is that fewer people are buying tickets as word of the cruelty is getting around even in cowboy country BINA ROBINSON Swain N Y Dec 6 1977 How to Ease the Citys Pension Load To the Editor Despite the corrective measures taken by city and state New York is again headed for financial trouble and is again looking to a not very sympathetic Washington It is interesting to noce however that even during the administration of John Lindsay The Times was warning that the colossal pension load fostered on the city by Mr Lindsay and others could not be met by the city in the future Fortunately by means of a temporary receivership this pension load can be written down to a sensible figure and the work of reshaping the new city can begin Unfortunately however there is an ancient fear of the word receivership such as prevailed at about the time of Woodrow Wilson and no doubt long before that in the history of the finances of the country Speaking of this fear Senator Carter Glass of Virginia the distinguished framer of the Federal Reserve Act with valuable assistance from Russell Leffingwell of Morgans gave this explanation in effect When a railroad goes into receivership this does not mean that the railroad disappears but merely that it no longer has to pay a president 20000 sic a year Therefore New York City can go ahead with renewed vigor after rewriting its ridiculous pensions and very possibly some salaries along with them Are we big enough to do it or will we waste more years talking of the Big Apple rather than demonstrating that we are worthy of such a term DUDLEY H SMITH Brooklyn Dec 16 1977 Westway or Improved Mass Transit For Whose Benefit To the Editor I feel compelled to respond to the  Dec 6 letter of Harold C Meyers president of the Automobile Club of New York I am quite sure that it is relatively simple for Mr Meyers a Westchester County resident to fully sympathize with the concerns expressed by those opposed to Westway and yet support a proposal that would benefit only the land moguls and their political entourage who inevitably gain from such a speculative financial coup as well as a few nonresidents of our beleaguered city One major case of the current exodus from New York City is the poor and everdeteriorating condition of our masstransit system With this departure go jobs industry taxes and talent at probably incalculable levels The additional cost of maintenance of a rundown transit system is overwhelming and the longer we wait to revitalize the system the more expensive and dangerously unsuitable it will become There also are numerous elements that can be tagged as costs to Westway which dont seem to be discussed such as work and safety maintenance and crime prevention and production losses to the surrounding areas during the estimated 10 years of construction as well as the added traffic problems for a city that is already being strangled by excessive exhaust fumes and traffic jams A recent study has shown that there would actually be more jobs Provided if the task of renovating the transit system our citys arteries were undertaken It would also induce return to our city with modern transportation as a focal point Planting this pestway In our neighborhoods would with traffic pollution and unneeded extra housing be the beginning of the end for some of the neighborhoods that have bravely survived many of the modern urban problems An improved masstransit system would benefit a large majority of the people who live and work in New York City A superhighway would inevitably service transients en route to their secure suburban communities It is about time that the people who live here were considered above the Patronizing nonresidents RON BOUCHER New York Dec 7 1977 Greenwich Villages Gain To the Editor Jon C Stouts Nov 14 letter expresses sharp concern as to the effect of land created by the Westway on the character of Greenwich Village We agree that Greenwich Village has a unique character which must be preserved All studies done for the West Side Highway project have concluded this and the Westway plan responds to this goal To our knowledge there has not been a proposal by anyone associated with the project for the construction of highrise housing along the West Village waterfront The New York City Planning Commission in its report Land Use and the West Side Highway has proposed that housing in the land created in this area be of the same height and density as exists in Greenwich Village today Rather than damaging Greenwich Village Westway will actually assist it in achieving its longstanding goal of waterfront recreational facilities It will restore and establish visual contact with the river through the West Village and create over 34 acres of new park land Mr Stout states that It is a time to consult the citizens on Westway The fact is that there probably has never been a project with more community liaison activity connected with it than Westway State and Westway officials have actively sought community input since 1972 they seek it now and will continue to do so JOHN LAUFER Asst Commissioner New York State Department of Transportation New York Dec 9 1977 Letter On Israels South African Trade A `Minuscule Economic Relationship To the Editor On Dec 14 the United Nations adopted a resolution censuring Israel for its economic relations with South Africa As the Times editorial of that day pointed out it marked yet another example of the hypocrisy that has served to discredit the UN The facts about South Africas trade with the rest of the world show that many of the nations voting to censure Israel have much more extensive financial dealings with South Africa than Israel does  Of South Africas 145 billion exportImport trade 15 billion was conducted with black Africa Only 50 millionless than twofifths of 1 percentInvolved trade with Israel  Of 19 billion of foreign capital invested in South Africa only 0005 of 1 percent came from Israel The rest of Africa invested more than 400 million in South Africa nearly 500 times the Israeli figure  It has been suggested that these high trade figures between South Africa and the rest of Africa are phenomena of the past when other African nations were under imperial control However a comparison of the 1975 data with available 1976 data reveals that the economic ties between South Africa and black Africa are growing  The following countries all of which voted to censure Israel have formal trading relationships with South Africa Angola Botswana Chad Congo Gabon Ghana Lesotho Malagasy Mauritius Mozambique Nigeria Senegal and Zambia  The Soviet Union a leading sponsor of the antiIsrael resolution supplies more than half of South Africas imports of arms for private sale If there was ever a case of the pot calling the kettle black this is it Israels economic relationship with South Africa is minuscule in comparison with the economic relationships between South Africa and the black African nations the oilrich Middle Eastern nations and the Sovietbloc countries JAMES H SCHEUER Member of Congress 11th Dist NY Washington DC Dec 20 1977
About New York,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/24/archives/about-new-york-an-orphanage-christmas-story.html,At its simplest Christmas is about a new baby So this is the season when the oldline orphanages get spuroftheseason calls from people who want to feel good for a while and offer to take a child in for the holiday But life hasnt been that Dickensian for decades There are no children available at the orphanage and even the callers who are not distracted by seasonal bathosthe serious callers wanting to adopt and raise a babyare told they may have to wait a few years at best and settle for someone other than the tiny pink ideal This is the case at Angel Guardian a Brooklyn orphanage that was started 80 years ago There have been the seasonal calls this week but there are no children to send out Where are the children The orphanage is in charge of about 1200 children and they are out in foster homestemporary domestic settings usually subsidized by government welfare and run by married couples who stop short of adoption and sometimes have to rotate the children on to other foster families These children have wound up in the Angel Guardian homes hardtoplace category a category that intensifies with age until a 12yearold comes to know well that he or she is not likely to be adopted ever by permanent parents With the passage of the abortion law six years ago and the rise of the singleparent movement Angel Guardians supply of newborns has plummeted to the point where the home handles perhaps 10 infants a year Nevertheless scores of adoptionminded couples who turn to the home still talk of getting a weekold infant So the real art at Angel Guardian is in talking these couples on the longshot waiting list into meeting some of the older hardtoplace children  Five years ago Elizabeth and Jack Skolnick childless through seven years of marriage knew exactly what they wanted We wanted an infant straight from the hospital the prime candidate Mrs Skolnick said Gradually as they waited with noword or promise from the home they eased their standards They would take either a boy or a girl up to 3 years old they told interviewers from the home And then when the question of defects finally came up they decided they would consider a child with correctible defects They first saw the 3yearold boy suggested by the home in a photograph Then they met him at the home he seemed friendly and they took him for a walk in the neighborhood and bought him a cookie at the bakery He didnt talk but he seemed outgoing and responded to affection Mrs Skolnick recalls The couple checked out the boys problems He did not speak and specialists pronounced him deaf He had just had surgery that left him with full vision in only one eye His coordination was lagging He needed arch supports He was not toilettrained The boy was somewhat removed from the tiny pink ideal The Skolnicks liked hint and agreed to adoption They took him home to Shirley LI Angel Guardians children come mainly from the city but about half of the adoptive parents are in Nassau and Suffolk Counties They called him Shanley and Mrs Skolnick quit her job to raise him  They had been warned not to expect that Shanley would go to a regular school and the specialists at a local hospital concurred that the unspeaking boy was deaf They recommended a hearing aid This was a crucial moment because Mrs Skolnick thought she noticed the boy responding to her call at home and she suspected his problem was related to emotional complications of his early life She talked this over with her family doctor decided against a hearing aid and personally handled a tutoring system based on a reward method Shanley could hear and Mrs Skolnick proved it to the hospital Now after five years with the Skolnicks he speaks quite normally and he goes to the local public school where his marks are fine The whole experience could have gone either way Agnes Nevin and the other social workers at the home make no promises about the hardtoplace children Shanley had some of the typical problems but not all Other children are hyperactive Some starkly resist affection Others of course are ostracized weirdly because of skin color and other deviations from the imagined norm of the babycravers As they age they slip further into the fringe of the child market The tiny pink ideal is for Christmas carols Mrs Skolnick talks very prayerfully about life but she also reveals an interesting pragmatic side from the experience of deciding to be Shanleys mother She appreciates the fact now that she knew the one she was receiving to mother and did not have to live through discovery of some of his problems from infancy the usual painful way  The Skolnicks worked so hard and helped Shanley blossom so brightly that when they got back on Angel Guardians adoption list for the second time they were rewarded quickly with a daughter This one came a year ago and she was fresh from birth and in perfect health They called her Holly The adoption is not yet complete and there was a terrible moment for the Skolnicks when the natural mother pondering her future sent a special request back through Angel Guardian for a picture of Holly The woman eventually signed the surrender papers and the adoption should be final soon on the baby who comes very close to the tiny pink ideal
Abortion Cutoff Causing Hardship For Poor Women Around Country,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/25/archives/abortion-cutoff-causing-hardship-for-poor-women-around-country.html,HOUSTONThe war over public financing for abortions has reached a sort of holiday truce but both sides will start firing aaain early next year Most of the recent victories have been scored by opponents of abortion and as a result poor women across the country say they are suffering severe hardships when they become pregnant unintentionally Clinics and public hospitals are providing reducedrate abortions for some women but many others are forced to beg or borrow the price of the operation which can run to 500 or more Some of them are seeking illegal abortions while others are simply resigned to keeping their unwanted children Sheila Pierce director of the Reproductive Services abortion clinic here said that new regulations have changed many womens lives The fight over financing started last year when Congress voted to cut off all Federal funds for abortions under  Medicaid and other programs unless the life of the woman was in danger This law known as the Hyde amendment was temporarily delayed by a Federal judge in Brooklyn but went into effect in August A Compromise Reached In its recent session Congress wrestled again with the problem which one analyst called the most divisive in living memory Earlier this month a compromise was reached that provides for Federal payment in certain cases of rape or incest or in which the womans health is severely threatened Many of the 300000 women who sought publicly financed abortions last year could have qualified under these rules but the compromise does not help the women who are merely poor not sick Those who support easier access to abortion have always fared better in the courts than in the legislatures and they intend to renew their legal attacks on the restrictions Their main contention will be that the antiabortion laws are rooted in Roman Catholic doctrine and therefore violate the constitutional principle of separation of church and state The antiabortion side is focusing on the 15 states that are picking up the full share of abortion costs for poor women In Massachusetts for example Gov Michael Dukakis has vetoed two bills that would have cut off state funds and the battle will be renewed next month In New York Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut has predicted a knockdown dragout fight over the issue The results of the Hyde amendment are visible in Texas where the state prehibited by law from financing programs without matching Federal funds Except for aid offered by a few hospitals public financing for abortions ended in August A Case in Point The impact of the amendment is felt by people like Bertha Barnes of Galveston who is 25 but looks 10 years older and who became pregnant almost four months ago Because the local hospital would not perform an abortion Mrs Barnes got on a bus the other day with her four children and came to Houston looking for help The trip cost almost 20 All she had left when she arrived was 40 that she had been saving for the rent Two years ago Mrs Barnes received an abortion paid for by Medicaid but now she no longer qualifies and because she is now past the first trimester of pregnancy the cost would be 450 The Barnes family lives on a welfare check of 166 a month and there was not much chance that she could come up with the money After a long day of examinations and discussions the Cullen Womens Center a private clinic agreed to perform the abortion and to let Mrs Barnes pay off the debt at 15 a month What would she have done otherwise I guess would have had the baby she said looking down at the bathroom scuffs on her roughened feet Or maybe kill myself For the time being the private abortion clinics here have agreed to subsidize the most needy patients but their resources are severely limited The Cullen Womens Center for instance set aside 6000 for loans but it has already spent 12000 and the repayment rate is less than percent One recipient was a 22yearold mother of two whose husband was deported to Mexico as an illegal alien Before his departure he beat his wife and he left her with a debt of 200 in unpaid rent The woman was training for a sales job at a department store when she learned that she was pregnant but she had no money Reproductive Services performed a lowcost abortion Sheila Pierce the clinics administrator said of the case Here was a woman who was trying to support her family but everything would have fallen through if she didnt get the abortion You really cant work your way out of poverty when you have no money and a new baby any extra money goes to the baby said Marcia Crowe administrator of the Cullen Clinic This is the most depressing part of our job These are the people who need the help most and yet its not there The opponents of abortion argue tht they are helping the poor Its a disadvantage to have an abortion said Cecilia McDonald a state hoard member of Right to Life an opposition group Youre destroying an unborn child and often there are physical and mental complications Finding the Money Many private clinics have to ask full or partial payment from needy patients The Delta Womens Clinic in New Orleans says that some women pay the 140 fee in crumpled 1 bills and change the fruits of doortodoor collection drives In Phoenix a 13yearold girl paid with her familys 250 monthly welfare check The Alan Guttmacher Institute of Planned Parenthood estimates that the average abortion costs 280 or 42 more than the average monthly welfare check Some clinics have tried to skirt the law by billing Medicaid for part of the cost of an abortion and listing it as laboratory fees or contraceptive services A doctor in New Orleans said that some physicians induced miscarriages then told their patients to go to a hospital emergency room Such haphazard measures are usually available only in urban areas Even before August many rural areas had no abortion services at all and the situation has since become worse The Cullen center recently received a call from a social worker in Texarkana who had failed to get a lowcost abortion for a young woman in northeast Texas The girl had tried to abort herself and spent two weeks in the hospital the social worker said but because she had no money no physician or clinic would end her pregnancy A Hidden Problem Abortion providers fear that the biggest problem remains hidden We are seeing possibly the more persistent or more informed women said Miss Pierce of Reproductive Services What about the women who hear on the radio that no Federal funds are available and dont know where to turn Few specific cases have been reported but some doctors say they expect to see an increase in selfinduced or illegal abortions The Federal Center for Disease Control says that in 1972 the last year before abortions became widely available 39 women died from illegal operations In 1976 the figure was one And while abortion providers press the fight for restored Federal funding they do not always feel good about it I dont know of anyone involved in abortion counseling who is not concerned with the high incidence of repeat abortions said Sandra Bennett of Planned Parenthood in Detroit There seems to be developing a cavalier attitude toward abortions and its being used by some as a means of birth control For now such agencies are trying to take care of people like Bertha Barnes who had her first child at 1R and bore three more in three years Me and my husband have not been getting along she says in explaining her desire for an abortion I dont want any more children by him Mrs Barnes was on birth control pills but gave them up because of high blood pressure When she went to a Galveston clinic to be fitted for an intrauterine device she was told that their schedule was full When her contraceptive foam ran out she did not have the 5 for new supply That is when she became pregnant

Taylor Fleming Is a writer based in Los Angeles my beauty a 27yearold childless child in grownup clothing I had no rage to hide behind anymore My work was good my husband supportive my failures my own Gone were the movements early days of magnificent sexual rage a rage born in the hearts and bodies of women who had lain nightly under men in whose pleasure they could not share and by whose words of sex they felt abused not aroused Nobody I knew hated men anymore That phase had passed But were there new angers Were they as potent as the old I could not write for two weeks afterward and then only slowly about an experience that entangled me in ways I had not expected to be entangled I have always distrusted people who seek private salvation in public places but for six days I had watched thousands of women do just that and do it with a kind of earnest Joy I first envied then shared then had to retreat from in order to describe  She was the first woman I met in Houston and I could not

stillempty lobby of the Hyatt Regency most of the delegates like Sallys friends would not arrive until Friday  the rest of the afternoon and went to dinner with six women I met at the front desk We were all dressed alike Jeans with pretty blouses We went to an old adobe seafood house way out on Main Street We ate flounder stuffed with oysters and shared a bottle of wine Nobody laughed very much The place was empty the food very good the women very apprehensive One Lillene Fifield a slight darkhaired woman with an offcenter smile was a delegate from California the rest were part of an ad hoc California Support Coalition They were lesbians One of them it turned out had been in high school with me I kept looking at her a very pretty somewhat serious girl who hooked me into my own history I remembered our campus of girls and wondered with no coloring emotion why in our efforts to love some of us tried to love women and some of us tried to love men Who knew when it began the preference for a bedmate or where in what fears or what genes or what need of love Why did it matter so much and to whom I did not sitting there feel outnumbered These women had come to Houston on their own money mainly to make sure the plank on sexual preference translation lesbian rights was passed by the 2000 conference dele gates  10 per cent of whom were lesbians The purpose of the conference financed by a 5 million Congressional appropriation was to send to the President recommendations on how to eliminate the remaining inequities legal and social between women and men There were altogether 26 propositions to be voted on in Houston propositions distilled into a National Plan of Action by 45 Presidentially appointed national commissioners a kind of board of governors for the conference headed by former Representative Bella Abzug Of the delegates 1442 had been elected in state meetings and 900 had been appointed by the commissioners The propositions they passed would be presented to President Carter who would do what with them no one was sure My dinner partners felt that the proposition on lesbian rights if passed would receive small support from the White Houses convinced Christian But they were not angry Mostly that night they were scared There had been talk of Nazis and Ku Kluxers coming to disrupt the conference No one knew how strong were the rightwing delegates Though outnumbered by the liberal delegates 4 to 1 they might it was feared filibuster sufficiently to disrupt the voting Then too we were in Houston and it was hot and frontierfeeling and we were all somehow staying in the same old hotel  the only place we could get into that first night  across from the Greyhound bus depot in clearly a tough part of town We traded paranoias A convention of lumbermen was staying on floors six seven and eight There were men in the lobby with tattoos on their arms and grease in their hair Some of the room doors had been broken with a fist or a foot We agreed to ride up and down in the elevators together we agreed to share a suite if such could be found Our paranoias intersected diverged We all feared the men feared rape I guess They feared too the extrarape rage reserved for the homosexual woman I found that I feared them the women somewhere Feared what  the sharing of a bed a possible caress Whom did I fear more My sense of safety was schizophrenic I slept at last alone badly no suite having been found in a tiny dark room feeling a bit of shame and a bit of sadness that my new acquaintances were far away on other floors separated from me by myriad lumbermen  Thursday morning I moved to the Hyatt and for the next two days I watched the lobby fill up I felt giddy lost in a genderless nevernever land Everywhere there were women mostly middleaged middleclass club women church women union women wearing buttons like How Dare You Assume Id Rather Be Young or AAUW for ERA women of eclectic causes and eclectic vanities women in muumuus tweed suits gaucho pants women drinking laughing talking women doing grownup things and exhilarated to be doing them things like tipping waiters carrying suitcases lobbying and caucusing to all hours of the night women exhilarated too by their sexual indefiniteness their sexual immunity in this temporary world without men They didnt talk about the men they had left at home That silence was perhaps the most revolutionary thing about the whole conference In the rage of the foremothers the rage of Kate Millett author of Sexual Politics and Betty Friedan author of The Feminine Mystique women I was hoping to see there in what I anticipated as their vindication their curtain call  there had been an intense involvement however angry with men But these women needed no one for these days and implicit in that was the sense that they could these middleclass working wives many of them take care of themselves that they could live alone if they had to taking their nonsexual nourishment from each other and their sexual nourishment as many men do from chance encounters That realization ran like a sad proud undercurrent beneath their high sense of purpose and exhilaration What they did talk about was whore to eat and what meeting to attend With the patience of the newly Included they sat for hours on suitcases in the lobby waiting to get into rooms just as they would sit for eight hours on hardbacked folding chairs in the Sam Houston Coliseum They griped mildly often at the press but it was the plaint of the franchised not the disenfranchised who would have worried not about how  but whether  they were being covered There were 1900 press people mostly women conscripted despite themselves into the prevailing sense of sorority who followed the delegates around recording their democratic exercise their graduation into the mainstream Late Friday afternoon when the heat was drying at last into a cool wind and the tops of Houstons tallest buildings were wrapped in shawls of mist I found finally some remnants of old angers at a small rally on the steps of City Hall A few hundred women many avowed lesbians mostly in jeans with clipped hair had gathered to hear Flo Kennedy the black feminist lawyer now championing prostitutes and Kate Millett perhaps the movements prime theoretician They had gathered in other words to hear two of the old guard Kennedy and Millett who had no formal connection with the conference stood alone that afternoon as the unreconstructed the guardians of the original rage There were no commissioners in the crowd who had come to see them nor discernible delegates nor any of the gay women I had met in any of the hotels In this audience were the scrappers the determined outcasts `Lesbianism is a profound feminist issue Kate Millett the movements theoretician told an outdoor rally `because discrimination against women begins at the level of sex Awaiting the start of the National Womens Conference in Houston last month 2000 delegates and an equal number of observers fill the Sam Houston Coliseum Two delegates exultantly hail the passage of the controversial sexual preference resolution by which the conference put itself on record in favor of lesbian rights The conference attracted its share of conservative delegates However because they were outnumbered 4 to 1 they had little chance to affect the proceedings women who like many selfstyled revolutionaries of the 60s had become so accustomed to their outrage that they would feel naked without it Flo 61 came to the microphone feisty Flo the doyenne of the disenfranchised in her traditional costume of jeans beads and boots Weve still only spilled menstrual blood she evangelized And if you think you can change society without shedding blood youre crazy Then she led a round of Everybody Needs a Hooker Sometime The crowd was happy having a hard time holding on to its anger The early evening was cool and there were black Vs of birds against the dark blue sky and there was only one aberrant placard among the others  something like Womens Libbers and Lesbians Repent  carried by one lone Christian and Flo had been her usual and Kate was coming Kate Millett small and quite round and pale her long thick gray hair a childs dream or nightmare of a witchs mane spoke then softly about the womens movement never having been in better shape She had come to Houston she said for only one reason She is a lesbian and hoped to see the sexualpreference plank pass Friday night that seemed a distant dream How would all those nice middleclass women endorse lesbian rights The Equal Rights Amendment yes even abortion which like lesbian rights had been mainstreamed into more palatable prose and was now called reproductive freedom a cumbersome slightly silly phrase But the language changes implied a new vision A woman late to a National Gay Task Force press conference had come screaming into the briefing room Oh are these the dykes Far out And everyone had laughed It was comparable to Richard Pryor calling himself nigger It implied a savvy selfacceptance and a growing social acceptance however hesitant To Kate Millett that acceptance was crucial to the movement Lesbianism she said that night is a profound feminist issue because discrimination against women begins at the level of sex There in a single sentence was a quiet cogent distillation of the original rage behind the movement The scepter was about to be passed officially from the theoreticians to the activists the grassroots workers in a sometimes moving sometimes boring three day ceremony I walked back to the hotel feeling warm and silly and safe in the streets I was in the center of the city reputed to have the highest crime rate in America but I wore my sentimentality like a suit of armor I had just left the old guard of the womens movement and was about to rejoin the new  There they were in the Hyatt lobby hundreds of them some still sitting on their suitcases in travel fatigues others dressed seriously now for a cocktail reception for the three First Ladies Rosalynn Carter Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson who the next morning would lull the conference hall with the pleasant banality of their remarks the historicalness of the occasion almost obscured by their reassuring rhetoric and by the wistful pomp of democracy There were flags and multiethnic Girl Scouts and thousands of deeply ordinary words that made the thousands of delegates feel warmed and wearied until roused to mild applause by the educated basso profundo of Barbara Jordan We will she said persuade and dissuade and when a debate becomes heated I hope you will remember Lyndon Johnsons invocation and Isaiahs invocation Come now let us reason together  Through the long morning some women read some did needlepoint some went to get coffee One sensed among them a determination to immunize themselves against the keynoters heartplucking a sense that if they fell now for fancy words they would fall too into the hands of the speakers surrender before they had begun their power to their more powerful sisters There was grumbling about Bella the presiding officer she was too strong too gruff too manipulative grumbling from women who admired her slightly more than they distrusted her women who would the final Monday morning vote down the proposition establishing a Cabinetlevel womens department because they said it was Bellas proposition for Bella There was grumbling too about something called ProPlan  a scheme supposedly devised by 11 women who headed their states delegations but rumored to be the brainchild again of Bella or of other highpowered backroomers  a simple politically sensible scheme to pressure delegates gently to vote the whole slate 26 propositions no cat fights or questions asked That that is what happened that most of the pro delegates did vote a straight slate nixing only the last the womens department was that first morning unimportant What was important was their grand girlish sense of hesitation and their determination not to be had by anyone The voting on the least provocative propositions began that afternoon I did not stay I took a taxi five miles across town and got off in another world Entering the AstroArena by a back entrance I found myself at the foot of a stage where an Elvis lookalike was singing When you pray pray for America When he finished I heard a horde rise behind me in ovation Twelve thousand people stood cheering and waving American flags or bibles They carried large handscrawled signs disarming in their rawness with messages like God Is a Family Man Keep Lesbians Out of Our Schools and I Was a Fetus Once At the edge of the stage a small child held up a smaller one a deformed little girl in a pink pinafore her hands curled her face a blur of tiny features These were Carters people in a sense their piety though more untutored was his piety They had come in buses from Southern cities and towns bringing their children in their party clothes The hall was full of mothers pale young mothers on their scrubbed faces a beatific mixture of maternal and religious zeal The husbands hovered mostly overweight in shortsleeved shirts the outline of their undershirts visible beneath In these men one saw a real wombenvy a feeling that their women however they treated them had a direct line to the Lord through their wombs I did for a moment envy the women the envy of their men understanding the simplistic male celebration of procreation understanding too how and why that male envy turned to rage against women who severed that line women who thumbed their noses at their link to the Lord and at their chance for immortality In light of that rage E R A opponent Phyllis Schlafly pert and powdered and always condescendingly cordial to these people her flock makes sense She preaches as she did that day female submission a preachment which to men already in awe of women is a reassuring litany To the women it promises protection if you procreate a glorious chance not to have to grow up A part of any woman however liberated is still somewhat seducible by that idea of male protectiveness That susceptibility accounts I think for Schiaflys effectiveness in her campaign against ERA and against abortion It accounts also for the sternness of newly liberated women many of whom fear and feel the need to resist the call of strong male arms as if it were the song of a siren  Back in the convention hall I spent Saturday night beside Jane McMichael the executive director of the National Womens Political Caucus One of the more sophisticated feminist organizations it was founded in 1971 by 271 politicallyminded women and was the catalyst for the ProPlan idea Jane McMichael is 35 she has seablue eyes soft greying hair and a shy smile She has been head of the 19 salaried NWPC staff members for three years Her organization will raise half a million dollars next year to keep the caucus alive researching profeminist candidates and issues In her dirndl skirt and blazer she moved around the floor with the determined slightly awkward stride of a Miss Jean Brodie stacking people at microphones talking with the ProPlan contacts in each delegation flushing with pleasure when each resolution passed one after the other We women have had so little power McMichael said that were uncomfortable with it embarrassed by it we want to step back from it But once youre a feminist youre always a feminist There is no going back It was difficult for a lot of women to be comfortable with men for awhile The initial break caused a lot of disruptions But weve worked out the kinks worked out our marriages We certainly dont hate men If anything we like them more They dont make me cower anymore Here was the missing link of the womens movement Between the theoreticians warmed by rage and the middleclass delegates in the hall warmed by a simple sense of seeing justice done were the Jane McMichaels warmed originally to battle by some sense of hurt somewhere along the way Who knew what had gone on in how many lives But there was a pain in this woman that had turned into power There were other women like her in the hall welldressed wellorganized women who for the last six or seven years had researched and lobbied Now this night they were having their moment from which for fear as always of seeming like men they stepped back Tomorrow night they would not take that step back 0 Sunday was not a good day for the conventions most serious churchgoers Their God must have seemed very far away just as the microphones must have seemed like a mirage in the desert As they drank their coffees and ate their hot dogs they watched women of a different faith women who looked just like them vote to sanction the possibility of abortion and lesbian rights They were not politically outmaneuvered so much as morally outmaneuvered The large left flank stole morality from the right and used it to great effect With the lateafternoon passing of the minority womens proposition  a proposition urging all levels of government to help end the dual discrimination against minority women there began a contagion of moral sentimentality against which the rightwing delegates were powerless The minority vote was significant because it was the first sign that the womens movement was going to include  and ask the country to include  women less lucky than themselves an inclusion which made them feel proud That righteous pride swept the proslate delegates through the remaining votes and out into the warm Houston night on a magic carpet of moral certitude their faces as beatific as the faces of the young mothers I had seen the day before If the rightwing delegates were steamrolled that night as they afterward maintained then they were steamrolled by sentiment As the propositions were dealt with alphabetically it was a short highpitched wait between the minority vote and the vote on reproductive freedom During the intervening three votes women of both persuasions jostled to be near one of the eight floor microphones for the start of the abortion debate a debate that when it came was characterized by the same pedestrianism as the opening ceremonies each side wedded as usual to its Pavlovian prose On the floor women with sad mouths sang a chorus of God Bless America while Gloria Steinem in narrow black pants a pumpkin silk shirt her hair as always led with tentative fist a chant of Choice Choice Choice For a brief moment morality seemed like a loose ball on a football field but the prochoice players somehow repossessed it and thereafter they held onto it There was only one proposition to be voted on before the vote on sexual preference Everyone began to settle Balloons stenciled We Are Everywhere were being quietly passed in the stands With the announcement of the sexual preference proposition the silence was suddenly thorough it was as if there had been a power failure It was obvious to everyone that the lesbian issue had become the emotional focal point of the conference Women who had not known it a minute before knew then that this was why they had come that this was their time of truth Could their proud inclusion of the less lucky in the womens movement be extended to lesbians Were their heterosexual hearts up to this danger this generosity It was a time of truth too for their movement which had come to Houston in fragments and had the chance with this vote to make itself whole and to turn all its energies outward for the first time The women on that floor seemed to understand that their movement divided too long against itself would be seriously imperiled if they did not finally allow in the very active lesbian minority a mi nority they had kept out for reasons of expediency for fear of alienating new converts to the movement But those new converts were in the hall and it was their moment Women remembered in that moment women who had been preoccupied for weeks and months with things like child care and equal employment remembered that the whole thing the whole movement had begun in bed in the sexual oppression and the sexual loneliness they had felt in their own beds Now lesbians women whose bodies speak only each others language wanted the official blessings of a movement for which many of them had worked part or all of the past 10 years It was Anita Bryant who had thrown down the gauntlet to the women in the movement they must bestow those blessings or not in public for all the world to see I went looking for Kate Mullett I found her huddled behind her hair in a dark corner near the speakers platform She had a phony press pass and was scared of being thrown off the floor I am she said with a halfsmile an eavesdropper at a womens conference As we listened to the delegates Millett spoke about them with affection and a tinge of bemusement These are people she said who were taught to laugh at jokes about faggots and dykes and theyve come to understand that this vote is morally important enough to get over that In Houston weve turned the corner we used to be a middleclass elitist movement and now were a middleclass mass movement Thats what every revolutionary dreams of isnt it inheriting a mass movement Were still middle class it takes time But that a movement was able to do what this one has done in 13 years is to be noted There were quite a few speakers the rhetoric at last of a higher heartier quality Millett paused to hear cocking her head and uttering soft right ons from time to time She said she had heard that afternoon that Betty Friedan might speak and when Friedan was finally recognized Millett rose and said quietly Yes oh yes let us heal all the wounds at once She stood her hand over her mouth facing the place where Friedans fierce voice and tender words came from somewhere far back in the hall I have been known to be violently opposed to lesbianism said Friedan in what in irony might become her best remembered words And in fact I have been As someone who grew up in Illinois in Peoria Illinois as someone who has loved men  perhaps too well  Ive had trouble with this issue But we must help women who are lesbians in their own civil rights Milletts thick tortoiseshell glasses misted Like a child in slippers she shuffled through the crowd largely unrecognized after the ghost of Friedans voice She wanted to thank her but could not find her The proposition passed easily and the aisles were suddenly full of women kissing each other on the cheek on the mouth I wanted to call my mother who I knew was watching on television and tell her it was OK One had to remind oneself that at least 75 percent of the women celebrating were heterosexual They were celebrating because for that one moment with that one vote they knew they were better than men It is impossible to imagine a comparable group of men conquering their sexual fear of each other and rising to embrace male homosexuals and these women knew that and their previous prides paled beside this pride I watched a covert celebrant wanting to hug and be hugged but held back by a nonsexual shyness and a residual sense of professional posture It was the oddest sensation being on that floor One felt absolutely in the mainstream  some mainstream anyway  knowing all the while that there was another mainstream out there the one I had seen in the AstroArena and that the two were destined to clash again and again in a civil war of women each side more sophisticated in weaponry each time Kate Millett touched other women sparingly like a child eager but too shy to break into a game of ringaroundarosy A few people stroked her hair as she passed We sat down again in her dark corner Well she said beaming the class is off to a flying start This is the most radical thing they could have done I always wonder why minorities are judged as if they had to be better but I do think women ought to be a little better with power than men because theyve had to work so hard to get it And out of their own oppression they should have a slightly better slant on justice This conference started off so starchy But even with all that dumb dopey democratic ritual the authenticity came through It makes you believe in women a lot  Monday morning was like the day after the prom With a sagging sense of their special ness the delegates dragged themselves through the remaining votes voting down as their final minor gesture of independence the proposed womens department and skirmishing a little as if to finally fulfill a press prophecy with the embittered rightwing conferees Everyone was ready to go home By Monday night the campground was deserted I went to dinner with a young male reporter who bemoaned the fact that there were not any great stories to be covered anymore I wondered if we had been in the same city the past few days knowing of course that he could not share my corny sentiments my feeling that I had tumbled inadvertently into an historic moment in many ways my own I had watched women have their grandscale parliamentary baptism One sensed that these women knew as they left Houston that with their conference so similar to so many that had gone before they had hastened their own absorption into the political mainstream They had not tried to change any of the existing rules of the game they had merely asked to be allowed to play But if they were political conservatives in that sense then they were also personal revolutionaries women willing to love women who love women In Houston they had matched intransigences and matched compassions The significance of the lesbian vote was that it reopened a channel of compassion in women long separated by their sexual allegiances and reminded them that they just might be tenderer than men after all It had been a long way back to that tenderness  Three First Ladies left to right Lady Bird Johnson Rosalynn Carter and Betty Ford join conference commissioner Bella Abzug in the torch ceremony which opened the Houston proceedings
Power to the People Maybe,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/27/archives/power-to-the-people-maybe.html,A year that began with Jimmy Carter promising to restore confidence in government may be ending with the American people more cynical and mistrustful of their leaders than ever before Mr Carters uneven personal performance his frequent clashes with Congress the Bert Lance affair the persistence of inflation and unemployment the highpowered beginning and sputtering continuance of the energy controversyin light of all that it would not be surprising if many Americans had been confirmed in a view of government as incompetent and unresponsive For that reason the coming year may see more interest than once would have been expected in two proposed Constitutional amendments purporting to ease the problem One sponsored by Senators James Abourezk and Mark Hatfield would adapt the initiative procedure to national legislation The other put forward by Senators John Danforth and Dennis DeConcini would limit members of the House of Representatives to six twoyear terms and members of the Senate to two sixyear terms The authors of these amendments do not claim that their adoption at stroke would restore the peoples faith in government nor can any procedural reform be that successful What is really needed is for people to perceive the Government as functioning smoothly and in their basic interest no such perception is really possible today Sooner or later for example Social Security taxpayers may realize that since they cannot deduct these onerous levies from their income taxes they actually are paying a tax on a tax Under the bill just passed a married couple earning 18900 jointly in 1979 will pay for example a Social Security tax of 605 percent or 1143 nod IN THE NATION about 26 percent in Federal state and city income taxes on the 1143 which they will never have received or about 297 more Thats a real tax of 76 rather than 605 percent a fact which if understood would do nothing whatever for confidence in government Under the proposed AbourezkHa field amendment theoretically it would be possible to repeal or amend by popular initiative the ruinous Social Security bill Congress has passed If at least three percent of the voters in the last Presidential election in each of at least ten states signed valid petitions within an 18month period a national proposition could go on the ballot in the next general election If approved the new law could not be repealed or amended by Congress for two years except by a twothirds vote Voters would not have the power to declare war call up the militia or amend the Constitution through the initiative procedure They could however have approved a Medicare system sometime in the 1950S rather than waiting for Congress to do it in the 1960s or they might be able to settle the present Congressional impasse on Federal funds for abortions They might well have passed in the last decade some sort of antibusing legislation On the whole and recognizing that there would be some bitter with the sweet the initiative procedure might well be useful The 23 states that already permit it have neither been ruined by mischievous legislation nor seen many of their problems solved by the wisdom of the people But Mr Abourezks claims do not seem overstatedthat the initiative makes more nearly real a citizens right to petition the government complements the system of checks and balances enhances government accountability and might therefore increase citizen participation and lessen mistrust The DanforthDeConcini proposal as Mr Danforth described it in a letter to the disapproving Wall Street Journal is designed to remind each member of Congress that he is not by virtue of his election a member of some ruling class ensconced in Washington but a citizen on leave to his governmenta public servant first last and foremost Aside from the inherent implausibility of Congress passing such an amendment it could be replied that if the goal is to build confidence in government the people ought to have the right to elect whom they please as often as they please But the twoterm limitation on Presidents does not appear so far to have had depressing effect on citizen participation or confidence and numerous states still restrict their governors to one or two terms The large turnover in recent years in the Senate and the House does seem to have had some rejuvenating effect on Congress A major problem of such reforms of course is that while they may or may not achieve their planned effects they almost always have unforeseen not necessarily welcome side effects No one need worry however about Congress taking plenty of time to study these particular reforms striking as they do at Congressional power 
Mr. Califano Operates on the Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/27/archives/mr-califano-operates-on-the-law.html,The spotlight in the national drama over abortion policy now falls on Secretary of Health Education and Welfare Califano The Secretary who is personally opposed to abortion must interpret the brand new law governing Medicaid funding of abortions for the poor Mr Califanos first tryin guidelines issued shortly after its passageraises serious question about his willingness to set aside personal feelings and carry out the will of Congress The guidelines were so narrowly construed that even his own legal staff raised objections Senators Magnuson and Brooke leaders in the battle to liberalize Medicaid policy have asked the Secretary to rewrite the guidelines We join this call The dispute centers on Medicaid provisions for rape and incest The law provides public payment for abor tions when the mothers life is in danger or when two doctors certify that she would suffer severe and longlasting physical damage if she gave birth For victims of rape or incest the law provides payment for medical procedures necessary  when such rape or incest has been reported promptly to a law enforcement agency or public health service Mr Califano will soon issue formal regulations that spell out for instance what Congress meant by promptly and by reported The Secretarys guidelines which have the force of taw until the regulations are published are less specific But they provide a pinched interpretation of what Congress meant by medical grocedures According to the Secretarys guidelines Congress did not mean abortions but procedures like dilation and curettage that can be used to end a possible pregnancy shortly after the rape or incest occurs To qualify for an abortion according to Mr Califanos reading of the new statute the victim of such crimes must also be in danger of her life or of serious longlasting physical damage But this interpretation ignores Congressional intent Mr Califano might argue that some members of the House would agree with his interpretation of the law The Houses position on the matter is cloudy But the Senate the intention was crystal clear The Senate would not have passed a piece of legislation that meant what Mr Califano now says the law means Few words in the long divisive abortion battle were so carefully chosen as those by Senator Brooke In addressing this very issue on the last day of debate he said So long as the rape or incest has been reported the woman clearly eligible for a publicly funded abortion Subcommittee Chairman Magnuson responded That correct I think we should make it clear to the Secretary Mr Califano  The new abortion law was difficult to forge It was our view a compromise at the expense of the poor Still it won the support of legislators who reflect a wide spectrum of views on abortion and now Secretary Califano must provide Federal regulations that faithfully reflect their agreement The legislative compromise was bad enough It should not through grudging executive action be made worse

Miami Homosexuals See aVictory Despite Defeat of Antibias Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/28/archives/miami-homosexuals-see-a-victory-despite-defeat-of-antibias-law.html,MIAMI Dec 27The telephone call was from a club woman who canceled a luncheon reservation for a party of 10 because she did not want to subject my ladies to a homosexual influence Ana tnat was about the worst thing that happened to David Harrison the owner of a popular Miami restaurant after he made the decision last spring to join out in the open the campaign to retain a local homosexual rights ordinance When the ordinance which forbade job and housing discrimination by sexual preference was soundly defeated last June the large homosexual community in south Florida was filled with dire talk of witchhunts and retaliations Nothing of the sort happened In fact six months after the county law was repealed by a vote of 208000 to 92000 homosexual activists now declare that they won the battle by losing the vote Ive traveled almost constantly around the nation since the election and Ive detected the politicization of people both gays and straights reacting to what happened here in Dade County said Jack Campbell leader of the coalition that fought vainly to rescue the ordinance as a human rights issue Discrimination Charged Individuals who had never been in volved publicly in gay rights business and professional people came out of the closet on this issue because of the bigotry and discrimination expressed by our opponents he added Chief among the opponents was Anita Bryant the entertainer whose name has become synonymous with antihomosexual attitudes Homosexuals see her as an unwitting ally who continues to remind national audiences of their struggle for human rights Miss Bryant was not available for corn ment but those who supported her cause last spring see her as a champion who has helped to spur a national revulsion against moral decay We werent out for victory or ven geance said Pat Atkinson assistant to the pastor of Northwest Baptist Church the springboard for Miss Bryants antihomosexual appeal called Save Our Children It was simply that homosexuality is against Gods word and we could not permit sin to become lawful It was a turning point for Dade County and the nation The attention of some of the church women is now directed at an enterprise operated by two leading members of the homosexual coalition Robert Kunst and Alan Rockway They have been trying to get Federal financing for a therapy center organized on the theory that bisexuality is the natural order of things and that multiple bisexual relationships are necessary to purge feelings of jealousy and possessiveness in human relations Funds Cut Off The men had been successful in obtaining a 55000 grant from the locally administered Department of Labor program under the Comprehensive Education and Training Act However the funds were cut off after objections were raised by people who did not want taxpayers money to finance homosexuals or bisexuals in providing counseling services to homosexuals and bisexuals We are more determinsd than ever not to let these people stand before us and flaunt their perverted lifestyles said Judy Wilson head of Concerned Christian Mothers Inc which uses the same mailing address as Miss Bryants disbanded organization People are taking a strong moral stand against perversion abortion and sex education in the schools Dr Rockway who is a clinical psychologist said that if the CETA funds were not restored he would sue the Federal Government on the ground of sex discrimination The fight of the center is not supported by a broad spectrum of the homosexual community In fact many members the old coalition that worked together in the spring campaign openly scorn both the philosophy and tactics of Dr Rock way and Mr Kunst They feel that the radical views of the two men alienate heterosexuals who are otherwise sympathetic to human rights issues Theres a lot of backbiting in every gay community said Mr Campbell who owns 40 male bath houses in this country and in Europe But most of the gay people tend to shy away from issues that emphasize sex and gay sex styles instead of the fundamental issue of the constitutional rights of every American Mr Harrison the restaurant owner concurred When I first heard Anita Bryant talk about gays I was annoyed and insulted I didnt like being called a child molester he said as he sipped chilled white wine in the green courtyard of his eating place Food Among Flowers But it was difficult to become involved at first because as a businessman 1 didnt want the public to confuse me with the militants who scare or with that minority in the gay community with lifestyles that I find disgusting he added Immediately after the June vote there were reports of sissy beaters on the prowl  the homosexual communitys phrase for young men with a psychological need to harm homosexuals But the gay issue and all the publicity has forced the police department to follow up on those beatings now and to cut down the number of homosexual entrapments at gay bars Mr Harrison said The debateNlast spring taught them that the people of these bars were human beings someones son maybe their own son Nor have there been widespread reprisals against homosexuals in jobs and housing In the homosexual community there is a split over the campaign conducted against Miss Bryant who has a contractual relationship with the Florida Citrus Commission The campaign was principally in the form of a boycott of Florida orange juice A minority feel that economic retaliation should not be used against the singer because she exercised her constitutional right of free speech to seek the dismissal of homosexuals Miss Bryants backers say that the campaign has been vicious and has indi rectly led to the decision by NBC to drop her as a regular on the Orange Bowl parade telecast this year In any case the local issue has faded and comes to mind only when comedians make certain jokes It also came to mind recently when the Florida Citrus Open golf tournament sent out Christmas greetings to patrons and friends with the line Don we now our gay apparel omitted from the familiar Yuletide stanza in scribed on the cards 11
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/29/archives/letters.html,To the Editor For a professor of political science Ross K Baker goes very wide of the mark when he seeks to establish the fanaticism of Ralph Nader John Gardner and David Cohen OpEd Dec 8 What he either does not or will not see is that these pragmatic and politically knowledgeable individuals are working in the political realm to effect changes they and their supporters want using the same hardheaded tradeoffs and tactics that have been effective through the years To suggest as Professor Baker does that Nader et al are pursuing the will o the wisp of separating politics from government is contradicted by their activities They are using the techniques of the lobbyist including when appropriate bringing public pressure on friends who are in office Joan Claybrook may need all the pressure Natter can bring to bear on his erstwhile fellow lobbyist if she is to be effective in her position One need not agree with each of the positions these individuals and groups have taken nor even always applaud their tactics to see the legitimacy and sometimes effectiveness of publicinterest lobbying Because their success depends on voter interest and not on the quiet use of money the major tool of the specialinterest lobbyist for generations critics such as Professor Baker apparently find the sometimes noisy and even strident tactics of the publicinterest groups distasteful But to suggest they are either unpolitical or somehow unfair as when Nader at tacks Claybrook is to miss what they are all about Nader et ui have learned to play the system by finding pressure points which at least sometimes lead to the desired policy outcome By the way Professor baker didnt do his homework and displays his ignorance of Common Cause positions when he speaks of placing its imprimatur on a 1976 Presidential candidate For better or worse Common Cause neither supports nor opposes candidates In the circulation or that notorious questionnaire Common Cause sought to require candidates to go beyond the customary realm of highbiown political rhetoric and to present the public with some real priorities in national budget planning MARGARET M CAPRON Arlington Mass Dec 17 1977 Of City Finances and the Pension Funds To the Editor The Citizens Budget Commission in its recent report on the financial emergency in New York City has recommended that the city pension funds be used for shortterm loans to meet the citys cashflow needs We can agree with the commissions concern about the mounting budget deficit and the urgent need to reduce expenditures but should the pension funds again be used to shore up the citys finances In the last months of 1975 when the citys financial needs became acute the pension trustees agreed to a plan urged by union leaders the Mayor and the Governor to purchase 25 billion of city securities Through this rescue plan which included aid from the Federal Government and the banks it was expected that the citys budget could be balanced by June 1978 But the city is now about as near bankruntcy as it was in 1975 Using the pension funds has not provided a solution Instead of achieving financial solvency for the city the solvency of the pension funds has been threatened The fixed assets of the Teachers Retirement System ior example are now over 40 percent invested in city securities The income from the remaining 30 percent of the assets is insuiticient even to pay the pensions of those who have already retired At least a third of these assets are the actual savings of the pensioners accumulated during their employment through voluntary payroll deductions A third of the retired teachers are receiving less than 4000 a year and they have been denied the cost of living increases recently granted to similar teachers throughout the state If the city becomes bankrupt their pensions cannot be paid without selling large amounts of the remaining assets Ilow long will these funds last Is fair or wise to dip even further into the pension assets Are the pensioners louse best able to meet the citys financial crisis WILLIAM WITHERS President New York Teachers Pension Assn New York Dec 19 1977 Charles Barsolti The Importance of Japan As a US Customer To the Editor To judge from recent press coverage one might think that United StatesJapan trade was a oneway street with Japan doing all the selling and none of the buying Nothing could be more misleading Japan is not simply a good US customer it is second only to Canada in its imports of American goods and it leads all nations in imports of American agricultural products In concrete terms American exports to Japan were 127 billion in 1974 116 billion in 1975 ana 118 billion in 1976 It should be further noted that these 36 billion worth of purchases were made in a period when Japan like the United States was reeling under the weight of enormous oil bills from OPEC nations The Japanese have unwisely allowed a huge trade surplus to pile up in USJapan trade during the past two years yet as recently as 1975 Japan ran a deficit with the US Even granting Japanese mistakes we should not allow the orchestrated lobbying of various American interest groups to blind us to the significance of Japan as a crucially important customer for American products Assoc Prof DONALD W KLEIN Political Science Tufts University Medford Mass Dec 20 1977 Abortion The Ancient Rules To the Editor Dr Joseph R Stanton letter Dec 15 is correct in saying The Times should not be selective Nor should Dr Stanton be selective when he cites ancient rules All the Athenian Jaw cases show that an abortion procured by the woman was considered a private wrong against her husband there is no hard evidence that it was also considered a public wrong The good doctor might have added that in early Athens the father had the right to expose his baby ie put it out in the open to die that in fifthcentury Athens although there was no explicit right to expose a baby Athenian fathers had recourse to such practice with legal if not always moral impunity It is worth noting that this onerous privilege was restricted to tile father This is not as snocking as it may seem A neaitny baby was usually exposed in a place where someone could easily rina and adopt it Everyone knows about the Hebrew baby exposed in Egypt Dr Stanton may choose to rely on the abortion clause of the Hippocratic oath But no woman today would accept the law of exposure nor would she accept any of the Athenian laws concerning women They had few rights net the least of their bonds was the law that gave the unique power to their fathers to marry them off and to annul the marriage without their consent BLUMA L TRELL Professor of Classics New York Dec 19 1977 The Oil Quotas To the Editor Captain Rommels question letter Dec 9 Why not burn their oil while we can get it and leave our precious oil in the ground for the future is appcte tine wonders it is so rarely askcet The answer of course is that it is far nitre profitable for the large oil companies to mine and market domestic oil here and Mideast oil in Europe The oil companies have persuaded every Administration since FDRs to let them set import quotas for foreign crude over the protests of conservationists including the US Navy Dependence on foreign oil is claptrap supporting continued de facto impart quotas EUGENE J MCNULTY Annapolis Md Dec 18 1977 On Trying to Curb Inflation at the Expense of Growth To the Editor The Times in a recent editorial supports a proposed tax concession designated as TIP taxbased incomes policy and designed to fight inflation by inducing wage and price restraint Restraining inflation is vital But the TIP proposal exemplifies the prevalent tendency of the efforts against inflation to divert attention from optimizing the rate of real economic growth on a sustainable basis Abysmally low average real growth since 1953 with five recessions and inadequate recoveries has cost us about 47 trillion 1976 dollars worth of total national production and more than 65 million man and womanyears of excessive unemployment Reversing this course is an even higher priority than restraining inflation And although the two problems are interrelated we know from all empirical evidence that they are not identical and that attempts to restrain inflation at the expense of growth not only is a bad bargain but also aggravates an inflation the main cause of which is increases in costs per unit of output due to high idleness of workers and other productive resources In these connections wages and prices are not ends in themselves they and many other factors are means related to the end purposes of full resource use meeting priority needs and doing social justice National wage and price policy which focuses upon inflation restraint but pays no attention to the wage and price trends essential to these three great purposes is misguided and injurious The TIP proposal would seek to hold money wage rate increases to adjustments for future inflation as estimated plus a 2 percent annual allowance for estimated productivity gains But especially in view of the fact that real wage rates are no higher now than several years ago and that productivity gains in a healthy economy average far more than 2 percent increases in the real value of wages in accord with TIP even allowing for reemploy ment would fall far below the more than 5 percent annual real increase in total wages needed for full economic recovery wage payments are close to twothirds of total consumer income and consumer spending is close to twothirds of GNP The error in TIP marked wageprice guidelines and direct controls when used during the past 15 years Also proposals for tax concessions to business to bear part of the costs of doing business should be examined with great care Moreover at least since 1964 efforts to stimulate the economy have relied far too much upon tax cuts and concessions in lieu of increased public investment It is only a secondary purpose of the Federal budget to prime the economy its primary purpose is to help allocate resources and incomes to serve priority needs which cannot be served adequately or at allwithout public programs or public assistance to private efforts of a priority nature The clear lesson since 1964 has been that almost endless rounds of tax cuts do not fulfill this duty or fulfill it far less effectively than increased public investment in terms of Government costs and achievement of priority servicing and economic stimulation Our greatly underserved priority needs in energy mass transportation environmental improvement urban renewal education health services at reasonable costs decent housing for those who lack it help to those among the deserving poor who cannot work and many other things should make us increasingly wary of tax cuts as the solution to almost all problems or even that of reducing unemployment and other idle resources The errors referred to above are perhaps as conspicuous now as in the past They also indicate why improved analysis and readjusted use of national economic policies as mandated in the HumphreyHawkins bill are so imperative LEON H KEYSERLING Washington Dec 28 1977 The writer served as chairman Council of Economic Advisers under President Truman
Letter: On Medicaid Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/30/archives/letter-on-medicaid-abortions.html,To the Editor Your Dec 27 editorial Mr Califano Operates on the Law is inaccurate in several respects First the Secretarys own legal staff did not raise objections to the statement or what the editorial refers to as guidelines issued by the Secretary on Dec 10 1977 In fact the Secretary issued the statement as drafted by the office of the general counsel There was no disagreement because the statement in substance restated the law Second the Secretary is committed to vigorous enforcement of this law The statement referred to in the editorial was released by the Secretary within 24 hours of the signing of the law by the President to put the new provisions into effect Immediately In addition as the statement indicates the Secretary immediately instructed tie general counsel to prepare regulations and establish procedures to In sure that the intent of Congress is vigorously enforced Third and most importantly the statement issued by the Secretary has been misread by The Times The statement which essentially follows the language of the new law does not say as the editorial indicates that the victim of rape or incest must be in danger of her life or serious longlasting physical damage to qualify for an abortion The Secretarys statement says as the law says when a case of rape or incest has been reported promptly to a law enforcement agency or public health service the department will provide Federal financial participation In the cost of medical procedures where such procedures are necessary for the victim The statement does not indicate whether the term medical procedures includes abortions Secretary Califano has directed his legal staff to review the legislative history of the law in order to determine the meaning of that term What the Secretary tried to make clear in his statement and what was misinterpreted by The Times was that the exception for medical procedures in the case of rape or incest was not exclusive In addition to Federal funding for medical procedures in the case of rape or incest the law permits Federal funding for abortions when the victims life is endangered or there is a risk of serious longlasting physical damage The Secretarys statement makes it clear that a victim of rape or incest like any other woman seeking an abortion is eligible for a federally funded abortion under either of these two exceptions regardless of whether the requirement of prompt reporting required in the case of medical procedures has been met RICHARD I BEATTIE Acting General Counsel Department of Health Education and Welfare Washington Dec 27 1977
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/30/archives/letters.html,To the Editor The Times recently reported that salesmen for the United States Surgical Corporation have participated in over 900 operations in New York State during the past five years Legislation to regulate who can do what to whom in the operating room was suggested as a remedy We believe that prohibiting salespeople from participating in operations would not address the basic issue involved Such a law would be directed at the wrong group of people and affect the medical process too late to help patients Since it is apparent that salespeople are often more knowledgeable about surgical equipment and its usage than are surgeons under the circumstances barring salespeople from the operating room would merely compound the risks to patients of already serious procedures It will not help patients to keep salespeople out of operating rooms rather it is to hospitals and surgeons that legislation must be directed It was reported that the president of United States Surgical Corporation maintained that surgeons using new equipment for the first few times often needed the technical advice salesmen can give during an operation We believe such practice sessions should take place in the classroom not in the operating room In addition not every hospital should be permitted to be the site of every operation Those operations which require sophisticated equipment and highly trained personnel should be restricted to specifically identified qualified institutions New York State must develop legislation which prohibits surzeons from performing procedures or using equipment for which they have not been adequately trained Mandatory education programs should be established by the appropriate agency of the state state certification of competency in the specific equipment or procedure should be required before a surgeon enters the operating room A procedure whereby hospitals are rated according to the type of operations which can safely be performed by their staffs using their facilities and equipment should also be developed These programs will help assure pa tients higher quality of care lessen the possibility of suffering due to mistakes of ignorance and save physicians and hospitals the cost pain and embarrassment of the malpractice proceedings arising from such situations By lowering the risk of ignorant surgeons performing incompetent surgery in inappropriate facilities mandatory education and hospital rating programs might even lower malpractice insurance rates Legislation to prohibit salespeople from participating in operations will not guarantee that unsuspecting patients are not used as surgical training material The continuing capability of surgeons and hospitals and not the role of salespeople is the real issue neither should be permitted to act outside the sphere of their demonstrated competency It is to these problems that the state must direct itself DONALD RUBIN SHELLEY FROST New York Dec 20 1977 The writers are respectively president and research director of the Consumer Commission on the Accreditation of Healin Services Inc Ambulances No Choice for Patients To the Editor The Nov 30 news article concerning the takeover of the voluntary ambulances by the City Health and Hospitals Corporation describes what amounts to a great lack of concern for the welfare of the indigent citizens of New York City In the struggle be tween the Hospitals Corporation and the voluntary hospitals over which is to get the indigent and emergency patients in the city the only people that are not given a choice are the patients themselves On the one hand we have the Hospitals Corporation with tremendous deficits and large municipal hospitals that very few people would patronize if given a choice On the other hand we have the voluntary hospitals that have been told they will be closed if they dont keep their census high enough By coldbloodedly manipulating the healthcare facilities that are accessible to people via the structure of hospital districts and the ambulance pickup system the Hospitals Corporation is trying to funnel as many patients as possible into the municipal hospitals in order to lower their deficits This is done in spite of the fact that the medical care available at Bellevue Harlem or Metropolitan Hospitals is not as good as that available at such voluntary hospitals as New York Hospital Mount Sinai or Beth Israel Moreover the city ambulance service is inferior to that offered by the voluntary hospitals In this struggle the elected government has the power to manipulate things in its own financial selfinterest rather than act as the representative of the people In the ambulance phase of this struggle nobody is interested in getting the patient to the nearest hospital or the best hospital or even the hospital desired by the patient The patient is seen only as a source of income with no say as to the type of emergency care he will receive and the patient population is shuffled around the city like so many parcels of mail to suit the citys financial interests JEFFREY R FISCHMAN MD New York Dec 5 1977 Unwanted Boat People the Editor The news that the Carter Administration has decided to cut the State Department request to admit 10000 Vietnamese boat people by 3000 maddening It seems the equivocation that characterized the American effort in Vietnam has now reclaimed itself on the defiant remnants of that dubious effort Even for those who believe that the American intervention was morally wrung there must be some moral writhing over the Administrations small man compassion to deny chance to those who risked their lives to reach hostile shores And whats 3000 in a war that claimed two million And all those ingenious arguments that have been put forward that there will not be enough boat people to fill the original quota request deSpite the continuing flow of 1500 a month and no way to find the necessary money for 3000 more Didnt anyone in the Carter staff find out how much the US was spending a day during its Indochinese heyday As a footnote it was reported last week that the Attorney General had granted emergency admission to 5000 soviet refugees bringing this years total to 9000 And nary a plaint was heard C C Wu Bronx Dec 22 1977 Adirondack Park The Commissioner and the Caretaker Cabins To the Editor Recently Peter Berle Commissioner of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation ordered the razing of four interior caretaker cabins in three wilderness areas of the Adirondack Park in compliance with the parks state land master plan Horrors cried many critics Nuts said the editor of an Adirondack weekly and a newspaper columnist described the act as disgraceful Commissioner Berles move is intended to protect wilderness areas which are defined in the Wilderness Act of 1964 and the state land master plan as areas where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by manwhere man himself is a visitor who does not remain Wilderness is scarce particularly east of the Mississippi and in the entire US including Alaska only about 2 percent of our land is currently being held or is slated for consideration as unspoiled wilderness It is imperative that we preserve what wilderness we have By definition wilderness in the Adirondack Park and in our national forests is to be affected primarily by the forces of nature with the imprint of mans work substantially unnoticeable Interior structures are imprints that should be removed unless a case can be made that they have overriding value in promoting health and welfare Such isonot the case with the four cabins in question DEC records indicate that only in the area of the Lake Colden caretaker cabin in the High Peaks Wilderness and near the periphery of a few other wilderness areas is there a significant amount of search and rescue activity The state land master plan wisely provides for the indefinite refmin r h I alto rnIrlan rahin Since passage of the 1964 Wilderness Act the US Forest Service has reevaluated its wilderness management policies A policy statement in the Forest Service manual states The term wilderness resource has been added to our management concept and it is not synonymous with recreational resource It involves management to maintain conditions of solitude challenge and primitive environment A dramatic illustration of the services deep commitment to wilderness is that the agency has restricted and inconvenienced itself Most administrative structures such as cabins lookouts barns and storage sheds have been phased out This is one case where it would be wise and commendable for New York State to copy the Federal Government It  is important to note that interior cabins and fire towers are only being removed from the one million acres of wilderness in the Adirondack Park A far greater number of administrative structures including cabins and towers will stand fast on the remaining 125 million state land acres Long before vibram soles lightweight packs and Svea stoves Bob Marshall wrote that wilderness was essential to mans sanity and dignity in a world overrun by manmade superficiality There is just one hope he said of repulsing the tyrannical ambition of civilization to conquer every niche on the whole earth That hope is the organization of spirited people who will fight for the freedom of the wilderness Peter Berle is fighting Lets give him our support and put the wilderness issue to rest It is important that we let Governor Carey know we are behind Peter Berle HAROLD A JERRY JR Chairman The Adirondack Council Elizabethtown NY Dec 19 1977 Dividend Tax Factor To the Editor An economics professor letter Dec 21 erroneously calls the 4 percent dividend credit insignificant To many investors this was indeed significant and it did contribute to the markets health Also tO say that the boom of the 1950s and 1960s occurred with the same double taxation of dividends we have today is to ignore our slide toward socialism our bailooning deficit spending our dollar disasters and plethora of governmental harassments or inaustry and Investment These and the other factors depressing the market are all the more reason ror creating a more favorable climate for investments one means for wnicn of course is the elimination of uouble taxation of dividends SAM 1 110MSON Manhasset L1 Dec 21 197 One Couples Needs To the Editor To the story of Grace Simmons Dec 15 who with her

prevent unwanted pregnancy MARGARET G MYERS Poughkeepsie NY Dec 20 1977

CLERGYMEN REPLY IN BOSTON DISPUTE Protestants and Archbishop Differ About Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/03/archives/clergymen-reply-in-boston-dispute-protestants-and-archbishop-differ.html,BOSTON Jan 2  The ecu menical spirit was somewhat shaken here this week as sev eral Protestant leaders reacted sharply to an attack on abor tion supporters by the Most Rev Humberto S Medeiros Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston  Archbishop Medeiros suc cessor to the late Richard Car dinal Cushing as the head of the Boston Archdiocese said last Sunday that efforts to lib eralize abortion laws were a step backward and a new barbarism In a strongly worded rejoin der the Rev Robert N West international leader of the Uni tarian Universalist Association criticized the Archbishop for hurling epithets such as bar barian and enemies of life It is unrortunate Mr West said that opponents of reform have been reduced to frantic and fanatic namecalling In a milder criticism the Rev Arthur Walmsley general sec retary of the Massachusetts Council of Churches said that the council regretted the par ticular way in which the Arch bishop had expressed his opin ion Rabbi Roland B Gittelsohn leader of Bostons Temple Is rael said that the Archbishop speaks as if all moral rights were on one side of the ques tion The Massachusetts Council of Churches also said it was seek ing an immediate meeting with the Archbishop to discuss the abortion issue Later however a council spokesman said the group was dismayed over its inability so far to arrange such a meeting There was no further com ment on the issue from Arch bishop Medeiros An editorial this week in The Pilot the official archdiocesan newspaper expressed surprise over the reaction to the Arch bishops remarks noting The Catholic position on abortion should be by this time famil iar to most Americans Tribute to Progress In this ecumenical age the editorial said one might have expected that those who wished to comment on the Archbish ops words would have at least waited until they were able to read the entire text before they denounced it as did one as frantic and fanatic The editorial said that others who issued statements had done so in a reasonable manner This is in itself a tribute to the progress we have made lo cally in religious understanding and brotherhood it declared A spokesman for the Council of Churches said Thursday that most Protestant leaders had de cided not to discuss the issue further in public They tend to believe he said that their inability to meet with the Archbishop was large ly due to his being new on the job and deeply involved in es tablishing his own administra tive structure

Undoing the Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/04/archives/undoing-the-abortion-law.html,No recent law has been so mutilated in its first six months as New York States abortion statute the most ad vanced in the nation The wrecking process may be continued in the next Legislature when Republican leaders plan to introduce such drastic amend ments that little may be left of this longsought right of womenthe right of choice in childbearing  The wrecking began on Oct 19 when the New York City Board of Health incorporated its own abortion rules into the Health Code tantamount to law and enforceable by fines and jail Although the State Legislature had legalized all abortion in the first 24 weeks of pregnancy by a licensed physician the board bypassed the lawmakers and restricted abortions to hospitals and hospitalaffiliated clinics and clinics with such expensive equip ment that few could afford it Without a word of medical evidence to support these restrictions the board thus wiped out a carefully selected list of small clinics and physicians who have safely handled thousands of cases for the Womens Center and other referral services The National Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws promptly established an expert panel including Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton and other legislators to examine the boards evidence Not one board member showed up or even presented a statement As a result of the boards restric tions abortion care in city hospitals has become a bureaucratic jungle whose main victims are the poor Re buffed and degraded by hospital after hospital they must wait an average of three to four weeks for an abortion while anyone with 600 or 700 can enter a proprietary hospital immediately These delays are not only psycho logically injurious to the patient but force her into the increased risks of late abortionthe saline injection technique instead of the simple five minute suction method commonly used in pretwelveweek pregnancies City and State Forces Work Against Programs To Give Women Choice Despite glowing reports from city hospitals the Rev Howard Moody of the Clergy and Lay Advocates for Hos pital Abortion Performance calls their record a tragic game of illusion and confusion The most unfortunate aspect is the refusal of officials to end the logjam with one proved solution outpatient clinics at every city hos pital for pretwelveweek cases The outstanding example of such safe efficient and inexpensive clinics is Dr Hale Harveys Womens Medical Group in Manhattans East Seventies a private service with a 200 top soon to be cut to 100 and many applicants accepted free The newer Womens Medical Center on Irving Place sets a 100 top Harveys doctors now per form eighty abortions a day almost as many as all city hospitals combined Since the Board of Healths only defense in banning small clinics is its claim to superior inhospital medical standards Harveys recent study re buts this claim The Health Services Administration announced a medical complication rate in hospital of 125 per 1000 Harveys complications were only onethird this rate in his first 4000 cases All hospitals have had four abortion deaths Harveys clinic has had none As if the new law had not been impeded enough a drive led by the Catholicbased Right to Life groups who spent an estimated 300000 on Washington States abortion refer endum but lost and the Conservative party abetted by Republican leaders aims to cripple the law with amend ments New repeal bills some stronger than New Yorks are given an excellent chance of passage in Arizona Iowa Michigan and Minnesota in 1971 With this steady march toward abortion repeal including Alaska Hawaii and Washington which almost rate with New York it would be a tragic de feat for social reform if the New York law were slashed to pieces after only six months of trial
Pontiff Exhorts Bishops on Teachings,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/05/archives/pontiff-exhorts-bishops-on-teachings.html,WASHINGTON Jan 4Pope Paul VI called on the worlds Roman Catholic Bishops today to rededicate themselves to teaching the traditional funda mentals of the faith  In a 4600word apostolic exhortation made public here by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops the Pope said that many Catholics were trou bled in their faith by an ac cumulation of ambiguities un certainties and doubts about its essentials Pope Paul asked the bishops to carry out their duty of hand ing on the faith in its fullness by teaching the word of God the whole word of God He called this a grave and urgent duty The message reaffirmed the Popes adherence to conserva tive and fundamental interpre tations of church teachings The message was dated Dec 8 to coincide with the fifth an niversary of the closing of Ecumenical Council Vatican II 196265 The Pope noted that the Council had brought about changes in the methods of pre senting what the Church teaches as unchangeable truths Fears Betrayal of Truth However he said bishops should be cautious lest this necessary effort should ever betray the truth and continuity of the teaching of the faith We must beware in particu lar he added lest an arbi trary selection should reduce Gods design to the limits of our human views and restrict the proclaiming of His word to what our ears like to hear excluding on purely natural criteria what does not please contemporary taste The Pope reemphasized a number of essentials of the faith including belief in the Trinity the real presence of Christs body and blood in the eucharist the church as an in stitution of salvation and the value of prayer and the sacra ments Among other such essentials he cited the moral responsi bility concerning for instance the indissolubility of marriage or respect for life The allusion was to divorce birth control and abortion While silence gradually ob scures certain fundamental mysteries of Christianity he said we see manifestations of a tendency to reconstruct from psychological and sociological data a Christianity cut off from the unbroken tradition which links it to the faith of the apostles and a tendency to ex tol a Christian life deprived of religious elements Pope Paul expressed encour agement and support for theo logians and scriptural scholars who are taking into account progress made in human sci ences and the questions the lat ter pose to the mind of the be lievers But in face of the ravages being inflicted upon the Chris tian people by the diffusion of venturesome hypotheses and of opinions that disturb the faith he said we have the duty to recall with the Council that true theology rests upon the written word of God together with sacred tradition as its per petual foundation The Pope exhorted the bishops not to be reduced to silence by fear of criticism However necessary the func tion of theologians he added it is not to the learned that God has confided the duty of authentically interpreting the faith of the church That faith is borne by the life of the peo ple whose bishops are responsi ble for them before God Time to Be Heard It is for the bishops to tell the people what God asks them to believe Now is the time for us to take the means to make our selves heard the Pontiff de clared
Light Needed in Albany,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/05/archives/light-needed-in-albany.html,There is pervading darkness in Albany as the State Legislature prepares to convene tomorrow The issues confronting the State of New York are numerous massive and yet in their exact size and shape uncertain  There has been no briefing by Governor Rockefeller on his budget this year the first year of his fourth fouryear term as in years past There have been only vigorous demands that the Administration in Washington and the Congress enact into law a generous scheme of Federal revenuesharing While the outlines of the states projected budgetary gap are still dimly defined they are clear enough to indicate the states desperate fiscal situation Some Republicans say the gap between projected expenses and projected revenues will be 500 million Some Democrats double this figure Money looms as the sessions key issue There are more questions than answers at this stage How much money does the state need How far short do its pro jected revenues fall What are the possible sources additional tax revenues The income tax The sales tax Both Perhaps next to money statelocal relations bulk the largest in importance Governor Rockefeller who wants no strings on the funds he hopes to get for the state from Washington seeks to impose additional strings on state money going to localities He has already initiated new audits of programs aided by state funds in New York City He may try to attach restrictions on the new state money due localities under the statelocal revenue sharing scheme adopted last year Besides money and statelocal relations a host of other vital issues crowd for attention housing how to build it health care how to provide it welfare how to rational ize it reapportionment how to accomplish it equitably abortion reform how to preserve it transportation how best to aid both subways and railroads legislative reform and electoral reform how to achieve them The lack of official Census tracts may prevent this session from considering reapportionment it could be come the business of a subsequent special session Family planning summarily shunted aside by the Senate after passage by the Assembly may find more sympa thetic attention now that the Federal Government has approved its own vastly expanded program These appear to be the major issues They are enough to keep the State Legislature busy They need better identification however better definition The course of leadership would be for Governor Rockefeller to throw some light on these issues in his opening address

ROCKEFELLER SAYS STATE ‘MUST TIGHTEN ITS BELT’;,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/07/archives/rockefeller-says-state-must-tighten-its-belt-silence-on-taxes.html,ALBANY Jan 6Governor Rockefeller warned the Legis lature today that the state faced a bleak fiscal situation  This is a time when a gov ernment just like a family must tighten its belt and live within its resources the Gov ernor declared in his yearly state of the state message as the Legislature convened for its 194th annual session Mr Rockefeller backed up his plea for austerity by pre senting a legislative program that broke no new ground and involved no major rise in state spending Explains the Increases The Governor said that even without major new programs state expenditures would jump 13billion over the current budget of 71billion because of mandated increases Among these are increases in state aid to schools and cities and raises for state employes Although the gap between revenue and expenses in the coming fiscal year has been estimated at 400million to 1 billion the Governor was con spicuously silent on the possi bility of tax increases which most legislators believe are in evitable Mr Rockefeller said he would defer decisions on the state financial plan until after Presi dent Nixon spelled out his pro posals for Federalstate rev enuesharing in his State of the Union Message this month Met With President Mr Rockefeller conferred with the President yesterday and a source close to the Gov ernor said later that Mr Nixon had assured the Governor of some new money from Fed eral revenuesharing Mr Rockefeller had flatly ruled out a tax increase in his 1970 message which was de livered against a background of the Governors impending can didacy for reelection The Governor was also silent today on New York Citys fiscal and labor problems He pro posed efforts to cut court con gestion in the city to halt the moves of corporate headquar ters from the pity and to seek Federal selection of the citys for a pilot project under Presi dent Nixons proposed family assistance program which would guarantee a minimum in come for welfare families None of these proposals would involve any major expen diture of state money In his message Mr Rocke feller proposed the following things Establishment of a com pulsory state health insurance program Support for a constitutional amendment permitting the es tablishment and financing of a community development pro gram to stimulate urban re newal Support for a constitutional amendment repealing the so called Blaine Amendment bar ring state aid to churchaffili ated schools Support for a constitutional amendment lowering the voting age to 18 Amendment of the abortion law to prohibit abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy instead of the present 24  A substantial but un specified increase in penalities for tax evaders as a means of prosecuting leaders of organ ized crime Revision of the drug laws Reduction of court conges tion The three constitutional amendments for which Mr Rockefeller urged support were approved by the previous Leg islature Such amendments re quire approval by two Legisla tures and then by voters in a referendum The compulsory health insur ance program would require virtually every worker in the state to join a health insurance plan with employer and em ploye splitting the premium costs Similar proposals have died in the Legislature for the last four years Under the community devel opment program the state could provide low interest funds for the construction of housing community centers and commercial buildings as part of urban renewal pro grams A 1billion bond issue to provide financing would also require voter approval next fall In calling for final legisla tive approval of the Blaine Amendment repeal the Gov ernor did not mention state aid to parents for parochial school tuition although proponents of parochial school aid are now backing this legislation rather than the repeal of Blaine Mr Rockefeller said he wanted the states narcotics laws to embody penalties that would reflect increased knowl edge as to the danger of par ticular drugs and [that would] provide punishment more close ly relatable to the harm caused to society The major result of this stillgeneral proposal is expected to be a reduction of penalties against users of soft drugs such as marijuana and barbiturates To cut court congestion par ticularly in New York City by creating a narcotics court Mr Rockefeller proposed increas ing the number of judges in various courts and setting up administrative tribunals such as those now handling many traffic violations in New York City Under recent Federal legisla tion upheld by the Supreme Court those under 21 may vote only for national offices The law went into effect last Fri day The state constitutional amendment would apply to all elections The message today was in sharp contrast to the Gover nors message last year a gu bernatorial election year Although Mr Rockefeller also emphasized the states fiscal problems in 1970 the major thrust was positive with such rallying cries as to eliminate poverty and injustice and to make the opportunity for good education and good health a universal right Any such calls in todays message were muted and sub ordinate to the overriding theme of belttightening The somber mood of the ad dress was reflected in the re action of legislators who ap peared reconciled to a period of retrenchment and wrestling with tight budgets The states three top Demo cratsController Arthur Levitt Senate Minority Leader Joseph Zaretzki of Manhattan and Assembly Minority Leader Stanley Steingut of Brooklyn withheld voicing their tradi tional exceptions to the Gov ernors message Mr Zaretzki and Mr Steingut like the other legislative leaders were reelected today as expected Touching other issues in his 10minute address in an Assem bly chamber crowded with egislators staff personnel rel atives and friends the Gov ernor also proposed the follow ing A final decision be made on the longdiscussed fourth jetport for the metropolitan area A Relocation Assistance Corporation be set up to pro vide loans for laidoff defense workers to move elsewhere to find employment The maximum loan for col lege tuition be increased from 7500 to 10000 All open dumps and incin erators be eliminated by Jan 1 1973 and that the state in

New College Trend: Women Studies,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/07/archives/new-college-trend-women-studies-new-trend-at-college-women-studies.html,A new academic discipline is rising on the nations cam puses women studies  More than 60 colleges and universities around the coun try apparently taking a hint from the black studies move ment are offering women studies courses this year A year ago only a handful of schools offered such courses The trend toward women studies which has affected such schools as Yale Cornell Princeton Wellesley and Northwestern appears to have been generated not only by the womens liberation move ment but also by pressures from students teachers and alumnae who believe women are not getting fair academic treatment The trend has encountered some opposition however from faculty members who believe such fields as black studies and women studies are divisive and academi cally unsound Women as a Group In general women studies courses treat women as a group that has its own his tory a unique role in society and special problems The courses involve such matters as the contributions of women to science history literature and political science discrim ination against women and the treatment of women in different societies At San Diego State College in California 10 elective courses are offered Fifty women and 20 men are en rolled in a course called Con temporary Issues in the Lib eration of Women under the direction of Dr Roberta Salper 31 years old a ded icated womens liberationist The class examines such is sues as abortion divorce laws contraception sexual attitudes child care and the role of minority group women At Princeton where women were admitted last year a similar course explores the impact of women on such social problems as drugs racism unemployment and pollution Seventyfive per cent of the students in the course are men An idea of the purpose of such courses is provided by the San Diego State programs statement of purpose which declares that the movement is an attempt to repair the damage done to women by the omissions and distortions of traditional education and to illustrate at least one way of releasing the power and potential of more than half the population of this coun try If it hadnt been for wo mens lib protests said Dr Salper from her West Coast office we wouldnt have this program at San Diego Stephanie Serementis a neurobiology major at Cor nell believes there is discrim ination against women stu dents I fight to be recognized In class she said and if Im a success the teacher thinks I must be an excep tion to the female race At San Diego State about 50 male professors recently attacked that schools pro gram as a radical innova tion At Cornell a questionnaire on the issue was distributed to the faculty last spring Half of the 185 who responded supported the program and half opposed it An engineering professor whose name was not dis closed by the university com mented on the questionnaire The idea is slightly absurd Why dont you stop these attempts at fragmentalizing higher education and devote yourself to real scholarship A humanities teacher called the program a disaster Black studies is divisive enough he said Female studies would inevitably be aimed toward political goals which I am far from sharing Other authorities disagree There are compelling rea sons right now for an intel lectual focus on women said Dr Jennie Farley aca demic coordinator for female studies at Cornell Take a problem like the population explosion she said If we are to encourage women to have fewer chil dren we must give them some satisfactory alternatives to being only housewives and mothers Ella Kusnetz a Cornell senior said women studies were valuable to her as a student I wish they had been of fered when I was a fresh man she said Ive never been as interested in academ ics Female studies is a new reference I have some iden tity now as a woman At Douglas College of Rut gers University a womens school a substitute for freshman English is Edu cated Women in Literature a course that concerns the portrayal of women in mod ern American literature The class led by Dr Elaine Show alter 29 recently discussed Mary McCarthys description of women in The Group her novel about eight Vassar graduates The direction the new courses will take is unclear said Florence Howe assist ant professor of English at Goucher College who is con sidered an authority on women studies by faculty members throughout the country Nonetheless she added the courses are multiplying rapidly Title Is Vague Miss Howe is the director of the Modern Language Asso ciations Commission on the Status of Women in the Pro fession which is investigat ing the equality of women teachers She has established a clearing house at Goucher for information on women studies The enrollment of men in the course at Princeton is at least partly a result of its vague title Political Mod ernization Originally I thought the course was about underdevel oped nations said Robert P Thomas a bearded sophomore from Washington It was a complete Shock find out what this was all about Al though I was a bit skeptical I decided it would be a good time to find out what wom ens lib is all about The majority of guys are all for womens lib as re suit of taking the course he said In a recent seminar involv ing nine students eight of whom were men the instruc tor Dr Kay Boals 26 posed a question about Betty Frie dans The Feminine Mys tique Friedan Book Discussed Did you find Friedans argument that theres no such thing as a happy housewife true she asked Of course not replied Mr Thomas But Friedan mentioned there were large numbers of suicides among the house wives she studied argued a classmate In the US women either have to do their thing with grandchildren or go out and get work observed Mr Thomas But so many women over 40 cant get interesting jobs said another student Look its not just women who cant find interesting work asserted Jonathan Winder I worked in a ware house this summer where all these guys did was rip out slips from other forms It may be chauvinistic to say but I dont think women ever had it so good The question isnt to de cide whos oppressed but to end oppression of both men and women said Dr Boals However that man ripping papers has it better than a woman caught in the

Excerpts Frcm the Message by Governor Rockefeller on the State of the State,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/07/archives/excerpts-from-the-message-by-governor-rockefeller-on-the-state-of.html,ALBANY Jan 6Following are ex cerpts from the message by Governor Rockefeller on the state of the state to the Legislature An abbreviated version was delivered on radio and television Five days ago in this chamber I spoke to the people of the unfinished tasks that lie before us and of past achieve ments that enable us to build for the future with a sense of hope Far re moved as fulfillment of our goals still may be the groundwork has been laid That is why in spite of all the difficul ties ahead my inaugural address was message of confidence and hope It reflected my unshakable conviction that there is nothing wrong with Amer ica that courage dedication and love cannot conquer that there is nothing wrong with America that we dont have the human and natural resources to overcome Unfortunately as in all human hopes and ambitions there is one condition attached to this outlooka condition involving the free will of people to re ject partisanship and political division The record in this state during the past 12 years has demonstrated the value of government which holds the common good to be more important than party politics It offers us an ex ample of true cooperation of partner ship between the Legislature the exec utive branch community leaders and the people to make significant advances in serving human needs The actions I propose today are of the highest priority I will submit later to your honorable bodies special mes sages detailing each of the general rec ommendations set forth today In addi tion I will send special messages and recommendations on other important matters including human rights con sumer protection and highway safety There are many other important and desirable programs that will have to be deferred in view of the severe financial situation faced by the state and its local governments For this is a time when a government just like a family must tighten its belt and live within its resources The Fiscal Plight In this connection it is appropriate that I give you a brief review of the states fiscal situation It clearly indi cates the difficulty of meeting the fiscal requirements of even those programs to which the state is already committed Following are the basic facts Under existing legislation state pub lic school aid will increase again in the coming fiscal year by more than 175 million State revenue sharing which was enacted last year to help relieve our hardpressed cities and other local governments will increase the budget by another 200million All other state aid will also increase as required under existing law by more than 400million Last years labor negotiations and previous legislation improving benefits for state employesnecessary to help keep their compensation equitable es pecially in this difficult period of infla tonrequire wage and fringe benefit increases in next years budget of more tan 230million In addition to sustain present state operated programs will require other increases totaling about 300million more These include the states ongoing programs for the care of the mentally ill the operation of the State University and the programs in health and in nar cotics addiction control and rehabilita tion The total of these Will require an in crease of approximately 13billion in the 197172 state budget And all of this is before taking into consideration urgent appeals for addi tional increases in state aid These ap peals include 300million to 1billion of increased aid from the schools and 1billion to 15billion of increased aid from local governments including the Big Six cities Cutting Back Budget Requests Our fiscal outlook is further compli cated by the fact that we are rapidly running out of bond authorizations to meet the capital needs of our people for such services as transportation and housing In the face of this bleak fiscal situation I have already eliminated some 403million from next years budget requests of state department and agency heads for desirable new or ex panded programs Our problem is that the state is al ready giving 63 cents of each tax dollar back to local governments  and New York State and local taxes combined are the highest per capita of any state in the nation We are now reaching the point at which the state and its local governments cannot keep up with the needs for major annual increases in revenues To provide basic services state gov ernments and their communities must get financial help from the Federal Governmentwhich collects twothirds of all our taxes and gives us back only 11 cents of every dollar they collect to help support state and local govern ment Unless we reverse the downward spiral particularly evident in so many of the urban areas we will be faced with a disastrous breakdown of those essential services That is why I have been pressing vigorous continuous campaign for 10billion revenuesharing program of new money from the Federal Govern ment to take effect on July 1 of this yearof which New York State and its local governments would receive ap proximately 1billion In fact two other Governors and met with President Nixon on this sub ject once again only yesterday Later this month the President will deliver his annual State of the Union Message I will defer final decisions on the state financial plan until after the Pres idents message Then we should know more about the course of action the Federal Government may take to avoid a collapse of state and local govern mental services across the nationpar ticularly in the urban areas Though the state financial picture for the moment must necessarily re main incomplete the other major areas for legislative action in the coming year are clear Therefore I will now set forth the following important elements of the Administrations 197172 legislative pro gram I THE ECONOMY Fortunately business and job oppor tunities have been brighter in New York State than in the nation generally De spite some high unemployment areas the economy of the state as a whole showed remarkable stability in 1970 in the face of a national economic slow down A Jobs and Training I have pledged allout state support of a goal of 400000 new jobs in the next four yearsand of the necessary training programs to assure that the people who are available to fill these jobs have the skills to match the de mand 1 A Comprehensive Manpower Agen cy I am asking the Manpower Commis sion to develop a proposal for the crea tion of a comprehensive manpower agency which would carry out or pro vide for the states responsibilites in this vital area and I will again recom mend the necessary appropriation for manpower training and development under the State Manpower Training Act 2 Helping Workers Affected by Defense Cutbacks To provide further help to workers affected by defense cutbacks I will recommend legislation and budg etary action to establish a Relocation Assistance Corporation to guarantee re location loans at reasonable rates to individuals who have lost their jobs due to a defense cutback or other disloca tion 3 Improvements in Social Insurance I shall recommend action to provide early unemployment compensation cov erage for some 400000 employes of nonprofit organizations B Industrial Growth Since 1959 New York States econ omy has been vitalized by 7700 new plants and plant expansions The ac tions we have taken together have contributed immeasurably to this proud record 1 Service Industries I will create new office for service industries in the State Commerce Department to sell service industry employers on the ad vantages of doing business in New York State 2 Corporate Headquarters in New York City I have asked the State Com merce Department to work with the New York City business community to deter the movement of corporate head quarters out of New York City and to determine what such organizations need tb assure their remaining in the city and what can be done to attract additional businesses to establish their corporate headquarters there 3 Power I will recommend legisla tion to expedite the selection and ap proval of sites for new power plants taking into consideration any adverse effects upon the environment II THE INDIVIDUAL Basic to selfrealization and a pro ductive life in our complex modern economy are a good education and the availability of good health care for all A Health A principal objective for this coming year must be the passage of a system of universal health insurance at least in New York State and hopefully on a national basis 1 Financing Medical Care The uni versal health insurance program I will propose will extend a basicbenefit policy to two categories of persons those who have no health insurance at present and those whose present health insurance is inadequate or costs more than they can afford It would also place the payment of the cost on a more equitable basis with employers paying a share of the premiums for employes who currently pay the entire cost A nationwide program is the best ap proach but until the Federal Govern ment acts in this area the health needs of New Yorkers must be met 2 The Health Care Delivery System I will propose legislation authorizing the establishment of nonprofit medical corporations that would permit physi cians to work with hospitals to provide prepaid comprehensive familycentered health care I will recommend additional legisla tive action this year to health facilities such as outpatient clinics and special ized rehabilitation centers Based on a report of the Governors Steering Committee on Social Problems to be available shortly I expect to offer additional measures to increase the supply and availability of health profes sional personnel including physicians I will propose legislation to establish the new medical occupation of physi cians assistants and to promote the de velopment of appropriate education and training programs for this occupation 3 Family Planning The President has set a national goal of making voluntary subsidized family planning assistance available to all citizens by 1975 In order to help meet the Presidents national family planning service goal I am directing the State Health Depart ment to develop detailed plans to avail New York of the Federal assistance appropriated for this purpose 4 Abortion The State Public Health Council has recommended lowering thee maximum period of pregnancy during which an abortion can be performed from the present 24 to 20 weeks I sup port this recommendation I have requested the State Public Health Council to continue reviewing the states experience under the abor tion law to make any further recom mendations to protect the health of women both residents and nonresidents undergoing abortions in this state 5 Health Care for the Elderly I will submit legislation to increase the avail ability of special health services to meet the needs of older people B Mental Health We will continue improvement of staffing at state mental hospitals and institutions Decentralization of large institutions for the mentally ill and retarded into smaller units Gradual modification or replacement of all large older institutions for the re tarded by small new communitybased facilities and Continued development of programs to meet the unique needs of special patient groups such as the senile the chronically ill the adolescent mental patient and the alcoholic C Education Our aim must be to gain control over the relentless rise in educational costs while maintaining the quality that has come to mark all levels of education in this state State School Aid State school aid will be increased by more than 175 million in the state budget for fiscal 197172 But any increase beyond that level will depend importantly on whether the Federal Government will assume larger share of the nations education costs than the 5 per cent of those costs that Washington now provides Second Passage of Blaine Repeal At no point has the future of parochial and other nonpublic schools been more bleak If nonpublic schools fail their students and the cost of their education are added to already overburdened pub lic schools Last year the Legislature approved first passage of the Blaine Amendment repeal and substitution of it by the less restrictive language of the First Amend ment of the Federal Constitution re garding separation of church and state I remain convinced that this amend ment will afford all the constitutional safeguards we need while at the same time giving the state maximum flexibil ity to deal with the educational prob lems and needs of all schoolchildren It will also remove the barrier which now exists between Bundy Aid and many of our private colleges and uni versities which are in dire financial straits Therefore I urge second passage of Blaine repeal by your honorable bodies and approval by the voters next fall Office of Child Development I Will propose the creation of a State Office of Child Development to plan and co ordinate all state efforts to expand day care D Higher Education 1 Expanded Facilities and Aid I will propose continuation of  The expansion plan of the State University Aid to City University of New York under the present 5050 matching aid formula and The Bundy program of state aid to private colleges 2 College Loans I will propose a realistic increase in the maximum amount students may borrow under the Higher Education Assistance Act from the present 7500 to at least 10000 also that students be given more time to repay these loans 3 Community College Health and En vironmental Courses I will propose in centives for the development of new courses in health and environmental careers to be offered in the community colleges 4 Greater Youth Involvement a Youth Clearinghouse I will continue a special effort I have initiated to provide within the executive chamber an ongoing channel of communica tion with the college students of this state b State Student Internship I will also submit legislation to create a student intern program in State government c 18YearOld Vote I also urge sec ond passage of the constitutional amendment lowering the voting age to 18 This action is especially desir able now to assure a full opportunity to vote in this state since the Federal Government has already lowered the voting age to 18 for Federal elections 5 Educational Television I will pro pose legislation to increase state aid to the states educational television sta tions to onethird of their approved operating costs E Welfare 1 Federal Family Assistance Plan will continue to support passage of the national Administrations Family Assist ance Plan with amendments that would recognize and relieve the special prob lems of states like New York which get a disproportionate share of the national welfare migration 2 Duryea Proposal Your distinguished Speaker of the Assembly Perry Duryea has made an excellent proposal in the event the Congress does not pass the Family Assistance Plan for the whole country Speaker Duryea recommends in that case that the Congress at least try out the plan on an experimental basis in one area such as New York City which suffers the nations most serious welfare problems I find this an excellent proposal and it would address itself directly to the understandable objections of Mayor Lindsay over the heavy costs of welfare in New York City brought about to large extent by current Federal welfare policies 3 Federal Welfare Takeover I will also continue to urge gradual Federal takeover of all state and local welfare costs 4 CostofLiving Benefit Increases In order to keep welfare benefits abreast of the increased cost of living I will submit for your consideration the 72 per cent welfare benefit increase recom mended by the State Board of Social Welfare III COMMUNITY LIFE Unfortunately too many of our com munities continue to be trapped in downward spirals of urban decay and breakdown of services This trend must be reversed We must save our urban centers by preserving the incentives for investment in those centers and en couraging the development of viable communities within them A Community Development Article I therefore strongly urge you to give second passage to the community de velopment article of the State Constitu tion and to work together for its ap proval by the voters this fall The new article would allow the state to become a greater catalyst and a closer partner with the private sector and local gov ernment in meeting community needs B Community Development Program and Bond Issue Essential to the success of the re vitalization of our communities will be the capital resources to do the job will therefore submit to your honorable bodies a proposal for a substantial com munity development bond issue for your approval and submission to the voters this fall With the passage of the community development article and the approval of the community development program and bond issue New York State in part nership with local governments and the private sector will be able to breathe new life into deteriorating urban com munities I view the community development article and bond issue together with universal health insurance program as the most important legislative objec tives I am presenting to you today and will address myself to them further in a special message devoted solely to them C Transportation To assure that transportation helps rather than hinders the development of a living environment in the years ahead we must continue to seek to integrate transportation planning more fully into total community development 1 Highways We will continue to build and improve the states system of interurban highways and arterials in the states 62 cities 2 Aviation We must rapidly bring to a head the longdelayed issue of fourth airline jetport serving the New York metropolitan area 3 Financing Mass Transportation We must keep our new transportation attuned to the fact that the states eco nomic future and the wellbeing of its communities are inseparable from its ability to transport people move goods and to develop the necessary facili ties for this in harmony with overall community needs and planning IV CRIME AND NARCOTICS Because of their corrosive effect in the basic fabric of community life the control of crime and narcotics abuse is an absolute necessity in solving the problems of our communities A Crime I am recommending a Safe Streets Act for New York which would author ize state assistance to local govern ments for expansion of police depart ments in order to deal with particular problems I also recommend increased training for police creation of a unit of women in the State Police and strengthened firearms and explosives control I will recommend a substantial in crease in criminal penalties for violation of New Yorks tax laws in order to provide prosecutors with a more effec tive method of reaching those engaged in organized crime at the highest levels who have previously been immune to successful prosecution B The Courts I have asked the Temporary Com mission to Study the Courts to focus immediately on the emergency in New York Citys criminal courts and to pro vide recommendations for effective remedies The administration board of the Judicial Conference has directed that juries in criminal trials be questioned by the judges in each case This pro cedure will speed the selection of juries without limiting the opportunity for prosecution or defense to challenge prospective jurors I will also submit proposals to speed the process of criminal justice by Removing those offenses and other matters that can be effectively handled outside the court system Creating special narcotics courts to try cases involving professional traf ficking in drugs Increasing the number of judges and providing longterm state financing for construction of additional facilities where needed and Gradually increasing state support of the net operating costs of the court system Finally I will submit and vigorously promote adoption of a nofault system of compensating victims of motor vehicle accidents to replace the present slow cumbersome costly and outdated system C Correctional Services I will recommend the establishment of a New York Correctional Services Training Academy to provide specialized training for state and local institutional and field service officers D Narcotics New York has embarked upon the worlds most comprehensive programs for the prevention of drug abuse and for the treatment and rehabilitation of narcotic addicts and drug abusers De spite this massive effortand despite number of notable successeswe are regrettably still immersed in the tragedy of drugs and drug addiction 1 Treatment and Rehabilitation To strengthen our efforts in treatment and rehabilitation I recommend Expansion of the states methadone program and other treatment programs Expansion of the states local youth ful drug abuse program to include in addition to matching funds direct state grants for needy local programs and to enable these programs to treat drug users who are as old as 24 years of age Creation of a Drug Abuse Research Institute to expand basic research in the physiological and psychological fac tors of drug abuse and new methods of treatment prevention and control of drug abuse 2 Preventive Education I recom mend the expansion of existing drug education and guidance programs 3 Law Enforcement In my execu tive budget I will recommend funds for expansion of the Special Narcotics Unit within the Division of State Police so it can cooperate more effectively with the special statewide prosecutor In addition I have directed the statewide prosecutor to establish as his first pri ority the detection and prosecution of organized narcotic rings V ENVIRONMENT A Firm Enforcement I am requesting the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation and the Attorney General to conduct a search ing review of all outstanding antipollu tion orders to determine which indus tries and communities are complying with their timetables for halting pollu tion and which are not and to take prompt action against those failing to do so including the assessment of ap propriately heavy fines B Pure Waters In brief New York States pure waters program involves a total of 42billion in government and indus try expenditure It ranks today as the largest most comprehensive antipollu tion effort ever undertakenanywhere in the world C Air Pollution I will sponsor steppedup action against vehicular industrial and other sources of air pollution I will initiate state enforcement of air pollution laws wherever local enforcement of these laws is inadequate D Solid Wastes Under the states new program of clean streets we are making money available immediately for the major cities to clean upon a crash basis areas blighted by accumulated trash and rubbish To further aid local governments I will propose long term low interest selfliquidating bond financing to help them meet the capital costs of solid waste disposal I will request funds for site location preliminary planning and economic studies by the Environmental Facilities Corporation for the development of regional environmental facilities parks I will propose the elmination of all open dumps and open incinerators by January 1 1973 I will submit legislation requiring a driver to submit proof that a junked vehicle has been properly disposed of before another vehicle can be registered I will propose legislation to ban bill boards on all state highways outside of urban areas VI THE NEED FOR RESPONSIVE FEDERALISM We as a single state can no longer realize our future hopes alone We must recognize that we are all part of a Federal system involving 50 states and a national Government all having reached a point of complete interde pendence and that we can only move ahead together A Federal Action At the Federal level the President and Congress should 1 Adopt a Federal revenue sharing program effective July 1 1971 that will return a minimum of 10billion of new money to state and local govr ernments nationwideincluding a 1 billion share for New York Stateto help support basic local services to the people 2 Enact a major simplification of the existing structure of over 1000 cate gorical Federal aid grants 3 Take over the total responsibility for financing and direction in certain areas of national responsibility such as welfare and health care through a national universal health insurance B State Action At the state level your honorable bodies and executive branch should 1 Continue to support to the maxi mum degree possible the strength and capacity of local governments to meet the needs of those citizens with state aid 2 See that performance standards set by the Legislature in connection with state programs and statesupported services are lived up to In this con nection uniform statewide audits of all levels of local government can make great contribution to efficient and economic administration and use of the taxpayers dollar 3 Assure greater state financial and administrative responsibility for certain services that can no longer be effec tively handled at local government level or by private enterprisemass trans portation is a good example C Local Government Action At the local level of government we must achieve I Simplification of the revenue raising structure of the various levels of local government to remove detri mental overlapping and duplication 2 Simplification of the structure of the various levels of local government in terms of function and jurisdiction 3 A sortingout of functions both from the point of view of financing and of administration among local state and Federal levels of government CONCLUSION The year now before us will be a testing time not alone for our state but for our entire system of Federalism Many local governments particularly in our great cities verge on actual fi nancial collapse And now for the first time the states also find their backs to the financial wall Yet while state and local governments bear most of the nations domestic burdens the Federal Government collects most of the taxes Our Federal system has reached A crucial point We recognize realistically that we as a single state can no longer realize our future hopes alone It is a time ol testing for our national Government Only through the effective joint action of all levels of government working together on a coordinated basis can we effectively meet peoples needs and shape our future

"To Them, Two Children Are Fine, but Three Crowd the World",https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/12/archives/to-them-two-children-are-fine-but-three-crowd-the-world.html,Mrs Shirley Lewis raised two fingers in the Vshaped peace sign yesterday and said she had her own mean ing for the gesture  It means Stop at Two  the slender redhaired wom an said Smiling Mrs Lewis who is the wife of a pediatrics interne was one of four leaders of the New York chapter of Zero Population Growth who met yesterday to talk about the relatively new and rapid ly growing population con trol group Almost 30000 people in 325 chapters throughout the country have joined ZPG since it was founded early in 1969 she said and most of them sport the groups button A blackandwhite number with the letters ZPG sitting on top of what looks like a road map but is actually a statistical graph The graph is supposed to symbolize what will happen if the worlds population con tinues at its present rate such a population explosion would have dire consequences ZPG leaders say or if there is zero population growth a stabilized population Were not against chil dren or babies at all said Peter Decks a 29yearold investment banker from Tux edo Park N Y who has been active in the New York chapter since it was founded a year ago Were just against mo than two  The four leaders sat around a table in the groups drafty unimpressive headquarters a portion of an artists loft on the eighth floor of 722 Broadway The walls are dec orated with graphs charts posters and slogans such as Stop at Two Make Love Not Babies Smaller Fami lies or Bigger Headaches and Anyone Can Have a Baby A Baby A Baby A Baby A Baby Is It Worth Re peating What were saying is that if people stop at two now the population will stabilize by the year 2015 said Judy Senderowitz 28 chairman of the 0member New York chapter who works at head quarters fulltime without pay Surveys show that most couples want three or more children Even if we continue at our present 1 per cent growth rate which demographers say is the lowest since the De pression she added our population will still double in 65 years And that means we will have to double our schools hospitals fire de partments and social serv ices Probably nothing makes ZPG people angrier than to see pictures of large families in advertisements or newspa per and magazine articles When this happens ZPGers fire off irate letters to the advertising agencies and the publications No Difference It doesnt make any dif ference whether the family can support all those children or not said Bonnie Kirk patrick 29 of Manhattan who has been advocating population control ever since her days at Mount Holyoke where she and Miss Sender owitz were classmates The fact is she added the society the world and the environment cant sup port them The open spaces will gradually diminish and so will the food and water supply And Id hate to think about all the pollution ZPG was the brainchild of Richard Bowers a lawyer from Old Mystic Conn It has been especially strong on college campuses and on the West Coast where Dr Paul Ehrlich an entomologist at Stanford University and the author of The Population Bomb is one of its leading advocates Although the ZPG people call their group the only activist population control movement about as radical as theyve gotten so far is to picket for the repeal of laws restricting contraception sterilization and abortion The New York chapter refers women seeking abor tions to the Womens Medical Center 80 Irving Place Supplying Speakers Most of their activities are educational and political such as supplying speakers to groups that want them passing out leaflets on street corners participating in ecological fairs and support ing tax laws that discourage large families Mrs Lewis and Mr Deeks the two married members of the group that met yesterday are childless but said they and their spouses planned to have two children and no more Then if they want more they plan to adopt another ZPG position ZPG is a nonprofit volun teer organization that is fi nanced largely by contribu tions from members Mem bership for one year costs 10 More

containing ZPG educa tional material that had been set up in front of the Museum of Natural History There has also been opposi tion from those who for re ligious reasons are against any interference with human reproduction Some people feel very of fended Miss Senderowitz said They think were in vading into private territory They feel that nobody has the right to talk about how many kids other people should have Mr Deeks nodded Were confronted with thinking that evolved hundreds of years ago when the only way a man could survive was if he had 10 children to help him do the work he said

HIGH COURT RULES WELFARE HOMES MAY BE INSPECTED,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/13/archives/high-court-rules-welfare-homes-may-be-inspected-holds-states-and.html,WASHINGTON Jan 12The Supreme Court ruled today that state and local welfare officials could insist on the right to inspect the homes of welfare recipients and could cut off the benefits of those who refused to let them in In a 6to3 ruling in which Justice Harry A Blackmun de livered his first majority opin ion the Court overturned a lower courts ruling that held that welfare clients had a con stitutional right to bar case workers from entering their homes The lower court had barred New York City and New York State welfare authorities from enforcing an inspection rule similar to rules in effect in most other statesthat required the parents of dependent children to let caseworkers into their homes to check on their eligibil ity to receive payments Caseworker Not a Sleuth Justice Blackmuns opinion rejected the threejudge Federal District Courts ruling that such visits were searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amend ments prohibition against un reasonable searches and sei zures The caseworker is not a sleuth but rather we trust is a friend in need Justice Black mun said He added One who dispenses purely private charity naturally has an interest in and expects to know how his charitable funds are utilized and put to work The public when it is the provider rightly expects the same The dissentersJustices Wil liam O Douglas Thurgood Mar shall and William J Brennan Jr said that the ruling violated the spirit of a 1967 Supreme Court ruling that held fire and housing inspectors could not demand the right to search business premises without a search warrant The difference they asserted is that welfare recipients are the lowly poor 1969 Case at Issue Justice Douglas charged that a result was to use the force of the governments largess to buy up constitutional rights from poor people He asked if the outcome would have been the same if the recipient of public funds had been a prominent affluent cotton or wheat farmer receiving benefit payments for not growing crops The case arose in 1969 after Mrs Barbara James of New York City had refused to let a city caseworker visit her home in connection with welfare pay ments that were being made for the support of her 2yearold son Maurice She offered to supply any desired information but welfare officials decided to cut off her payments She challenged that action in court suing both the city and state officials with the aid of Mobilization for Youth legal services and the Columbia Cen ter on Social Welfare Policy and Law The threejudge court ruled 2 to 1 that welfare offi cials could not cut off any re cipients benefits for refusing home visits City and state welfare regula tions in New York State require that home visits be made by caseworkers at least once every three months for those receiv ing home relief veterans assist ance or aid to dependent chil dren Visits are required at least once every six months to the aged blind and disabled Who get public assistance Justice Blackmuns opinion stressed that a major purpose of the visits in the case at issue was to protect children as well as to detect fraud He noted that Mrs James had been bellig erent and uncooperative and that her child was known to have suffered a fractured skull a dent in the head and a pos sible rat bite A sixjudge majority is one that is becoming familiar as the Burger Court has begun to move toward a more conserva tive alignment Justice Black mun was joined by Chief Jus tice Warren E Burger and Jus tices Hugo L Black John M Harlan Potter Stewart and Byron R White The following developments also took place today in the Supreme Court In a 72 decision the Court limited the tactics that con struction unions may employ It held that the TaftHartley Acts prohibition against secondary boycotts forbade strikes against a contractor to get him to make a subcontractor change his labor policies The decision against the International Union of Operating Engineers modi fied a lower courts holding that the only forbidden pres sures were those aimed at severing the relationship be tween a contractor and his sub contractor The Court was asked to hold that women have a consti tutional right to abortion upon demand In arguments over the constitutionality of the District of Columbias antiabortion law Norman Dorsen a New York lawyer said that the High Court would be plagued with abortion cases until it ruled that the Constitution gave women the right to decide whether or not to bear children A New York lawyer Ste phen Grant asked the Justices to hold that victims of uncon stitutional searches might sue the offending policemen for damages Arguing in the case of Webster Bivens a Bronx man whose home was searched by Federal narcotics agents act ing without a search warrant Mr Grant declared that the Supreme Courts present policy of excluding evidence obtained by illegal searches was not enough to deter illegal conduct by lawenforcement officials State Agency Gratified A spokesman for the State Department of Social Services said the agency was extremely gratified by the outcome of the welfare homeinspection case He said that the practice was not to make unwarranted visits to welfare recipients At the citys Human Re

MEDICAL FREEDOM URGED FOR MINORS,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/15/archives/medical-freedom-urged-for-minors-bill-would-allow-abortions-without.html,An official of Planned Parent hood of New York City called yesterday for enactment of pro posed state legislation that would give minors the right to obtain medical careincluding contraception and abortion without parental consent Alfred F Moran executive vice president of the family planning organization said that some of the most urgent health needs of young people were in the areas of pregnancy vene real disease and drug abuse needs which many youngsters are unable to discuss with their parents Mr Moran urged that the Legislature pass a law that would specifically permit li censed facilities and practition ers to furnish care to any per son under the age of 21 who requests it without parental consent if in the physicians judgment the failure to meet a health need could result in a serious health hazard A bill to this effect freeing doctors dentists and health facilities of liability in such cases has been filed by As semblyman Albert Blumenthal Democrat of Manhattan Mr Blumenthal is expected to modify his bill to include minors over the age of 13 Who Is a Minor Noting wide discrepancies in the definition of a minor Mr Moran asserted that in New York State a young person could buy contraceptives at the age of 16 a girl could legally consent to intercourse at the age of 17 and a girl could get married without parental per mission at the age of 18 What do our legislators think happens between age 16 when youngsters can buy con traceptives and age 17 when a girl can say yes to sex Mr Moran asked Practice with dolls Although there is no law re quiring physicians to obtain pa rental consent before treating a minor many doctors and insti tutions insist on parental con sent for fear of malpractice suits or assault charges According to Mrs Harriet Pil pel lawyer for Planned Parent hood in most cases these fears are illfounded since she said there has never been a judg ment in the United States against a doctor or hospital which rendered medical serv ices to a minor over the age of 15 Mr Moran and Mrs Pilpel addressed a conference of 250 representatives of hospitals medical groups clinics and so cial services at the Carnegie Endowment Center The confer ence was sponsored by the Fam ily Planning Resources Center a part of Planned Parenthood Miscarriage Case Cited The confusion that can re sult from the current indefinite medicolegal situation is typi fied Mr Moran said by the case of a 17yearold girl who two weeks ago was told at a municipal hospital that she needed parental consent before they could treat her following a miscarriage That hospital has a policy as do all municipal hospitals that enables it to provide abor tions to 17yearolds without parental consent Mr Moran noted But the hospital denied this youngster service because the D an C [dilation and cu rettage] she acquired for the miscarriage was not for the purposes of abortion but for gynecological treatment and parental consent would be re quired In a recent case in Califor nia a hospital refused an abor tion to an unmarried 20year oldwho already had one childbecause her mother would not give consent The requirement for parental consent before a teenager can receive medical services often has the effect of corrupting young people and undermining integrity ntegrity Mr Moran as serted It encourages teen agers to lie about their age to forge parents signatures or claim marriage when no mar riage exists Parents on the Spot He said it also often put par ents on the spot asking them to sanction behavior they could not openly condone such as a mother who was asked to consent to the providing of contraceptive devices to her 16yearold Although the requirement for parental consent has been jus tified as a means of protecting the minor in practice it com monly has exactly the opposite effect Mr Moran asserted

Music,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/17/archives/dear-uncle-the-allowance-you-send-isnt-enough.html,THERE was an interesting head line in the lead story of the Jan 5 edition of the Wall Street Journal Increased Federal Aid in Home Mortgage Field Nears Take over Point In the Jan 11 Newsweek there was a story about the Federal Government galloping to the aid of the Lockheed Aircraft Corp Deputy Defense Secretary David Packard said the story carefully refrained from dis closing the total cost of his plan to the nations taxpayers but outside es timates ranged from 750million to 14billion Good old private enter prise  Government money goes into high ways and the cost of a superhighway these days is from 2530 million a mile Government money subsidizes the American farmer to the tune of an annual 35billion The maritime in dustry will get under the new Merchant Marine Act a throatswallowing 27 billion The airlines get around 100 million excluding the SST program which is asking for 277million Oil and other mineral industries benefit thanks to depletion allowances an in direct subsidy by some 13billion The bill for Federal help in home owner ship which is subsidized by deduction for interest runs about 6billion And now the Partnership for the Arts is getting ready to ask Congress for full funding for the National En dowment for the Arts Full funding for the next fiscal year starting July would be 30million Peanuts  Partnership for the Arts is the dream child of Amyas Ames head of Lincoln Center and he as yet does not know exactly what to make of it I never thought Id he in the politics of the arts he said a few days ago look ing as mildly bewildered as an exWall Streeter Kidder Peabody can ever look This is all something new The arts have never pulled together before never lobbied before It started about two years ago when the presidents of the five major Ameri can orchestras came together to discuss mutual problems This led to a na tional committee of orchestra presi dents Then Ames got involved in the drive for the funding of the New York State Arts Council and that gave him even more to think about  In this drive leaders in all of the arts got together and worked out a plan to put pressure on the State legis lators Museum directors conductors musicians dancers artistsall worked in their locality exhorting residents to write to Albany It was a high pres sure campaign and it worked says Ames Letters kept piling up on the legislators desks The issue created more response than even the abortion bill Albany came through with an 18 million appropriation This came to about a dollar per citizen of New York State It was a bigger sum than the Federals 15million for the National Endowment It was bigger than all of the state arts councils put together Why not Ames reasoned try to do across the country what the citizens of New York State did He believes that the time is ripe People are so deeply upset by negative trends in American life that they want to do something positive They are ready to act Ames went around the country talk ing to concerned people who were in volved with the arts He organized a working committee of men and women that represented all areas of the United States That committee in turn was to stir up local interest and apply pres sure to appropriate sources notably Washington Were a direct lobby Ames says and were taking direct aim at the 50 members of the House Appro priations Committee At first Ames was thinking of a na tional lobby of the arts that would ask Congress for 200million He was talked out of that as not being prac tical Ames has by no means forgotten his 200million and it is the sum that Partnership for the Arts will eventually shoot for But right now all he and his group want to do is get Appropriations to give full funding for the next fiscal year to the National Endowment for the Arts Full funding would be 30 million  In President Nixons budget for the last fiscal year the National Endow ment was down for 20million The House Appropriations Committee re duced that sum to 15million If Ap propriations follows precedent the 30 million for the next fiscal year will be reduced by an equivalent or even greater amount When the President signed the original grant for the Na tional Endowment it called for a three year steppedup appropriation 20 milion 30million and 40million There is a feeling in many suspicious circles that Government money for the arts is primarily used to subsidize the big Establishment organizations Part nership for the Arts will try to make it clear that the reverse will be true that any money obtained will be used pri marily for community effort the idea being to get music into the schools or to get people into the concert halls through lowpriced concerts All Ameri can orchestras would love to establish working groups within the orchestras themselves that would go into the field as chamber organizations Museum di rectors and drama companies also have ideas about community work In any case Government money that is lobbied through by Partnership for the Arts will be administered and disbursed by the National Endowment for the Arts Were starting the fight after the Presidents budget message on Jan 22 Ames says If we get the public surge I believe is there well break the log jam One hopes so There is a growing feeling among those responsible for funding the arts in America that they now are asking for no more than their due that the Government in the last dec ade has gotten the arts and American life in general into an awful mess and that its up to the Government to do something about it What with infla tion restrictive legislation and a pe culiar hierarchy of priorities the Gov ernment has brought the arts in Amer ica to a crisis As one fundraiser for cultural endeavor puts it The Govern ment has reached into our till Now Government has the obligation of doing something about it  It was only a decade or so ago that leaders in the arts tended to flee any hint of Government subsidy This would be creeping Socialism or worse But times have changed and subsidy is no longer a dirty word Nor is anybody going to accuse such Establishment fig ures as Ames and the other members of his boarda board that includes C Douglas Dillon in New York Judson Bemis in Minneapolis William B Bur kenroad Jr in New Orleans George C Seybolt in Boston and Philip S Boone in San Franciscoof being creeping Socialists The capitalists of Lockheed who are asking the Government to bail them out are not being called creep ing Socialists The farmers who accept subsidy do not consider themselves creeping Socialists What is not generally realized is that the arts in America are a 2billion annual operation and if Lockheed can go to the Government asking over 750 million to pay for its mistakes and get it the 30million that Partnership for the Arts is asking is a modest figure indeed As its longterm goal of 200 million is
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/17/archives/doctors-to-get-them-to-where-they-are-needed-most.html,WASHINGTON  The United States today is suffering from a poor distribution of doctorsand it is as acute in Manhattans teeming Upper West Side as it is in the tiny town of Kirkland cradled in the rolling cornfields of Illinois Its not that New York and Illinois are short of doctors They have more doc tors per residents than most oth er states The problem is that these doctors are poorly distrib uted In Kirkland the 1000 towns people chipped in 40000 to build and equip a clinic that was made available free of charge to any physician But the towns sixyear search for a doctor has been fruitless and the clinic is being used as day care center for migrant children Weve just about giv en up looking says Mrs Edwin L Johnson The situation on the Upper West Side in New York City is different For years the number Of doctors was adequate But after World War II the middle class began moving out of the neighborhood and it lost its at tractiveness to young physicians In the past 20 years almost no young doctors have set up prac tice in the area and many of the physicians who were there have died retired or moved to the more affluent suburbs The situation in both these areas is replicated again and again throughout the country and translates in human terms as higher death and sickness rates One of the major reasons why the United States the worlds wealthiest nation is not one of the healthiest is because of these gaps in its patchwork medical care system But change seems to be in the offing On New Years Eve President Nixon signed a mea sure that would help attract doc tors to Kirkland and the Upper West Side The program called the Emergency Health Personnel Act of 1970 would recruit doc tors dentists nurses and other health professionals into the Pub lic Health Service Instead of serving with the National Institute of Health the Indian Health Service the Coast Guard or the Communicable Di sease Center as most Public Health Service officers do these doctors would directly dispense medical services to persons liv ing in rundown urban areas and rural regions including per haps Kirkland and the Upper West Side This is a radical de parture from the traditional con duct of American medicine In the past only select groups of people such as veterans Indi ans the military and merchant seamen were entitled to care from Federal medical personnel The new program would at a cost of 60million over the next twoandahalf years pay the salaries for perhaps several thousand professionals who would work in small teams of from two to six members State health agencies and local medi cal societies would invite the teams into areas where services have been inadequate Why should a young doctor enter such a program that pays say 12000 a year when he could make 1000 a day performing abortions in private hos pitals in New York City Part of the reason would be an ex emption from the military doc tors draft which is even more odious to most physicians than regular conscription is to most teenagers Another reason would be the increased spirit of social activism on the part of young doctors paralleling that of other members of their generation Many young doctors increasing ly complain that a medical de gree has merely become a li cense to print money This group is spearheading demands that medicine live up to its social responsibilities by dispensing better health care to those who need it most the poor and the alienated

Sterilization Is An Answer for Many,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/18/archives/sterilization-is-an-answer-for-many.html,Not long ago people who talked about sterilization usually found themselves huddled in a corner some where speaking in hushed tones Men associated the operation with castration Women felt it would make them less of a woman Then came the problems with The Pill coupled with the decline of American puri tanism and the growing public awareness of the pop ulation explosion All of a sudden steriliza tion no longer seemed so horrible Almost 2 million Ameri cans of childbearing age have had sterilization opera tions as their method of permanent contraception ac cording to the Association for Voluntary Sterilization 14 West 40th Street Requests by Men The AVS says that al most 100000 persons a year are requesting the operations and that 78 per cent of them are men A few years ago most of the patients were women To us sterilization is the Cadillac of birth control methods said John R Rague executive director of AVS And abortion is the Volks wagen Those who have had the operation are finally talking about it At cocktail parties in the suburbs on television talk shows Arthur Godfrey who has had the operation is probably the bestknown advocate at feminist meet ings at singles weekends at Catskills resorts Some men who have un dergone the operation known as a vasectomy are even sporting gold pins that they bought for 1 from the AVS The pin is in the shape of the medical symbol for the male except that there is a split in it The word vasectomy is written at the bottom Not Militant I dont go out of my way to talk about sterilization Im not a militant proselyt izer said Richard Lemkin 29 years old of Brooklyn an administrative aide with the Population Council But if people are talking about birth control and the trouble with pills Ill mention it Mr Lemkin who is mar ried and has two children age 5 and 3 said he and his wife decided he should have the operation because they were dissatisfied with the available methods of contra ception He had the 15minute oper ation at the Margaret Sanger Research Bureau clinic 17 West 16th Street on a Friday afternoon rested at home over the weekend and re turned to work on Monday The operation he said gave him only slight pain Has his sex life been af fected by the operation Its the same as before he said smiling and the plus is that we have no more anxieties about whether we goofed According to the AVS 15 vasectomy clinics have sprung up throughout the country in the last two years There are two in New York the Sanger clinic and one at the Downstate Medical Cen ter 450 Clarkson Avenue Brooklyn A vasectomy which costs between 50 and 150 is al most always done in a clinic or doctors office under a local anesthetic It involves cutting the tubes vas def erens that carry the sperm The operation does not in terefere with a mans ability to have an erection or ejacu lation but the semen con sperm Short Stay For the woman the pro cedure called a salpingec tomy or tubal ligation in volves cutting and tying the tubes that carry the eggs This can be done through a small abdominal incision or by the vaginal approach A threetofive day stay in a hospital is usually involved The operation which costs from 150 to 300 does not hormone production In a few cases the opera tions can be reversed for both men and women and fertility restored by the re joining of the severed tubes But the success rate of those procedures is disputed most physicians think 30 per cent is the most realistic figure and patients are often told to consider their operations permanent Some people and some doctors have the mistaken belief that the operations are illegal Actually sterilization is as legal as a tonsillectomy in almost every state Only Utah requires reasons of medical necessity Still many doctors espe cially those of the Roman Catholic faith refuse to do the operation Religious con siderations and fear of mal practice suits seem to be the major stumbling blocks Many hospitals are also re luctant to allow the opera tions and have sterilization committees that rule on who should have the operation Some use the 120 for mula which means that no woman could be sterilized unless her age multiplied by the number of children equals 120 Thus a 37yearold mother of three would be denied the operation because three times 37 equals 111 while if the woman were 40 she would be granted the operation It took Mrs Betty Gon zales 38 of Pine Brook N J 18 months to find a hospital that would allow her to be sterilized A registered nurse she decided she wanted a tubal ligation at the age of 29 after she had given birth to her sixth child in seven years I knew the male operation was simpler the robust pleasantfaced woman said but I thought I should have the operation because my husband was still young too If something happened to our marriage I didnt want to deny him the right to have more children I was sure I didnt want any more Nowadays she isnt wor ried about anything happen ing to her marriage She and her husband Manuel a truck driver are happier than ever she said some thing that wasnt true back in the days when their birth control methods condoms and diaphragms kept failing F Wayne King curator of the department of herpetol ogy at the Bronx Zoo said he decided to get a vasec tomy after he traveled to the jungles of Asia and Africa and found that the animals and the wilderness were dis appearing Its all linked directly to the population explosion he said I felt that if I was going to go around talking about population problems then Id better set a good example He and his wife Sherry who live in an apartment in the Zoo grounds have no children If they ever decide to have a family he said they will adopt Not everybody I know approves of an operation like mine he said Our whole population is geared to hav ing children and people be gin to raise eyebrows if you dont fill your household full of children Still Has Beard Mr King said he didnt feel that his masculinity had been threatened by his vas ectomy I still have my deep voice and my beard Ile said stroking his lush facial hair Some people have had to resort to radical tactics in order to get the operation Mrs Geraldine Pipkin 35 of Paterson N J tried to com mit suicide by turning on all the gas jets in ber oven before a hospital committee would approve her request And Sandra Moseley 27 of Elmhurst Queens had to threaten that she would be come a Lesbian unless she got a tubal ligation Mrs Pipkin who is the wife of a bowling alley man ager the mother of seven and black scoffs whenever she hears black militants condemn sterilization on the grounds that it is a form of genocide for black people Its a much greater sin to have too many children and not he able to provide for them she said Miss Moseley a redhaired handwriting analyst said she had trouble getting the operation because she was divorced and the mother of only one child One day I found myself pregnant again even though I had been taking The Pill every day she said She finally found a gynecologist who would give her an abor tion but it wasnt untill Miss Moseley threatened to be come a Lesbian that the doc tor agreed to do a tubal ligation at the same time Hospitals Picketed An active feminist Miss Moseley recently formed a militant prosterilization group called Foresight which pickets doctors and hospitals that refuse to do the oper ations She said that many people had asked her how she could be sure at the age of 27 that she never wanted to have another child She tells them For the same reason that I have rejected a career as a baseball player I just have no interest in baseball The Rev Rodney Shaw 53 director of the Depart ment of Population Problems of the United Methodist Church said he was steri lized 16 years ago when peo ple didnt talk about such things He and his wife have three children I think that when a couple have enough children he said the man has the moral obligation to take care of birth control In fact when he speaks to United Methodist womens groups on population con trol he often tells them to rush home and inform their husbands Its your turn and dont come back to the bedroom until youve done something Malpractice Suits Mr Shaw advocates mal practice suits against doctors and hospitals that refuse to perform the operations for people who want them Such suits have had some success To those who say that having children is Gods will and that the human reproductive process should not be inter fered with he replies It is not Gods will that we continue to live like rab bits Our planet faces disas ter unless we stop popula tion growth Anyone who knows what our uncontrolled birth rate will do and still has more children is sinning against God and man What about the passage in the Bible that says Be fruitful and multiply Yes okay God weve done that Mr Shaw

and Senate sessions a week might seek to raise their salaries or at least their expense stipends this year Legislators now make 15 000 a year and are given lulus  a lump sum in lieu of a detailed accounting of expenses  of 3000 a year It is a touchy subject this year because of the grim portrayals of the states fis cal situation that have been repeatedly given by Governor Rockefeller A group the Temporary State Commission to Review the Salary and Compensation of Members of the Legislature and the Judi ciary is studying the matter But the chairman of the 15man commission Warren Wakeman Clute Jr president of the Watkins Salt Company in Watkins Glen so far will say only Theres no infor mation to be published at this time One prominent legislator said that a pay increase was under serious consideration because a lot of us work very hard at this job and are hurting financially He said that there was talk of replac ing the lulu with an allow ance of 40 to 50 a day and of raising the salaries to 20 000 to 25000 a year Legislators cannot raise their own salaries during session Thus if an increase is voted it would not take effect until 1973 when a newly elected Legislature is

"Woman's Role in Society Is Troubling Soviet, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/25/archives/womans-role-in-society-is-troubling-soviet-too-womans-role-in.html,MOSCOW Jan 24Soviet women who are expected to do everything from digging ditches to producing babies are grumbling these days about job discrimination male chauvinism and lack of concern by Soviet authori ties The result according to one demographer is the de velopment of a womens question in the Soviet Un ion Why has the idea of real emancipation of women still not emerged victorious in the public consciousness of both men and women Sociologists are warning the authorities that the dis satisfaction of many women with their status in society is a contributing cause if not the major one for the sharp drop in the birth ratefrom 249 per thousand in 1960 to 17 in 1969 the last year for which statistics are avail able Newspapers and maga zines regularly print letters and articles related to the womens question One woman writes that there must be 24hour nur series so that women can hold on to jobs Another says bonuses should be paid women with children to al low them to quit work A man from Kharkov com plains that because his wife is so busy with the house hold chores and her job she cannot make him a meal so he has become an alcoholic The revolution freed us a middleaged woman said so that we can work hard er than men Many of the problems are similar to those faced by women in the United States and other Western countries where the womens libera tion movement is active But there is no comparable organized movement in the Soviet Union and in deed some of the problems are different For instance Soviet wom en have no quarrel with the present rules on voluntary abortion which is the main birth control method They do complain about prefer ence given to men in many fields of work and the para dox of public thinking as a result of which women are considered mens equals in doing heavy manual work but men generally refuse to do an equal share of house hold chores Sociologists report the dif ficulties that a woman faces in holding a fulltime job running a household and hav ing a family The pressures often result in family dis putes a growing number of divorces and the birthrate problem Despite recommendations by scholars and by the wom en themselves nothing seems to be done to ease the prob lem There are probably no easy answers Women make up 50 per cent of the work force Many typically female jobs are the least attractive paving streets picking up garbage digging holes Oth ers such as teaching medi cine and scientific work are more gratifying but even where women make up most of the workers a man is usually in charge Lidiya T Litvinenko a demographer interviewed in the latest issue of Zhurnalist the journalists magazine says it is no secret that fac tory directors prefer to give better jobs to men out of concern that women often have to leave to take care of children Women she says are faced with a choice either to have a child or have a career  and most these days choose the latter Many men would like to put the women back in the kitchen and restore an old fashioned family environ ment But Miss Litvinenko says this is not acceptable to women They want jobs that interest them and they do not want to be dependent on their husbands salaries She acknowledges that some women share the pre vailing male outlook on a womens role but she main tains that they are either naive or hypocritical Moreover sociologists point out that the Soviet economy already short of workers could not function if a sub stantial number of women quit the work force They also say that a husbands salary alone is often not enough to make ends meet She Rarely Goes Out One of the mosttalked about pieces of writing in the last year is a short story A Week Like Any Other written by Natalya Baranskaya a laboratory worker who relates the cri sis of a young married wom an driven to nervous ex haustion by the burdens of keeping a job taking care of two small children and remaining attractive to her husband Her heroine like many women in real life is con stantly tired and rarely gets time to see a movie or read a book She is teased by her coworkers because she has two children while virtually none of her friends have more than one The trend toward a one child family is so common now in the European parts of the Soviet Union that it is the prime concern of the demographers A sociologist writing in the youth newspaper Kom somolskaya Pravda said he was upset by the view of many youths who he said are opposed to having chil dren because they regard them as a burden He reminded his readers that unless many families had at least two children and many three children society would not reproduce itself and the country would face more severe manpower shortages There already is a labor shortage in big cities and in areas with an inhospitable environment such as Siberia Zoya A Yankova a so ciologist working for the Academy of Sciences Insti tute of Social Research is a specialist on womens prob lems and her findings as published recently by the academy seem to verify what most Russians believe is the case On the basis of interviews in Moscow Leningrad and Penza she said that the So viet woman on the average has to spend more time six hours  on household chores than she did 40 years ago the figure was four hours then Much of the extra work she said is the result of an almost complete abdication of men from household work and a discernible switch in Soviet families from patriar chal to matriarchal If earlier the obligations of women in the home were limited mainly to preparing meals housecleaning and laundry etc she said now their basic duties have also become the upbringing of children supervising their activities visiting childrens institutions shopping for the home including major purchases organizing the leisure time of the family and other not specifically womens obligations in the old patriarchal family Women in other words not only have to fulfill their traditional obligations but have new ones demanding extra energy and increasing the amount of time spent on work outside of their jobs Part of the extra energy is spent traveling between home and job Because so much of the new housing available to new families is on the outskirts of urban areas many women travel as much as an hour and a half each way with ad ditional time spent in shop ping along the way Babysitting an Issue In the past Miss Yankova said women could count on their mothers or mothersin law to help out with chil dren and household work But the improvement in housing conditions has al lowed the two generations to live apart and many grandmothers are no longer eager to work fulltime as babysitters and cleaning women at home Maids and regular baby sit ters are difficult to find be cause factories and stores offer better wagesas much as 80 to 90 rubles a month for unskilled help  com pared with the 50 rubles that a maid might receive A ruble is 110 at the offi cial rate Despite promises of ex panded services Miss Yan kova found only a third of the women in the survey ever sent clothes to the dry clean er and then only two or three times a year In Moscow where the standard of living is higher than in the rest of the coun try only 15 per cent of the women have washing ma chines 37 per cent refrigera tors and 20 per cent vacuum cleaners the survey showed Women Are Often Tired Because of the lack of hu man or mechanical help Miss Yankova said a sig nificant part of those polled replied Often to the ques tion Are you often tired Eighty per cent of those polled said their free time was limited to watching tele vision or sleeping Only 20 per cent said they went to the movies or the theater or entertained on a regular ba sis Many women said their lives would be easier if there were better nursery centers About half of those polled said they were dissatisfied with the nurseries A major complaint is the rule that if a child catches a cold or some other illness he must go home and this means the mother must take sick leave to care for the child Miss Litvinenko said places of employment should pro vide nurseries and day schools that would keep sick children thereby allowing the mother to stay at work and encourage her to have more children About 80 per cent of the women questioned by Miss Yankova said a woman should take care of children up to the age of 3 since in the nurseries they often get sick But Soviet law pro vides only one years leave of absence Many women would also like to work part time to al low more time with children Miss Yankova said but Miss Litvinenko said in fact most women do not want to work less than full time Officialdom Challenged Many sociologists seem to recognize that their rather frank criticisms of the status of women in Soviet society run counter to the frequent official boasts that women have equality under Commu nism To give the complaints ide ological justification some sociologists have quoted free ly from Lenins comments on the subject Miss Yankova re minded her readers that he said Very few men even those from the proletariat have considered how much they would lighten the burdens and cares of their wives or even to relieve them of them completely  if they would help in womens work But no this would be against the rights and dignity of man He demands that he has his rest and comfort The house hold life of the woman is a daily sacrifice of herself as a victim to thousands of petty things The old right of male supremacy continues to exist in concealed forms

The Man Claire Wanted to Kill,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/07/archives/the-man-claire-wanted-to-kill-the-man-claire-wanted-to-kill.html,GOOD GOD I dont want to be a symbol of womens liberation The words are softandserious and somehow incongruous They come from Claire Bloom an epit ome of femininity if there ever was one Claire Bloom Mother lover bra wearer makeup bearer and such superb actress that her current Broad way portrayal of Nora the giddy fluttery sexobject wife who finally walks out on her mile chauvinist hus band in Ibsens A Dolls House has brought her instant association with the womens lib movement And now the lady sitting in the drawing room of her East 62d Street duplex doth protesteven though top lib leaders like Betty Friedan got freebies for opening night That was the producers idea and he just happens to be Miss Blooms husband Hillard Oh Calcutta Elkins who describes him self as the opportunist of the family Im just not a political animal Miss Bloom says in her delicate British ac cent and I dont like it when people in the audience become political in that last scene where Nora confronts her husband Torvald [played by Donald Madden] Weve had one Right On and thats quite enough Some men were even hissing But its something much bigger than that Its about human free dom and dignity I think Ibsen would agree A group of Norwegian feminists once asked him to speak in the late 1880s and he refused saying he wasnt talking about human rights but about human dignity In that last scene the most wonderful miracle happens Two grown human souls come together and recognize each other and meet as them selves as totally honest and free souls Thats the miracle But there are certain things I like about the movement she goes on Abortion    and equal pay for equal jobs The Pill is womens liberation And there should be child care for women who want to work and cant afford nurse as I can But when it comes to womens rights in the bedroom I think things should stay just as they are And lets face it acting is probably the only profession where there Is no sex discrimination Ive been earning living in it since I was 14 and Ive never been discriminated against Actresses are totally equal and many times theyre a lot better off than men There have been instances though Once when I was 19 a man terribly well placed in England asked me to marry him He told me Id have to give up my career That kind of thing has happened only a few times but when it has Ive wanted to kill This wouldbe killer looks more like an angel Although now approaching that dreaded age of 40 Id rather be 31 or 34 Miss Bloom is still as radiant as a tea rose her features almost as perfect as the young Garbos Her eyes are a velvety brown and her flawless fair skin is wrinklefree She tends to come across as Miss Pristine but at the same time you get the feeling that she would Iike to break out of that goodygood image  like the Victorian miss who sheds her clothes on the Salem commercial There will be some break ing out of that image on Feb 17 when Miss Bloom plays the bitchy domineer ing Hedda in Hedda Gab ler which will alternate with A Dolls House at the Playhouse Hedda is a much more difficult demanding part Miss Bloom says Her motives are diffuse whereas Noras are very clear Nora is an entirely feminine wo man and the one thing she and Torvald had in common was a terribly happy sex life That was the one thing that kept them happy and jump ing around all the time Hed da on the other hand was destroyed before the play be gan She was the favorite daughter and so tremendous ly spoiled Ive spoken to a psychoanalyst about her and I think shes terribly frigid  and basically a homosex ual Some theater buffs were taken aback when they learned that the shrewd El kins who has made a mint from the nudie Oh Calcut ta was going to bring the two Ibsen plays to West 48th Street We wanted to do something together he says while his wife is being pho tographed in another room A Dolls House has got some stuff in it that could have been written yesterday afternoon and the casts of the two plays are abso lutely interchangeable We will do very well  but no ones going to get rich We have a 12week season that can be extended Maybe then well take the plays to London Or maybe we could sell them to The Movie of the Week on television that is if we could find one of those TV guys who can What was it like working with an actress who is also his wife Its been a gas he says Whats that Miss Bloom straining to hear calls from the other room Im going to take gas her husband calls back laughing The Elkins live in an apart ment above his office with Miss Blooms 10yearold daughter Anna who strongly resembles her father Rod Steiger The apartment is startlingly opulent especially the Victorian living room with its huge painting of Na poleon over the mantel red velvet draperies red velvet couches and black and white marble floor I should have been a fag designer Elkins says gleefully The couple was married in August 1969 shortly after Miss Bloom was divorced from Steiger to whom she fondly referred during their 10year marriage as my monster There have been rumors of bitterness between them and one gossip column said they recently sat at ad joining tables at Sardis and didnt speak a word to each other Theres no bitterness on my side Miss Bloom says after Elkins has left the room We talk on the phone about Anna but Rod just doesnt want to see me He and Anna are very close He sees her whenever hes in New York and on holi days and at Christmas He told me on the phone Good luck on the play Hes a very very sweet man and we had some marvelous years together But I dont think we should make a big thing out of being old friends You know I know some peo ple who think its so civilized when first husbands and sec ond husbands act like old friends and see each other all of the time But to me it seems incestuous    and From Miss Blooms tone it sounds as though there might have been a bit of the doll wife life of Nora in her mar riage to Steiger Thats much too personal she says lowering her eyes to the floor Every woman has played this game to one de gree or another And its a very shameful game for both husband and wife The most appalling thing is the hypo critical things men and wo men play played and prob ably will play to the end of time I had a tremendous hor ror as a child of being a housewife and nothing else she goes on I always felt my mother could have been more I think if she were born now shed be more than she is But I dont think my daughter Anna could possi bly think that being a house wife is all there is How could she living in this crazy house with Hilly and me and hav ing a father who is such an interesting man Although she was born in London Miss Bloom lived with her mother and brother for a year and a half in Forest Hills Queens during World War II because Ed ward Bloom an ad man thought New York would be safer for his family than Eng land during the blitz But Claire her mother and bro ther were miserable They lived on charity in a rented single room Mr Bloom couldnt send them any mon ey because of the embargo on the British pound and in Forest Hills they encount ered antiSemitism for the first time in their lives Back they went to the blitz At the age of 12 Miss Bloom won a scholarship to the Guildhall School of Drama and after seven years of doing juvenile leads and Shakes pearean women she got what must rank as one of the big gest breaks in movie his tory Charlie Chaplin chose her in 1950when she was only 19to be his leading lady in Limelight All of a sudden she was a movie star and Prince Nicholas of Yugoslavia was taking her to lunch and the paparazzi were hounding her to pose for cheesecake and she was snapping back Im not sup posed to be Betty Grable Thrilling yes But not The Greatest Thrill That came two years later in 1952 when she played Juliet in London and almost single handed saved the Old Vic from financial disaster Once as a child she had seen Norma Shearer do the same part on the screen and it was then and there that she decided to become an actress Its the most marvelous part she says beaming There are not that many great parts for women and Juliet has everything Miss Bloom has worked ex tensively on the boards on the silver screen and on The Tube but it is the theater that she loves best Quite honestly Ive always been more successful there she says I love the life I love going to the theater my dressing room the contact with the audience and the show going differently every night I never expected to make movies Its been a bo nus Some of the movies Ive done have been very good like Look Back in Anger and The Spy Who Caine In From the Cold But there have been some big mistakes too Rod and I never should have made The Illustrated Man We thought it was going to be very special    but it just wasnt And there were two others that I did only because I was broke and wont mention them They were both disasters She pauses for a moment and then as though she were giv ing advice to some fledgling thespian says You must never do anything that you dont want to do There have been quite some leading men too Oli vier He has incredibly beautiful gray eyes she says Burton He has the most beautiful green eyes Chaplin He was another matter Working with him in Limelight was a priv ilege beyond words Nothing will probably ever come up to that again A person real ly cant continue on that plane Gielgud Hes the first person who called me the morning after the reviews for A Dolls House came out Hes the most beautiful man Its just somehow typi cal that he would call first She ruffles a bit when I suggest that most people have her pegged as a classi cal actress Let people think of me what they like she says I just want them to come and see my work and then leave me alone Im not a big personality or star Youre born that When you think of the really good ac tresses like Maureen Staple ton or Dorothy Tutin or Peg gy Ashcroft you cant think of things like that You think of the parts theyve played the work theyve done And now Miss Bloom has a matinee to make As a parting shot I ask her if she has any unfulfilled role goals Her lips curve into a slight smile Its terribly frightening she says Nora Hedda and Miss Julie were my goals and now I dont know whether Ill ever be able to do Miss Julie That would be very hard to follow after Hedda Heddas the kind of person you just dont get out of your system very easily Somehow after heavy the ater talk like that it seems almost sacrilegious to change the subject to her husbands Oh Calcutta but Miss Bloom doesnt mind I think its great fun and very healthy she says It brought out a whole lot of things that people just whis pered about and THERE IT WAS out in the open in the theater I think its marvel ous to see a beautiful nude body Would she do a nude scene It depends on how it was lit If my body looked beautiful yes I feel very es thetically about bodies
"69,000 ABORTIONS IN 6 MONTHS HERE",https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/07/archives/69000-abortions-in-6-months-here-women-from-out-of-state-account.html,An estimated total of 69000 abortions were performed in New York Cityhalf of them on women from out of state during the first six months of legalzed abortion here the citys Health Services Administrator Gordon Chase reported yester day The estimate is a rough one that does not include abortions performed in doctors offices The state law which took ef fect last July 1 permits abor tions anywhere But the citys Health Code was amended Oct 19 to require that the operation be restricted to hospitals or ap proved clinics Statewide figures for the same period are not yet avail able Although fetal deaths are supposed to be reported to the Health Department it is known that doctors usually did not do so during the nearly four months when they could legally perform abortions in their of fices Mr Chase pointed to a gratifying trend in his six month status report A Trend Noted Increasingly he noted women who seek abortions are doing so in the first trimes ter [three months] of pregnan cy when the procedure is easier and safer In July and August 686 per cent of abortions were done in the 12th week or earlier In September and October 708 per cent were early abortions In November and December the percentage had increased to 737 Were hopeful that this trend will accelerate as more women become familiar with the new law Mr Chase said We will continue our educa tional efforts urging women who decide on abortion to seek one early He said experience in other countries had shown that the percentage of abortions per formed after the 12th week could drop to as little as 5 per cent of the total Of the 69000 abortions up to Dec 31 about 12000 were performed in municipal hospi tals 21000 in voluntary pri vate nonprofit hospitals 21 000 in proprietary profitmak ing hospitals and 15000 in special abortion clinics 45 From City City residents accounted for 45 per cent of the total 4 per cent came from elsewhere in the state and 49 per cent from out of state No residence was given for 2 per cent Virtually all of the abortions performed in municipal hospi tals were on city residents as were 60 per cent of those done in voluntary hospitals Of the operations performed in pro prietary hospitals 777 were on women from out of town as were 898 per cent of clinic abortions Mr Chase reported that waiting time for abortions was dropping sharply at municipal hospitals which were averag ing 600 a week by the years end On Dec 31 1202 women were awaiting abortions at municipal hospitals of these 943 were already scheduled and 259 were still waiting for a definite date He said the municipal hospi tals were close to their goal a maximum wait of 10 days be tween initial visit and opera tion for women who are less than 12 weeks pregnant 12 Deaths Reported In the first trimester the standard procedure is to re move the fetus either by suc tion or by dilation and curet tage Later in pregnancy abor tions are induced by injecting a saline solution into the uterus Twelve deaths were asso ciated with abortions here dur ing the first six months These included seven deaths from abortions that were started out side of hospitals The rate of reported compli cations remained relatively con stant over the period at 124 for each thousand Mr Chase noted that this rate was almost four times greater for abortions performed after the first tri mester
The New Libertarian Creed,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/09/archives/the-new-libertarian-creed-a-renewed-faith-in-the-individual-is-the.html,Recently a great deal of publicity has been given to a burgeoning split in the right wing a split between the dominant BuckleyNational Review conservatives and the new libertarians  In their breakaway the libertarians who are strong on college campuses and generally among the youth hark back to an older almost forgotten tra dition of individualism that character ized the right wing in the 1930a and 40s Led by such notable intellectuals as Albert Jay Nock and H L Mencken and by the Taft wing of the Republican party among the politicians the older right wing was devoted to the liberty of the individual It therefore led the opposition to the growth of Big Government in America a growth presided over by New DealFair Deal liberalism This older right wing upheld civil liberty and the economic freedom of the market economy while opposing gov ernment intervention conscription militarism and American intervention and imperialism overseas Since the mid1950s however the National Review has led the right into its present conservative stance In rhetoric the National Review upholds a fusion of liberty and order in which the liberty of the individual is judiciously contained within a matrix of order supplied by the state In his early days William Buckley pro claimed himself a libertarian with the single exception of the need to wage an allout struggle against the Com munist conspiracy at home and abroad This concession was bad enough as the entire thrust of con servative foreign policy was redirected toward militarism and empire But since the mid50s as the con servative movement has moved ever closer to the seats of power whatever libertarian elements had been in the fusion have one by one disappeared And so the National Review now sup ports with scarcely a qualm the gi gantic misinvestment of the SST and space programs the nationalization of passenger rail service restrictions on imports and virtually the entire Nixon program It warmly supports laws en forcing moral codes and opposes civil liberties as well as the American tradi tion of separation of church and state It was in response to this systematic shedding of their libertarian strands that so many rightwing youth have rebelled and have taken out on their own The tensions and inner contradic tions of the attempt to fuse liberty and order have finally split the conserva tive coalition apart The libertarian doctrine begins not with the conservative community or state but with the individual Every individual as an independent acting entity possesses the absolute right of selfownership that is to own his or her person without molestation by others From this axiom we derive total opposition to conscription and abortion laws Secondly each individ ual then has the right to own any previously unowned resources such as virgin land that he finds and brings into use by exerting his personal en ergy upon the resource From this is derived the right of homesteading landed property and as a conse quence all the other rights of private property For if a man owns himself and his homesteaded land he also has the right to own unmolested the land that he has transformed into capital as well as the right to give his property to anyone he wishes hence the right of inheritance and to exchange his titles to property for anyone elses titles hence the right of free con tract and the laissezfaire freemarket economy The conservative holds as one of his highest goals the preservation of law and order but his order and his law is the coercive dictation of the state Throughout the ages and in the present day as well the state has lived through the profound disorder of con tinuing aggression against the person and property of countless individuals It robs through taxation enslaves through conscription and murders by way of club bayonet napalm and Hbomb The libertarian holds that the state is permanent aggression and dis order and that the National Review conservatives constitute some of the states most articulate champions and apologists The young libertarians are not sim ply returning to Taftera individualism In asserting themselves as libertari ans they are returning as well to the tradition that once established Amer ica as the proud beaconlight of free dom the tradition of Jefferson Paine Jackson and Garrison And in doing so they are repudiating such conservative theorists as James Burnham of The National Review who has conceded that there is no rational foundation for government and has asserted in a reversion to the ancient des potic theories of divine right that in ancient times before the illusions of science had corrupted traditional wis dom the founders of cities states were known to be gods or demigods Burnhams recent call in National Review for a new Bismarck for Amer ica and for a reevaluation of fascism is the logical culmination of conserva tive statism and obscurantism The lib ertarians in contrast are raising the standards of freedom and reason on which this country was founded
Abortion Brokers Are Under Study,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/10/archives/abortion-brokers-are-under-study-practices-of-abortionreferral.html,July 1 1970 was the day on which it became legal for any woman to obtain an abortion in New York State and as it has turned out a day of opportunity for a handful of entrepreneurs who have found in the hard won reform the basis for one of the most lucrative businesses of the year  That is how Stephen E Mindell an assistant attor ney general in the office of State Attorney General Louis J Lefkowitz recently de scribed the small but appar ently booming abortion referral business Mr Min dell and Barnett Levy head of the offices consumer fraud division have been conduct ing an investigation of com mercial abortion brokers to prepare for hearings sched uled for tomorrow Regulation Possible The purpose of the allday hearings which will be chaired by Mr Lefkowitz at SO Centre Street in Manhat tan is to help decide whether the activities of these agen cies call for some form of regulation or possibly their abolition Were not pre pared to say at this time whether or not commercial agencies should be allowed to continue at all Mr Min dell said Since July 1 according to the New York City Health Services Administration about 69000 legal abortions have been performed in the city The administration esti mates that half were per formed on women from out side the state It seems likely that a high percentage of these women obtained the necessary hospi tal and physicians services through one of the dozen or so commercial agencies their number is continually increasingthat charge fees The fees go to well over 100 for the referral service alone which does not cover the medical costs Just how much money they have made is largely a matter of more or less in formed speculation One agency is estimated to have grossed over 1million since the abortionreform law went into effect The commercial referral agencies are demonstrably eager for business Their advertisements appear in classifiedad columns par ticularly in campus news papers and physicians throughout the United States report a continuing stream of Dear Doctor    letters reminding them that their patients can obtain legal abortions in New York and stressing the virtues of the agency Compassion Stressed One letter from a service that described itself as an agency with humanitarian interests wound up its two page cottonsoft letter with More importantly our serv ice is compassionate Our main concern is the welfare of the woman before and after her abortion For the general public the approach is not always as lowkey In December vaca tioners in Miami Beach could look up from the beach to see a lowflying airplane trailing a banner that read Abortion Information and listed a New York telephone number that of a referral agency Service Available Free It is the fee that has drawn most of the criticism of the agencies The same service is available to women without a fee through local Planned Parenthood offices the Fam ily Planning Information Service in New York City the Clergy Consultation Services on Abortion which now has 28 offices in 22 states and the nonprofit groups set up on many campuses The commercial agencies are able to operate because the outofstate women are ignorant of the same facilities without a fee Mr Levy said The basic service provided by the agencies is to find the woman a physician who will perform the type of abortion she requires and the neces sary hospital space and care plus extras sometimes such as airport limousine service and counseling The quality of the medical care is not generally criti cized According to the infor mation that the Attorney Generals office has obtained all the abortions have been performed in accredited hos pitalsabout 40 proprietary private and profitmaking institutions in all five bor oughsand by licensed gyn ecologists Among the questions that Mr Mindell and Mr Levy hope to have answered to morrow arc several involving nondisclosure of fees The patient has absolutely no idea of how the fee is split said Mr Mindell In some cases the referral fee is more than the doctors fee Background an Issue They will also examine the lack of appropriate back ground among the commer cial abortion brokers wheth er or not the fee is reason able in terms of the overall cost and some other more complicated questions Should a middleman Mr Mindell asked intercede be tween the doctor and the pa tient and make a profit out of it This is where the question is Is it feesplitting Is this solicitation of patients Dr Robert E Hall a pro fessor of obstetrics and gyn ecology at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University who was a vigorous proponent of the abortionreform legislation said Its certainly blatant ly both feesplitting and so licitation I get a letter about every two weeks from an agency Ive never heard of The humanitarian service the agencies write about Dr Hall said is actually mak ing a fast buck Mrs Sheila Whyte the ex ecutive director of Womens Pavilion Inc a referral agen cy said in a telephone inter view that women calling about obtaining an abortion would be told what the fee [to the agency] is if they asked She also said she felt the commercial service was actually justifiable because the agency did an awful lot of service casescases in which it waived the fee and obtained the abortion for a lower rate or perhaps for nothing But a call to the Womens Pavilion the same afternoon from a reporter who said she was a student from Pitts burgh who was about 10 weeks pregnant and very short of funds was met with an absolute although politely phrased refusal to say what part of the overall charge went to the agency The agency employe asked repeatedly if there were some way of obtaining an abortion without paying a fee failed to mention the nonprofit agencies Nor did she indicate any possibility that the young woman might be handled as a service case A Similar Response A similar call to Womens Referral Service Inc in Jackson Heights Queens met a similar response The charge285 for an early pregnancy abortion involving only a few hours in the hos pital 410 for a 24hour hos pital stayincluded every thing the interviewer said And the services fee Our fee is included in that Couldnt she say what it was I really dont know was the reply from the inter viewer who said she would have to ask her supervisor who was off the floor When she was asked if there were any other way of making arrangements for an abortion she said hesitantly that there was not In a later interview Jerry Simon the president of the small group of business men who he said established Womens Referral Service about three months ago said that all a woman had to do to find out the agencys fee was Just ask Mr Simon volunteered to a reporter that the fee was 75 to 100 depending on the hospital Mr Simon conceded that some of these girls [the tele phone interviewers] get over eager But he said that All our girls are equipped to give them several alternatives with the telephone numbers of the nonprofit agencies right on their desks Not all the commercial agencies were surveyed but a call to one named Abor tion Information Services pro duced a similar refusal to reveal the fee The total package charge however is to be paid in full in ad vance by Western Union money order or in cash the caller was told This require ment is usual among the com mercial agencies A former associate of the owner of Abortion Informa tion Services however said the agency set a minimum fee of 110 A spokesman for the agency said it had referred 15000 women since July 1 Another aspect of the com mercial operations that has raised questions is the pos sibility that the interviewers are in effect practicing medicine without a license by asking women the dura tion of their pregnancies and deciding the appropriate abortion technique Out to Make a Fortune I think in principle they serve a worthwhile func tion Dr Hall said but he added that the abortion brokers were taking a tre mendous profit for service that should be available without charge Ive had several men and women come to me who want to start up abortion  referral agencies the physician add ed Theyre very selfright eous and humanitarian but when you get down to the nittygritty theyre out to make a fortune One Dr Hall said was a collector of delinquent bills for a chain of motels who wanted to set up an abor tionreferral agency with a tiein to the motel ohain which would provide the overnight housing for the patients The referral industry came to the Attorney Generals at tention last fall when a young single woman from Indianapolis came to the Consumer Frauds Division to complain that she had been unable to get a refund from an agency that sent her to a hospital she disliked Mr Simon in explaining why he felt his agency was performing a needed service said he felt the nonprofit groups were doing a magni ficent job as a general rule but that the exceptions he knew of prompted him to set up Womens Referral Service Similar responses came from other agenciesthey are fill ing a need they say and filling it better Mr Mindell and Mr Levy pointed out that in New York State a businessman must be licensed or regulated to run a funeral home or an em ployment agency or to be a junk dealer But as Mr Mindell pointed out At this point there is absolutely no regulation in the State of New York as to who can go into this and what fees can be charged

Realities of Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/13/archives/realities-of-abortion.html,On Oct 8 1970 a 20yearold unmarried clinic patient from Manhat tan had an abortion at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center During the procedure one of the instruments perforated the wall of her uterus Over the next few hours it became apparent that she was bleeding inter nally She was returned to the operat ing room where a hysterectomy was performed Ten pints of blood were administered She has survived and done well  On Oct 10 Mrs Maria Ortega a 23yearold married woman from Boston had an abortion in the office of a doctor in New York City The uterus was perforated She was sent home where she died five hours later of internal bleeding There is little doubt in my mind that the first woman would also have died if she had been sent home after her abortion There is little doubt that the second woman would have lived had her abortion occurred in a hospital Is there need for further proof that abortions should be performed in hos pitals and not in doctors offices Is not one such death enough Evidently not for there are still those predomi nantly laymen who claim that an abortion is as simple as a tooth extrac tion and that the New York City Board of Health acted without justification in outlawing office abortions in the city I am sure that these critics are sincere in their beliefs But they are wrong Why not allow abortions In special clinics and in doctors offices Here the argument has run full circle for we are back to 23yearold Mrs Ortega dying at home of internal hemorrhage In Hungary where abortion has been legal for 14 years where doctors have become experienced with modern abortion techniques and where all abortions are done in hospitals the incidence of uterine perforation is per 1000 abortions This sounds infini tesimal But if you condone even 250000 clinic and office abortions a year these figures indicate that you must accept 500 of these catastrophes occurring in facilities unsuited to han dling them Not to mention the eight fold greater risk of hemorrhage which can be so immediate and massive that the patient may not survive a ten minute trip to the hospital These complications are unavoidable no mat ter where abortions are done They are far less often fatal when they occur in a hospital The terrible irony of Mrs Ortegas death lies not only in the fact that it most probably would have been pre vented in a hospital but also in the fact that since she came from out of state it might have been prevented by a residency requirement Until the laws are changed elsewhere New York must make the awful decision between quantity and quality in abortion care Unfortunately we cannot have both I would opt for quality and hope that the other states will soon deal with their proportionate share of the quantity Within six months at most I am convinced that the situation will changenot from bad to worse but from good to better Hospital facilities will expand doctors will become more experienced policies will become more realistic and attitudes more hu mane Rich and poor married and unmarried minors and majors women with early and late pregnancies will be aborted safely inexpensively ex peditiously To assure this outcome in New York and to hasten its happen ing throughout the country it is im perative that the New York Legisla ture act now to confine the practice of abortion to hospitals and restrict the eligibility for abortion to New York State residents

Simon on Sarris,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/14/archives/he-desires-flight-from-reality-simon-on-sarris.html,ANDREW SARRIS is the main repre sentative in America of a kind of movie criticism called auteur criticism a term perhaps not yet so generally known as not to require some explanation Under the aegis of the late Andre Bazin the French film critic and founder of La Revue du Cinma 1947 which turned into the Cahiers du Cinma there developed the new breed of socalled Cahiers critics  Bazin himself an editor of Cahiers was a cultivated extremely wellmean ing Roman Catholic criticand essen tially a buff He clasped movies of every kidney to his bosom wrote about them thoughtfully but rather convolutedly and inelegantly and also alas quite humor lessly Nevertheless he was one of the first scholarcritics  perhaps the first of importance in France he occupies much the same charismatic semilegen dary position that James Agee occupies here The critical disciples of Bazin started under the leadership of Francois Truf faut and with considerable though not total support from their master some thing they called the politique des auteurs or politics of authorship Ac cording to this view a truly great director is an auteur author whether or not he has written the screenplay he imposes his personality on every aspect of the film which then can be said to reveal rather than anything else the artistic personality of that director or auteur But in filmmaking and especially in American filmmaking which the Cahiers crowd has always idolized the director is often at the mercy of the producer or studio hence the auteurists elaborated a theory according to which the bril liance of an auteur the very quality that distinguishes him from a mere di rector shows up in the skill with which he puts his individuality across despite the rigid mold into which his film must be fitted From there it was only a short step to admiring films for their quirks real or imaginary idiosyncrasies that were discovered in this or that corner of movie There was a shot here a bit of technique there a small twist in the plot yonder that came in for the most ardent and eccentric admiration The entire output of an auteur had to be scruti nized for almost imperceptible true or alleged oddities which could be traced from film to film in the auteurs oeuvre The obscurer the auteur the better the more the auteur critic has the opportu nity to impress us with his esoteric knowledge  often so esoteric that it is hardly worth having Unfortunately it has never been re vealed how someone becomes an auteur as far as I can ascertain it is a status conferred upon one by an official or un official poll of the Cahiers critics or even by the sufficiently obstreperous approbation of a minority among them Here is an account of the changing tastes in auteurs at the Cahiers as given in 1962 by Robert Benayoun an un sympathetic critic from the rival and equally auteurist publication Positif but accurate enough for all that As generation after generation went its way the idols were shuffled those who once worshiped Welles Huston and Rossellini were ousted by the champions of Aldrich Hawks and Anthony Mann and then by those of Fuller Lang and Losey Today all this has been swept away by a new brood of cinphiles who are blithely ignorant of any films that are more than five years old and new gods have been installed Ulmer Walsh and Cottafavi The politique des auteurs is as can be seen a dialectic of hor monal rejuvenation sustained by the criterion of rediscovery on virgin ground Benayoun disregards the tact that some of the auteur critics are very up on their film history having spent years and years of their lives in Henri Lang loiss French Cinematheque there ab sorbing along with films of value some of the most slimecovered flotsam of both the silent and soundfilm eras In any case the judgments of the Cahiers critics are scandalous thus an entire issue of the magazine was dedicated to the work of Edgar G Ulmer a proto typical hack if ever there was one Here is Sarris The American Cinema p 143 on Ulmer Strictly speaking most of Ulmers films are of interest only to unthinking audiences and specialists in miseenscne Yet anyone who loves the cinema [which thinking audience apparently cannot do] must be moved by Daughter of Dr Jekyll a film with a scenario so atroci ous that it takes 40 minutes to establish that the daughter of Dr Jekyll is indeed the daughter of Dr Jekyll Ulmers camera never falters even when his characters disintegrate    his reflexes are still sharp for the meaningful chal lenges of The Black Cat Bluebeard Ruthless Murder Is My Beat Detour and The Naked Dawn That a personal style could emerge from the lowest depths of Poverty Row is a tribute to director without alibis And Ulmer for Sarris is one of the minor glories of the cinema Here is a career more sub terranean than most which be [sic] signature of a genuine artist  Now if you should wonder about which bee [sic] might have stung Sarris you will find that it is the Cahiers critics Thus Fereydoun Hoveyda I again quote Benayoun extolled Nicholas Rays Party Girl simply because he found the plot particularly silly and Luc Moullet admired in the work of that abysmal director Samuel Fuller the gratuitousness fortunately total of the camera movements Similarly the Cahiers critic Andr S Labarthe writes about Godards A Woman Is a Worn an The words are not there to ex press something but rather to express the characters They are reactives ob stacles and their function is in a cer tain sense lateral   Only accidents count here the accent intonation modulation  in short the form La barthe calls the film among other things a documentary of Karina Go dards then wife Sarris without ac knowledging Labarthe  or perhaps taking universal familiarity with Cahiers lucubrations for granted  declares [Woman] is a documentary not mere ly of Karina but of the sheer otherness of all women    [it] employs all the resources of the cinema to express the exquisite of heterosexual love This about the shenanigans of three comicstrip characters lacking even the thickness of cardboard in a film whose direction consists of piling capricious gimmick on gimmick And Sarris con cludes The ultimate paradox of A Woman Is a Woman is its genuinely tragic spirit If there is anything tragic about that manifestly farcical though unfunny film it is the number of viewers and reviewers it has duped What has made the auteur critics what they are Let us remember that the first wave of them were schoolboys during World War II Chabrol and Go dard were born in 1930 Truffaut in 1932 Rivette in 1928 This in itself must have been a disruptive experience driving the boys into the movies as haven from reality After the war at the Cinmathque and elsewhere they were finally able to get at the American films they could not see during the Oc cupation and this formerly forbidden fruit must have tasted doubly sweet We recall that Godard dedicated Breathless to Monogram Pictures the studio that specialized in lowbudget abortions The American cinematic violence glossiness and mindlessness must have compensated for the sense of inertia indigence and stern philo sophical speculation  it was the era of Existentialism on the rise  that characterized the postwar years in Paris The American movie became both an antidote and an anodyne Some dozen or fifteen years later these no longer so very young men found themselves in the situation of having to justify the fact that they did not know much about anything except poor to rotten American movies The solution clearly was to elevate this abstruse and absurd information to the level of high and important erudition and thereby justify ones misspent youth a process which by the way need not be a conscious one  In all this the French or more prop erly Cartesian spirit of cogitation as proof of ones existence plays an im portant role For though cogitation is one of the three noblest functions of man along with love and artistic or scientific creation it does not come as easy as one might wish it is certainly much harder than concoction which it may superficially resemble The concoct ing of elaborate theories systems struc tures categorizations is a favorite French pastime and has on occasion yielded useful results It has also on other and more numerous occasions produced reckless and sterile theorizing of which the politique des auteurs is a depressing example Not only is there no critical basis for the canonization of directors into auteurs but also em pirically a simple trip to Hollywood and observation of moviemaking under the studio bosses would have taught these French critics that the supposed auteur had immeasurably less power than they attributed to him and that what they took to be his choices were either no choices or not his Though the auteurist accolade usu ally went to American mediocrities or nonentities it could go to anyone as long as it ran sufficiently contrary to generally held notions Thus Rossellinis banal and boring Voyage to Italy made in 1953well after the neorealist impulse and inspiration had forsaken the directorwas voted top film of believe all time by the Cahiers critics years after it was madean opinion that was duly echoed much later yet by Susan Sontag when she introduced the film at its first New York screening at the Museum of Modern Art Similarly at one point the Cahiers critics concurred that Under Capri corn was Hitchcocks greatest film verdict that must shock any discrimi nating mind as it apparently did even Hitchcocks Years later in the book length interview Truffaut conducted with the filmmaker we still find Hitch cock warding off the interviewers excessive enthusiasm for this failed film But let us get to the auteur theorys American branch there is also an Eng lish one represented chiefly by the critics on Sight and Sound and Movie and for all I know there are others flourishing from Latvia to Lebanon The American chef dcole is I repeat Andrew Sarris who was also the editor of the Englishlanguage edition of the Cahiers that appeared here between 1965 and 1967 Apropos the Americanization of the auteur theory Pauline Kael had some cogent and devastating things to say in her 1963 article Circles and Squares Since then however her position  or more accurately her way of defining  has changed drastically bringing her much closer to Sarris and his band of insiders whom she attacked in that es say reprinted in I Lost It at the Movies Among other pertinent ob servations about the auteurists Miss Kael noted that their decisions are beyond criticism Its like a womans telling us that she feels a certain dress does something for her her feeling has about as much to do with critical judg ment as the auteur critics feeling that Minnelli has it but Huston never had it In this light let us survey some ex amples of the Sarris method at work Claude Chabrol is not only an auteur critic but also a filmmaker which al most automatically grants him auteur status So we find Sarris justifying his unconvincing endorsement of the dreary Landru with this concluding state ment which like all those not other wise identified comes from Confes sions of a Cultist What Chabrol proves once again is that stupidity when viewed honestly and sympathet ically is the stuff of poetry By the same argument one could prove that Wordsworths The Idiot Boy is one of the great achievements of English poetry Even more extraordinary is Sarriss special pleading for Chabrols preten tiously trashy Les Biches The Village Voice Oct 17 1968 Chabrols com passionate view of uselessness and stupidity makes every apparently gra tuitous camera movement a warm caress This is marvelously circular reasoning how do we know that Cha brol is compassionate with stupidity Because of all those apparently gratui tous but really caressing camera move ments And how do we know that those apparently gratuitous camera movements are really warm caresses Because of Chabrols compassion for stupidity I shall not go into the murky issue of why Chabrol views stupidity with a compas sion that looks more like lurid com plaisance to me but I cannot help won dering how camera movement can be anything but apparent anything but what we see on screen Thus If camera movement is a warm caress is so because it appears to be so if it is apparently something else eg a gratuitous bit of tomfoolery then gratui tous tomfoolery it is Les Biches Sarris continues is    a thing of beauty a film of subjective feelings rather than objective facts a film of more style than substance deliri ous decadent but ultimately delightful to those with a taste for appearances as the purest language of the cinema One wonders by what hocuspocus sub jective feelings what other kind is there can be made ipso facto into positive value And what films can pos sibly he said to deal in objective facts another redundancy except perhaps newsreels Surely it is the nature and application of feelings that matters not just their existence And why adduce in a films defense that it has more style than substance The very fact that the style and sub stance are not identical that elements we recognize as necessarily fused should here he not only imperfectly matched but also readily separable is evidence of artistic failure And if we can and must make a separation why should we put style over substance It all comes out in the wash because those among whom Sarris proudly numbers himself perceive appearances as the purest language of cinema Why should appearances be that And in any case what does Sarris mean by appearances  to say nothing of purest and language As I under stand language it has to do not with appearances but with signs or symbols for meanings And what is the purest language The one that is farthest from the mots de la tribu most poetic Or the one that is most accurate most algebraic Or the one that is simplest most universally comprehensible And why above all should appearances have such a positive value Only a moment ago Sarris warned us against accepting Chabrols camera movements at their apparent value  It is fairly easy to recognize what lurks behind this hopeless jumbling of words and ideas a simple desire to justify ones use of movies as an escape from reality So Pauline Kael writes in her already quoted essay These critics work embarrassingly hard trying to give some semblance of intellectual respecta bility to a preoccupation with mindless repetitious commercial products the kind of action movies that the restless rootless men who wander on Forty second Street and in the Tenderloin of all our big cities have always preferred because they could respond to them without thought These movies soak up your time    they serve a very different function for Sarris or Bogdanovich    even though they devise elaborate theo ries to justify taking up their time Les Biches to be sure is more of an inac tion movie but what it lacks in action it more than makes up for in mindless ness and repetitiousness But it is true that action movies are particularly appealing to this crowd Take the case of the actiondirector Samuel Fuller Peter Wollen an English auteurist who admires Sarris as much as Sarris admires him lists his favorite auteurs the absolute greats under Sar riss term of Pantheon Directors among them we find the usual com petent technicians Ford Hawks Hitch cock and more or less clever entertain ers Lubitsch Sternberg Ophtils who appear also in Sarriss Pantheon and many other auteurist hit parades But there too is Samuel Fuller whom even Sarris relegates to the second circle of greats The Far Side of Paradise as he calls it Nevertheless here is Sarris on Fullers Shock Corridor to which he concedes the earmarks of transpar ent trashiness and goes on to say The dialogue is so intense so com pressed so lacking in all the shadings of wit and verisimilitude that it is im possible to escape the impression of a primitive artist at work And Shock Corridor emerges as a distinguished addition to the art form in which Hol lywood has always excelledthe ba roque Bpicture In 1963 when Sarris wrote this you were lucky to find among Hollywoods preceding 50 years worth of Apictures a handful of works of art even to call the Bpictures an art form is laughable or pitiful or both at once Sarris will stop at no desperate strat agem to make his baggypants theory appear ironclad Thus Hitchcocks tawdry The Birds is praised as a joy because it does not feed parasiti cally on outside cultural references  Chekhov Synge ONeill Genet Behan Melville or what have you On that basis you could rejoice in every skin flick along 42d Street from Olgas Girls to Tales for Malesunless of course Sarris should be able to prove that they feed on what have you And by way of a final example who would not cherish Sarriss lastditch maneuvers to save Hitchcocks senile Topaz which Vincent Canby of The New York Times an auteurish reviewer also raved about and placed on his 10 best list Sarris is reduced to praising faggedout Hitchcock for having im provised to the extent of exploiting John Vernons expressively blue eyes in a morally ambivalent situation The Village Voice Dec 25 1969 Just how a pair of eyes even if it were something more remarkable than blue say yellow can be exploited in a morally ambivalent situation to say nothing of how one improvises with this  by not allowing Vernon to blink lest we lose some of that azure eloquence  Sarris of course neglects to tell us But he does affirm that Topaz affords us unexpected glimpses of the most saving of all human graces perversity and humor Why perversity should he a most saving human grace I cannot imagine unless it be that Sarris is dimly aware that one most saving or Pan theon grace is insufficient to save a film as wretched as Topaz so another one has to be recruited from among the vices Perversity however is certainly the most saving grace of Sarriss criticism as well as the only deliberate one the humor being mostly unintentional This article is excerpted from Mr Sirnons book Movies Into Film to be published shortly by The Dial Press

10th consecutive term having been reelected last November in a campaign that featured his vote for abortion liberalization in 1970 and his real estate dealing in Nassau County In a tribute to the Senator Governor Rockefeller spoke of his widespread humanitarian in terests These the Governor said ranged from automobile and traffic safety in which he was an acknowledged national pioneer to cancer research and control Senator Earl W Brydges the Senate Majority Leader mentioned in his statement that Mr Speno had overcome can cer of the throat and that he was active in anticancer legis

assistance to parents of nonpublic school children and for championing automobile safety legislation At ills death he was co sponsoring with Assemblyman Alfred H Lernery a Queens Re publican the SpenoLerner bill which would provide state aid of up to 230 annually a pupil to parents of parochial school children The money was to go for tultion The bill which had the backing of many powerful Ro man eatholics would have the effect of helping church schools in their present troubled condi tion Many of these schools are hardpressed financially The controversial bill was strongly attacked a week ago by the Governor who argued that it would undermine the public school system Its legislative chances were believed in doubt at this session Senator Spenos interest in the parochial schools was also supported by Jewish groups in the state These groups had worked with him in previous legislative sessions for bills that would allot money for text book purchases Although the Senator a Catholic as

Homosexual Militance,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/19/archives/homosexual-militance.html,To many people the recent demon strations and confrontations concern ing homosexuals civil rights might seem to be just another of those libera tion movements which are so popular at present There may be a minor ele ment of truth in this view but the gay liberation movement is primarily con cerned with profound issuesa few of which will be mentioned hereinvolv ing the very basis of mans psychologi cal and physical relationship to man  Cutting through the ancient rhetoric of antihomosexual militants who have existed infinitely longer than the homo sexual militants one discovers the sources of all prejudice against us our difference and our refusal to conform An elaborate structure has been built upon this untenable foundation to justify centuries of polemics purges and scapegoatism but science and truth are now exposing it as fallacious Fallacy IHomosexuality Is Unnat ural The pitfalls in defining varying forms of behavior as natural and unnatural are obvious What is nat ural at one time and in one place is unnatural at another time and in an other place ie polygamy human sacrifice abortion Such scientists as Margaret Mead Ruth Benedict Alfred Kinsey and Frank Beach have shown us that homosexual behavior has existed throughout mans history in many diverse societies and among many animal species Many cultures accept andor require homosexual activity as part of their socialization process Yet it is called unnatural in our own country In reality such terminology is merely camouflage for an early tribal need for workers hunters and warriors Essentially it is the glorification of reproduction as the sole purpose of sexual relationships Few intelligent people would accept this idea today but it remains a persuasive factor in justifying antihomosexual theory The real issue masked in verbal clich is the justification of majority behavior and the proscription or elimination of minority behavior Fallacy II Homosexuality Is Im moral Again the semantic problem is evident Moral and immoral are judgmental terms relative to time place and the needs of the majority For example various societies and eras have defined antisemitism and anti black pogroms as moral while others have not The basic problem is to establish a durable definition of moral and immoral which applies to all times and to all places Joseph Fletcher and Norman Pittenger among others sug gest such definitions Any behavior or attitude manifesting selfless loving concern for another person is morale and any behavior or attitude bringing physical or mental harm to another person is immoral There are two overriding considera tions which must be borne in mind 1 homosexual relations between con senting individuals bring joy not harm and are therefore moral 2 individual man must not be manipulated by gov ernment church or society to fulfill goals inimical to the happiness of indi vidual citizens when their happiness does not infringe upon the rights of other individual citizens Fallacy IIIHomosexuality Is an Ill ness This currently popular theory is a glaring example of the contemporary mania for calling tastes habits and behavior which differ from ones own sick The famed Wolfenden Com mission in Great Britain and the Kin sey Institute in the United States have exposed the fallacy of these views Dr Kinseys research found that onethird of the adult male population has had a homosexual experience to the point of orgasm while onehalf of that same population is capable of homosexual response The discrepancy between the two figures is the result of societal pressures favoring a heterosexual norm and suppressing an individuals homosexual desires a fact which has been detrimental to families and jobs when the clash between homosexual desires and antihomosexual pressures became too great The consequence of Kinseys findings is that onethird to onehalf of the male population is either sick to some degree or that something is basically wrong with the majoritys illness theory The essential questions are clear Are meaningful expressions of emotion only valid between members of oppo site sexes Is the sole purpose of intense human relationships mechani cal reproduction Is the strength of society founded upon its sameness rather than its diversity Perhaps Henry David Thoreau pro vided the answer when he wrote Let every man mind his own business and endeavor to be what he was made The time has come for the homosexual to be what he was made not the gro tesque outcast which the heterosexual population would have him be

Corporate Wives Studied,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/21/archives/corporate-wives-studied-corporate-wives.html,Most wives agreed with the corporation they too felt that the good wife is the wife who adjusts graciously to the system curbs open intellec tualism or the desire to be alone    a frequent consequence is the superwoman complex    they take on a back breaking load of duties and a guilt feeling that theyre not up to it The Organization Man by William Whyte 1956 BOSTON  William Whytes study of the human behavioral side of the giant corporations that make America tick is still a best selling classic and required reading for future business managers But statements like those above now draw reactions ranging from scorn to amused denial from the wives of the younger men tabbed for leadership in the organizational world There are signs more subtle than revolutionary that the cor porate wife is not quite so willing to marry her hus bands organization for bet ter or for worse nor to serve docilely as the unpaid mem ber of the team it hires Not surprisingly the young er the wife the more clarion her declaration of independ ence We want something more out of life than our husbands or their corpora tions can provide said Nancy Hall 23 years old a member of the Womens Lib eration Collective of the Har vard Business School Wives Club In a much softer tone Pat Allinson

the Harvard BSchool which speaks in the first person usually singular are not at all militant But as Mary Moody whose husband Thomas is super visor of industry forecasts for Shell Oil said I went on interview trips with my hus band in 1962 Some compa nies planned programs and made me feel Id be conform ing It was through offhand remarks about how the wives did things together such as bowl on Tuesday and bridge on Wednesday Other companies treated me as an individual and a person Thank heaven my husband liked that best This year the Sloan Wives moved the School to reappraise its former view of the wife as extension of the hus band Mr Patten said They asked for and received a se ries of Wednesday evening seminars in addition to the Friday afternoon arts and science classes in which they are permitted to join their husbands For their own seminars the wives have chosen topics such as organizational be havior and accounting He gave us the straight stuff and didnt water it down or

compa ny paid for it These were two people coming to do their own things and spend the evenings together The wives education and working experience add di mensions to the trend Among the upcoming genera tion of executives now in business schools or just out Mr Beckharcl said the wives are working but not in the context that theyre going to settle down and have babies Joans an artist or Cathy is a personnel mana ger I suspect many corpora tions will see this mode of life as a condition of at tracting and holding good people As people have been be coming more loyal to their professions than to their or ganizations they go where the work is challenging and the environment makes work meaningful he added A recent questionnaire cir culated among members of the Harvard Business School Wives Club indicated that half of them are working while their husbands submit to the highly pressured or deal intended to transform them into the nations busi ness leaders Fifty per cent of those answering the sur vey said they had career plans of their own Twenty of them are en rolled with their husbands in a new and popular seminar in The Executive Family organized by Dr Barrie Greiff the BSchool

the system and their wives have considerable in fluence in this regard Dr Greiff said Whatever business Rich ard gets into I should be in too said Cyral Sheldon a curriculum writer planning to pursue a doctorate after her husband receives his MBA We dont want to manufacture a better soap We want to do something socially useful she said The Sheldons are thinking of buying a vocational school These

MIT re ported that scrutinizing the wife is being raised as an ethical question to the point that some organizations are changing their policies Dr Greiff believes that any psy chological testing of the wife is an invasion of privacy However wives are still being looked at particularly in the toplevel searches of major industrial companies and banking institutions Russell Reynolds an ex ecutive recruiting consultant said that although the wife is incidental to the hunt for an entrepreneur driving force type for a small com pany the larger companies tend to be much more ori ented toward the

Paperback Books,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/21/archives/female-human-beings-female-human-beings.html,Have you any notion how many books are written about women in the course of one year Have you any notion how many are written by men Are you aware that you are perhaps the most discussed ani mal in the universe So Virginia Woolf in 1929 was provoked to a cry of exasperation just give us A Room of Ones Own and as you leave shut the door  The intervening years mercifully saw an end to titles like The Mental Moral and Physical Inferiority of the Female Sex but we did not man age to shut the door on a parade of obedient insidious stereotypes Most of us read believed and even wrote about ourselves as awkward teenagers mothers neurotics seduc tresses hostesses romantic heroines and consumers  everything but women Our breathing creature selves as centers of experience were somehow lost among all these charac terizations as they so often seemed to be in our lives Kay Lindsey a black woman has written recently When we are de fined by those other than ourselves the qualities ascribed to us are not in our interests but rather reflect the nature of the roles which we are intended to play And a radical wo mens manifesto reiterates We must cease to be defined by men  we must define ourselves About three years ago all kinds of women but especially young radi cal women started doing a remark able thing they withdrew to be alone together and began experimentally tentatively to try to define them selves  for themselves without reference to the needs and expec tations of men In the beginning one of them writes it was hard for anyone to speak at all our voices trembled and we felt we succeeded if we just got out the gist of what we wanted to say But the women gained in confidence they found that they had minds and could use them and that as they broke the deepdown involuntary deference to men that had supplanted their trust in them selves they were freed from a chron ic paralysis They talked listened to each other wrote and circulated position papers exploring their ideas as to why they had stammered stum bled fought each other and failed before And a peculiar thing began to hap pen as they redefined themselves they found themselves calling sharp ly in question the august sciences that had defined them  biology psychology politics medicine They unearthed some missing pieces of history that suggested a rather dif ferent shape for the whole puzzle They discovered as Virginia Woolf had discovered that they had a tradi tion although neglect had left it discontinuous and they began to re assemble that puzzle too They re vived the voices of their mothers and sought out the contributions of sisters It seemed that a room of ones own had been too little to ask we would have a world of our own Suddenly it was a great time to be a woman It was like being in a diving bell and peering out at the ocean astonished to find that the pressure we had felt when each of us was out there alone and unpro tected had lifted it was as if we had been born on Jupiter and had suddenly arrived on earth weighing 200 pounds less and breathing the atmosphere we were meant for That diving bell that atmosphere is the flourishing feminist culture Every woman who enters in can grow breathe stretch find her capacities shed fear acquire discipline become wholea female human being Always before our ex ploration of what those words might mean has been brought to a grinding haltfor want of the kind of supportive environ ment that could only be pro vided by female human beings Why hasnt there been a vig orous feminist culture before if so many materials have lain at hand waiting only to be taken up and knit together Now that the classics of fem inism are returning to print we find that periodically over the centuries women have stated their case with such wit grace vigor and irrefutable justifica tion that their failure to win the full grant of both their rights and their abilities testi fies only to the size of societys stake in keeping them down In the face of such vested ob tuseness the fact that a couple of fine feminist tracts have been written by men argues the same kind of case for male re deemability that the accom plished woman once presented Tor female ability its possible to break training but its rare So far from being soured or warped these voices carry the unmistakable assurance of per sons who have found the clear spring of the self There is Mary Wolistone crafts Vindication of the Rights of Woman Norton 175 I shall

all these on slaughts had not made the pa triarchate tremble on its sen tentious foundations surely the publication in 1948 of Ruth Herschbergers Adams Rib Harper 95 cents should have sent great cracks of sheepish ness across its face and brought it to tumble down in laughter This book is a collection of little essays fun nier than Thurber the cumu lative effect of which is to re cord an astringent opinion in favor of womens sexual vital ity and to expose what amounts to a systematic cultural pro gram for its suppression to gether with all other healthy surges of selfassertion in wo men and all tendencies to be gentle in men At once a lam poon and an indictment of the politics of frigidity and the se mantics of sexism it should have made cruel nonsense of the cultivation of two

and ap pallingly documented by Betty Friedan under the title of The Feminine Mystique Dell 125 Five points of awareness across a span of 160 years yet the connecting links are miss ing that would make this a conscious living tradition We may seek some reason for this in our reading on an enlight ening subject the economics of sexism In Born Female The High Cost of Keeping Women Down Pocket 95 cents Car oline Bird shows how in a patriarchal society conditions at a physical or economic fron tier may of necessity produce equality and androgyny of the sexes but as soon as a period of consolidation and sta bility sets in it becomes a mark of status to keep an idle woman The sexual philosophies corresponding to these two his torical motionsrelative fem inism and masculinism have alternated just frequent ly enough to keep every gen eration of American women from using their mothers as models The feminists of each generation then have had to begin all over at the begin ning The tradition is broken the mothers are lost there is no cumulation At the same time as femi nist writers from Mill to Rossi to the Redstockings have said again and again women are the only oppressed group that have lived divided from one another and in intimacy with their masters in a chronic state of bribery and intimida tion combined Mill The goal of their lives being to capture and keep one man apiece wo men were even further divid ed as hostile and mistrustful as two men competing for some prize or honor only more so because women fought for an undignified reward As long as women were kept apart free women would remain isolated instances and a movement could be dissolved bought off with a concession  like the vote  or absorbed into a na tional crisis Without commu nity there could be no tradi tion without sisterhood a few of us might defy but we could neither inherit nor transmit It is this truth that Simone de Beauvoir mourned when she wrote in her massive and mag nificent sounding of the female experience The Second Sex Bantam 125 Women lack concrete means for organizing themselves into a unit which can stand face to face with the correlative unit They have no past no history no reli gion of their own But now from Beauvoirs point of view the incredible has happened the current feminist generation is well on the way to forging just such a unit a history and a myth How did this happen First of all for some time the family as sacrosanct spir itual and economic unit of American society has been breaking down and it is only recently that this breakdown has begun to show its posi tive aspects As the first Amer ican feminists suspected but the suffragists did not dare to admitboth attitudes are doc umented in Aileen Kraditors Up From the Pedestal Quad rangle 295the family has been the prime agent of control and socialization  particular ly of women and children its very meat  and the prime barrier to radical social change The reasons for its dis integration are complex and speculative but the reverbera tions carry far beyond radical circles Masculine Feminine an anthology edited by Betty Ros zak and Theodore Roszak Har perColophon 245 could provide a quick and painless conversion to the spirit of fem inism for people who are a little nervous about it This book provides in a dazzling curve the argument for the abolition of sex roles and the adoption of androgynous equality In brilliant papers by Juliet Mitch ell Alice Rossi Judith Brown and others it puts forward such varied alternatives to the fam ily as the legitimization of a number of different forms for intersexual and intergenera tional bonding the promotion of parttime work for both men and women the abolition of il legitimacy equal division of all tasks within the family free birth control and abortion and 24hour day care In the con text of these experimental structures there is both room and need for women to work together as well as with men But there is another bitter impetus behind the new unity of women a force more em phatic in its rejection of the male as presently constituted and more radical in its em brace of the female as hope for the future This strain of feminism stresses the need to get ourselves together to build a stable deeply founded fe male world before we can even begin to think about the forms and means for reintegration If the idea of an allfemale world seems shocking think how naturally we speak of the mans world and then con sider what there is apart from social conditioning to prevent women in particular from en joying the respite and unself conscious company of their kind This is the Womens Libera tion movement which emerged from the militant New Left It is represented in the Roszak anthology with mixed admira tion and dubiety in

powerlessness in the hands of medical men and leg islators who regard them as baby producers their use as unpaid labor in the home To read deeply in these an thologies is to have your vision altered Sisterhood is the most distinctive and intense it was written by women speak ing to other women it is not a book so much as it is a proc ess of radical education and it is the most advanced in that the greater number of its papers have passed beyond ex ploration into analysis and planning Voices and Blue print are showcase antholo gies Voices includes a histor ical sampling and some classic broadsheet analyses from the movement while Blueprint the most hastily assembled gives the best sense of the raw grc ping experience of consciousnessraising where it all began You become aware of how the unpaid labor of housewives facilitates the freedom and pro ductivity of their husbands how a woman can be a little territory for the most power less man to lord it over and Ivw she provides the psychic repository for his own most mistrusted feelings In short you begin to understand just how men have benefited from the oppression of women There is just cause here for rage es pecially when you consider how long and how unquestioningly women have accepted it Still so searing and uncompromis ing a vision of the war between the sexes must have been hard won It comes out of a great and recent hurt a betrayal of faith what Robin Morgan calls a moment of insult so in tense that ones eyes are ir revocably opened This last straw was the op pression of women in the Move ment Itself and the accounts of Robin Morgan Marge Piercy and others make the most rev elatory reading in Womens Liberation A better experiment than the Movement could not have been designed to test for the secret presence of a cul tural virus on the clear agar of idealism where it was hoped that a pure new society would grow the same old pattern ominously reasserted itself In the emerging female myth it is the throwing down of wo man from her equality that is Original Sin leading to expul sion into the communal Gar den nto the desolate wastes of the family private property and the state I find this no more irrational than the Bibli cal version Suddenly women found them selves serving as secretary mother and concubine while the men did all the speaking writing and negotiating  and these were men who professed to reject all the oppressive ritual machinery of their so ciety It is from this experience that Movement women distilled their radical and as it turns out creative mistrust of men What Beauvoir saw as so radical as to be impossible women doing without men has enabled these women to attain to an utterly new vision of human possibility The an drogynists tend to make their new ideas out of bits and scraps of traditional thinking always a sign that conversion has not gong quite deep enough Theodore Roszak for example speaks of the need for every man to come to terms with the woman [he] has locked up in the dungeons of his own psyche All diagnoses of sex ual analogy must be referred to Mary Ellmann whose Think ing About Women Harcourt Harvest 265 which might well be called Thinking v About Thinking n About Women  is a devastating anatomy of this species of men tal habit After the example of Freud and Jung she writes dryly many people like to believe that somewhere inside men on the appendix or the spleen tiny women are crouching all the time quiet and hidden but there Radical women have come to see that the packag ing of human qualities in even a metaphorical man and wo man always does injustice to individuals and that since our standard packaging is a prod uct of patriarchal culture it does the most frequent and striking injustice to female in dividuals We must do some thing much more difficult we must divest ourselves of all preconception and walk into the unknown This the rare Mary Ellman has accomplished alone by seeking not an an drogynous but an anarchic eye    never governed by incarnation the radical wo men have achieved it by tak ing hands and going to earth in their own experience Consciousness  raising makes it possible to raze pre existent structures of thought and then gradually to discover the forms potential in raw ex perience It cannot be overem phasized how radical a tech nique this is coming from crea tures who three years ago would have been damned scorned and shamed by their brothers for subjectivism To use R D Laings phrase this is the politics of experience the return of politics and all other systems of abstraction to its sole meaningful basis in the lives of human beings Equipped with this fresh sense of the structures of experience women will among other things approach the great bod ies of knowledge from a new angle and begin to revise them in a scholarship which will strive first of all to be in Toni Cades characteristic jux taposition clear analytical personal basic We already have an example of the effects of such an at titude on historical scholarship in The American Woman Who Was She edited by Anne Firor Scott Prentice Hall 245 Aileen Kraditors Up From the Pedestal Quad rangle 295 is a docu mentary history of feminism this is simply the begin nings of a history of women Statistics are here but they are always returned to life in excerpts from letters jour nals and the forgotten autobi ographies of modest rebels and witnesses The endurance in vention and liveliness with which women carried on the ordinary life of this country add up to a commonplace exhilarating heroism yet the substantial role they played in the reform of labor conditions and public health has remained equally obscure As Eleanor Flexner remarks in the bibliography to her Century of Struggle Athe neum 345 A great deal of material has been dissipated and lost reflecting not only the low worth put on it by historians and sociologists but a general attitude of the rela tive unimportance of women and their activities Male his tory chronicles the triumphs and defeats of the ego in pub lic in this history women have been foctsoldiers quartermas ters mothers inspirations priz es and the civilian body count Mrs Scotts book inaugurates what Robin Morgan has called herstory  a life of America in the female line transmitted through the female eye mind and hand What is ahead As the fem inist culture grows stronger women will be liberated once and for all from the labor of selfjustification and selfde fense always a major drain on the energies of female ad venturers and will turn to ex ploration of the arts and sci ences I would predict that within 20 years womens uni versities will be founded and endowed run by women though they will employ and admit men on largely nonaca demic qualification which will avoid some of the worst jailings of the patriarchal uni versity indifference to the com munity involvement with mill tatyindustrial interests and which will provide shelter for the development of the femi nist point of view and for the almost archeological task of reconstructing herstory These might be the first flexi ble institutions of a profound ly constructive revolution For there Is no doubt that we are entering a revolution one whose ultimate outcome is beyond imagining Simone de Beauvoir need no longer pro test that Man represents both the positive and the neutral as is indicated by the common use of man to designate hu man beings in general whereas woman represents only the neg ative defined by limiting criteria without reciprocity As many of us see it and as Robin Morgan says it we are moving beyond all known standards    beyond to a species with a new name that would not dare define itself as Man 
JUSTICES CURTAIL U.S. COURTS',https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/24/archives/justices-curtail-us-courts-role-in-state-trials-prosecutions-to-be.html,WASHINGTON Feb 23The Supreme Court instructed Federal trial judges today to curtail the growing practice of halting state prosecutions against defendants who assert that their constitutional rights are being violated In the future the high court said Federal courts should let these defendants stand trial in state courts and raise their constitutional defenses there Federal judges were told that they could stay the state proceedings and rule on the de fendants contentions only in exceptional circum stances when the state offi cials were alleged to be acting in bad faith to harass the de fendants Criticism Has Widened There has beeh widening criticism  including some from Chief Justice Warren E Burger  of the growing will ingness of threejudge Federal District Courts to shortcut state procedures by halting state trials and declaring un constitutional the laws that the states are attempting to en force Six suits that had been brought before threejudge courts were thrown out today as the Supreme Court announced its new guidelines Among them was an action by l I members of the Revolu tionary Action Movement a black militant group in New York They were seeking to bar the state from prosecuting them under New Yorks 69yearold criminal anarchy law The state is now free to try them and four others on charges of plotting to use sabo tage arson and assassination to promote terror in New York Two Fled to Algiers However two of them Her man B Ferguson and Arthur Harris have since taken up self exile in Algiers after having been convicted of plotting to murder moderate civil rights leaders The criminal anarchy indictment was handed up almost four years ago but the case was delayed because the Supreme Court heard arguments on it three times before ruling on it today Among the other rulings thrown out were one that de clared unconstitutional the use of Californias criminal anarchy law against black militants one that struck down an Illinois antiintimidation law and one that struck down the law under which the Swedish film I Am Curious Yellow had been banned in Boston The recent tendency of the Burger Court to splinter into small units was evident today as the Justices issued 17 sepa rate opinions in deciding the six cases However only Justice Wil liam O Douglas dissented from the basic ruling that the Fed eral courts should normally not interfere once a state prosecu tion is begun The willingness of Federal district judges to shortcut state prosecutions stemmed initially from a suggestion by the Su preme Court in a 1965 decision Dombrowski v Pfister That decision contained lan guage declaring that when an apparently unconstitutional state criminal law was being invoked against dissident groups to discourage them from continuing to protest three judge courts should strike the laws down Justice Hugo L Black who wrote the prevailing opinions today said that the Court had made those statements in the Dombrowski case in passing and that they were not meant to signal a change in Federal State relations He declared that principles of federalism rqquired Federal judges to refuse to hand down injunc tions or declaratory judgments to interfere with a pending state case unless the defend ants were threatened with ir reparable injury Left open was the question of whether or not threejudge courts should step in and de clare state laws unconstitu tional when state officials are threatening to use them against dissident groups but have not yet done so In a dissent from the bench Justice Douglas called the days decisions en inquest upon the famous case of Dombrowski Chief Justice Burger com plained in a recent interview and in a dissenting opinion that the Federal judiciary might be swamped by the grow ing tide of threejudge cases Since the Dombrowski case the number of such cases has almost doubled from 147 in 1965 to 291 last year Many of them were test cases challenging state laws on obscenity abortion homo sexuality vagrancy and loiter ing Many of those that are still pending may now be dis missed unless the defendants can show exceptional circum stances
More Executives Becoming Workers for Planned Parenthood,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/25/archives/more-executives-becoming-workers-for-planned-parenthood.html,Family planning started out as a womens movement because back in 1912 when Margaret Sanger coined the phrase birth control most men considered it indelicate Furthermore many saw fam ily planning as  threat to the natural rights of their sex Mrs Sanger and her fol lowers conjured up pathetic pictures of poor young moth ers with too many children dragging at their skirts pull ing theta into an early grave and then facing misery and neglectbut masculine hearts were not touched at least not enough to get men in volved Now that attitude has changed Men especially men in big business and the law yers who represent them have come to see that an ex cess of people can make life difficult for everyone no matter what their private re sources The result Executives and corporation lawyers have been leaping into Planned Parenthood especially into the moneyraising phase of it Angus C Littlejohn presi dent of the United States Trust Company International Corporation recently summed up the attitude of a good many others when he told of what he found when he came back to the New York area to live after 25 years in foreign countries The Basic Problem I couldnt get over the changes he said And pret ty soon I began to see how problems in transportation in housing in education and juvenile delinquency all go back to the basic problem of I too much population Robert V Roosa partner of Brown Brothers Harriman  Co bankers who has headed Planned Parenthoods fundraising arm the United Planned Parenthood Cam paign for the last two years is convinced that worse con ditions are in the offing and that the situation will keep on deteriorating unless the birth rate can be checked Do you realize he asked how many young unwed mothers there are in this city simply because there was no one to teach them how to keep from getting pregnant Whats it going to be like five or six years from now when all those children are ready for school And if we dont stop bringing all these babies into the world there soon wont even be enough room for us to stand up in From this kind of thinking its an easy step to want to get involved in Planned Par enthood Indeed so many men are now deep in the movement that on the na tional board of the organiza tion they outnumber women 55 to 49 And it is not at all unusual for a man to per suade his wife to become ac tive for the cause instead of the other way around Several Children for Most That is not the case with Mr Littlejohn however When asked about his wife he laughed and said Most men in Planned Parenthood youll find have five or six children I have five and they keep my wife pretty busy Be sides she ha other inter ests But George N Lindsay a lawyer in the firm of Debe voise Plimpton Lyons  Gates who is the older brother of the Mayor and who served as chairman of the national Planned Parenthood organization in 1966 67 and 68 said that he got his wife Mary into the movement And now she is on the board of the Margaret Sanger clinic Alexis C Coudert a part ner in the law firm of Coudert Brothers is another who said he led his wife into Planned Parenthood He him self was persuaded to go into it seven or eight years ago by a friend on the board he got me to be cochairman of fundraising Mrs Coudert who before her marriage 10 years ago was a fashion director in a New Jersey store didnt re quire much persuasion When I first came here and saw what a threat the popu lation explosion was I be came interested on the city level she said She added Then when my husband went on the board I also became interested in the national and international organizationspart of the money raised goes to all three and we began going to meetings and dinners to gether This year I was an associate chairman of the benefit art tour here Victor Kovner also a law yer Lankenau Kovner  Bickford is still another who was in the movement before his wife was He went into it in 1967 because since Id been active in the political life of the city I felt an obli gation beyond the direct area of family planning For instance he said Planned Parenthood was looking for those who could help with getting legislation through on abortion Medi caid reimbursements on the level of unwanted pregnan cies in minors and setting up contraceptive centersthat sort of thing The service to minors is one of our greatest concerns now Sarah Kovner who before her husband went into Planned Parenthood used to think of it as an oldfash ioned agency that was slight ly patronizing became ly patronizing became ac tive in it about a year ago and last month she organized a conference on the legal rights of minors in regard to abortion and contraception She and her husband go to meetings and dinners to gether What you soon learn said Mr Kovner is that people who are concerned with population are working with conservationists and en vironmentalists We know now that it all fits together its all one big problem Frank E Barnett chair man of the board of the Union Pacific Railroad Com pany and his wife a volun teer at the SpenceChapin Adoption Service are an other couple who are in Planned Parenthood together Risky Thing in 1959 Seeing a surplus of home less children led me to be lieve that there should just be fewer of them said Mr Barnett But while some progress is being made in that direction there will have to be a massive effort before a movement like Planned Parenthood is real ly effective A hopeful sign is that governments are be ginning to realize that popula tion explosions are going to become unmanageable One man who was preced ed into Planned Parenthood by his wife is Cass Canfield senior editor of Harper  Row and an honorary mem ber of the board of that pub lishing house That was in 1959 Jane Canfield recalled I had gone into it about 40 years ago when we had a little clinic in Mount Kisco For a long long time it was con sidered a womans problem Then in 1959 I was a dele gate to a conference in India and Cass went along as sort of an observer Well you cant go to India without being appalled He had always been sympa thetic with Planned Parent hood and when he came home he joined it It was a risky thing for a man to do in 1959 We were warned that Harpers books might be boycotted and my husband did get some crank letters But soon after he went into the movement the tide started to turn and other men began taking an active interest Mr Canfield who went on to become head of Interna tional Planned Parenthood he is now honorary chair man is presently serving on the board of the national organization Long before he went into the movement there were such valiant pioneers as Dr Alan F Guttmacher who in 1929 started working on be half of Planned Parenthood in Baltimore when he was a young obstetrician and gyne cologist at Johns Hopkins When he moved to New York in 1952 he continued working for the cause and has been president of the na tional organization since 1962 Aid From Corporations Getting large contributions used to be extremely difficult because according to Robert Roosa banks and corpora tions were afraid for a long time that if they gave they would be misunderstood One of the first to go over this hurdle was Chase John D Rockefeller 3d who is a brother of the head of Chase Manhattan Bank David Rockfeller is also a major contributor Among other businessmen who have been active recently in the Planned Parenthood movement are William H Moore chairman of the board of Bankers Trust R L Ireland who is with Brown Brothers Harri man John B M Place vice chairman of the board of Chase Manhattan and Peter L Bernstein president of BernsteinMacaulay Inc an investment advisory service Of the 25000 volunteers throughout the United States about 5000 are men In New York the percentage is even higherabout onethird Times have indeed changed since Margaret Sangers father voicing the thoughts of most males asked her if she couldnt find some other subject to talk about besides the bedroom According to Mrs Sanger he lowered his voice when he said bed room Today largely because of the men who have rallied to the cause Planned Parent hoods budget for this year is 20million20 times what it was when Cass Canfield led the way into the organ ization in 1959

Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/28/archives/supreme-court-chipping-away-at-decisions-of-warren-era.html,WASHINGTON  During the last decade the Warren Court marched up the hill of judicial intervention and during the past week it be came evident that the Burger Court has started to march down again No two steps could have been more sym bolic of the change than the rulings made by the Supreme Court last Tuesday and Wednesday backtoback On Tuesday the Burger Court had occasion to con sider the impact of an im portant decision of the Warren Court the 1965 case of Dumbrowski v Pfister The Warren Court had ap peared to say that when defendants in state prosecu tion complained to Federal courts that their rights were being violated then three judge Federal district courts should halt the prosecutions and rule on the constitution ality of the state laws that were being enforced The district judges followed the High Courts cue with such gusto that state laws on obscenity abortion subver sion homosexuality va grancy etc began to fall like tenpins until the Supreme Court called a halt last week Undermining Federalism The Burger Court took another look at the Dum browski case decided that wholesale takeovers of state prosecutions by United States judges was undermining fed eralism and instructed the district judges to halt state prosecutions only when state officials were cynically har assing the defendants On Wednesday the Burger Court poked a loophole in the decision that symbolized the Warren Courts solicitude for criminal defendants Mir anda V Arizona Earl Warren had written in that 5to4 ruling that confessions could not be used as evidence unless suspects were first warned of their rights He stressed the need to deter the police from vio lating individuals privilege against selfincrimination Warren Burger said in a 5to4 decision Wednesday that even though such con fessions could not be admit ted as evidence they could be Introduced to contradict a defendants testimony He emphasized the desirability of discovering truth in court Part of what is happening can be attributed to Presi dent Nixons success in nam ing justices who resist the Warren Courts proclivity for breaking through into new areas of law Mr Burger and President Nixons other nominee Harry A Blackmun have been on the same side of all but two of the Courts decisions this year Their union has been decisive in narrowing liberal doctrines of the Warren Court on welfare double jeopardy longshoremens in jury suits plea bargaining and now confessions But the fact that only Justide William O Douglas dissented from Tuesdays Federalism deci sion showed that even the Warren Courts liberal hold overs are having some second thought about the zest with which some Federal judges become judicial activists Justice Thurgood Marshall for instance is plainly irked at the way the district courts have extended one of his obscenity decisions to strike down a series of state and Federal antismut laws When appeals of those rulings were recently argued before the Supreme Court he grumbled repeatedly from the bench about those who stretch the law beyond its plain meaning Pending Decisions With four months still re maining in the current term it remains to be seen if this caution will continue to dom inate the Courts actions The justices have yet to make important rulings on school desegregation abortion con scientious objectors the death penalty and churchstate re lations any of which could take the Court in unantici pated directions Yet a pattern seems to be emerging as the Courts cen ter of gravity has shifted to what may soon be known as the Burger Majority composed of the Chief Jus tice Mr Blackmun and three justices who were frequent dissenters during the War ren yearsJohn M Harlan Potter Stewart and Byron R White As a group they un doubtedly disapproved much that the Warren Court did but only Mr Burger has said that he does not feel bound by those rulings Thus there seems to be little prospect at this time that most of the major holdings of recent years will be overruled Indeed the effort to have the Miranda case completely overturned seems to have run out of steam in the Jus tice Department despite At torney General John N Mit chells announcement in 1969 that a test case would be developed Last week Assist ant Attorney General Will R Wilson disclosed that his attorneys are not actively looking for such a case What the Burger Court de cisions have generally dem onstrated is that it is not necessary to overrule famous cases in order to blunt their effect The Burger Court has proved as adept as earlier Courts in finding that the facts of cases before them are different from those in prior rulings which therefore need not be followed Another technique for ig noring past opinions is the rule of jurisprudence under which statements and opin ions that are not necessary to the decision  called dictaare not binding on future cases So that if the Court holds that certain language in a prior decision was dictum then the lan guage can be ignored Last weeks two decisions ran counter to rather explicit statements in the Dombrow ski and Miranda opinions but the Court found that it was dicta and disregarded it Thus the Burger Court can blunt the thrust of the War ren Court without making a sharp break with the recent past In an informal talk last year with a group of Govern ment lawyers Mr Burger spoke of the desirability of lowering the profile of the Supreme Court after the con troversial Warren era The events of last week sug gested that the process is well under way FRED P GRAHAM

Three Ways To Solve The Welfare Problem,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/07/archives/three-ways-to-solve-the-welfare-problem-three-ways-to-solve-the.html,WHEN the Nixon Administrations Family Assistance Plan was shelved by the last Congress at the end of 1970 15 per cent of New York Citys population 25 per cent of Newarks population and 6 per cent of all Americans about 125 million people  were on welfare and since then their number has continued to rise faster than expected One would therefore think that national and local task forces would be searching for other solutions to the welfare problem But the White House  though it is still planning to revive FAP as welfare experts now call it  is preoccupied with revenue sharing And Mayor Lindsay and Congressman Wilbur Mills the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee who are trying in different ways to have the Federal Government take over welfare are worrying about who pays the bill None of the programs FAP included can do much about the welfare problem itself That problem is really in the heart of the American economy which simply does not need all the unemployed looking for work at a living wage and which cannot provide for all the working poor who require higher wages to support their families Ultimately therefore an end to the welfare problem requires either remaking the economy so that it produces full employment at a living wage or altering public beliefs about welfare so that the Government will provide the unneeded and underpaid with a decent income Had it passed the Family Assistance Plan would have aided some of the cities and states caught in a budget squeeze by constantly rising welfare costs for it increased Federal sharing in welfare expenditures but it would not have resulted in either jobs or decent incomes for the poor It did establish the salutary and muchneeded principle of a guaranteed annual income for all Americans but the guarantee came only to about 2300 for an otherwise penniless family of four 1600 plus 700 worth of food stamps an amount higher than present welfare benefits in only eight states The plan would not have improved the lot of welfare recipients in the remaining states although it would have helped the working poor or underemployed with wage supports until their income reached 3940 It could be argued of course that once the principle of a guaranteed income became law the guarantee now far below the Federal poverty line of 3800 would eventually be raised but perhaps FAP would also have established a new and lower poverty line for a long time to come for while Government benefits are usually raised over the years this is not the case with programs for the poor Thus Social Security benefits which are paid mainly to the nonpoor have gone up but Medicaid benefits have gone down and although the Federal Government established the principle of building decent housing for the poor in the late nineteenthirties the number of public housing units actually built has been declining for 15 years The Problem WHEN an economy cannot provide work for everyone some people have to be excluded from the labor force The American economy excludes the sick the blind and the old even though some may be able to work it discourages wives and mothers from working and it keeps the young out as long as possible only partly so that they can obtain more education It also excludes people without the proper job skills work habits and sometimes skin color or employs them only if they are willing to accept very low wages Many of the excluded are compensated directly by government for being left out but unemployed men are often left without help after unemployment compensation runs out unless they desert from or are rejected by their families the wives and children then becoming eligible for Aid to Families of Dependent Children or AFDC AFDC was established for widows and orphans but during the Depression it also began to help separated divorced and unmarried mothers Even then the caseload was less than half a million but after World War II it began to climb By 1956 there were more than two million recipients by 1963 almost four million and since then the number has increased at an even faster rate to five million in 1967 six and a half million in 1968 and more than eight and a half million by December 1970 Why the AFDC rolls should increase so spectacularly is still being debated by experts and critics Initially the most common explanation was the onset of unemployment with women applying for help when their jobless husbands desertedsometimes just to make their wives eligible for aid  or when separated or divorced women lost their jobs As the numbers continued to increase during the period of nearly full employment in the midsixties however other explanations were offered Daniel Patrick Moynihan who as the Presidents Counselor fought tirelessly for FAP argued in the nowfamous Moynihan Report that the increase was stimulated not just by unemployment but also by the disintegration of the black family the ravages of slavery having created matriarchal family which rejected its men even without economic cause He pointed out that the AFDC rolls were going up while black unemployment was coming down But no one knows how long it takes for a man who has lost his job to leave his family and for the family to apply for AFDC Besides aotual joblessness in the ghetto is considerably higher than that counted in official unemployment figures and may not come down even when the rest of society is prospering In recent years the rise in the number of AFDC recipients has also been explained by or blamed on actions of the Supreme Court which invalidated residence requirements that had postponed eligibility for newly arrived poor people in many states the Federal Government which through a program known as AFDCU made benefits available with a jobless man in the house overly liberal local welfare agencies which were letting too many people on the rolls and various ghetto organizations notably the National Welfare Rights Organization which were urging poor women to claim their welfare rights These explanations are not supported by the available evidence however MostAFDC recipients even those newly on the rolls are longtime residents of their communities the AFDCU program has been activated in only 25 states and only on a small scale and the rolls have risen all over the country even where welfare agencies follow restrictive practices and welfare mothers are not being organized The increasing militancy in the ghetto may have led more women to claim AFDC without organized encouragement however particularly as recent studies suggest that they feel less stigma about doing so than middleclass observers thought or thought they should In addition as Frances Piven and Richard Coward demonstrate in a forthcoming book the welfare rolls have historically been expanded to dampen political militancy among the poor and the middle nineteensixties were the years of the long hot summer The rise in the rolls is also due to a concurrent rise in the benefits paid to recipients for whenever benefits go up people with incomes below the new benefit become eligible The benefits were increased during the sixties because they had been abysmally low before and today they still average only about 180 a month for a family but there are other reasons as well As the Federal Government reimbursed a larger proportion of total welfare outlays to cities and AMERICANS ON WELFARE  Faces of recent welfare recipients dramatize the upward curve of the nations welfare population since 1965 The cost has risen sharply too  from 39billion in 1965 to 85billion in 1970 New cases are mainly in the Aid to Families of Dependent Children program states they in turn may have raised benefits because AFDC recipients are after all voters and as they become more numerous politicians are naturally more aware of their needs Even so the increase in benefits affects the rolls only when income from work fails to increase at the same rate but wage levels among the working poor have been sluggish in recent years and have not kept up 1968 with the rising benefits Consequently as Martin Rein has pointed out more people are entitled to AFDC and others are discouraged from looking for a poorly paid job if they can obtain more and steadier income from AFDC particularly in cities where they can take parttime work on the side without losing benefits For example in New York City a welfare mother can earn 2000 from such work and still obtain 3386 in addition from AFDC in Chicago AF DC will give her about 2600 in Wilmington and Phoenix about 1800 The high New York and Chicago payments stem largely from liberal state welfare supplements but neither they nor the privilege of retaining income from work are available in most other states Although there is no evidence that many women in the liberal states have given up fulltime jobs to go on welfare it is possible that they may simply have stopped looking for poorly paid jobs Nevertheless unemployment continues to be a major cause of the increase in AFDC benefits the rolls having gone up more sharply than ever in the last year and the proportion of white applicants is higher as well In a recession the lowwage and temporary jobs on which so many poor people exist are the first to disappear for when the affluent take shorter vacations and businessmen entertain less often even on expense accounts maids dishwashers and others are quickly laid off If the recession continues particularly at the lower levels of the economy which respond least quickly to Federal economic expansion policies the rolls are likely to continue to rise They may even do so if the recession 1969 ends for as far as one can tell 30 to 50 per cent of the women who may be eligible for AFDC have never applied partly because they are too proud but mainly because they do not know they are eligible Welfare agencies do not advertise their programs leaving it to the initiative of potential recipients to find out whether they are entitled to it UNLIKE the sick and disabled whose exclusion from the economy is not thought to be their own fault AFDC recipients are often blamed for going on welfare Over the years the AFDC recipient has come to be pictured as a Southern black woman who has moved to a Northern city paying high welfare benefits getting rid of her husband to become eligible for welfare and having illegitimate children to obtain more money Her absent husband has been accused of shirking his family responsibilities of being unwilling to work at unpleasant jobs or to work at all and of wanting to live off his wifes welfare income Recipients have been characterized as cheaters and welfare workers as permissive bleeding hearts unwilling to cut ineligibles off the rolls In the last couple of years public dissatisfaction with AFDC has escalated further for welfare is becoming the largest and fastestgrowing item in many municipal budgets New Yorks included Actually the popular image of welfare recipients is quite similar to that of the poor generally and refleets a widespread hostility especially toward the black poor For a long time this image was also nurtured by lack of information about AFDC recipients but now a number of studies exist which show that image to be largely incorrect To begin with recipients probably cheat less than affluent incometax filers for a recent New York experiment in which welfare applicants claimed their eligibility by personal affidavits without the usual income investigation showed that only 2 per cent had misrepresented their assets and the latest HEW study on the subject shows a 4 per cent cheating rate Even in supposedly liberal New York case workers have not become very liberal in doling out benefits and their decisions are always checked by supervisors whose job it is to make sure that no extra money is paid out Also about a quarter of the applicants are still denied entry to the rolls and others continue to be dropped for not obeying the welfare workers And recent studies in poor communities indicate that many AFDC recipients continue to live a crisisridden existence trying to make ends meet and protecting their children from the hazards of growing up in slum housing and addictridden streets As for the characteristics of AFDC recipients almost half are white although almost 45 per cent are black a high proportion considering that only 10 per cent of the total population is black but not so high considering that about a third of the poor and 42 per cent of poor children are black Few recipients move to cities with high benefits just to get on AFDC most come to find jobs Nor do they want to be on AFDC indeed all the studies suggest that like other Americans they would much rather work for a livingand almost a third are working often In parttime jobs Many go on AFDC only intermittently the average period being two to three years and remarkably few raise children who go on welfare when they become adults The largest proportion of women have been separated from their husbands a long time before going on AFDC though few are divorced divorce being a luxury they could not afford until the Office of Economic Opportunity started to provide free legal services Most welfare recipients do not have illegitimate children but in cities like Chicago and New York about a third of black recipientsare unmarried mothers even though only a few have children with more than one father Illegitimacy has always been high among the poor mainly because they could not afford abortions and it has been higher among blacks because forced marriage to legitimize children the reason for less illegitimacy among poor whites has not been considered a viable solution When unemployment rates for young blacks are between 25 and 40 per cent men shy away from marriage even when they become fathers and the women are understandably reluctant to marry men with little prospect of becoming breadwinners Even so a new study by Phillips Cutright demonstrates again that increases in AFDColls or benefits do not stimulate an increase in illegitimacy THE distinguishing characteristic of most AFDCecipients is of course family breakup but this too is only another symptom of their economic difficulties While about twothirds of all poor families stay together family breakup has also always been frequent among the poor particularly when men have not been able to obtain steady jobs A mans role in the family and his selfrespect are based mainly on his ability as a breadwinner and when he fails and fails repeatedly he may eventually either desert or be pushed out by his wife especially if she has a steadier source of support through work or welfare This pattern of family breakup was prevalent in the past among white immigrant groups during hard times despite their reputation for family stability And despite the popular belief that family breakup is today a predominantly black phenomenon it is found in poor white and Puerto Rican areas too and all over the world wherever men lack steady work and women have more reliable sources of income Sociological studies also indicate that most of the men want steady work and would remain with their families if they could get it The popular stereotype has it that deserters are nonchalant swingers enjoying a troublefree existence but in reality they are depressed men whose repeated failure in the job market has sapped their selfconfidence Some manifest their depression by the rejection of all responsibility some by escape into alcohol others by pursuing sexual success when economic success is impossible to achieve True in recent years some men have become reluctant to accept lowpaying jobs but they do so knowing that they cannot support their families with such jobs and fearing that they will lose the jobs eventually anyway and suffer further loss of selfconfidence Younger menand womenare now sometimes unwilling to accept unpleasant or deadend jobs but this is true of young people at all income levels except perhaps for some hippies and that unwillingness almost always ends when the young people become parents Undoubtedly there are shirkers among the poor but they can also be found among the rich who are called playboys and among the rest of the population for every office and factory numbers a few people who loaf on the job Except among the poor however shirkers usually manage to stay employed despite their reluctance to exert themselves The fact that welfare now supports about 15 per cent of New Yorks population when the citys official unemploy ment rate stands at 5 per cent might suggest that there are many more shirkers among the poor Actually the welfare percentage is higher because it includes children while the unemployment figure includes only the labor force Even so if one adds to the officially unemployed the people who have after repeated failure given up looking for work and are therefore no longer counted as being in the labor force the real unemployment rate is probably at least twice the official rate Moreover familial breakup may also be caused by the mans bringing home a wage too small to support his family The working poor with fulltime jobs make up more than a quarter of Americans now living below the poverty line and it is possible that the AFDC rolls also include some families whose breadwinner though employed left his family because he could not support it properly on wages of 60 to 80 a week and such wages are still being paid to many men in New York Until recently America has ignored the working poor perhaps because of the belief that if men have jobs they can solve their other problems The inaccuracy of this belief is well illustrated by Kenneth Clarks 1964 study of Harlem in which he found a higher correlation between social pathology and underemployment than unemployment As he concluded Apparently the roots of pathology in central Harlem lie not primarily in unemployment  [but] in the low status of the jobs held by the residents of the community The Solutions NEW solutions to the welfare problem are difficult to invent for there are really only two alternatives decently paid and steady jobs for those who can work and income in lieu of work for those who cannot Providing the jobs also boils down to two alternatives job training for the skilled bluecollar and whitecollar worker most likely to be available in our type of economythat is fitting the unskilled whether employed or unemployed to a job or finding decently paid unskilled work for themthat is creating jobs to fit the people Job training has been underway since the midsixties as part of the War on Poverty but so far without much success Training the unskilled is a new idea and effective techniques are still lacking particularly to persuade fearful and inexperienced trainees to stick with the program and employers and coworkers to be patient with them More often however job training has failed because despite all the statistics about vacancies in skilled work the jobs have just not been available Offthejob training did not work because the trainers had no access to jobs or had access only to deadend jobs and these neither made use of the training nor could long hold the trainees As a result manpower experts began to emphasize onthejob training which guarantees a job at the end of a course as is normally the case with executive training schemes but such guarantees are more difficult to make in the factory than in the executive suite For example after the ghetto uprisings companies which worried about the fate of plants near the ghettos hired and trained some of the socalled hardcore unemployed but as Federal grants for this proornm ran out the danger of further ghetto disturbances passed and the recession began rrnnv of those hired were jobless again Trainees particularly those earmarked for the better jobs also ran into opposition from older workers who objected that they had put in long years at lowerpaying levels and saw no reason why newcomers should not pass the same hurdles Older workers were also unhappy about the newcomers because they were black sometimes brought ghetto militancy with them and were thought to be taking jobs away from friends and relatives of the older men as they sometimes did when companies hired only trainees who were after all being subsidized by the Government One type of job training which has been somewhat more successful has involved paraprofessionals men and women who were trained as aides to teachers doctors nurses and other professionals This program has achieved as much success as it has because Government funds were available both to create the jobs and to train people for them but even professionals feared that the paraprofessionals might invade their turfs so that too many paraprofessional jobs became deadend Nevertheless job  training efforts ought to be stepped up particularly in the paraprofessional occupations for they can offer dignified and steady work But job training alone is not enough more jobs must be created for the trainees of low enough status not to threaten incumbent workers and yet with enough future promise to attract and hold trainees The second alternative to create jobs that unskilled workers can fill at once without training would be simpler and faster Although this approach could be used in private industry particularly if the Government stopped granting tax writeoffs for laborsaving machinery and put a punitive tax on further automation it may be impossible to fight technological progress Consequently the Government ought to become the employer of last resort hiring the unskilled for publicworks programs This is perhaps still the easiest way to make new jobs and almost every community needs to build new hospitals rebuild its sewers clean up its waterways and construct more public housing Unfortunately these jobs would be mostly deadend thus providing only a temporary solution although if the jobs were well paid their deadendness might be less of a detriment Low pay is just one of the shortcomings of the jobcreation scheme recently announced by the Administration BUT there is a different approach to job creation which might not result in as much opposition from incumbent workers or so many deadend jobs for rather than adding new workers at the bottom as do most present schemes it would make changes at the top What have in mind is promoting the most skilled workers in factories and offices to a master status like the master teacher who Tanks above ordinary teachers moving all other workers up a notch letting the unemployed and underemployed fill the vacancies that develop at the bottom and allowing them to work their way up in the traditional manner Private enterprise would have no incentive to undertake such a scheme and much of its cost would have to be borne by the Federal Government but the unions might well give it political support because it would mean raises for present workers and new union members as well Another version of this approach would have the Government offer special extra pensions to all older employed workers willing to retire a bit earlier than they planned move younger workers into vacated slots and again place the unemployed and underemployed at the bottom Both of these top  down approaches could also be used in Government employment Another approadh to job creation which has long been advocated by conservative economists and politicians is to abolish the minimum wage so that private enterprise can make new jobs by cutting its labor costs Presumably all kinds of new manufacturing and service employment could spring up if workers were available at 1 to 150 an hour Abolishing the minimum wage would however be disastrous it should in fact be raised from the present 160 an hour which is below the poverty line to 250 and more in high costofliving areas Still an experiment might be set up to allow employers to create genuine new jobs at less than minimum wages with the Government paying wage supplements to the new workers to bring their total pay up to the minimum wage I have proposed Such an experiment would undoubtedly be politically popular for it would get people off the dole and help lowwage industries and regions of the country The scheme might of course create mostly deadend jobs although the wage supplements could be continued at decreasing rates if the newly created jobs were upgraded Even so the experiment ought to be tried only long enough to discover if it would establish viable new jobs for it has potentially dangerous possibilities Among other things it could lead to a stampede of presently underemployed people to the new jobs and it would create havoc with existing wage levels in any case It would also subsidize employers who exploit their workers when they could actually pay higher wages it might motivate employers to cheat by not hiring more skilled workers and it would encourage or perpetuate inefficient firms which can survive only by paying low wages Appropriate limitations would have to be established to exclude the exploiters and cheaters but in a period when new jobs are scarce it may be desirable to maintain inefficient employers as long as they provide new jobs and Government can supplement wages so that the new workers can support their families properly The main trouble with jobcreation schemes is that they require large governmental subsidies one reason why job training which is less costly has been so popular in Washington and why the President last year vetoed a pioneering new manpower bill which included funds to create jobs With unemploydient remaining high however the Administration has just reversed itself and now proposes to establish 200000 lastresort public service jobs Unfortunately 200000 is just a drop in the bucket and the pay is to be at least 120 an hour far below the present minimum wage While the Presidents action is a break with Republican tradition the Government has long been creating new jobs in an indirect fashion the Army has always been an employer of last resort for poor boys and Department of Defense appropriations Government tax writeoffs and other subsidies have established many new industrial jobs at Government expense The Government is also moving into job maintenance funding retraining programs for jobless engineers subsidizing bankrupt railroads stimulating highway construction and continuing with the supersonic plane at least in part to prevent the further disappearance of jobs Given the political power of the Pentagon the incumbent workers and their unions however it is not likely that Washington will soon create large numbers of wellpaid jobs for poor people with less political clout particularly when their work problems are popularly conceived to be their own fault UNLESS such new jobs are created deliberately or found in some other way the unemployed and the working poor must be supported through some form of income grant until employment at a Wing wage is available and that grant should go to the men wherever possible so that further family breakups can be avoided Unfortunately giving ablebodied men incomes for not working violates a fundamental American belief that they should earn only by laboring and whenever pollsters ask the public to choose between guaranteeing the poor jobs or incomes a large majority always prefers the former In practice this belief has already been rejected at least by Government for it is much easier to send checks to the jobless or their wives than to bring new jobs into being Moreover the belief that people should not be paid if they do not work puts the blame for poverty on the poor whereas the blame really belongs on the economy which cannot use them at a living wage While that economy has produced more affluence for more people than any other in history it has never produced full employment at a living wage except perhaps in World War B In fact unemployment and underemployment are natural byproducts of the American economy just as pollution is a byproduct of current methods of industrial production The economy can produce relative affluence for perhaps twothirds of the population although real affluence for no more than a quarter because it is free to exclude or underpay the remainder and pass the burden for their upkeep to government just as it has traditionally passed the burden for removing pollution to government But if the excluded and underpaid who are citizens and taxpayers like everyone else  and actually pay a higher proportion of their income in taxes than anyone elsehad to be incorporated into the economy as full members they would reduce the affluence of the majority Consequently if the poor indirectly subsidize the affluent by being kept from participation in the economy the affluent ought to subsidize the poor in return by income in lieu of work Opponents of this position will argue that before we resort to paying without requiring work the poor ought to be forced to take the jobs they are now reluctant to take whatever the wage in a similar vein whites who came up the hard way have insisted that the black poor ought to make it the same way instead of going on welfare This argument ignores three facts that the blacks came up in harder ways than anyone else having worked as slaves for no pay whatever that they have often been pushed out of better jobs or kept in the worst ones by discrimination and that they nevertheless keep trying to come up as the kinds of jobs held by the working poor and welfare recipients will attest As for the young people who now sometimes refuse to follow this route they have absorbed the same values concerning job satisfaction and mobility as every other young American One can rail against their having learned the prevailing American job standards of course but then one cannot complain if they protest through demonstrations and civil disturbance that they are not allowed to share in the prevailing American standard of living The most potent argument against giving people incomes without work continues to be the matter of work incentive the popular belief being that if someone can obtain income without working he or she will not seek work Indeed historically AFDC and other welfare benefits have been kept low so that the incentive to work is not eliminated Nevertheless there is considerable reason to believe that work incentive would not be affected by income in lieu of work For one thing welfare recipients do work and want to work for another people work not only for the income but to gain satisfaction or at least to keep busy and most important to retain their selfrespect Among already employed people pay raises seem to increase work incentive and striving for further raises and when industrial firms institute short workweeks even without a loss in pay many of the workers generate additional work incentive and moonlight on a second job Moreover current OEO experiments which pay a negative income tax to a sample of poor families are showing that instead of being content with the OEO funds these families are increasing their earnings from other sources Consequently the popular belief about income and work incentive may be upside down and if poor people have a sufficient income to start with their desire to do better may enhance their incentive to work and to get off the dole Conversely forcing them to get by on the lowest welfare grant possible may keep them so busy with daytoday survival that they lack the energy morale and hopefulness to look for work In fact the only instance in which an income grant will discourage people from working or looking for a job occurs when the work pays less or when it is unpleasant unsteady and unable to provide selfrespect Thus income grants may increase reluctance among the poor to perform the underpaid dirty work which they are now
forced to perform where welfare benefits are too low for survival STILL giving people incomes instead of jobs is not the happiest solution for as long as work is a measure of being needed and a major source of selfrespect longterm unemployment will be socially and psychologically debilitating and being on the dole has much the same effect But if the economy cannot make decent jobs available an income grant should be considered a reward for staying out of the economy just as war veterans are rewarded for their services to the nation Furthermore if the old and disabled are entitled to a decent income without working so are people unable to find work and if AFDC mothers are entitled to incomes so that they can raise their children properly so are unemployed or underemployed men for they play an equally important role in the family In all justice an income in lieu of work or in support of underpaid work ought to come out of the profits of the same private economy that excludes people for if a company increases its profits by firing or underpaying workers it should pay the cost of supporting them just as polluters should be required to pay the costs to others of their pollution Since American tradition seems to require that government pay for these byproducts of the economy however the income grant will have to be governments responsibility The best way of providing such a grant would be to revive the Family Assistance Plan but with a higher guaranteed income such as the 5600 proposed by Senator Eugene McCarthy last year A guarantee at this level would not only eliminate poverty at one fell swoop but would also solve the problems of the working poor it might win political support from more Americans than the original plan Persuading WAITING FOR WELFARE A West Side social services center Welfare Gans says is becoming the largest and fastestgrowing item in many municipal budgets New Yorks included About 15 per cent of the cityand 6 per cent of the nationis on relief Congress and the more affluent taxpayers of the wisdom of a 5600 guarantee is likely to be difficult however and there are already indications that only the most minimal Family Assistance Plan will have a chance of passage in the new Congress In fact Congressman Mills who supported FAP last year has proposed putting the welfare program under the aegis of the Federal Government instead Although his plan is also intended as a substitute for revenuesharing it will either freeze or reduce welfare rolls and benefits Mr Mills is no friend of the welfare recipient and it eliminates FAPs provisions to help the working poor If a 5600 FAP is out of the question for political reasons I would favor two other strategies first to develop a diversified program of multipleincome grants instead of relying on a single grant like AFDC or FAP and second to extend the grants not only to the poor and working poor but also to nearaffluent moderateincome Middle America Unlike a singleincome grant which draws all of the political animus toward the poor a program of diversified grants scatters the opposition and if one part of the program is rejected by Congress others can still be considered Grants that bring benefits to Middle Americans will enroll political support from many of the potential beneficiaries If the Nixon Administration is successful in reviving last years 2300 FAP which it has just resubmitted to Congress at 2200 or if the Mills plan becomes law a program of additional multipleincome supports might include the following New local versions of the present AFDC program which whatever its many faults has the virtue of being in existence and sending out checks Indeed as Nathan Glazer pointed out last year in New York AFDC has in some respects become an income grant now that some of the more punishing features for example the regulations taxing away all work income prohibiting payments when there is a man in the house etc have been abolished  A family allowance to go to every family with children rich or poor to aid parents in paying the costs of raising their children Many European countries and Canada have long paid family allowancesand despite popular belief without an increase in the birth rate Technically speaking a family allowance is not even an anti poverty measure partly because the allowance is normally not high enough by itself to provide escape from poverty although there is no reason it could not be set higher but mainly because it goes to every family even if affluent parents would return most of the allowance through taxes This latter feature makes it inefficient but gives it the great political virtue of appealing to a huge constituency not just the poor  Wage supports like those proposed in the Family Assistance Plan and like the wage supplements I suggested earlier to create new jobs to go to all presently employed working poor until they too earn 5600 or better still6 600 the annual income which is according to a recent Gallup poll the minimum a family of four needs to get along  Housing assistance for families who cannot afford to pay the going and constantly increasing costs of housing This subsidy would be quite popular with the sizable number of people the children of the World War H baby boom who are about to have youngsters of their own and will need some financial help in obtaining housing for at present only the most affluent third of the population can afford the housing being built Rent subsidies would have to be accompanied by builder subsidies and public housing programs to make sure that more housing is built however otherwise rents will just be raised to absorb the subsidies wherever housing is in short supply  Student supports to pay children from lowincome and moderate income families to finish high school and go on to college or technical school so they will have an equal opportunity in the skilled labor market of the future The Government already subsidizes college students and there is no reason why it Should not also help less affluent youngsters at lower levels of schooling Many other subsidies could be included under a multiple programfor example longerterm unemployment compensation Social Security for every old person and national health insurance for all It might also be useful to try A more efficient substitute would award parents too poor to nay Federal income tax the 625 deductions for children that now provide a family subsidy to taxpayers but this negative family allowance would go only to the poor and would not help moderateincome Americans some new onesfor example a migration allowance to enable people to move out of areas where jobs are scarce a car grant to make it possible for the poor and working poor to Obtain automobiles in areas which will not build mass transit and free or cheap antipoverty insurance a scheme proposed by Amitai Etzioni to insure people against becoming poor which might be especially useful for the many families who fall temporarily below the poverty line The Cost My proposal for multiple income grants carries a heavy price tag the cost of the 5600 FAP alone has been estimated at 20  billion and it might go as high as 60billion if workers are given wage supports to bring them closer to the national median income10 000 In comparison the Nixon Administrations FAP would cost only about 5  billion a year as does the current Federal share of AFDC payments The other grants which would pay lesser amounts but to more people would be equally costly although they would be needed less urgently if a 5600 FAP became the law of the land My earlier suggestions for job creation and wage supplements would be even costlier but more of the outlay would be returned to the Government through higher taxes generated by economic growth Proposals that cost 20billion or more naturally raise the question of who is to pay for them although this question might not be raised quite so belligerently in the case of multiple grants which go to a sizable portion of the population Moreover the first question might lead to a second one that has long needed asking Who isand who should besubsidized by the Government either directly or through tax exemptions Most subsidies now go to producers and employers rather than employes or consumers although not all are by any means undesirable Many enable producers to compete in the world market and to provide jobs for American workers but others allow entrepeneurs and speculators to make unreasonable profits Even the subsidies for ordinary citizens go to those needing them leastfor example stockholders investors pursuing capital gains and homeowners Moreover the big corporations pile up undistributed profits in good times the rich continue to pay less of their income in taxes than the rest and the very rich almost nothing at all so that in effect their share of Government costs is paid by the taxpayers of moderate and lesser income Incidentally these taxpayers might think differently about the subsidies and tax benefits for which they pay if they were also called welfare programs if the oil depletion allowance were described as the Oil Producers Public Assistance Program or we talked about the Tobacco Growers Dole Aid to Dependent Airlines or Supplementary Benefits to Purchasers of TaxExempt Bonds Joseph Pechman has recently observed that if unnecessary producer subsidies and tax exemptions that benefit mainly the rich and very rich were eliminated the Government could raise 25billion more a year in taxes enough to pay for much of a 5600 FAP Furthermore since those who benefit from the exclusionary consequences of the economy should subsidize those who suffer from them the Government should levy an income  equalization tax surcharge much like the equalization payments the Government now gives to poorer states and cities on the most affluent 20 per cent of the population those earning 15000 or more An additional 500 tax on people earning 150 with progressively higher surcharges for the more affluent would bring in about 10billion year Even less affluent people might be willing to pay somewhat higher taxes if they could obtain directly some of the grants I have described and some tax moneys should be available for equalization purposes if the President withdraws all troops and weapons from Indochina Subsidies that go to people of low income might also be a good investment for the Government for they would spend the money on goods and services they cannot afford now thus stimulating more economic growth than corporate tax writeoffs for laborsaving technology THERE is a third solution to the welfare problem which I have not mentioned so far to reduce welfare eligibility through reinstating residence and other punitive requirements cut benefits to absolute subsistence levels and force recipients to work at starvation wages This solution seems to have generated considerable political interest of late judging by the various restrictive amendments added to FAP by conservative Senators last fall and by an earlier unsuccessful attempt by a House committee to overturn Supreme Court rulings on residence and a maninthehouse and to freeze total welfare expenditures Public support for this solution may not be lacking either for cutbacks in the welfare budget are being demanded in many communities and New Yorks public employes who are seeking higher salaries are asking as did one fireman If the city has 2billion a year for the bums on welfare how come they have no dough for us Although one might be saddened by the attempts of the near affluent to improve their incomes at the expense of the poor they are just being rational for taking from the poor requires only a reallocation of already available public monies whereas taking from the rich would probably require new taxes on them which would never be levied if past performance is any guide Besides asking the poor to pay more or get less is a timehonored American tradition though it also exists in Europe and even in some socialist countries It is possible that this tradition may have to end however for the poor of today are not quite like the poor of yesteryear as I indicated earlier they are beginning to obtain some political influence at least in the larger cities Restrictive measures against AFDC recipients might also stoke the everpresent anger in the ghetto but most poor people are not militant and the most immediate effect of a welfare cutback would be more family breakups and an increase in various pathologies in poor neighborhoods with higher bills for more police protection prisons hospitals and the like Still the major effect of restrictive measures will be on the country as a whole for pushing the poor further out of the economy and into the underclass that Gunnar Myrdal identified some years ago will add to the polarization of American society Fortunately or unfortunately polarization can continue for a long time without serious deleterious consequences for the rest of the population after all many generations passed

Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/07/archives/a-priest-views-movie-priests-from-bing-to-marcello.html,WHATEVER happened to Father Chic OMalley As casually portrayed by Bing Crosby in Going My Way and The Bells of St Marys he jauntily strolled through a world in which his likable easygoing personality was able to transform teenage hoodlums into choir boys to persuade hardened businessmen to become paragons of charity to deter young lovers from premarital sex to move prostitutes to reform and even to convert an old Irish pastor into a golf enthusiast A little crooning by Father OMalley of such profoundly religious lyrics as Up ahead is rainbow hill going my way seemed to be all that was needed to encourage people to mend their ways While neither Father OMalleys nor the films vision of the priesthood went any deeper than a black suit and Roman collar the films had a warm and affirmative approach to humanity which made viewing them a pleasant diversion However times and tastes change and so do cinematic visions of the priesthood Recently on the silver screen as heirs to Father Chic we have had the moronic priest of MASH the gravytrain riding weak bourgeois clerics of Bunuels Tristana the little boy lost priest with girl friend of Pieces of Dreams and the musical monk  social reformer of Act of the Heart The latest star of the genre is the wheelingdealing bureaucrat cleric played by Marcello Mastroianni in The Priests Wife Religion at least institutional and organized religion seems to have fallen on bad times One problem is that religions symbols dont seem to be expressing contemporary mans selfunderstanding nor does religions depiction of God seem to answer contemporary mans search for a transcendent a value or a person that will give his life experience an ultimate meaning Increasingly both religious thinkers and philosophers have turned toward a study of the mass media in order to understand mans need and desire for a meaning an identity and a destiny that will satisfy him As a priest and philosopher involved daily with the mystery of the transcendent God and as a movie buff whose idea of interesting stimulating and entertaining leisure time is seeing a good Flick I welcomed the new rash of films about priests with enthusiastic expectation and excitement Sympathetic to Eugene ONeills claim that all dramatic est is worthless unless It deals with mans relationship with God I believe that there is much material for significant cinema in the life of a priest Since just about every human value comes under the cynical scalpel of the makers of MAPH it would seem to be pointless to single out and dwell on the presentation of the priest apart from a thorough discussion of the entire film The depiction of priests in Tristana is part of Bunuels onesided but nevertheless perceptive view of organized religion which view deserves study by organized religions defenders The view of clerics presented by Bunuel is part of the Spanish directors larger vision his view of evil as staining all human activity Bunuels scorn seems to focus more on the clerical state as a caste in society than on the meaning of the priesthood More interesting as attempts at depicting visions of priesthood are Pieces of Dreams and Act of the Heart In Pieces of Dreams director Daniel Haller tries to zero in on the problems of the contemporary young priest among questioning Catholics in a changing Church The young priests problems are depicted honestly and at least in the early part of the film quite well The difficulty of rectory living with an older priest whose vision of the ministry is quite different the annoyance of parish busy work the misunderstanding and suspicion of parishioners the agony of struggling with important questions such as abortion and birth control these and other problems are touched upon in the film However when the priest Robert Forster begins his love affair with a young divorced social worker the film becomes increasingly diffuse confused and confusing It is difficult to tell whether the film is trying to say too much or to say almost nothing about the presentday priest If the latter the film succeeds When Father Gregory Lindthe Little boy lost looking for little boy found in the song which Peggy Lee sings on the sound trackleaves the priesthood the viewer is not quite sure why or what he is leaving Pieces of Dreams raises good questions but its vision of the priesthood is too much on the surface to actualize sustain or develop the drama of a priest struggling with the meaning of his life Paul Almonds Act of the Heart is a more interesting study Donald Sutherland plays Father Michael an Augustinian monk temporarily assigned to conduct a concert in which Martha Genevieve Bujold a young romantic girl from the local Anglican choir will be a soloist Eventually the priest falls in love with and marries the apparently strongly religious girl There is only a cursory suggestion of Father Michaels problems dissatisfaction with the Churchs attempts at reform discomfort with the clerical role need to affirm his humanity unrealized desire to work for social justice Though the role of the monk in the film is secondary Almonds film is nevertheless an interesting if ultimately disappointing treatment of the priesthood However the priestly figure in center stage is not Father Michael but Martha It is she who feels the need to worship God to make reparation and ultimately to sacrifice herself for the sake of her fellow men The crucifixes altars scriptural passages and other religious symbols more easily introduced because of Father Michaels presence in the plot are meaningful and relevant for the films development because of their relation to Martha Feeling that among humans she is special and that she never will be understood by her contemporaries the extremely neurotic if not psychotic young girl feels she must live according to her own inner convictions These ultimately lead her to selfimmolation The film ends with Martha dousing herself with gasoline and then burning herself to ashes on a hill She feels that her act of the heart imitates Christs selfsacrifice Mr Almond whose earlier Isabel indicated a talent of great promise is a master of cinematic technique However Act of the Heart is interesting probing and exciting only as long as the religious problems remain real The ending makes clear that Marthas spiritual intensity is the product of a soul not saintly but sick Through montage that abounds with religious symbols Almond suggests Important religious questions but the potential drama between God and man gives way to a psychological exploration of a pitiable religious fanatic The main interest of the new film The Priests Wife is that it may be the most strongly anticlerical film ever made Chased through much of the film by Sophia Loren Father Mario Carlesi played by Marcello Mastroianni finally succumbs and decides to leave the priesthood and marry his persistent pursuer Trying to be released from his priestly obligations through proper channels Father Carlesi runs into a detour in the form of Vatican bureaucracy Lured by a Vatican office job and the rank of monsignor Carlesi decides to hold on to the priesthood and let go of Sophia Well not really let go since the clerical Casanova suggests that Sophia might take a nearby apartment and be his mistress Even if some of the abuses depicted in the film really exist in the Italian Church the overall effect of The Priests Wife is a onedimensional at times bludgeoning attack which diminishes in cinematic value as the anger of its creators becomes more evident Never missing chance for target practice on what they take to be the priesthood or the Church the makers of The Priests Wife engage in an overkill that turns their film into an unreal diatribe Cinematic visions of the priesthood change It may seem like a long road from Father Chic OMalley to Monsignor Mario Carlesi but in terms of cinematic exploration of the drama between God and man it is little more than a change from a black suit to a Roman cassock Neither gets to the heart of the matter Though some other films about priests are coming up I have heard that among moviemakers interest in the topic is waning Perhaps its just as well The last time I saw Father Chic OMalley he was telling Sister Ingrid Bergman that any time she had difficulties or needed help she should just dial O for OMalley A few more depictions of priests such as the one in The Priests Wife and I may dial O for OMalley myself

Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/11/archives/mayor-lindsays-record-on-welfare.html,To the Editor John A Hamiltons observations on the growing welfare caseload [OpEd Feb 22] reflects the frustration felt by all of us who deal with the problem day after day But in charging that Mayor Lindsay among others has been most derelict in doing anything meaningful about it Mr Hamilton is wrong First it is wrong to say that Mayor Lindsay has done next to nothing to expand the citys familyplanning services At the start of the Lindsay administration five years ago there was virtually no cityoperated familyplanning service at all Based on recent studies by the Rand Institute estimating the number of lowincome women do New York City in need of familyplanning services the city calculates that It now provides service for at least onethird of this population Here are some of the steps that have been taken In 1965 there were no familyplanning services offered in Health Depattment clinics Today clinics in 22 locations account for over 67000 patient visits a year In addition over the last four years the Human Resources Administration in cooperation with the Health Services Administration and Planned Parenthood has established eleven neighborhoodbased family clinics servicing over 100000 women Familyplanning services in municipal hospitals have been greatly expanded so that today fifteen such hospitals provide for 72000 patient visits annually in familyplanning clinics In the last two years the Health Department has mounted a pioneering program whereby local community women are trained to deliver familyplanning counseling to inpatients at 33 municipal and voluntary hospitals Sixty counselors now see 5600 patients each month Thirty more counselors offer familyplanning counseling to all women receiving abortions in municipal hospitals Familyplanning resources remain critical needbut clearly the citys effort thus far does not warrant the charge of dereliction Mr Hamilton is also wrong in saying that the citys daycare facilities are mostly on paper In the last five years the city has doubled the number of daycare centers and tripled the number of children in day care from 5000 in 1966 to 16500 today Contrary to the assertion of Controller Beame there was no Federal money available to the city for day care until ten months ago When we put these funds to use immediately to unclog the backlog of unfunded programs The city expects to provide daycare space for 16000 additional children in the next twelve months and a total of 51000 spaces by 1972 Obviously this program will not meet the total needs of New Yorks children but derelict is surely not the appropriate word to describe what we have done and hope to do In the area of manpower Mr Hamilton concludes that the citys program is run in a slipshod fashion He ignores the fact that over 45000 former or potential welfare clients have gone to work in public service job programs run by the city and that the 30 million of city funds contributed to manpower programs is probably greater than the contribution of any city or state in the nation To reduce fragmentation among these programs the city has brought to life the New York CAMPS committee local coordinating body for all manpower programs Both The Times and the Economic Development Council of New York City Inc have commended this effort Unless this nation achieves a fullemployment economy a total refcirm of the existing welfare system and commitment of much larger resources to daycare familyplanning and manpower programs our city cannot meet the needs of the poor If we do not succeed it will be because of the absence of a national commitment to end poverty not because of lack of a concern or attention here RICHARD R AURELIO Deputy Mayor New York March 2 1971
Religion,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/14/archives/catholic-right-challenge-by-a-small-but-very-determined-band.html,Several months ago a group of Roman Catholics wearing red berets was arrested on charges of breaking into a hospital clinic in Washington D C to protest the performing of abortions Contrary to what might be assumed from their style the demonstrators were not from the militant Catholic left but quite the opposite Backed by an organization known as the Sons of Thunder they spoke for new if still relatively small force in American Catholicismthe militant right Frustrated over what I v regard as overimplementation of the liberal trends of Vatican II impatient over papal tolerance of heresy in the Netherlands and elsewhere and scandalized by trends toward liberal abortion laws a hard core of Catholic conservatives has begun to adopt the tacticsand confront the problemsthus far associated only with the left Among recent evidence is the following Parochial Schools A number of conservative Catholic organizations notably Catholics United for the Faith and the Society for the Christian Commonwealth have begun campaigns to back parentoperated alternatives to official parochial schools The campaigns result from a conviction that churchsponsored schools have sold out to sex education doctrinally spineless catechisms and other liberal influences Financial Boycotts The 12000member National Federation of Laymen has begun Operation Salvation which Is aimed at withholding funds from parishes whose schools reflect humanistic and Freudian values Among the techniques are cards to place in offering baskets in lieu of money and bumper stickers both proclaiming No doctrine no dollars Dropouts From the Right Whereas most defectors from the faith have been restless liberals noticeable numbers of conservatives also have begun to drop out Alphonse J Matt Jr associate editor of the traditionalist weekly newspaper The Wanderer reported last week that his journal was receiving numerous subscription cancellations from readers who feel they have been betrayed by the hierarchy Most give up on any church others join Eastern Orthodos Eastern Rite Roman Catholic or even Protestant fundamentalist bodies Open Criticism of the Hierarchy Whereas most public opposition to Pope Paul VI and other church leaders has been from the left conservatives have now become increasingly vocal In an interview last week William A Marra a lay philosopher at Fordharn University expressed typical traditionalist frustration with the Pontiff He looks at all the heresy that is rampant in the chanceries and all he can do is weep Mr Marra said The most charitable thing you can say about him is that he Is ineffectual Assessing the size of either the left or the right in American Catholicism is tricky business One measure of the left is the 65000 circulation of the National Catholic Reporter a weekly newspaper that has been must reading for Catholic reformists Activists on the right probably number a good deal less than that but claim in effect that they are the tip of the iceberg and that they have the tacit support of many nonactivist laymen and priests Right now both sides are probably losing ground in absolute terms because as Michael Lawrence an editor of the traditionalist monthly Triumph put it Catholics are getting tired of religious fights Mr Lawrence sees this as a boost for conservatives because people want to cool things for a while and live with what we have Most traditionalists however seem to believe that the liberal reforms of Vatican II have now become so normative that it is the liberals who have more to gain by preserving the status quo The result has been the new militance of remaining rightist militants and widespread debate among them over how to restore the church to past values One approach has been to challenge the legitimacy of church leaders and their policies The Rev Gommar A DePauw founder of the Catholic Traditionalist Movement has gone further than most conservatives and charged that last years revision of the Order of file Mass by the Vatican was illicit Criticism of the Pope Veritas a smallcirculation publication emanating from Louisville has sharply criticized Pope Paul and administered to him its WhackofShillelagh Award a sort of ecclesiastical Fickle Finger of Fate prize for among other things conspiring with enemies of God It has also demoted Archbishop Thomas J McDonough of Louisville to Father McDonough The Remnant which broke off from The Wanderer which has a circulation of 45000 has publicly wondered about the legitimacy of the new mass but some traditionalists have been wary even of raising such questions We sometimes wonder about Vatican policies like the diplomatic initiatives with Communist countries said Mr Matt But with the hierarchy so much under siege these days we try to avoid saying things that will undermine their authority even further The Wanderer handled the mass question by inspiring a committee to work on a new translation of the Latin original that might satisfy both the American hierarchy and rightist laymen In the area of morality the greatest militancy has come from Triumph a Washingtonbased monthly edited by Brent Bozell a brotherinlaw of William F Buckley Jr the conservative columnist It has systematically set traditional Catholic thought against many policies of the state The journal which has lost some friends by its assertion that state aid to parochial schools will destroy their Catholic character has focused on the life issue  the threat of birth control and abortion to the Christian concept of the dignity of human life Also it has raised the question of whether a Catholic should pay taxes to Federal and state governments that give at least tacit assent to abortions Conscience Problem I would face a serious problem of conscience if I lived in a state like New York said Mr Lawrence The vanguard of civil disobedience from the right are the Sons of Thunder They claim a hardcore membership of 150 and are led by a strapping 24yearold Triumph editor named Bradley Evans who has long hair and wears a rosary and a St Theresa medal around his neck In addition to demonstrations the Sons of Thunder have begun organizing antiabortion counseling clinics whose volunteer doctors are committed to convincing pregnant women to have their babies Along with others in the Triumph circle they are thinking of setting up communities of Catholics committed to living according to the principles of natural law and dream of the day when the Government of the United States will be changed into a sort of modified theocracy How much support the various shades of Catholic traditionalism will garner has yet to be seen but it is clear that a small but committed core is ready to challenge not only secular values In general but also the leaders of the church themselves Our greatest enemies are the bureaucrats in the chanceries who still retain the lingering good will of moderately educated Catholics said Mr Marra On this point we understand tie liberals very well EDWARD B FISKE
Medicine,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/14/archives/teenagers-largely-account-for-startling-increase-illegitimacy.html,The rate of illegitimate births in the United States has nearly doubled during the last decade but the causes of this phenomenon remain elusive Not the immediate cause of course but the fact that more unmarried women are having intercourse without using contraception is a correct answer without being an adequate explanation And all the other popular explanationssuch as the decline in religious or economic or social sanctions against unwed mothers or the lack of sex education in the schools are simply inaccurate according to Dr Phillips Cutright a sociologist who has spent the last five years studying the causes and cures of illegitimacy here and abroad The facts are he says in a report in the current issue of Family Planning Perspectives that the nations teenagers who are more sexually active than everand who have contributed most heavily to the rise in illegitimacygenerally do not realize how easy it is to become pregnant and even those who do do not have medicallyprescribed contraceptives readily available to them Nor do most have abortion as a ready option should they find themselves pregnant out of wedlock For years weve tried to use fear of pregnancy as a deterrent to illegitimacy and it hasnt worked Its time to try something else says Dr Cutright a research associate at the Joint Center for Urban Studies of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University and a professor of sociology at Indiana University Carol D Is just one of thousands of American teenagers who illustrate Dr Cutrights findings An intelligent girl from a religious middleclass home in the Middle West Carol became pregnant at the age of 15 following two acts of unprotected intercourse with her high school sweetheart Asked why she had taken a chance she replied Theres nine years difference between my brother and me I never knew I could get pregnant so easily I thought it was something you had to work on and plan Her attempt to get an abortion failed and she was forced to bear her illegitimate child Two years laterstill illinformed about effective contraceptionshe became pregnant again Just how important the teenage contribution is to rising illegitimacy can be seen when the statistics are broken down into age groups From 1965 to 1968 the latest date for which figures are available illegitimacy rates actually declined for the first time in a quartercentury among adult American women But this decline was offset by a tremendous increase in illegitimacy among teenagers who comprised about 70 per cent of the unmarried population To Dr Cutright the decline among the older groups reflects the growing availability of effective contraception to adult women regardless of marital status But to the unmarried minor who in many cases must get parental consent to obtain medically prescribed contraceptives the pill and the IUD are just something she hears about Dr Cutrights investigation has exploded many of the myths that supposedly explain rising illegitimacy among them The increase in welfare benefits No link was found between Illegitimacy rates and the number of families receiving welfare benefits or the amount of those benefits Illegitimacy rates rose dramatically in the early 1940s while welfare roles declined by a third and illegitimacy increased at about the same rate in states that pay high welfare benefits as in those that pay low benefits The same holds true for Canada and other countries The decline of the authoritarian family Families became increasingly permissive during the first 40 years of this century while illegitimacy rates declined in nearly all developed countries The lack of adequate sex education in the schools By themselves Dr Cutright says school programs that tell young women about contraceptives will do little to increase their use Sweden which adopted a national policy to provide sex and contraceptive information in schools 30 years ago has experienced a rapid increase in illegitimacy among young women during the last decade Dr Cutright also predicts failure for any program that tries to teach American men to use condoms He notes that since 1940 American men in the Armed Forces have been exposed to the most intensive form of cribcation in condom use one can imagine Yet the il legitimacy rate continued to soar following World War II and the Korean War and today at least 15 per cent of American servicemen in Vietnam have contracted venereal disease which could have been prevented by the use of condoms Further complicating the problem the sociologist believes is the fact that the growing emphasis on female contraceptive methods has made men less willing to assume responsibility for preventing pregnancy in outofwedlock coitus What is the solution Dr Outright urges the establishment of Governmentfinanced familyplanning clinics that would serve any woman who comes in backed up by abortion on request to deal with contraceptive failures The schools he says would Op best to simply post the locations of the nearby clinics And without condoning or condemning nonmarital sex the schools might also try to give teenagers a realistic picture of the risk of pregnancy One way to do this he suggests is to fill a bowl with marbles of two different colors in proportion to the risk involved and have stludents pick blindfolded A young fertile woman having unprotected intercourse twice a week stands a 35 per cent chance of being pregnant at the end of the month Dr Outright recalls the response to this lesson of his 10yearold daughter who was thrilled after picking three white marbles in a row indicating she was not pregnant Then she drew a black one Her face dropped and she whined painfully But daddy I dont want to be pregnant JANE E BRODY
Approval of State Abortion Law Increases Among Obstetricians,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/14/archives/approval-of-state-abortion-law-increases-among-obstetricians.html,A survey of specialists in obstetrics and gynecology in New York State indicates that twodthirds favor the new abortion law without qualification according to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine The survey initially done last summer and repeated last month showed that living with the state law had resulted in increasingly liberal views among physicians For example last summer shortly after the law took effect permitting abortions for any reason up to the 24th week of pregnancy 59 per cent of the physicians surveyed said they favored the law as written Six months later the number had increased to 67 per cent A similar trend was noted among Roman Catholic doctors who make up 29 per cent of the obstetricians in the state Catholic obstetricians favoring the law rose from 23 per cent to 31 per cent over the sixmonth period with 8 per cent expressing favor with some qualifications According to Dr Raymond C Lerner who directed the study the findings indicate that a change in legislation very often legitimizes a view and makes people more willing to accept it He recalled that before the law was passed it had been opposed by the State Medical Society The survey was conducted by telephone among a random sample of half the states 2800 obstetrician gynecologists Eightythree per cent of the sample responded to the first round of questioning and 90 per cent of the same sample completed the second interview The 48000 survey which Dr Lerner conducted with Dr Charles B Arnold and Dr Sylvia Wassertheil all assistant professors of community health was supported by the Population Council The liberalization of physicians attitudes was accompanied by a similar change in what doctors say they will do Whereas 54 per cent of the doctors surveyed last summer said they were willing to perform abortions in accordance with the law the number had risen to 60 per cent by last month The greatest change noted in the survey was in the physicians estimates of their cornmunities abilities to handle the demand for abortion LaSt summer only 43 per cent thought local resources would be adequate By January this rose to 68 per cent The survey also found that nearly half the doctors thought that abortions before the 12th week of pregnancy could be performed in clinics but 91 per cent thought that abortions after the 12th week should be done in hospitals
Albany Notes,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/15/archives/states-fiscal-woes-dominate-the-talk-in-albany-eclipsing-lindsays.html,ALBANY March 14Like the genie let out of the bottle Governor Rockefellers 84billion state budget with its staggering 11billion tax package hangs over the cur rent legislative session The budget almost com pletely dominates the con versation and the action here It has pushed into the back ground virtually every other issue including another fiscal colossus Mayor Lindsays 8807mil lion tax package much of which will require legislative approval Republican legislative lead ers wont even begin to dis sect the Lindsay proposals until after they have enacted a state budget Normally that task should be com pleted in two weeks in time for the start of the new fiscal year April 1 But the budget and tax negotiations are so complex that some legislators are already talking about an Interim budget that would merely authorize spending at current levels until the new budget is enacted Among the other major is sues caught in the budgetary logjam are the community development bond issue re duction of narcotics posses sion penalties some tighten ing of the abortion law pa rochial school aid and state health insurance As a result the Legisla ture which in other years would often be starting the final push toward adjourn ment at this point is still marking time with threeday sessions each week The slow pace is reflected in the output of major legis lation The skimpy list in cludes the setting of a Sept 14 primary date approval of a constitutional amendment authorizing the 18  year  old vote allowing state audits of New York City Buffalo and Rochester and extension of the flattrack racing sea son from 234 to 249 days a lear The snow is still on the ground in this refrigerated capital but it is likely that the snow will go before the legislators There is already talk of a midMay adjourn ment that would make this one of the longer sessions in recent years  The budget gloom was pierced by one bright ray re cently Governor Rockefeller received a 1300 check from a Pennsylvania woman who wrote that she wanted to celebrate her 70th birthday by donations to church and state The woman Mrs May bel T Kettering of Elizabeth town Pa said she was send ing the money out of state because she had spent sev eral years in your exciting state while you were our good Governor The money went to the states general fund and Mr Rockefeller dashed off a birthday card posthaste  Doubting Thomases over Governor Rockefellers con sideration of drastic pro posals to cut the welfare spiral in the state abound in Albany Is he kidding was the frequent reaction of people who questioned whether the liberal Mr Rockefeller was seriously proposing a crack down on welfare and sec ondly whether his proposals would really put much of a dent in the welfare rolls Conversations with Rocke feller aides and others who are familiar with the Gov ernors thinking make it evi dent that he isnt kidding and in fact will probably have specific legislative pro posals within the next two weeks The Governor is consider ing a proposal to bar welfare assistance to those coming into the state who can find only substandard housing in which to live The legal rationale for such a move would be that the inferior housing endangers the health and welfare of the wouldbe welfare recipient as well as the community at large Mr Rockefeller is also likely to propose strict en forcement of a law requiring welfare recipients to accept any Job offered them includ ing possible state  created Jobs He really feels that there is a dangerous break in our society between those who are working and paying taxes and those receiving welfare a source close to the Governor said There are so many people who think that the only reason theyre paying higher taxes is welfare and weve got to show were aware of the problem Another Rockefeller assso ciate said that the Governor was very much concerned about welfare and doesnt know how to come to grips with it but felt that he had to stake out some kind of position with legislators talk ing about all kinds of cuts in welfare He said that he sensed in the Governor an entirely different mood on welfare The Governor is said to be concerned over the long range social and fiscal impli cations for a nation having 10 per cent or more of its population on welfare and the shortrange implications of a Legislature in a mood to commit mayhem on welfare expenditures However Mr Rockefeller is portrayed as under no illu sions about the immediate impact of his proposals You cant turn a battleship around on a dime said a Rockefeller aide The Gov ernor is said to realize that not only laws but also the attitude of many welfare ad ministrators and other public officials will have to be changed before there is any major reduction in the wel fare rolls Hes flailing around for a solution just like the rest of us said one high state official It may sound like Alice in Wonderland but its a fact that the taxpayers are pay ing 75000 for a temporary state commission report that will almost certainly recom mend that the taxpayers should cough up some more money for salary increases for legislators The commission has been supposedly deliberating this difficult problem for a year and is scheduled to come up with a report just about the time the Legislature is levy ing the latest tax increases The problem is when should the legislators let the pay cat out of the bag If they give themselves a raise in this year of the Rockefellerpro claimed stopgap crisis bud get and unparalleled fiscal dilemma some voters might take exception If they wait until next year a legislative election year the voters will have an opportunity for quick retribution The legislators are paid 15000 a year plus a 3000 expense allowance However legislative leaders receive ad ditional allowances ranging from as low as 2000 to as high as 21000 annually As a result the Legislature is rapidly filling with leaders Thirty of the 57 Senators and 55 of the 150 Assemblymen now qualify as some sort of leaders for fiscal purposes anyway  One of the more pervasive pastimes here is charting the ebb and flow of Mayor Lind says Presidential prospects Most politicians here in cluding Lindsay friends and foes are convinced that de spite all the City Hallin spired hoopla the Mayor can not switch parties or overtly begin seeking a Presidential nomination until he disposes of the citys tangled fiscal and labor problems To start politicking openly at this point would make his every move in the effort to come up with more revenue and to conclude contracts with the police fire and san itation unions look as though he was playing politics Hence the consensus here is that the Mayor wont be changing parties or acting like a candidate until fall Whether Mr Lindsay switches parties or not he probably wouldnt win any popularity contests among legislators of either party Many of them consider him less than a roaring success as the citys chief executive Yet there is grudging ad miration of his political sex appeal At a recent budget hearing for example the leader of a group of upstate taxpayers complained about our own [upstate] mayors clutching at his coattails as if his problems were theirs He was alluding to the other five of the Big Six mayors who have been following Mr Lindsays lead in the fight for more state aid for cities While the taxpayer leader was complaining however a group of Mr Lindsays house

Soviet Expert Opposes Abortion Ban,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/23/archives/soviet-expert-opposes-abortion-ban.html,MOSCOW March 22  A prominent Soviet population specialist is Arguing against proposals to abolish legal abor tions as a way of raising the falling Soviet birth rate  Writing in the weekly liter ary newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta Prof Dmitri Valente head of a demographic research section at Moscow University said that he and his coauthor G Kiseleva categorically re jected the views expressed by some Russians that the birth rate could be raised if abor tions were prohibited Abortions were legalized soon after the 1917 Revolution but were banned by Stalin in 1936 They were again made legal in 1955 The operation costs five rubles or 550 Professor Valente and Mr Kiseleva said that research in the Soviet Union and abroad had proven that when abortion is banned the birth rate rises for only one to one and a half years Dangerous Consequences After this period the arti cle said it again falls and often drops lower than before the prohibition And at the same time banning abortion can have dangerous Conse quences first of all there is an increase in the number of deaths and deformities from criminal abortions A woman who does not want to have a baby will not have it the article said Legal barriers have practically no effect anywhere in the world No statistics have been pub lished on the number of abor tions performed in the Soviet Union but the figure is thought to be quite high since many Russians regard abortion as the principal birthcontrol method in the absence of sophisticated methods such as the pill dia phragm or intrauterine device Now however some people are arguing for an end to abor tion because of the declining Soviet birth rate which in 1969 was only 17 per thousand peo ple The figure is significantly lower In the European parts of the country In 1960 the rate was 249 per thousand Since there already is a wide spread shortage of workers in most areas of the country with the labor deficit most acute in places such as Western Siberla where ambitious projects are planned authorities have ex pressed concern about the fu ture labor supply if the rate continues to decline Reasons Are Sought  Sociologists and demogra phers have been seeking rea sons for the prevailing tend ency of most families to have no more than two children Professor Valente said that a recent study showed that 85 per cent of all families had only one or two children Most printed studies recom mend better living conditions for young couples increased Government stipends to moth ers and permission for a woman to have Up to three years leave of absence at the time she gives birth The Government has so far adopted none of these suggestions Although abortions are com mon in everyday life there is some stigma attached to having them and a woman usually confides only to her closest friends that she has had an abortion The sense of moral disfavor concerning abortions was expressed recently in a short story by Vladimir Solou khin a wellknown writer Many Russians have said they were shocked by the storys open discussion of abortion and the authors disapproval of it  In the story the narrator meets a middleaged woman who already has two grown children and who has become pregnant again She tells the the supreme torture and that narrator that giving birth is the supreme torture and that she plans an abortion The narrator said he was sorry to hear that and asked if women dont ever think of their unborn children Youre probably not having your first abortion he said Havent you ever had a wish to have had at least a glimpse of the children you poisoned After apologizing for his rudeness he said he knew woman who was suffering re Morse for her abortions That woman had a daughter who had died and as she was dying she told her mother that she had had a dream the night be fore The girl had said I dreamt that you were in a field and many children stood around youthree girls and four boys But they are all ter rible miserable Ones head looks like a bottle Another has three legs One girl has something like paws instead of hands It is such a terrible dream and you are embracing all of them and crying and am running toward them and they invite me to play with them The narrator says that the mother didnt pay attention to the dream until a month after her daughters death when she remembered the dream and that she had had exactly seven abortions in her life and the dying girl had seven children in her dream The woman almost went crazy and had to get special treatment the narrator said After hearing this the mid dleaged woman in the story does not have the abortion and the tale ends happily with the birth of her new child

Adoption Law: When Should a Mother Lose Rights to Her Child?,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/24/archives/adoption-law-when-should-a-mother-lose-rights-to-her-child.html,The magic number is 4225B There are Other numbers being played too 6053 6476 and 4452 but 4225B is given the best odds for coming up in the legislativeroulette These designations are all attached to bills pending in the State Assembly Each would reform the current mode of executing adoptions in New York to reduce the chances that when a child has been placed in an adoptive home he will be reclaimed by his natural mother The bills differ mainly in the amount of time a mother is given to recon sider her decision to give the baby away Bill 4225B introduced by Joseph R Pisani Republican of New Rochelle is expected to be debated in the Assembly soon It would give the natural mother 30 days after she has legally relinquished her child to change her mind As things stand now she has the option to exercise that right any time before the issuance of final adoption papers by the court The law requires that a minimum of six months elapse between the date the court is first petitioned and the granting of those papers but it often takes a year or more because the court calendars are jammed Both the Family Court and the Surrogates Court can handle adoptions but the bulk go to Surrogates Court It is this indeterminate amount of time that has espe cially in the last two months fanned the flames of public indignation pitted natural mothers adoption agencies adoptive parents and lawyers against one another sent at least one case to the highest court in the state and several others into lower courts motivated legislators to write bills citizens groups to circulate petitions hold rallies and pressure their representatives and disturbed every adoptive parent whose papers arent final The current furor began in January when the State Court of Appeals upheld a Supreme Court ruling that ordered Mr and Mrs Frank Bacile of Bayport L I to return to his natural mother the 3yearold boy they had taken in two weeks after his birth and were in the process of adopting It bothers me that mothers can always change their minds The reason that people adopt is for the security of knowing the child is yours You dont want to be just a baby sitter An adoptive mothers view The mother Mrs Elizabeth Tierney Ferro of Brooklyn had changed her mind because she had married and said she could now give the boy a suitable home In February television viewers watched her take him from the courtroom as he cried out I want to go to my mommy Almost concurrently a second case captured head lines when the Nicholas DeMartinos of Brooklyn vowed to go to the United States Supreme Court if necessary to overturn decisions by two New York courts requiring them to return to her natural mother the 9monthold girl they had received eight months earlier through the Spence Chapin Adoption Service A decision from the Court of Appeals is expected next month The central question raised by both cases as well as by several similar but less publicized ones is not as many people believe whether the natural mother is guilty of trespassing her legal rights but rather whether the law which clearly gives her those rights in the first place is a humane and tenable one There is no doubt that both Mrs Ferro and Miss Olga Scarpetta the mother of the DeMartino child had the law on their side for in neither case had final papers been processed But there is grave doubt on the part of Govern ment officials agency executives and caseworkers psy chiatrists and the public that it is in the best interests of the child to put it in a home and remove it six nine months a year or as in the Bacile case three years later And there is the emotionally volatile question of the fairness of giving a couple a child allowing them to ex pend time money energyand loveon him and then taking him away when the biological mother has a change of heart or circumstances It is this point that most disturbs parents who already have adoptive children but not those binding documents and couples who have applied for babies As Alfred Dukes of the Bronx who is awaiting his second child from the citys Department of Social Services put it Our caseworker called about three weeks ago about the possibility of a baby But we didnt get it someone else got there first I was distressed for two days and I had never even seen the baby Imagine if I had gotten one and lost it    Although there are no known withdrawals of applica tions a number of prospective parents are taking a wait andsee attitude Sortie have said they would not accept a child now without assurance that the mothers surrender is irrevocable some are waiting for the DeMartino decision The central question is not whether the natural mother is guilty trespassing her legal rights but rather whether the law which clearly gives her those rights is a humane and tenable one others want to see what if any legislation will be passed Some parents who already have adoptive children have contemplated fleeing to another state or another country in what the law would consider kidnaping And many couples are prepared to sit tight and take their chances Most parents who do not yet have babies will take risks no matter how desolate and haggard they become The hunger for a child is terribly strong said Joseph Spencer the DeMartinos lawyer Jacob Fuchsberg former president of the American Trial Lawyers Association hasalso volun teered his services and spoken in court on their behalf While adoptive parents speak from many backgrounds and wildly divergent educational professional and eco nomic circumstances they have one voice that expresses one fear What happened to the DeMartinos could happen to me It bothers me that mothers can always change their minds Mrs Dukes said The reason that people adopt is for the security of knowing the child is yours You dont want to be just a baby sitter When you go to the agency and speak with people you think that this cant happen The caseworker told us that the only reason you can lose the child is if youre a bad parent said a woman who works for a bank She and her husband who is an oil company employe have been on the list of a Brooklyn agency since December Now they are considering withdrawing their names and adopting a baby through private channels in the belief that the procedure can move through the courts more rapidly Actually the same sixmonth waiting period between petition and finalization applies to both agency and private adoptions The wife of a doctor is considering moving to New Jersey where surrenders cannot be revoked so easily if new legislation isnt passed in New York She has a 4year old adopted daughter and is waiting for the placement of a second child But Im not sure Ill go through with it she said I have a long wait because of the scarcity of babies since the passage of the abortion law so I havent withdrawn my request I want to see what bills pass I had one child and lost it at birth Ive had a hyster rectomy so this is our only way to have a family she said The wife of an influential public affairs writer re membered her reaction to the first news reports of the two cases I was devastated I panicked and went into hys terics I sat frozen to the television set until my husband came home She has a 9monthold son received through the SpenceChapin agency her petition has been filed and she expects her papers to be granted in about four months I was afraid that the publicity might make the natural mother of our child rethink her decision she said I was afraid to answer the phone and when I got a letter from SpenceChapin I was afraid to open it [it turned out to be a routine form letter] The fright and fear robs you of the joy of having this glorious thing in your house and your heart Her husband was a bit calmer but not much I tried to tell her that this was one particular case one judgment and one judgment doesnt affect every judgment he re called in his office the other day But he reflected The potential is that it can happen We discovered that we were in limbo The jeopardy the threat is always there We like the anonymous character of the relationship established by the agency between us and the natural mother The DeMartinos made us aware of this shadowy fig ure he said Our sense of barrier [between natural and adoptive parent] has been undermined Statistically the natural mother even with the latitude she is allowed in reconsidering her surrender is a minor threat She has been made to seem more ominous by the timing of the two cases In fact among the calls that have poured into the agencies in tire last two months officials reported that a number have been made by natural mothers intent on re affirming their decisions Just this morning an intelligent young woman who is pregnant called to assure me that if she surrenders her baby she will really mean it said Mrs Roberta Adams adoption supervisor for the Talbot Perkins Childrens Serv ices in Brooklyn adding We never take a surrender un less we think its final Ninetyfive per cent of the natural mothers accept the finality of the surrender but a lifetime isnt enough time to think if youve done the right thing A natural mothers view Most agencies try to forestall revocation by placing babies with foster rather than adoptive parents if they feel the natural mothers are at all hesitant about their decisions The sacks of mail received by Assemblyman Pisanl contained a letter from one natural mother who supported his bill She observed A lifetime isnt enough time to think if youve done the right thing Ninetyfive per cent of the natural mothers accept the finality of the surrender said M Mae Neely director of the citys Department of Social Services Division of Adoption Services which has never had a case go to court But we have had calls from girls who are unsure about their decision she said When that happens we ask the girl to come in we talk to her assure her that shes made the best possible choice that it was a wise ma ture responsible decision for the child and for herself and that this will give her the chalice to start a new life She generally feels better and thats the end of it The aver age age of the mothers she deals with she said ranges from 15 to 19 It isnt always so simple for agency officials and law yers to quell the anxieties expressed by adoptive parents and applicants They want assurance and a guarantee that this wont happen to them Miss Neely said We have to be forth right We tell them this is unusual that most natural mothers stick to their surrenders We also tell them that we know that the law is not tight enough and theres no guarantee The surrender gives legal safety but it doesnt go far enough And there are no laws to guide the judge While all the agencies have received such calls Spence Chapin has been swamped because it is at the eye of the DeMartino storm and because it is the largest voluntary adoption agency in the city It became impossible for one department to handle all the calls Now everybodys taking them said Mrs Jane Edwards the executive director We get 30 to 40 calls a day from couples awaiting finalization Weve heard from attorneys and other agences and weve gotten volumes of letters Weve even gotten calls from parents whose papers have been finalized for as long as six years They say know its impossible but Im concerned The two arguments put forth most often by the agen cies to allay their callers fears are 1 the natural mother has made no attempt to contact the caseworker and 2 the proportion of natural mothers who take any kind of serious action is infinitesimal As Roberta Adams of Talbot Perkins observed There are between 4000 and 5000 agency adoptions a year in New York and this comes maybe once a year Most parents who do not yet have babies will take risks no matter how desolate and haggard they become The hunger for a child is terribly strong A lawyers view And while parents may be worried and nervous about their status and the existing laws their confidence in agency procedures does not seem to have been shaken SpenceChapin has been criticized by lawyers and other segments of the public for its handling of the DeMartino case but none of the parents interviewed said it was to blame for the legal complications Parents who had adopted their children through SpenceChapin said they Would be willing to do so again In fact Mrs Edwards said inquiries and applications have increased since the DeMartino matter became public knowledge On a monthly basis weve had a 10 per cent increase she said adding that this might be attributed to the current shortage of infants Several agencies have stopped considering applicants for very young children The words of a writer who received his child from SpenceChapin reflects not only his attitude toward the agency but the feelings that the desire for a child create as well You have the same approach to the agency as you have to a fraternity You take your hat in hand put a smile on your face and just hope youll be accepted Its like getting into a fancy club After that youre just grate ful and you dont ask a lot of prying questions

Republican legislative leaders have tenta tively agreed on budget cuts totaling more than 600million sources high in the party re ported tonight The three Republican offi cials have been negotiating reductions in the Governors proposed 845billion budget for the last three days They plan a final meeting tomorrow morning before pre senting the budget package to the Republican majorities in both houses at closed confer ences The Legislature has a budget deadline of next Wednesday midnight the start of the new fiscal year Tuition Fees Expected Republican informants said the reductions would include major slashes in welfare ex penditures a decrease of up to 11000 in present or planned state jobs a cut in State Uni versity and state educationaid funds including the likely im position of tuition fees at the City University and a drastic slowdown of state construction projects The budget cuts would per mit the dropping of more than half the 11billion tax pack age proposed by the Governor to finance the budget Among the tax increases expected to be eliminated are the 10 per cent incometax surcharge some business tax increases and the doubling of motor ve hide registration fees The Republican legislative leaders Assembly Speaker Per ry B Duryea of Montauk and Senate Majority Leader Earl W Brydges of Niagara Falls said tonight that they would keep the Republican legislators in conference through the week end if necessary to obtain agreement on the budget As difficult as the negotia tions were among the Governor and his legislative lieutenants winning the agreement of Re publican majorities in both houses is expected to be even harder The leaders need 76 of the partys 79 votes in the As sembly and 29 of the 31 in the senate to pass the budget Democrats Ignored The minority Democrats are being ignored It was enough to make the Assembly minority leader Stanley Steingut of Brooklyn complain on the floor that this budget is being made in the back rooms and that the Democrats dont know whats going on If the Republicans ultimately need Democratic votes to re place GOP defectors they plan to win support from indi vidual Democrats rather than deal with the leadership The Democrats are publicly committed to oppose an in crease to 4 per cent from 3 per cent in sales tax Many Repub licans consider that increase one of the more politically palatable of the proposed tax rises So Republican leaders will concentrate on winning a majority in their own ranks but it is not expected to be easy Mr Rockefeller Mr Duryea and Mr Brydges have been bar gaining for the last three days over budget cuts There was still no final agreement tonight but in any event this is only the first round in a fight not likely to end before the start of the new fiscal year next Thursday The next round comes when Mr Duryea and Mr Brydges go back to their colleagues in an effort to round up the needed votes A reporter was able to ob tain a copy of the Assembly Ways and Means committee proposal for 4231million in state aid cuts including huge reductions in school aid wel fare and revenue sharing with cities but Republican legisla tors have not received the working paper There are already evident crossfires that seem to make a common ground for agree ment difficult For example Four Republicans in the Senate who hold the balance of power there say publicly they will not vote for a budget that includes tax increases One of the four Senator James H Donovan of Chad wicks a leading opponent of abortionreform declared Im not even talking about a budget until they take out 3 million to kill babies He re ferred to a Medicaid allocation for abortion payments Another of the four Sena tor Thomas F McGowan of Buffalo engaged in shouting matches over the budget with his leader Mr Brydges on Monday This seems hardly conducive atmosphere for bar gaining Long Island Republican leg islators have told their leaders they will not vote for any budg et cutting school aid One of the Long Islanders Assemblyman Milton Jonas of North Merrick went further and said he would not support any cuts in welfare aid to depend ent children He added that about five unidentified legisla tors support his position But the drastic budget cuts demand ed by Republican legislators cannot be done without major reductions in welfare Recrimination Noted There are also conflicting pressures from outside inter ests The major one appears to be the demand of the tax payers and other voters for re duced government spending and as little taxation as pos sible This pressure has produced recriminations in some GOP conferences Some legislators have denounced welfare cheats and bums One Re publican Senator proposed that Medicaid allowances for artifi cial limbs be eliminated He said that would demonstrate to the Federal Government that the state needed help But educators want more aid And the Mental Hygiene Department mobilized to pro test proposed cuts in the de partment budget And vet erans groups decry the gross insult of a proposal to elimi nate the State Division of Vet eran Affairs More disputes involving edu cators unions veterans and other groups are expected as the details of the budget cuts are made public in the next few days The Senate Finance Committee has proposed elimi nating 3400 new jobs 3200 vacant posts and 4400 jobs held by civil servants with no tenure for example Reconciling these multiple interests will be the job of Mr Brydges and Mr Duryea
"Pink and fading, in watermelon ink",https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/28/archives/the-abortion-an-historical-romance-1966-by-richard-brautigan-226-pp.html,One way of receiving Richard Brau tigans new book is disarmingly sug gested by the novel itself there ought to be somebody in clothes of welcome on duty all the time to accept and register everything that anybody wants or has to write Log it in describe it briefly let the author put it on the shelf of his choice on no account catalog it and give the re lieved creator coffee and a cookie Human rights for books  The setting is a library devoted to the reception of manuscripts an all night depository for oneway com munications and the librarian who narrates the story has just accepted among the days 24 assorted acquisi tions another book by Richard Brau tiganlooking a little older a little more tired than when he brought in his first Whats this one about the librarian asks Brautigans casual answer Just another book That could be a very arch under statement coming from the wise and funny man who wrote Trout Fish ing in America Of an order apart from most books Trout Fishing in America was a totally original novel plotted in the changing shapes of heartbreaking symbol for what is happening to America Trout Fishing in America was a legleis wino cheap hotel a revolutionary slogan chalked on the backs of schoolchil dren it was the political disguise of the murderous Mayor of the Twen tieth Century it was a brooding spirit that remembered people with threecornered hats fishing in the dawn and Lewis and Clark discover ing the Great Falls of the Missouri It was dead extinct as the dinosaur trout had become steel streams had become stores but it seemed to live transformed again in the life and prose and person of Brautigan him self Every chapter had a secret hook to set a steel meaning in a sparely tied fly of anecdote and metaphor a valuable and accurate surprise Just another book like that is what you pray for every time you crack a new one The fact is we are still getting Brautigan writings from a time be fore Trout Fishing made the world his oyster The new book has been around a while and owes more to In Watermelon Sugar which itself was written a couple of years or more before Trout Fishing was published The commonplace short dialogues of greeting eating and beddingCon versations and things that happen every day Work baths breakfast and dinner that gave In Water melon Sugar so many relaxed seem ingly vacuous pages illustrated the novels point about peaceful coexis tence with mortality They also sug gested analogously that with regard to literary mortality the way to san ity was watermelon inkwhich one imagines to be vaguely pink and fading while one reads The new book is written almost entirely with the sugarwater sprezzatura of an artist who hands it in to a deadend library and never expects to see it again The story is simple and straight forward Two people help each other out of temporary blockages an abor tion ironically the agency of their delivery This librarian is a nice con fident human but he has not faced the state of things outside the library for three years The girl Vida comes into his library and his life with the problem that she hates her own vol uptuous body the leerings and paw ings of the ubiquitous American mammaphile have made her wish she were a pipestem Presumably thanks to the same gift which makes him the perfect bookgreeter the librarian immediately puts Vida at ease even though hes as mad about her outsize breasts as anybody They bed down very agreeably the only resistance coining from hooks and buttons It was a difficult pile of clothes Each garment was won in a strange war The result is preg nancy and that leads without soul searching to a decision for Mexico and the mill of Dr Garcia Here the book moves out of the whimsically imagined San Francisco library into the present California freeway and airport scene and ad dresses in an oddly frontal way the Womens Lib themes of abortion and sexobjectification It will be read In part as a rather uncomradely attack on Brautigans fellow girlwatchers and perhaps as some sort of state ment about the nastiness and dis honesty of our social and legal pres sures around the subject of abortion But its doubtful if the author of Trout Fishingwho did his damn ing there in the permanent and hard artistic warhas his heart in such a lazy undertaking There is something spooky and funny here pale pink and fading A jolly friend named Foster is the fosterparent of the abortion The trip to Tijuana is mostly a demeaning comedy of the confusion Vidas body wreaks among the males Just before the little party leaves for the plane South an old lady unborn comes to the library and demands to know what they have done with her unborn mother She has a book to deposit but its pages are blank like snow What begins to ring true under neath the scorn piled on the American male which is neither true serious or interesting is a steady stepbystep notation of a real trip and a real abortion These parents of a prevented child are spooked numb by what they are doing They go through with it by putting one foot before the other and the librarian tells it all straight It will be the last thing you ex pected from Richard Brautigan but you will know pretty well how it feels to go to Mexico on such an errand After it is over you will say with Vida Youre looking at the future biggest fan The Pin ever had The Abortion is short swift and formally neat and though it contains some very offhand writing this experiment along the limits of the watermelon thinness of Brautigans ink is cheeky enough and there are enough indelible stretches where the watermelon ink rinses out some India to be just a little more than just another book

Ethics Debate Set Off By Life Science Gains,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/28/archives/ethics-debate-set-off-by-life-science-gains-ethics-debate-is-set.html,This article was prepared by Jane E Brody a science writer and Edward B Fiske religion editor Scientists and doctors theo logians and legislators and host of other professionals around the country are show ing an intense new interest in the moral issues created by innovations in the life sciences The growing ethical concern which amounts to a movement arises from such recent devel opments as heart transplants and new drugs to alter emo tions and behavior It is also prompted by such future pos sibilities as the creation of testtube babies and the ma nipulation of genes to im prove the human race Unless thought is given to such matters now said James Watson the Nobel Prizewin ning geneticist the possibility of our having a free choice will one day suddenly be gone Last week Senator Walter F Mondale Democrat of Minne sota and 17 bipartisan cospon sors introduced a bill in the Senate to establish a twoyear National Advisory Commission on Health Science and Society to explore the moral social and legal implications of develop ments in biology and medicine The new interest has already given rise to a number of in stitutions that are investigating the ethics of biology and medi cine a rapidly proliferating lit erature on the subject and a burgeoning number of scien tific conferences on ethical issues Under attack are many of the traditional assumptions that underlie not only biology and medicine but all science and technology Among them are the beliefs that scientific prog ress is automatically good that what is medically beneficial to the individual is necessarily good for society and that sci entists are the best judges of the direction in which their re search should go At this point agreement is far greater on the questions than the answers said Dr J Russell Elkinton editor of the Annals of Internal Medicine But he added at least a re sponsible debate is under way The debate is focused upon discoveries capable of radically affecting the quality of life altering the structure of society and even changing the very nature of man himself Doctors have already devel oped drugs and elaborate ma chinery capable of prolonging the lives of countless millions of people suffering from ter minal illnesses When should the plug be pulled Does a person have the right to ask that he be left untreated to die in peace Should the physician in some cases speed the end to the patients suffering Where do the rights of society come in when physicians funds and hospital beds used to keep terminal patients alive are in short supply Similarly the first transplant of a human heart in December 1967 created a host of still unresolved ethical questions When is a person dead How can a limited organ supply be fairly used in face of an over whelming need and demand Can society justify the costly treatment in view of other pressing medical needs As the American Friends Service Committee put it in a recent report A single heart transplant costs 20000 to 50000 How many individuals could be rehabilitated with glasses hearing aids or dental care for the cost of one heart transplant A Broader Menace Dr Ren Dubos bacteriolo gist and scientific humanist at Rockefeller University seed a broader question of social com mitment than simply the either or questions within traditional medicine Why become excited about a few hundred organ trans plants when every day in New York City 30000 children are exposed to the possibility of permanent handicaps from lead poisoning and no one is doing anything about it he asks On the horizon are science fiction sounding discoveries that would create a vast array of brandnew ethical issues Scientists have already been able to take a cell from an adult frog and by placing its nucleus into a frog egg create a new frog that is a genetic carbon copy of the original adult Although the same feat in mammals is technically far more difficult some geneticists expect it to become a human reality within a decade or two This process known as clo ning has already raised ques tions Does an individual have a right to his uniqueness What would be the psychological ef fects of seeing ones genetic blueprint played out in advance if for example the person one was cloned from developed muscular dystrophy at age 35 Beethoven Multiplied For musical reasons it might be nice to have a whole con servatory of Beethovens but the societal effects of so many persons with Beethovens tem perament might be disastrous What would be the effect on family structure if scores of American men could order their own copy of Raquel Welch And what if cloning had been a reality when Hitler was in power Other future ethical problems are expected to grow out of the increasing ability of neurol ogists to define precisely the areas of the brain that control certain aspects of behavior Questions will clearly arise too from a rapidly growing array of potent drugs that can change behavior raise or lower intelligence enhance or impair memory and affect specific kinds of learning Should criminals be forced to accept rehabilitation that would involve direct electrical or chemical stimulation of their brains or even brain surgery Such techniques are already be ing tested in man Would the use of a drug that raised the general level of in telligence create a society of persons unwilling to do essen tial menial chores Would man twice as smart as he now is still be human On a Narrow Base Until now consideration of such ethical and social ques tions has generally been con fined to a few isolated individ uals in science and religion Recently however a num ber of institutes have sprung up to pursue such issues on a formal interdisciplinary basis and in anticipation of scientific advances wherever possible Set in the tranquil beauty of HastingsonHudson NY the Institute of Society Ethics and the Life Sciences now two years old has recruited 70 per sons in fields ranging from philosophy to biochemistry to serve on task forces in the areas of population control genetic engineering death and dying and behavior control In dealing with population problems said the institutes director Daniel Callahan a Roman Catholic philosopher our job is not to provide easy answers but to spell out the ethical acceptability of various approaches  such as manda tory abortion or birth control incentives  that might be adopted as government policy A second major organization the Institute of Religion op erates in the midst of Houstons huge Texas Medical Center The institute promotes interdis ciplinary discussions of ethical problems that arise out of med icine and research including the heart transblants for which the center is famous Buses to Poor Delayed Kenneth Varrett an econo mist at the Xerox Center for Health Care Research in the Houston complex noted in an interview that largely as a re sult of discussion with the Rev Kenneth L Vaux of the insti tute staff his center had post poned plans to put experimen tal diagnostic equipment on buses and send them out into poor areas We realized that it would be unethical to screen people for illnesses and raise expecta tions of their being helped un til we were also prepared to offer them treatment he explained Several smaller institutes re cently created include the Cen ter for Human Values in the Health Sciences in San Fran cisco and the Institute for Theological Encounter with Science and Technology at St Louis University Dr Leon Kass is heading a new 15 member committee on Life Sciences and Social Policy a part of the National Academy of Sciences Some theologians special izing in ethics are trying to acquaint themselves with the facts and future of biology and medicine Paul Ramsey profes sor of religion at Princeton University for instance recent ly spent a sabbatical year studying genetics and ethics at Georgetown Medical School and has since written widely on the ethical problems of genetic engineering Panels in Centers In the last few years com mittees have been set up at virtually all medical centers to review proposed human experi ments Such panels which would for example prevent an experi ment that would involve in jecting cancer cells into per sons incapable of understand ing the nature of the experi ment are now mandatory for federally financed research And medical schools through out the country often under pressure from students have started to set up courses on ethical issues Dr Willard Gaylin a 46year old psychiatrist who is helping to develop an ethics program at Columbia College of Physi cians and Surgeons recalls that in his medical school days ethics meant what size shingle a doctor should hang outside his office Todays students he says are grappling with such sticky questions as whether to let a 10yearold girl with a terminal illness die in peace as her mother re quested or whether to try to prolong her life Who Will Decide Underlying the new ethical concern is a conviction that the authority of science like that of universities the churches and the military must in creasingly come into question Scientists and others are now asking whether scientific prog ress necessarily serves the good of man and in cases where it obviously does whether scien tists should be the only ones to determine the direction it takes There is in short a growing consensus that the consequences of science are too important to be left to the scientists Were talking about chang ing the bodies and minds of men remarked Dr Kass him self a biochemist Scientists are not peculiar repositories of wisdom on these matters He and other individuals and institutions concerned with the new ethics would like to see critical scientific questions such as whether to create car bon copies of peopleposed on an interdisciplinary basis Dr Robert Francoeur an em bryologist at Fairleigh Dickin son University and a married Roman Catholic priest favors an international consortium of scientists physicians sociolo gists economists lawyers the ologians and others to deal with such matters The Mondale proposal would set up a 15member committee appointed by the President from the areas of medicine law theology biology sociol ogy physics the humanities government public affairs and health care How can the ethical ques tions they discuss ever be re solved There is a consensus that some problems the defi nition of death perhaps or the use and distribution of organs for transplantsmight be best dealt with through legislation Others however such as poli cies governing euthanasia may be more appropriately handled through professional guidelines and the evolution of a public consensus Among the new ethicists there is general agreement that some way must be found to involve the public Dr Ramsey would like to see the public represented even on fairly tech nical interdisciplinary boards Some people might be sim ply stunned and overwhelmed he said but their symbolic presence would put the profes sions on notice that society does have a concern Yet many scientists on the firing line are nervous about having the public looking over their shoulders One fear is that the public is antiscience and will inhibit research Scientists Fears When Senator Mondale first introduced a resolution to es tablish a national commission on medical ethics three years ago he expected scientists to welcome it Instead he recalled the other day I was disappointed and appalled by the almost unex plainable fear on the part of some scientists about the pub lic being involved Their atti tude was Its none of the pub lics business Others said Do it but keep it within the profession The senator said Research has more to gain from the pub lic process than to lose Se crecy could do a lot of harm Dr Kass said Instead of raising the bogy man of inter ference scientists should help legislators and the public dis criminate between the technol ogy we should scrutinize and that we should leave alone Another fear of scientists is that the long process of public deliberation might grind scien tific research to a halt Dr Robert White a neuro surgeon at Western Reserve University who studies brain and body transplants in dogs and monkeys said he wel comed the new sensitivity to ethical concerns But he added If we were starting now open heart surgery would take two or three times longer to de velop than it actually did be cause universities hospitals and doctors themselves are very much more sensitive to what theyre doing to patients Terms It Cheap Implementing the ideas of the biomedical ethicists pre sents a number of difficulties For One thing theres no lobby group said Robert Veatch a pharmacologist the ologian and medical ethicist at the Hastings Institute No one organizes around the fact that hes sick What we really need is a Ralph Nader for medical ethics Another serious limitation is money Dr Callahans group found that few foundations that support research have thus far shown interest in the area and have difficulty fitting requests for funds for medical ethics into their traditional categories Dr Kass noted however that the kind of research and thought needed is cheap com pared to the cost of what pro duces these problems and sug gested a routine budgeting of 1 per cent of research funds for study of the ethical conse quences of the research A third difficulty is that there are no real answers to ethical questions and in most cases the choice is not be tween good and evil but be tween relative goods Were not dealing with solvable problems in the usual sense of the word said Dr Kass In a fragmented plural istic society youre not going to come to agreement on mat ters that have divided the best of human minds since antiq uity Yet the growing consensus is that the thinking must be done and done now What man can do is becoming more obvious said Dr Elkinton What man ought to do is yet a dark enigma

originally proposed Agreement Has Contingency However the sources said the agreement was dependent upon whether Assembly Speak er Perry B Duryea Republican of Montauk agreed and that as yet there was no such agree ment In addition Mr Brydges was reported to be amenable to speeding up the pace of rev enue sharing to the city during the last three months of the municipal fiscal year ending June 30

budget proposed by the Governor in January Assembly Minority Leader Stanley Stein gut said An attempt is being made to ram this multibillion dollar budget through the Legis lature in an atmosphere of

would have a confer ence tomorrow and we may put something out In issuing the statement the Assembly Democrats resuscit tated some budget and tax pro posals of earlier in the session that are expected to form the nucleus of the legislation they will introduce duing the bud et debate as an alternative to whatever the Republicans fi nally emerge with These proposals include re ducing the need for new taxes which will still be needed even if the 703million in cuts are made by postponing payment of 250million in state assist ance to local governments for welfare This would be done by per mitting the localities to issue shortterm notes on the com mercial market to borrow the 250million with the money being repaid so it would not be charged against the 197172 fiscal year Tax Reforms Offered In addition the Democrats have recommended economies in government operations and tax reforms that they said would cut the Governors re quest for 11billion in taxes by 505million The Democrats have also pro posed eliminating 1150 state jobs including those of 59 corn missioners and agency directors as part of an overall reorgan ization of state government The plan would eliminate some agencies and shift others so there would be 36 major state agencies instead of the current 115 with a savings of 115million the Democratic leaders have estimated In a related fiscal develop ment State Controller Arthur Levitt issued an audit report that said that New York City could collect 57million in Medicaid funds once it speeded its system of filing Federal and state claims The states audit reported that the city was as much as seven months behind in billing state and Federal governments to obtain their share of the expenses The backlog in billings has existed since the inception o the program in 1966 the audit said adding that new proce dures for billing will take seven months to eliminate the backlog
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/30/archives/move-over-mr-tolstoy.html,THE ABORTION An Historical Romance 1966 By Richard Brautigan 226 pages Simon  Schuster 595 The Abortion Richard Brautigans new novel is split almost evenly down the middle Half of it is amiable fantasy half realistic documentary so factual you can draw a map from its pages It is possible to tie the two halves together symbolically or rather hang one half on the other But that possibility depends more on the ingenuity of the commenta tor than on the merit of the work After all its pos sible to correlate any two things in the universe In spite of the fact that people come and go in this book and that part of it involves a journey by auto van plane and bus from San Francis co to Tijuana and back the work is essentially static It never moves off center never gets off the ground One reason for this malaise is the authors catchascatchcan approach to the blank page He grabs at a chapter and throws it to the mat But his victories are easy ones The authors flip attitude is like watered whisky Only a whiff of the original comes through The offbeat the surreal the neat observations of Trout Fishing in America have been changed into selfindulgent liter ary ticks And the manner shows I wont go so far as to say that Mr Brautigan is contemptuous of those who put down hard coin of the realm for his books but the substance of The Abortion is thin to the point of invisibility Library for All Writers In The Abortion the I who tells the story is in charge of a fabulous library open 24 hours a day seven days a week Its a great place books are never bor rowed only deposited and they are books that have only just been written Anybody with a finished manuscript can bring it to the library and leave it there The literary values of these works are never questioned the authors are never challenged no book is ever rejected All titles are entered into a ledger and in a marvelous twist each author is allowed to shelve the book where he thinks it belongs Books written by destiny or by design books that have haunted the authors imag ination the scribblings of illiterates the confessions of the confused all receive the same courteous treatment What a way to work off ones fancies desires ambitions transcendental thoughts Every man his own Plato Tolstoy make room for Mr Smith In its early stages The Abortion sounded very much like a short story by Israel Zangwill in which all those with memories too painful to keep or useless to retain could park them in a storehouse and either leave them there or exchange them for somehing more functional or pleasant But having established this literary house of fantasy Brautigan is not quite sure what to do with it So he introduces Vida Veye da an eyecatching female of superior en dowments with whom the entire American Navy wants to be wrecked on a deserted isle Vida has a problem Her appeal to men lies so heavily on her spirit that she wants to be changed into something else some thing preferably long thin and angular Her problem is not so great though that she refuses to stay the night with the keeper of books and before the reader knows it or has a chance to back away he is in the middle of a novel in which a guy takes a girl in out of the rain they decide to share his bed she becomes preg nant they decide not to have the child Sounds original doesnt it The last half of the book is a stepbystep account of how the two travel to Tijuana how Vida has her abortion and how they return Anyone interested in having such an operation in Tijuana or in the details of securing such surgery will find The Abortion tense with excitement The rest of us some 200 mil lion maybe will find it a paralyzing bore Moral Can Be Drawn If one is determined enough a moral can be drawn from this fiction Maybe the library is the same way station for the un born spirit as the abortion mill is for the unborn child Maybe the author Is con demning the waste in both instances May be he is trying to draw attention to those inarticulate and dumb spirits who are un able to give form to their yearnings who die unmarked and unnoticed in the man swarm of humanity Maybebut I doubt it For the book is so morally neutral so entirely without nuance or reflection that it could easily be a chapter in a West Coast travel guide No theorizing can prop up this jerrybuilt substitute for entertainment Brautigan has wandered a long way from Trout Fishing in America There was an irreverent unstructured slightly wacky quality to those sketches that revealed an offbeat mind a flexible informal and tangy prose style and an original way of looking at the commonplace The KoolAid Wino with his insatiable thirst for this perfumed powdery pop the handsome trout whose last moments are comforted by swigs of California port the man in undated with thistle seedlings whenever he buys gas make a kooky but attractive cast of characters And the life that wanders in and out of that book defying the Establishment nor mal economic laws and bourgeois morality has a raffish and wry charm But its not a style that works with everything In Watermelon Sugar was a feeble and ama teurish exercise It took 30 minutes to read and seemed interminable There were things in it that could only be excused on the grounds that the author was being paid so much a word The Abortion is not so great a failure but it is a greater disap pointment Mr Brautigan has let a good idea wither for lack of nourishment
Legislature Receives Measures Implementing Governor's Welfare Reforms,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/31/archives/legislature-receives-measures-implementing-governors-welfare.html,ALBANY March 30Moving quickly to implement his welfare reform program Governor Rockefeller had a bill submitted to the Legislature today to prohibit welfare payments to anyone who voluntarily left his Job or reduced his earnings to qualify for welfare or for higher payments than he was getting Under the bill it would be assumed that the applicant had quit his job or reduced his earnings for the purpose of getting welfare or receiving higher payments if he applied for welfare or increased payments within 60 days after his employment This bill removes any potential incentive for persons who are working to voluntarily end their employment or reduce their earnings without good cause in order to receive or increase their welfare payments Mr Rockefeller told the legislators in a memorandum with his bill Special Services Ordered This bill would also require local employment offices of the State Labor Department to provide special services for unskilled workers and welfare recipients These offices would also be required to maintain registers of jobs employment preparation services and counseling before and after the welfare applicants were referred to jobs The Governor gave no estimate of how many persons would be affected by this or other welfare measures submitted today or how much they would save in expenditures We will be determining the numbers and the savings as this program develops a spokesman said Another measure would make it mandatory for local welfare officials or the State Industrial Commissioner to require employable home relief recipients to perform work assigned to them as work relief The present law permits welfare officials to do this But does not mandate it Welfare officials would be required to establish public works projects to which employable persons on home relief would be assigned Public works projects would also be mandated for the conservation and development of work skills of parents and other eligible relatives receiving aid to dependent children Minimum Held Obsolete A third measure would repeal a section of the social services law mandating minimum salary rates for local caseworkers The basic minimum now is 4500 a year with 10 per cent more for caseworkers with one year of graduate training and 20 per cent over the minimum for those with two years of graduate training As new methods are developed in the administration of public assistance programs including the separation of services and payment functions there will be increasing need for flexibility in personnel standards qualifications and salaries the Governor observed in a memorandum He also noted that since the minimum pay scales were established by the Legislature the Taylor Law which governs labor negotiations by public employes had been enacted and salaries were now appropriate matters of collective bargaining The 4500 minimum was obsolete and currently without practical effect he added The fourth bill would require that appropriate members of the staff of local welfare offices personally advise eligible needy persons periodically of the availability of family planning services at public expense and inquire whether such persons desire to have such services furnished to them They could not be required or coerced into requesting or receiving these services In another legislative development 14 Senators and 42 Assemblymen including Republicans and Democrats in both houses asked their colleagues to approve a measure to protect by state law the current status and quality of the specialized academic high schools in New York City Senator John D Calandra Bronx Republican and Assemblyman Burton G Hecht Bronx Democrat the chief sponsors included in this category the Bronx High School of Science Peter Stuyvesant High School Brooklyn Technical High School the High School of Music and Art and the High School of the Performing Arts Members of the community school board in District 3 of Manhattans West Side charged recently that the admission policy at the Bronx High School of Science had made it the most segregated school in the city Chancellor Harvey B Scribner has announced he will name a committee to examine admission policies at the specialized high schools Mr Calandra and Mr Hecht accused Dr Scribner of the most insidious attack thus far upon the finest educational schools in New York City They said the Chancellors attempt to destroy these schools must be stopped immediately Other legislative developments ABORTION PROPOSALS Tarky Lombardi Syracuse Republican who is chairman of the Senate Health Committee asked the Legislature to outlaw commercial abortion referral services and ban hospitals and doctors from accepting referral patients from outofstate referral agencies At a news conference here Dr Alan F

Schools visited the Capitol to lobby for repeal of the socalled Blaine Amendment to the Constitution which bars state aid to religiously oriented schools and for the enactment of the SpenoLerner bill

NEW TRIMS MADE IN STATE BUDGET TO END DEADLOCK,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/02/archives/new-trims-made-in-state-budget-to-end-deadlock-a-gop-agreement.html,ALBANY Friday April 2 A Republican impasse on a new state budget was ended last night with Governor Rockefeller and GOP leaders agreeing to additional econo mies of 43million for a total of 760million in reductions from the Governors original 845billion proposal Legislative sources said that the Governor as part of a series of deals to win the crucial votes of a handful of Republi can holdouts in both houses had agreed to suspend state payments for abortions for welfare recipients and the working poor in the Medicaid program for 90 days pending legislative action aimed at banning such payments In addition the Republican leadership scrapped proposed new taxes on beer and liquor that would have yielded an estimated total of 59million Budget Debate Begins After nearly 11 hours of tedious sometimes vexing negotiations with the Republi can holdouts a 77billion budget for the 1972 state fiscal year was brought to the floor of the Senate and the Assembly for a debate that was originally scheduled for Wednesday In New York City Mayor Lindsay deplored the budget cuts declaring No budget is better than the budget that has been proposed Other high city officials painted a bleak picture of declining city services under the reduced state funds The debate began at 915 PM and was still going on ear ly this morning At 1135 PM the Assembly passed the first of a series of budget bills 76 to 73 with one abstention Only three Republicans voted against the measure Edwyn E Mason of Hobart Edward M Kinsella of Syracuse and Clark C Warn ple of Schenectady Voting Pattern The vote76 is the minimum required for passagewas ex pected to set the pattern for the voting on the rest of the budget Assemblyman Willis H Ste phens chairman of the Ways and Means Committee led off the debate by terming the sharply honed version of the Governors 845billion pro posal a budget of consensus that few are happy with By 945 PM the first Assem blyman of the evening slipped off to sleep as speaker after speaker began to rise Assemblyman Alexander Chananau Democrat of the Bronx and ranking minority member of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee led the Democratic attack on the budg et by charging that Governor Rockefeller and the Republican legislators had said during the last election campaign that there would be no need for new taxes this year The people bought his prom ises and now they will have to pay for them Mr Chananau said The Senate bells calling the Assembly together sounded at 10 PM and finally released the 31 Republican Senators from lastminute conference on the controversial budget The budget contains a tax increase package of about 475 million A drastic shrinking of the Governors original tax re quest of 11billion it amounts to roughly 43 cents for every tax dollar Mr Rockefeller asked for in January Sales Tax Up 1 Cent The tax package calls for a rise from 3 to 4 cents on the dollar in the states portion of the sales tax for estimated revenues of 307million as well as for an increase in busi ness taxes worth 168million Two of the Republican hold outsSenator James H Dono van of Chadwicks a passionate foe of last years liberalization of the abortion law and Richard E Schermerhorn a freshman from Cornwallsaid that Mr Rockefeller had pledged that if the bill banning Medicaid pay ments for abortions for medi cally indigent mothersexcept when their lives were imperiled passed the Legislature he would sign it Mr Donovan said the Gov ernor had also agreed to seek the release of all pending abortion bills from committee for floor debate The last few days here have been dominated by the attempts of the Governor and the Republican leaders to mol lify a hardline cadre of five Republican Senators and about 10 Assemblymen who opposed the Governors proposed budget of 845billion That budget contained the record re quest for new taxes of 11bil lion Most of the recommendations for cuts hit heavily at aid to localities particularly in the welfare sector and at state bureaucracies and programs such as narcotics and consumer affairs On Tuesday the GOP leg islative leaders proposed cuts of about 720million in the Governors budget request and sharply reduced the tax pack age to 488million The pack age included a 1centonthe dollar increase in the sales tax an increase of up to 1 per cent in the corporation franchise tax and rises in the taxes on liquor and beer But this was still not enough to satisfy the holdouts partic ularly the legislative delegation from the Syracuse area where local newspapers editorialized relentlessly against new taxes To break the deadlock and to preserve Republican unity which had become slightly tar nished here in the past few days the Governor and the leaders agreed last night to more than 40million in new budget cuts for a total reduc tion of 760million Most of the new economiies were expected to come out of the budget for the Urban De velopment Corporation a pet agency of the Governor by re quiring the corporation to pay back about 43million in state loans in the new fiscal year In addition the tax package was shrunk to about 475mil lion The planned tax increases on beer from 45 cents to 25 cents on the gallon and on liquor from 225 to 275 a gallon were dropped During the past few days intense negotiations took place aimed at swaying 76 of the As semblys 79 Republicans and 29 of the Senates 31 Republicans None of the bargaining was more highpressure than that conducted today Mr Rockefeller entered Sena tor Brydges office at 10 AM yesterday and a stream of tightlipped legislators aides budget officials and leaders were observed entering and leaving until well into the eve ning Wednesday night the leaders recessed both houses when they realized they did not have the votes to pass the budget with out seeking support from the minority Democrats Yesterday began with cancellations of GOP confer ences another indication that there were not enough votes to pass a budget While rumors swirled about the Capitol and the Democrats chuckled over the rift in the GOP ranks the hard negotia ting was taking place in Sena tor Brydgess office Late In the afternoon after a day of statementssuch as Were halfway between agree ment and nonagreement  cautious optimism was voiced by the leaders They said that a budget might finally be passed in legislative debates that were expected to run into the night A little after 7 PM a spokes man for the Governor said that Mr Rockefeller felt well have a budget tonight The latest budget package takes harsh swipes at the 16 million people on the states welfare rolls including a pro posal to cut most payments by 10 per cent This and other proposed welfare shrinkages were remin iscent of 1969 when economy mindde lawmakers chopped at the spiraling state welfare budget At that time a wave of protest from Democrats and welfare groups ensued al though without much success This year the outcry has been more a whimper than a harangue although the wel fare reductionswhich would spare the aged blind and dis abledwould pay only 90 per cent of the state standard for dependent families and individ uals and couples on home re lief The 10 per cent cut trims

Budget by Capitulation,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/03/archives/budget-by-capitulation.html,The Republicandictated state budget rammed through the Legislature at dawn yesterday is a shabby example of budgetmaking by secret caucus and budgetmaking by capitulation Governor Rockefellers proposed budget was ripped and sewed together sawed and sanded by members of his own party Conservative elements were clearly in the saddle with the moderatesincluding the Governor himselfobliged to yield on virtually every important point Democratic members of the Legislature were excluded from the entire process almost as totally as if they had been in an Apollo space capsule on their way to the moon They received copies of the budget only an hour before they were called into session to watch impotently while the GOP hammered it home The result of this parody of deliberative government is a budget that robs urban areas of funds due them penalizes the poor and fails to meet essential needs The trouble is not that cuts came in the original Rockefeller proposals but that the wrong cuts came Instead of returning 21 per cent of the states personal income tax revenues to the localities as the state had promised it would under the revenuesharing scheme enacted only a year ago this budget returns only 18 per cent Each lost percentage point translates into 16 mil lion lost for New York City which already confronts massive budgetary shortages of its own Welfare recipients will not only be denied the modest costofliving boosts due them but they will also be forced to absorb a 10 per cent cut in existing levels benefits The inevitable result will be increased malnutri tion among the 500000 youngsters on relief in New York City Other budget cuts hit at such key areas as medical care and education    The Republicans decreed no hikes in income taxes although hikes in the upperincome brackets would have been a form of forced Federalstate revenue sharing since state taxes can be credited against Federal income levies Instead the GOP chose to raise the state sales tax from three cents to four cents on the dollar While everyone shares this tax burden it bears with special severity on poor and middleincome families Some of the budgetary provisions defy all reason In the name of economy it was agreed to suspend Medicaid payments for abortions It is difficult to imagine a more selfdefeating policy This means that medically indigent women who may already have several children and not want any more could be denied the opportunity to have an abortion This is a vicious inhumane thing to do it is also an uneconomic thing to do The average cost for an out patient abortion in New York City is 64 the average cost of an inpatient abortion is 177 The average cost of childbirth is 339 and prenatal and postnatal care runs the figure to 800 If the mother is on welfare her relief budget goes up by 624 a year to care for the extra child Where is the economy in this This is one of many questions which the lateness of the hour and existing budgetary procedures prevented even being considered It is hard to conceive of a more irresponsible way to make a budget There is a clear need to revise the Legis latures rules so that at least a week will elapse between the final submission of budget bills and the Legislatures action on them Such an interval would give members of the Legisla ture a chance to know what they are voting on it would give citizens a chance to weigh alternatives and to com municate with their representatives That would be budgetmaking by reason not chaos Pending such basic reform the Legislature has a duty to take another look at the shambles it has made of the present budget Revisions are essential to meet the states inescapable needs The Governor is the right man to lead that effort at redress

Nixon Orders End To Eased Abortions In Armed Services,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/03/archives/nixon-orders-end-to-eased-abortions-in-armed-services.html,SAN CLEMENTE Calif April 2President Nixon has quietly ordered the armed services to abandon liberalized abortion procedures adopted last year and asked them to follow in stead the abortion procedures of the states White House sources confirmed tonight  Under the liberalized military procedures the sources said the wives of servicemen were able to obtain abortions more easily than they would have under state regulations which generally are more stringent In most cases the wife of a serviceman was able to obtain an abortion on the recommen dation of a military doctor and one consultant By contrast most states require a more cumbersome and ultimately more difficult procedure Military sources said tonight that the purpose of the liberali zation was not so much to make it easier for the wife of a serviceman to obtain an abor tion as it was to standardize abortion procedures throughout the armed services There was no intent these sources said to defy state regulations The main objective of the changes was merely to make it simpler for military doctors to respond to requests from those seeking abortions However sources at the Western White House said President Mixon felt that the military services should adhere to state regulations and should henceforth agree to abortions only after the most careful checking with state law No other motive was given for his decision which was recently transmitted to Secretary of De fense Melvin R Laird
CITY SPURNS PLAN FOR LABOR PACTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/03/archives/city-spurns-plan-for-labor-pacts-lindsay-says-cuts-in-budget-by.html,Blaming state budget cuts Mayor Lindsay rejected yester day the recommendations of a special impasse panel for set tlement of the contract disputes with the citys policemen fire men and sanitation men The budget adopted early today by the controlling state legislative leadership worsens the citys fiscal crisis the Mayor said in a statement It has reduced even further the citys financial capabilites The city at this time has only one choice We must adhere strictly to our labor policy guidelines Under these conditions the city cannot possibly finance a settlement based on the media tors recommendations There fore the city must reject the panels recommendations Suggestions Reviewed Mayor Lindsay conferred dur ing the afternoon with his Labor Policy Committee and the Bu reau of the Budget staff His office announced that he had thoroughly reviewed the im passe panels recommendations in the light of a preliminary analysis of the state budget approved in Albany early yes terday morning The Labor Pol icy Committee advised the Mayor to reject the recommen dations Earlier in the day the Mayor charged that the state budget reductions cut the throats of the cities The Republican leaders in Albany he said made a deal with the rightwing Republican legislators and the Conserva tive party The battle Is not over he insisted He asked his aides to try to round up citizen support for protests to individual legis lators that might result in modi fications The citys rejection of the impasse panels recommenda tions was another in the se ries of setbacks this week in efforts to resolve the drawn out disputes The Uniformed Sanitationmens Association re jected the recommendations on Wednesday The Uniformed Firefighters Association had not formally rejected them but Michael J Maye president of the firemen made it clear that his union was not satisfied with the proposals Only the Patrolmens Benevo lent Association has not made public its position on the panels proposals but a spokes man said that Edward J Kier nan PBA president would discuss the unions view at a news conference at 1 PM Monday at 250 Broadway Firemen Are Silent There was no immediate comment from Mr Maye re garding the Mayors rejection of the recommendations the first time since the establish ment of the Office of Collec tive Bargaining that the city had rejected the formal pro posals of an impasse panel John J DeLury president of the sanitationmen said that he did not consider the citys re jection surprising in view of the indicated attitudes of the uni formed groups toward the rec ommendations Now he said perhaps we can get together and wrap it up He did not explain further how he thought this could be done Mayor Lindsays assertion that the city must adhere strict ly to the labor policy guidelines apparently referred to those es tablished last December The Mayors committee had recom mended that no salary increase be granted except to offset the cost of inflation or to com pensate for increased worker productivity In setting up the guidelines the committee also urged that the line be held on pensions that parity clauses in contracts be eliminated and that con tracts run for at least three years Guidelines Surpassed However the impasse panel had gone beyond those guide lines in some respects It had recommended that firemen pa trolmen and sanitationmen be granted full pay pensions after 40 years service The recommendations also called for a 27month contract that would give firemen and patrolmen a 1900 pay in crease in three increments on top of a new salary base of 12150 This would have raised the salary of patrolmen and firemen to 14050 as of Jan 1 1973 For sanitationmen the rec ommended pay increase also in three increments was 1710 on top of a new base salary of 10951 This would have raised sanitationmens pay to 12661 as of Jan 1 1973 The panels report did specify that new contracts contain no provision for the establishment or maintenance of a parity rela tionship with the salaries of any other employe group Panel members and officials of the Office of Collective Bar gaining had been hopeful that the recommendations would provide the basis for final set tlement of the citys thorny disputes with the three serv ices But optimism about the citys willingness to go along  despite past precedents  dimmed after the firemen and sanitationmen made it clear that they were unwilling to go along with the panels pro posals Budget Talks Put Off Mayor Lindsay faced with the critical state budget cuts canceled a meeting to work on the citys own 197172 budget in favor of a session with Richard Brown his legislative lobbyist Budget Director Ed ward K Hamilton and other officials to assess the specific effects of the Albany actions Gordon Chase the Health Services Administrator issued a statement saying he was shocked and dismayed at reported promise by Governor Rockefeller to suspend state payments for abortions under the Medicaid program for 90 days pending passage of a bill that would bar these payments permanently The effect of this bill is not to deny the right oJ abortions to everyone a right given by the State Legislature last year but just to deny the right to women who cannot pay for them Mr Chase said Mr Lindsay said his harsh words about the Republicans who made the budget deal should not be construed as praise for the Democrats who were shut out of the negotia tions This is not to say that the minority acted like great states men Mr Lindsay said By re fusing to consider increases in the sales tax and by insisting that the Republicans come to them he said the Democrats had lessened the possibility of cooperation Mr Lindsay said the most severe blow in the budget was a decision by the state not to return to localities the 21 per cent of state income tax pay ments that had been promised This was a breach of faith he said in political terns While the fiscal impact of welfare changes might not be extreme he said the impact in human terms is tragic He expressed alarm at cuts in higher education and health
Nixon Abortion Statement,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/04/archives/nixon-abortion-statement.html,SAN CLEMENTE Calif April 3Following is the statement by President Nixon on Abortion  Historically laws regulat ing abortion in the United States have been the province of states not the Federal Gov ernment That remains the situation today as one state after another takes up this question debates it and de cides It That is where the de cisions should be made Partly for that reason I have directed that the policy on abortions at American military bases in the United States be made to correspond with the laws of the states where those bases are located If the laws in a particular state restrict abortions the rule at the military base hos pitals are to correspond to that law The effect of this directive is to reverse service regula tions issued last summer which had liberalized the rules on abortions at military hospitals The new ruling su persedes thisand has been put into effect by the Secre tary of Defense But while this matter is be ing debated in state capitals and weighed by various courts the country has a right to know my personal views From personal and reli gious beliefs I consider abor tion an unacceptable form of population control Further unrestricted abortion policies or abortion on demand I can not square with my personal belief in the sanctity of hu man lifeincluding the life of the yet unborn For sure ly the unborn have rights also recognized in law rec ognized even in principles ex pounded by the United Na tions Ours is a nation with a JudeoChristian heritage It is also a nation with serious so cial problemsproblems of malnutrition of broken homes of poverty and of de linquency But none of these problems justifies such a so lution A good and generous peo ple will not opt in my view for this kind of alternative to its social dilemmas Rather it will open its hearts and homes to the unwanted chil dren of its own as it has done for the unwanted mil lions of other lands

A Look at Women's Lib in Suburbia: The Emphasis Is Different,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/07/archives/a-look-at-womens-lib-in-suburbia-the-emphasis-is-different.html,WESTPORT Conn April 6Womens liberation in suburbia Its there its growing and its different from its counterpart in the cities In New York the movement is made of professional women concerned with job discrimination and equal pay said Mrs Elliott Hirsh of Stamford founder of a womens lib magazine and a frequent panelist with two of her daughters aged 15 and 25 at feminist meetings in the state In suburbia the woman is concerned with problems within herself Womens liberation in suburbia Its there but if its growing its certainly not without a good deal of opposition and most of it from women themselves Women said Mrs Eugene Penner of Redding a painter and an activist who helped organize Connecticut Feminists in the Arts women feel that if they start to examine anything it is going to fall apart There is practically a Pollyanna attitude of liking what you have Womens liberation in suburbia Its there its growing but its layered over so that women seem to be isolated from the mainstream of life In the suburbs commented Mrs Arnold Benton of Ridgefield a sculptor wife of a psychiatrist mother of two young children and one of the leading figures in the Connecticut feminist movement you have a large group of educated women who can show their political talents by licking envelopes and serving coffee their economic talents by running bake sales their organizational talents by overseeing the Brownies In Connecticuts Fairfield County the second largest of the states eight counties in population with a crosssection of communities that vary from such workingclass cities as Bridgeport to such affluent residential communities as Westport and Darien the womens liberation movement appears to be proliferating in a manner that may be representative of suburbia in general In the county informal discussion groups and consciousnessraising sessions under the banner of womens lib are cropping up More formally structured groups such as Connecticut Feminists in the Arts Western Connecticut National Organization for Women NOW and Fairfield County Womens Liberation all have recently made their appearance Membership is fluid informal and often unrecorded so it is difficult to assess the size of the movement in numbers but its growing impact is noticeable Even established organizations in the area are devoting meetings to the changing role of women Greater Emphasis on Identity While they support the familiar womens lib cries for equal job and pay opportunities day care centers and abortions one of the things that seems to place suburban feminists apart is that they appear to place greater emphasis on their inner needs and a search for identity I see the liberation of women as a progression from one kind of blindness to a little light 37yearold Kitty Penner said Ive always been conditioned to be dependent Suzanne Benton who is 39 noted but Im much more independent since Ive joined the movement Of course it leaves me open to attack but the delicious headiness of being able to define myself has been worth it Dr Dorothy Tennow Hoffman of Westport a professor of psychology at the University of Bridgeport who is deeply involved in the feminist movement in Fairfield County said she considers womens lib very much a suburban movement Even though the suburban woman may be among the worlds wealthiest her opportunities for identity and selfdetermination have been nonexistent the 42yearold educator said The fact that most suburban housewives dont realize this is irrelevant she insisted Dr Hoffman who guides several con sciousnessraising groups through their weekly sessions and has added a course in womens studies at the college called Philosophical and Psychological Aspects of Womens Roles carries her liberated mood into her private life She refuses to discuss it Being married or not married or the mother of children is an incidental aspect of being a woman she dedared It is not part of my public or professional image Furthermore I want to be related to in terms of my public actions and thoughts not by the dull details of how I manage my daily life Started a Rural Group Mrs Penner whose husband Eugene Is a guidance counselor in the Westport school system formerly was an art teacher and is now working seriously at her own paintings Besides helping organize Feminists in the Arts she started a womens lib group in the small rural community of Redding where she and her husband and their sons Charles 13 and Jonathan 9 live Mrs Penner concedes that she has rein into opposition over her activism but she said finds resistance by women understandable Marriages today are very shaky and under great pressure from many sides she said I think women are afraid to examine thingseven school situations that deal with their children Mrs Penner said that she has worked out an arrangement with her family where her two sons rotate certain jobs each week I cant be an artist who doesnt paint and I had to find solutions for household work she explained The boys do such jobs as sweeping vacuuming and some of the laundry so that she no longer even has to think about them She finds the arrangement very satisfactory The boys are very selfsufficient Mrs Penner said They are very much aware that my painting is important to me They know that the maid is not going to come by that I am not the maid that in fact there is no maid Husband Doesnt Feel Threatened She added that perhaps due to his own professional training and experience her husband is very much into womens lib and has gone to several meetings with her He doesnt feel threatened by it she said He sees it as human growth for every oneone more avenue for opening peoples potential Suzanne Benton who is president of Western Connecticut NOW and a founder of Connecticut Feminists in the Arts said she thinks her activism has improved her home life Womens lib has levels of threat for both of us she said in talking about her husband who is a psychiatrist at Silver Hill Foundation a private hospital in New Canaan but it nevertheless improved our relationship As I have become more of a person I have become more of a person to him Mrs Benton said that her husband their 12yearsold son Daniel and 7yearold daughter Janet all share now in house cleaning and cooking duties It isnt a burden to me any more she commented On the other hand Lura Grace she prefers to be called Lolly Hirsh who regards the magazine she founded last summer WomenTo By Of For and About as an opportunity for genuine communication between women discovered that the road to liberation can be a somewhat stormy one Mrs Hirsh said that her husband who runs his own advertising agency has not always agreed with her activism Its been one hellish year she said but I think we are all going to come out much more human In explaining why she feels suburban feminism differs from its urban counterpart Mrs Hirsh 49 and the mother of two sons and three daughters ranging in age from 11 to 27 describes the suburban woman as the homemaker the brood mare dealing with isolation with a husband 50 miles away in the city and insists that the very institutions which are supposed to serve herthe church the law the communication media and particularly the medical professionhave failed her totally Patricia Girton of Fairfield who is one of the few single women among the feminist leaders in Fairfield County she is one of the organizers of Fairfield County Womens Liberation said that she has encountered considerable resistance to her espousal of womens rights at Westports Famous Artists School where she is an office worker At home however its a different story I have been talking about womens liberation for a number of years and now that a fullgrown movement has come along its been easier for me Miss Ginoni who is working on her masters degree in sociology at the University of Bridgeport said My sister has become involved and even my mother has changed many of her early ideas about the womans role She used to think that being a wife and mother was a role in itself now she sees that thats not all them is for any human being As for my father she continued he is not as domineering as he used to be because we dont allow him to be Now we question his authority Our opinions are just as valid as his opinions New Attitude Toward Dates Miss Ginoni a diminutive 5 foot inch slender 101 pounds woman of 25 who wears her long brown hair loosely in a flip said she has also found a difference in her thoughts about her dates Its a matter of my attitudes that have changed she emphasized At one time their feelings toward me were very very important Now I find I am the one who is doing the judging rather than being judged  at one time would have accepted a date much more readily than I do now Apart from talking to each other and seeking to carry their message to other groups Fairfield Countys feminists are proceeding in other ways to force a new and critical look at suburban values In the legal arena they are supporting Women versus Connecticut a Yalebased group consisting of women students at Yale Law School and other feminists which has initiated a court suit seeking to liberalize the states abortion laws On the art front Connecticut Feminists in the Arts plans a spring arts festival called Women Metamorphosis I to be held in New Haven from April 29 to May 2 The festival is being presented as a wide range of expression by women  knowing it will provide stimulation and encouragement to all women in metamorphosis In the suburbs womens lib is in the air Dr Hoffman declared I see the movement as part of the vast penetrating change that is taking place everywhere But with it all doubts continue Esta Schaffer a Westport artist wife and mother who has attended several area meetings is one of those uncertain about the feminist movement While womens lib makes many valid statements I fear the direction it is taking she said They seem to stress the doing rather than the being which would propel women right into the same competitive rat race as the men I dont think they stress the human values
Nixon Abortion Stand Assailed By Planned Parenthood Doctors,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/07/archives/nixon-abortion-stand-assailed-by-planned-parenthood-doctors.html,KANSAS CITY Kan April 6 President Nixon and Governor Rockefeller of New York were sharply criticized today for their stands on abortion by the Arnerican Association of Planned Parenthood Physicians The doctors took exception to the Presidents comment last Saturday that because of his personal and religious beliefs he considered abortion an unacceptable form of population control A letter signed by Dr Richard Frank president of the association was sent to the White House It said the association was deeply troubled that the President of the United States would publicly state his religious and moral belief concerning abortion when this matter is being considered in legislatures and courts In a pluralistic society the letter went on the religious and moral beliefs of those who regard abortion as preferable to compulsory childbearing deserve the same respect as the beliefs of those to whom abortion is unacceptable We reaffirm our policy which states that it is the right of every woman to decide whether and when to bear a child At a news conference Dr Frank said Mr Nixon was prejudging that which should not be prejudged He compared the Presidents remarks with Mr Nixons comments on the Charles Manson case made  ing the Sharon Tate slaying trial Dr Alan Guttmacher president of Planned ParenthoodWorld Population criticized Mr Nixon for what he termed hamstringing his own Commission on Population Growth Dr Guttmacher predicted that the President would not accept his commissions report if abortion were included in it The association also adopted a resolution calling on Governor Rockefeller to restore Medicaid payments to women who have had voluntary abortions Dr Guttmacher called Mr Rockefellers action in suspending such payments political He said that the Governor was wheeling and dealing to win support for his budget The resolution said the cutoff of Medicaid payments for voluntary abortions performed under New York State law is detrimental to the health and welfare of women is grossly discriminatory against the poor is economically counterproductive and maybe unconstitutional
WASHINGTON,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/07/archives/nixon-and-muskie-on-abortion.html,In the ten years since John F Kennedy became the first Roman Catholic to be elected to the Presidency religious issues have almost ceased to be a major source of political controversy in the United States but the two front runners in the 1972 Presidential election campaign are acting early to avoid trouble over the question of legalized abortion Since New York States liberalized abortion law went into effect last July 1 Gordon Chase New York Citys Health Services Administrator reports that 97881 legal abortions have taken place in New York City alone over half of them on women from out of state This steep rise in the abortion rate brought from the thirty Roman tholic of New York State a warning in a pastoral letter that the church disowns by immediate excommunication any Catholic who deliberately procures an abortion or helps someone else to do so The letter condemned abortionists and their deathdealing trade and added They even advertise their monstrous commerce beyond the confines of the state thus making New York the abortion capital of America Senator Edmund Muskie the leading Democratic candidate for the Presidency and himself a Roman Catholic was the first to react to the political implications of this issue and was soon followed by President Nixon himself Mr Muskie took the opportunity in an interview with David Frost on the Westinghouse Broadcasting Companys network to draw a distinction between his support of birth control as a means of family planning and his anxiety over legalized abortion after the first six weeks of pregnancy He said he believed in birth control thought peopie ought to have government information on the subject so that they could make their own decisions and added that he hoped the Popes next encyclical on birth control takes a more liberal attitude toward the birth control pill The question of abortion does trouble me he said I suppose its related to my religious training or my church training but I think its broader than that Im concerned about diluting in any way the concept of the sanctity of life  First of all were not entirely sure of the psychological impact upon mothers themselves who become free or indiscriminate in the use of this way of avoiding the consequences of sexual relations A life has been taken away from them and Its the very nature of motherhood you know to shield and protect life not to destroy it If it becomes all right to take a life in that stage then how easy will it be to slip into the next step Should people in old age who are seniledoes it then become legitimate to take their lives And there is the medical question of when does life begin to quicken That I guess is about six weeks Its when you get beyond that point that I begin to have trouble  A few days later Mr Nixon went even further From personal and religious beliefs I consider abortion an unacceptable form of population control he said in a formal statement Further unrestricted abortion policies or abortion on demand I cannot square with my personal belief in the sanctity of human lifeincluding the life of the unborn A good and generous people he added will not opt in my view for this kind of alternative to its social dilemmas Rather it will open its hearts and its homes to the unwanted children of its own as it has done for the unwanted millions of other lands Well there seem to be all kinds of different views about the sanctity of life these days in Vietnam as well as in New York City but even in the more liberal political views on religious questions these days It is clear that abortion could easily become an issue for many voters in 1972 Senator Muskie apparently wanted to get his views on record early in the campaign and devoted more time on the Frost show to defining his positions on birth control and abortion than on any other subject Clearly lie is opposed to abortion merely as a means of helping reduce the welfare rolls or at least he told Mr Frost that this concept troubled him President Nixon however was even more explicit in opposing all abortion at any time in pregnancy in order to control population Ours is a nation with a Judea Christian heritage he said It is also a nation with serious social problems problems of malnutrition of broken homes of poverty and delinquency But none of these problems justifies such a solution Thus Mr Nixon went closer to the strict prohibition on abortion for population control outlined by the Roman Catholic bishops than did Senator Muskie and though neither statement was much noticed it is just as well to have them clearly on record for the question is sure to come up time and again as the campaign proceeds I welcomed Mr Frosts question Senator Muskie said and have used my answer to him in order to answer people who have written for my views on the subject

A Report On the Abortion Capital Of the Country,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/11/archives/a-report-on-the-abortion-capital-of-the-country-abortion-capital-of.html,AFTER nine months experience under New York States new abortion law only one definitive conclusion is possible What this country needs is a perfect contraceptive Since July 1 well over 100000 legal abortions have been performed in New York City The rate is now about 15000 a month and it shows signs of increasing steadily rather than abating New York City has in fact become the abortion capital of the country And remarkably its medical resources have been quite successful in meeting this vast new demand At the same time there are still enough horror stories enough unsolved problems to make any report on the citys legal abortion scene sound like a report on the old illegal one Investigating abortion procedures in New York today is like peeling an onion and finding that pristine pearllike layers alternate with rotten ones It is a world of continual contradictions a juxtaposition of good medicine with bad of altruism with exploitation of efficiency with incompetence of humanity with cruelty Unfortunately the data collected so far about New York Citys abortion experience are somewhat unreliable Only three of the 17 or so clinics report regularly and municipal hospitals are not filing the terminationofpregnancy certificates on which statistics regarding residency period of gestation race and age are based However approximate statistics are available an estimated 98000 abortions have been performed of these about half were performed on outofstate women and about 726 per cent were performed during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy White women accounted for 735 per cent of the total 222 per cent were black and 43 per cent Puerto Rican Most of the women were rather young 56 per cent were between 20 and 30 about a fifth were under 20 and a fifth were over 30 New York City does not collect marital statistics on abortion patients but a small early sampling by the State Department of Health indicated that 44 per cent of the New York City patients were married and private clinics in the city estimate that roughly half of their patients are married On the whole the city has avoided the catastrophe which the foes of legalized abortion predicted It has been able to perform an enormous number of abortions the true figure is probably much closer to 125000 with a high degree of safety There have been 14 deaths in the city as a result of abortions Seven resulted from procedures performed in hospitals and one from an abortion performed in a doctors office In addition at least two deaths are known to have occurred out of state as a result of New York City abortions one in Indianapolis and one in New Jersey The Health Services Administration counts only those deaths occurring in New York City under known auspices this yields a rate of 8 deaths per 100000 abortions which compares favorably with the experience of other coun tries in which abortion is legal Great Britain for instance had a death rate of 17 per 100000 abortions in its first year There is evidence that the law has made a real reduction in low quality illegal or selfinduced abortions although not as large a one as might have been expected or hoped Incompletesbungled abortion cases requiring later hospitalizationhave fallen off as much as 50 per cent in some hospitals There has also been a noticeable drop in the number of unwanted babies at least among white women Adoption agencies report a 50 per cent decline in the number of white babies placed for adoption over the past four months If the official statistics reveal nothing about personal experiences under the new procedures they reveal little more about the scope of the abortion industry that has grown up largely uncontrolled since the passage of the law initiating what one publicofficial has called the most critical in vivo experiment in abortion history What follows is a look at some of the more salient features of the scene A MODEL ABORTION UNIT IN A MUNICIPAL HOSPITAL KINGS County Hospital has developed one of the best hospital abortion facilities in New York City It scores high in all the criteria abortion proponents consider important It is the closest thing possible to a walkin clinic given the citys mandatory twoday waiting period between applying for an abortion and having one Women can walk in at any time without appointments for the physical examination that sets the process in motion It handles about 150 abortions a week more than any other municipal hospital and is the only one that accepts cases up to the 24th week of pregnancy after which abortions are prohibited under the law Most of the municipal hospitals perform abor tions only through the 20th week It has its own Medicaid inspector so that anyone who does not have the money for the procedure 160 for suction curettage 270 for saline instillation can apply The hospital does not wait for the application to be approved before performing the abortion It neither keeps women in the hospital so long that it becomes a hardship for them nor pushes them out before they can catch their breath Suctioncase patients stay from four to eight hours salinecase patients return to the hospital when labor begins and stay in a special sixbed room attended by a medical student Its abortion unit is completely separate from its regular obstetrical and gynecological units This prevents some of the otherwise inevitable trauma Patients are spared hostility from medical personnel and other patients who may be unsympathetic nurses are spared the emotional confusion of trying to save one womans baby while helping another woman to abort All medical personnel specifically volunteered to work on the abortion unit and then were screened to insure further that they were sympathetic to abortion patients At Kings County medical personnel make special efforts in large ways and small to lessen the inevitable misery of abortion There are juice and sandwiches for the patients coloring books and crayons for the children who sometimes stay at the hospital while their mothers are being aborted Once Nurse Linda Galley called every social agency in Brooklyn to try to find a place for a saline patient to stay while awaiting the onset of laborthe patient was in the process of separating from her husband No one would take the patient in so Mrs Gallay kept her on in the abortion unit Another time when a patients mother died just before the patient was to have a saline abortion and there was no one to take care of the younger brothers and sisters the whole family slept at the hospital overnight Word around the hospitals is that Kings County owes its ability to respond humanely and flexibly in abortion cases to the efficiency and resourcefulness of 24yearold Judith Epstein the units administrator Miss Epsteins description of the logistics of operating her 16bed abortion unit is reminiscent of a Marx Brothers movie doubletime Every day we have four shifts of patients In the morning we do two shifts of d  cs eight patients in at 730 and are bedded down and ready to go by 830 Two doctors use three operating rooms simultaneously so we can keep the women moving as quickly as possible At 200 we pick up the third shift the saltingouts By 4 the last d  cs from the morning are ready to go home and at 530 or 6 we change all the linen on the beds and change nurses and the fourth shift begins We encourage the evening d  cs to stay overnight its cold out and not too safe We wake them up at 6 give them breakfast and send them home Then we change the linen and were ready for the morning again Kings County is one of the 14 municipal hospitals which have performed 16200 abortions since the new law went into effect last July 1 Additionally New Yorks voluntary private nonprofit and proprietary private profitmaking hospitals have each performed another 56800 Some of these have simply begun scheduling a limited amount of operating time for abortions in addition to the other services they provide and a few have established abortion programs which deal with larger numbers of patients in an organized way PUBLIC VS PRIVATE FACILITIES AN interesting new phenomenon among the private hospitals is those specializing primarily  even almost exclusively  in abortions Among the bestknown of these are Park East Park West Wickersham and Madison Avenue Hospitals Park East for example handles as many as 50 patients a day at fees ranging from 300 to 575 Other hospitals have made it known to referral agencies that they are willing to take cases in volume One Brooklyn hospital is said to have made an arrangement with a referral agency be cause it was awaiting a million dollars in Blue Cross payments and was short of cash The lowestpriced abortions are those available through the Womens Abortion Project which acting as an organized consumer group has been able to pressure costs down to 100 by promising several doctors outside the city limits a large volume of referrals The doctors who operate out of their offices each book as many as 15 to 20 abortions a day Another kind of facility which has developed to meet the abortion demand is the nonhospital clinic The clinics provide lowcost outpatient abortions in volume for women 12 weeks pregnant or less These generally cost between 200 and 300 However Planned Parenthood of New York City expects to open a clinic here this summer that will set a new low with an average fee of 80 It is impossible to generalize about the quality of care available in the various types of facilitiesagain both extremes exist side by side While Kings County a municipal hospital may be among the best Bellevue another municipal seems at once one of the best and one of the worst Bellevue has a liberal payment policy and a highly sympathetic nursing staff and is not overly strict in enforcing the requirements that patients be from the city to qualify for municipalhospital care On the other hand 90 per cent of Bellevue abortions are done by resident physicians who are still in training whereas at Jacobi Bronx Municipal for instance 80 per cent are done by physicians on the faculty Also Bellevue insists that d  c patients 9 to 12 weeks pregnant spend two full days in the hospitaleven though the patients do nothing the first day but lie in bed and receive a shave and an enema Saline patients are are kept in the hospital over the entire course of the procedure often three days or longer This is not only a hardship on poor women but also reduces the number of patients the hospital can serve Most disturbing of all Bellevue has been conducting routine fetal heartbeat monitoring of its saline patients in order to observe when the fetus dies When the research first started the electro cardiogram EKG monitor was placed right next to the womans bed Each time there was a fetal heartbeat she heard a click and saw a needle register the EKG pattern In effect she heard and watched the fetus die When Bellevue social workers confronted one of the doctors participating in the experiment he said Well I dont like doing abortions so I might as well get something out of it Bellevue is still conducting fetal heartbeat observations without the permission of the women involved but claims that the machine has been put in another room so patients can no longer observe it A private hospital however is no guarantee of superior humane or even safe treatment Last August a woman from Michigan checked into a hospital near Kennedy Airport for a 900 abortion arranged by a referral agency shed seen advertised in a national magazine The referral agency had told her that since she was 16 weeks pregnant she would have a saline abortion The woman was wheeled into an operating room where her legs were strapped in stirrups and a gas mask put over her face When she awoke her stomach hurt and she found that it had been bandaged She asked why and was told that she had begun to hemorrhage and that a hysterotomy had been performed to save her life Since saline patients are never given general anesthesia nor strapped into stirrups the doctor obviously had made a mistake Either he did not know how advanced the pregnancy was and began a d  c which caused the hemorrhage or he confused the patient with a hysterotomy patient and made up the patently farfetched The situation in the hospitals is typical of the abortion picture in general there is no uniformity from facility to facility Even the municipal hospitals all theoretically under the same administration vary radically in procedure medical practice and attitudes toward the patient Nor does the common saw You get what you pay for have any relevance here A 160 municipal abortion may be as safe and pleasant as the de luxe 575 abortion special THE STORY OF ONE CLINIC THIS is the story of Womens Services formerly Womens Medical Group New Yorks bestknown clinic Barbara Pyle and Dr Hale Harvey met when she was studying for her masters and he his PhD in the philosophy department in Tulane University in New Orleans Dr Harvey was interested in medical ethics particularly as they related to abortion and asked Barbara Pyle to research the legalized abortion system in England when she spent her summer vacation there That fall Miss Pyle transferred to NYU to work on her PhD but remained in touch with Harvey When abortion became legal here says Miss Pyle I wrote to Hale and said Why dont we start a clinic I knew all about it from the research Id done in England He sent me 30000 and thats what it tooktwo months supplies and everything drugs medications pumps and everything I figured we would make Hales money back in six weeks and we did When everything was under way Dr Harvey came north and became the clinics medical director Womens Services which receives 90 per cent of its 700 patients per week through referrals from the Clergy Consultation Service has pioneered in making abortion as painless and positive an experience as possible The clinic is staffed by 60 women counselors many of whom have had abortions themselves who spend an hour and a half with each patient developing a supportive relationship with her and seeing her through the entire procedure It is clinic policy that the counselors wear ordinary street clothesexcept during the abortion itself when they wear lab coatsin order to encourage a womantowoman rather than womantonurse relationship After interviewing the patient and discussing the abortion with her to allay any fear or guilt she may feel the counselor calls in the doctor Each doctor is required to go through a little ritual he shakes the patients hand and says Im glad to meet you The counselor then explains why the woman has chosen to have the abortion The doctor then must say Youre doing the right thing Im glad to help you Flowered potholder mittens cover the cold metal stirrups on the operating table A sheet is suspended over the table so that although the patient can see the doctors face she never sees a drop of blood or an instrument A painkiller is given by pill not by needle which might hurt and is followed by a paracervical block Womens Services has a good safety record In fact it is the only New York abortion facility to have had its record confirmed by an outside observer A US Public Health Service officer reviewed the clinics unselected data and found that its complication rate was 236 per 1000 abortions a figure which compares well with the complication rates in Czechoslovakia and Hungary which range from 7 to 54 per 1000 abortions respectively Everything seemed perfect Letters flowed in from grate ful women the press wrote admiring reports those most familiar with the abortion scene  counselors reporters women doing referralsvowed that if they themselves ever needed abortions they would go to Womens Services Then in January the State Department of Health found out what Hale Harvey and Barbara Pyle had known all along Harvey had been accused of performing illegal abortions and had surrendered his medical license to the Louisiana State Medical Board in 1969 he was not licensed to practice medicine in any state in the country The state recommended that the Attorney General take action against the clinic because it was in violation of the public health law requiring such facilities to be licensed Hale Harvey left the clinic and callers were told he was on an indefinite vacation and Dr Bernard Nathanson medical consultant to the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws was brought in to take his place The clinic has applied for licensing and expects to receive a decision on May 10 No other New York City clinic has been licensed by the state The case of Womens Services illustrates some of the paradoxes of the New York abortion situation Although the New York City Board of Health set up stringent and elaborate requirements for clinics on Oct 19 it left a crucial loophole the clinics were not required to register or apply for approval when they opened Therefore the city had no way of knowing whether the clinics met the Board of Health Requirements or even in fact how many there were where they were located and who ran them The city took the position that it would allow the clinics a period of grace in which to meet the requirements OUTOFSTATE WOMEN I KATHY D am 18 years old and live in a suburb of Boston In fate July when I discovered that I was pregnant I called a referral service in New York City They told me to contact Dr Frank S at his office on Park Avenue I called the doctor and his secretary told me the cost would be 300 It took me two weeks to get the money together then I made the appointment and my husband brother and I came to New York We had 343 and our return tickets to Boston The doctor said yes his fee was 300 but the hospital cost 275 We left his office and I was crying so much I couldnt see the buildings We sold our bus tickets back We called everyone we knew but we couldnt raise any more money That night we stayed in Central Park Early in the morning we saw some blood banks on 40th Street We got 10 each for a pint of blood Further along the block was another blood bank I was too dizzy to give more but Richie and Ken each got 20 more We spent another night in Central Park very hungry since wed only had one hot dog each all day The next day I kept throwing up and crying We tried to beg but were too ashamed That night we slept in Tompkins Square The next morning we still needed 25 more We called the doctor but he refused to lower his price At that my husband was so desperate he waltzed along St Marks Place trying to solicit a homosexual Instead he met a woman from Womens Liberation who lent us 25 Later we found out I could have had the abortion done for much less but neither the doctor nor the referral agency ever suggested I could get a cheaper one elsewhere TESTIMONY FROM HEARINGS HELD BY BOROUGH PRESIDENT PERCY SUTTON ON OCT 16 1970 SINCE July more than 50000 out  of  state women have come to New York for abortions Most of them like Kathy D have made their arrangements through the commercial agencies which make their services known in a variety of ways Some of the ads are restrained and sober like those on the slick pages of the national magazines others are tasteless and tackya squib on a matchbook cover a notice on the back pages of a tabloid squeezed in among the racing results and usedcar ads even believe it or not a banner drawn by a blimp flying over a beach in Miami Unlike the New York woman who can find an abortion simply by asking her own gynecologist and who is aware from newspapers magazines and friends of the alternatives available the outoftown woman frequently finds herself at the mercy of a commercial referral agency Complaints against the agencies have been numerous resulting in recent investigations of this new industry by the State Attorney Generals office which is currently debating whether the agencies should be outlawed or regulated The most common problems are these  Many of the agencies imply that they offer the only or cheapest way of finding an abortion when in fact their prices are often higher than average and free information is available from other sources  The fees they charge for making the arrangements range from a low of 75 to 160 and up  The agencies usually refuse to supply a breakdown of the package price until after the abortion has been paid for and performed Employes of one agency testified that when women asked what the agencys fee was they were told it was 10when in fact the agency kept much larger amount The agencies push their higher priced packages encouraging women to have deluxe rooms or to have general rather than local anesthesia when these may have no bearing on the safety of the procedure Potentially more serious problems may arise because a woman who goes through such an agency has no direct prior contact with the doctor who will perform her abortion A case in point is the woman who had the mistaken hysterotomy here not one but two referral agencies were involved The first agency subcontracted the patient to a second agency which made the hospital arrangements A woman may arrive in New York to find that her pregnancy is further advanced than she thought and may have to have a more expensive procedure than she is prepared to pay for If she hasnt taken the precaution of having a pregnancy test she may even have an abortion although not pregnant at all Although outofstate women generally dont know about them free referrals are available through several responsible nonprofit referral agencies  Planned Parenthood of New York City runs the Family Planning Information Service set up by the Interagency Council for Family Planning The service refers callers to hospitals and doctors who perform abortions for under 350 inclusive It refers to only one clinic Upper Harlem Medical Association  The Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion is a network of 120 ministers and rabbis with offices in 23 states who do free abortion counseling and referrals Women anywhere in the country can call their New York number to be put in touch with a clergyman near them  The Womens Abortion Project is a network of some 400 womens liberationists unequivocally dedicated to the right of every woman who wants an abortion to have one In addition to making referrals to all the standard facilities plus its own doctors outside the city the Abortion Project will find women places to stay and do just about anything else necessary to help someone having an abortion We get everybody elses rejects the women who have no money or have to be aborted the very next day or are too late says Sue Murdock a member of the project Most city officials and even many abortion spokesmen have taken the position that their responsibility ends with New York City women Some like Dr Robert Hall head of the Association for the Study of Abortion would even impose a residency requirement My main concern is the future of nationwide repeal of abortion laws he says I see it jeopardized by those capitalizing on the momentary monopoly New York has Id be willing to say no to a couple of hundred thousand women over the next year in order to improve the chances of their having legalized abortion in their own states Others like Councilwoman Carol Greitzer believe that city government and health agencies should take the responsibility for providing abortion information to outofstate women I recommend that they advertise and maintain a 24hour referral service and forbid all other referrals except by nonprofit organizations she says Attorney General Louis Lefkowitz has stated he will not outlaw the commercial agencies unless he is satisfied that agencies exist where people can get this information In the meantime Planned Parenthood the Clergy Consultation Service and the Womens Abortion Project are carrying the main burden of providing noncommercial alternatives LATE ABORTIONS  OF have arisen under the new law those involving late abortions are among the thorniest They are hardest on the nurses Some nurses who see and handle as many as four or five fetuses in one day end up having nightmares The doctors involvement often ends with the saline instillation it is the nurse who must examine the fetus and placenta to see that all the tissue has been expelled an who must prepare the fetus for the mortuary When saline patients are treated in the obstetrical ward the nurse also must cope with the ambiguities inherent in the situation In one bed you may have a woman whos making her fourth attempt to have a live baby and you know its going to come out dead and in the next bed you may have someone whos aborting by choice says one nurse After 20 weeks gestation the  situation becomes even more difficult I hate to do abortions after 20 weeks says one doctor who conscientiously performs them When you inject saline you often see an increase in fetal movements Its horrible And the probability of a live birth though still extremely small increases Since July there have been 28 live births About half survived longer than several minutes and one lived to be placed for adoption At Bellevue where one fetus lived for half an hour and another for five and a half hours the policy is to resuscitate the fetus and rush it to the premature ward Your initial reaction is youre dealing with life and you have to support it says Ann McDonald head nurse on the obstetrical service But theyre such immature fetuses that the chance of survival is nil to begin with Yet you cant stand by and watch Unfortunately the women having the post20week abortions are those least able to cope with their situation they are the poorest least educated youngest women Miss Margaret Aldrich who runs the citys abortion clearing house an interhospital agency has observed that one typical late abortion patient is the girl under 15 The family doesnt know she doesnt want them to know When she finally gets to someone who can help her shes in the last stages of pregnancy Kids honestly dont know anything about pregnancy They dont get the facts of life at home they dont get them at school they dont get them anywhere Miss Aldrichs observation is borne out by the statistics at Kings Count for instance women under 20 re present 40 per cent of the saline patients Governor Rockefeller has recommended that the State Legislature reduce the gestation period for justifiable abortion to 20 weeks Virtually all doctors favor this recommendation It was never meant to be 24 weeks says Dr Edwin Daily director of the Department of Healths Maternal Infant CareFamily Planning Projects The only reason that was put in was to kill the law In fact the 24week limit seems to have been arrived at as a legislators compromise In the old law a distinction was made between first and seconddegree abortion with the dividing line at 24 weeks of gestation The fetus is generally considered viable at 28 weeks however during the nineteentwenties a fetus judged to be about 20 weeks at birth survived into adulthood Twentyfour weeks was chosen as a midpoint When the new law was drafted Cyril C Means Jr professor at New York Law School and an expert on New York States abortion laws recommended that 24 weeks would be a good cutoff point because of the legislative precedent and also because many birth defects cannot be detected until 20 weeks gestation or later Medically however abortion is defined as the termination of pregnancy within the first 20 weeks of gestation and most doctors are biased in favor of this limit I have never met a doctor who wouldnt agree to setting the limit back to 20 weeks says Dr Hall Most womens groups however oppose this restriction on the grounds that it would hurt those who need it most Hospitals and doctors quote price demands in advance then the women spend weeks trying to get the money says Sue Murdock Its criminal to punish these women IRONICALLY the agency keeping closest watch on the medical aspects of abortion in New York is the U S Public Health Services Abortion Surveillance Committee which works out of Atlanta Ga Doctors on the committee have come up to New York to study individual facilities and have traveled to Indianapolis and New Jersey to investigate deaths occurring there as a result of New York City abortions The committee also keeps close watch on reports from sentinel hospitals around the country If you expect that a disease like encephalitis may come into your town says Dr James Kahn of the Abortion Surveillance Committee you set up a ring of sentinel chickens on the outskirts Then you bleed them periodically to see if theyve developed antibodies to the disease I thought it might be a good idea to apply that concept to New Yorks abortion situation  establish sentinel hospitals to look for complications and report them to us Then we could trace them right back to the doctors and hospitals responsible The sentinel hospitals have reported a flurry of complaints concerning two hospitals one private and one voluntary but not in great enough number to be significant From what evidence there is New York seems to be handling abortions with adequate safety On the other hand there isnt that much evidence The citys data on abortion complications are hopelessly inadequate  the statistical thing is an absolute morass says Dr Harold Schulman obgyn chief at Jacobi hospital No standards at all have been developed BEYOND the matter of safety lie questions concerning the medically optimum ways of performing abortions Here the dispute rages Some doctors believe abortions should be performed only in hospitals on an inpatient basis Dr Schulman on the other hand believes that the clinic he runs at Jacobi has demonstrited that outpatient abortions even outpatient salines are safe Some obgyn chiefs routinely use general anesthesia Others believe that general anesthesia presents an unnecessary danger to the patient Anesthesia always carries a risk says Dr Hall Its a small risk but when youre dealing with such a large number of patients it becomes significant As doctors gain experience with abortion more refined techniques are being developed One clinic Womens Medical Center at 80 Irving Place now temporarily closed specialized in a refinement of suction curettage called the Karmen technique A plastic tube the size of a drinking straw called a cannula was used instead of a vacuum curette Since the tube was so small dilatation of the cervix was unnecessary and since it was flexible perforation of the uterus was less likely This technique has proved effective only through the eighth week of pregnancy however Dr Schulman has developed a refinement of the saline technique after the needle is introduced into the amniotic sac it is replaced by a plastic tube eliminating the possibility of the needles hitting blood vessel or perforating the uterus as it shrinks when the fluid is withdrawn Ideally what we want is something thats available at the corner drugstore thats completely safe says Dr Edmund Rothschild a director of the Health and Hospitals Corporation Many doctors hope that prostaglamdins a class of compounds originally isolated from seminal fluid will prove to be the abortifacient of the future Some of these seem to be effective in inducing abortion when taken intravenously or even when used in a vaginal tampon There are hopes that prostaglandins might even provide the perfect morningafter pill Although the compounds look very promising three to five years of basic research are expected to be necessary before they will be cleared for use by the FDA THE VIEW LAW WILL NOT BE ABORTED THERE is littl
 doubt that New York City has become the abortion capital of the country a designation those in the vanguard of the abortion movement are proud to accept So far despite generous room for improvement New York apparently has proven itself capable of handling the enormous demandeven to the satisfaction of the State Legislature which is expected to decree no fundamental alteration in the law this session  though it may make that change barring abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy Not a bad startbut these problems remain  Abortion is still less accessible to the poor than the rich In 1968 under the old restrictive law there were five abortions per 1000 births for ward patients and 9 abortions per 1000 births for private patients Despite the hundredfold increase the old ratio is still intact Of course Governor Rockefellers temporary suspension of Medicaid payments for abortions widens this gap considerably and should the Legislature approve permanent suspension an obvious discrimination against the poor will result  Profiteering has not yet been brought under control although competition among clinics abortion specialty hospitals and referral agencies has brought prices down somewhat The Attorney Generals office has brought a lawsuit against one of the agencies Abortion Information Agency Inc and a bill outlawing all commercial referral agencies has been introduced in the Legislatureactions which should further alleviate this problem  The New York City Department of Health has failed to supervise the clinics to establish accurate data collection or to take any action on the medical complaints it has received  And the old attitudes linger on Some medical personnel like the obgyn chief at one hospital still refer to abortion as this obscene business THERE is no evidence that the demand for abortions is leveling off hospitals have had a large and steady increase in applicants since January Doubtless as abortion information gets around and people begin to regard the procedure as more acceptable this increase will continue As doctors become increasingly experienced with abortion we can expect to see the development of better techniques culminating perhaps in the discovery of the perfect abortifacient Perhaps And perhaps we will also see the development of that perfect contraceptive,,
BIRTH‐CURB MOVES FOUGHT IN IRELAND,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/11/archives/birthcurb-moves-fought-in-ireland-churchstate-clash-feared-over.html,DUBLIN April 10 Moves to liberalize the Irish laws on contraception and to remove the constitutional ban on divorce legislation are running into both political and ecclesiastical opposition here and few people now rule out the possibility of a major clash between church and state on these issues Under laws dating back to 1876 the importation of contraceptives even for personal use is banned and people who break the law are liable to fines of up to 250 Under the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1935 sale and importation for sale of contraceptives is made a criminal offense Customs officials intercept and seize consignments from Britain in the mail whenever they can be identified The Pill Is Available For many years the prohibition was justified on the grounds that it was not actually illegal to use contraceptives provided they fell from heaven or you could manufacture them yourself but during the last two years pressure has been building up for a change The only contraceptive available at present is the Pill which can be obtained on a medical prescription as a cycle regulator Twentyfive thousand women are estimated to be using it mainly from the middle and upper classes who can afford private medical treatmentand the cost of the medication At the annual convention of the ruling Fianna Fail party in January this year the Prime Minister John Lynch speaking about the possible reunification of the country made a distinction between private and public morality and said that private morality should not be a subject for legislation His speech was widely interpreted as meaning that this and other legislation influenced by the Roman Catholic Church would have to be repealed if Northern Irelands million Protestants were to be assimilated into the state Laws Repeal Sought Later the Foreign Affairs Minister Dr Patrick J Hillery endorsed Mr Lynchs statement but made it plain that the laws should be changed to respect the wishes of the minority in the republic as it exists at present irrespective of any reunification A private members bill to end the ban on the import and sale of contraceptives was introduced in the Senate by Senator Mary Robinson a young law lecturer but late last month members refused to give it a first reading The majority leader Senator Thomas Mullin advised the 60member house to await the Governments decision on the issue He said that the Government would not be pushed into action by any pressure group Presbyterian and Episcopalian church leaders have supported the move to repeal the ban and Irish doctors polled by a medical newspaper have voted overwhelmingly in favor of change So has the nascent Irish Womens Liberation Movement The Roman Catholic hierarchy however has come out strongly against the proposals Linking the move on contraception to questions such as divorce and abortion it issued a statement saying that it shared the widespread disquiet in the country about proposed changes and urged people to reject them There is speculation that a combination of eccliasiastical opposition and grassroots disquiet about the proposed measure is forcing the Government to adopt delaying tactics Some ministers on the other hand are conscious of the fact that failure to change the law will reinforce Protestant opposition in Ulster to the idea of a united Ireland Balancing this is their fear that a political confrontation with Catholic Church leaders could be damaging in an election Sooner or later a decision will have to be taken In the meantime two small familyplanning clinics continue their attempts to provide advice on contraception hampered both by the existing legislation and the attitude of the customs officials For those in the forefront of the move to change the law it looks like a long battle The one on divorce will presumably be even longer
The Court: Justices Are Losing Their Cool,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/11/archives/justices-are-losing-their-cool-the-court.html,WASHINGTON  Since the Court this term has already downgraded citizens receiving public welfare and citizens having the misfortune to be illegitimate I suppose todays decision downgrading citizens born outside the United States should have been expected Law This opening shot by Justice William J Brennan Jr in a dissenting opinion last Monday said much about the mood of the Supreme Court as it reached the Easter recess It also implied much about what can be expected from the Court in the final three months of its 197071 term For the better part of the term that began in October Justice Brennan and his colleagues had maintained the tone of gentlemanly contention that usually marks disagreements within the Supreme Court But last week when the Court ruled 5 to 4 that some foreignborn citizens can lose their citizenship unless they live in the United States for five years before they reach the age of 28 the usually affable Mr Brennan made no effort to hide his bitterness Only four years ago the Warren Court had declared that Americans couldnt lose their citizenship unless they renounced it The Warren Court had also broadened the rights of welfare clients and illegitimate children and Justice Brennans undisguised chagrin at seeing those rights narrowed so soon served to underscore the testiness that has marked the Supreme Court in recent weeks The tendency first became notable the week before last when Justice Hugo L Black and Chief Justice Warren E Burger dissented from a decision which overturned a burglary conviction because the officer who issued a radio alert for the arrest of the suspect did not have enough evidence to make a legal arrest The dissenters called this ruling a wholly indefensible miscarriage of justice that could make many good people believe our Court actually enjoys frustrating justice by turning professional criminals loose to prey upon society with impunity On the same day Justice Brennan remarked acidly that the Courts change of direction on illegitimates reflected a moral prejudice and that it cannot even pretend to be a principled decision Some of the barbs have been personal Justice Brennan has needled Justice Black an avowed constitutional literalist for decisionmaking resting on personal predilections Justice William 0 Douglas has accused the Courts strict constructionists of loose construction And Justice Black sitting within armsreach of the thricedivorced Justice Douglas has departed from the text of his dissent in a divorcefee case to declare that what God bath joined together let no man  or government put asunder The increasingly vinegary statements by justices who were mainstays of the Warren Courts liberal wing have served to underscore their frustrations during this term In October the Burger Court began its first term with a full bench of nine justices and already it has declined to follow the liberal rulings of the Warren Court mentioned by Justice Brennan plus other Warren Court doctrines on double jeopardy police interrogation longshoremens injury claims and witnesses immunity In addition roughly 50 more cases have been decided but the opinions have not yet been written and announced They concern such important matters as capital punishment abortion school desegregation obscenity reapportionment and criminal suspects rights and Mr Brennans current sour mood suggests that what is to come does not gladden a liberals heart It now appears that the Court is changing direction faster than had generally been expected An important reason has been that President Nixons two strict constructionist nominees Mr Burger and his lifelong friend Harry A Blackmun have stood together to a remarkable extent Earlier in the term the Republicans from Minneapolis and St Paul were jokingly dubbed the Minnesota Twins but now for liberals that term is not so funny Of the 64 appeals that have been heard and decided this term Mr Blackmun has differed with the Chief Justice only three times Their conservative solidarityin sharp contrast with the predominantly liberal inclinations of the men whom they replaced Earl Warren and Abe Fortashas quickly changed the complexion of the court When they line up with the three justices who most frequently disagreed with the Warren majority  John M Harlan Potter Stewart and Byron R White they can back the Court away from precedents that were set only a few years ago This seems to underlie some of the testiness among the justices When the Warren Court moved decisively in the early 1960s to take the Court on a new path Earl Warren had been Chief Justice for almost a decade and neither he nor any of the other justices had been appointed for the express purpose of changing the Courts decisions Moreover the precedents that were being modified or abandoned were mostly old ones that had not been issued by justices then on the Court The current situation is more reminiscent of the incident that took place after the Civil War when the sevenmember court overturned President Grants legal tender law 4 to 3 That same day he filled two vacancies and the newly packed Court caused a public uproar by upholding the laws 5 to 4 Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes later said that this abrupt turnabout shocked popular respect for the Court Of the three Warren Court rulings that Justice Brennan lamented last Monday as having been downgraded the oldest was issued four years ago raising the possibility that Mr Nixons strategy may be working too rapidly for the Supreme Courts own good

YOUTHS COUNSEL TROUBLED PEERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/11/archives/youths-counsel-troubled-peers-private-group-in-new-haven-reaches.html,NEW HAVEN April 10  For the last 19 months an organization called Number Nine  which took its name from the Beatles song Revolution Number Nine  has been serving as a friend and big brother to young people here Hundreds in their teens and early 20s have telephoned for help  a friend is out of control on drugs a girl wants to know how to get an abortion someone thinks he may have venereal disease Countless others have just wandered in from the street looking for someone to talk with or a place to sleep and a meal The organization which is run by young people who in long hair beards and jeans are difficult to distinguish from their clients has been praised by commnuity leaders and awarded some cash grants Building Hazardous But activities were sharply curtailed recently when the city building inspector declared that the threestory former warehouse that serves as Number Nines headquarters was in hazardous condition Necessary improvements putting the sprinkler system in working order and constructing two fire exits  is expected to cost 10000 Some members of the staff of 20 and several volunteers have started working on the fire exits and while they are at it repainting the drab warehouse walls in startlingly bright combinations But most have turned to fund raising So far they have collected 3000 nearly a third of it by panhandling on downtown streets The rest has come in the mail from people who have heard of Number Nines plight Aid Is Not Abundant Appeals to city and state officials and to several private foundations have yielded nothing Some local service clubs have offered to help but none has yet provided any money Our morale level is very low said Ted Clark who is 27 years old and one of the founders of Number Nine You hear so many people talking about the need for programs for kids that kids need to be given more responsibility he told a visitor in his cluttered office Here we have a program that is effective by almost any criteria that is staffed entirely by young people that works closely with existing agencies and we cant raise enough money to survive Thats demoralizing Started in 1969 Mr Clark along with Dennis Jaffe 24 and Yvonne Durchfort 25 who is now Mrs Jaffe started Number Nine in the fall of 1969 They were fascinated by the young counter culture they saw developing in their midst Mr Clark said and were convinced that the problems they also saw were neither being identified nor remedied by established agencies To get started they borrowed a store front and an apartment from two community groups and managed to get a set of four telephones without putting up a deposit Their first contribution 100 from the Democratic town chairman of New Haven paid for the installation of phones Dozens of local high school and college students jumped at the opportunity to do volunteer work at Number Nine and since the beginning New Haven foundations and the state have provided nearly 90000 in grants none of which can be used for building repairs The organization has renovated two condemned houses and is negotiating to buy the headquarters which it now rents for 4400 a year It has also bought an old bus Pay Is 20 a Week Eventually Number Nine began to develop a paid staff At first the salary was 15 a week plus room and board Later the pay was raised to the present 20 a week The founders set up an aroundtheclock telephone operation immediately primarily to find out exactly what the problems were and who had them Many callers it turned out just wanted to talk Those who seemed deeply troubled were invited to headquarters for lengthy counseling sessions Sometimes after staffers had won the confidence of a youth they would urge him to bring his parents along and eventually family counseling sessions were begun Nearly a dozen psychiatrists and psychologists have volunteered as consultants but no one on the Number Nine staff is fully qualified as either So Number Nine guides its most serious cases to established agencies At the heart of Number Nine is a concept of counseling by peers in which a young persons is encouraged to talk out his troubles and express his feelings The theory at Number Nine is that moralizing about drugs is an unproductive venture and so staff members neither discourage nor encourage it directly But they say drug use is closely tied to other problems and that as they attend to the problem that the client presents us he tends to decrease his use of dangerous drugs
Unwed Mother's Key Decision: To Give Up or Keep Her Child,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/11/archives/unwed-mothers-key-decision-to-give-up-or-keep-her-child.html,Should I keep the baby or put it up for adoption That is the fundamental  and often agonizing  question that confronts unmarried women who have decided against abortion and are about to become mothers At Lenox Hill Hospital a group of motherstobe was discussing the question and the case of a 10monthold girl adopted by Mr and Mrs Nicholas DaMartino who has been ordered returned to her natural mother There were 15 of us at the home [for unwed pregnant girls] when the DeMartino case came up said Beth and not one agreed with the natural mother Beth  that Is not her real name  has made her decision The 19yearold Long Island girl will give her baby up for adoption The DeMartino case of which she spoke involves Miss Olga Scarpetta of Colombia who changed her mind after she had signed a baby over to an adoption agency On Wednesday the Court of Appeals the states highest tribunal upheld a lower court decision that the child known as Baby Lenore be returned to Miss Scarpetta The next day the DeMartinos filed suit in Federal Court for a reversal of the ruling What kills me about the whole thing Beth said is that when she gave up the baby she thought It was the right thing to do Then she wants it back I dont think shes emotionally fit to be mother She may want to give it up again Primacy Questioned The agency in the case the SpenceChapin Adoption Service questioned whether the law was not placing too high a premium on the primacy of the mother A change of heart can be disastrous especially for the child Its terrible Beth said A 3yearold really knows his parents In yet another case last month a state court awarded 3yearold boy to his adoptive parents I feel that what Im doing now is the best thing said Sue and I hope that in 3 years 10 years or 20 years Ill feel the same Sue who is from New Jersey has arranged to have her baby adopted through SpenceChapin Im 18 years old and I have my life to live she went on And its not fair if you cant give the baby security A baby cant live on love Pregnant girls are helped to face and examine all the considerations involved in making a decision on adoption during group counseling sessions at Lenox Hill Hospitals department of obstetrics and gynecollogy We work with them to get them to come to terms with the situation said Dr Nini Vas Dias who guides the sessions in a conference room on the hospitals obstetrical floor It can be a very emotional issue It isnt only that they can change their minds but they wait until the last minute to make up their minds she said The 10week course is offered without charge by the hospital as part of its community service program Demand for Babies For many the decision to give up the baby is made easier by the fact that they know there is a demand for babies They know too that placement by an adoption agency is a painstaking procedure and that in all likelihood the child will be placed in an emotionally stable financially secure home with loving adoptive parents There is less demand for nonwhite babies More often they go to foster homes where payment is made for their care Dorothy a 19yearold New Yorker is tall and goodlooking and wears a high Afro hairstyle She has a baby boy in a foster home Her new baby too will probably go to a foster home The process of birth is explained during the sessions and a film on delivery is shown Dorothy recalling the first time she delivered voiced a different view It was beautiful she said I saw the babys head and then the doctor knocked me out I was so mad I wanted to see all of it This is something I can do that a man cant Beth disagreed Im not keeping It so why should I go through this beautiful bit she said Adoption agencies also work with girls to be sure they understand the finality of their decision A staff member of SpenceChapin said that the agency considered the surrender form a binding document and one that should be upheld by the courts She went on to explain If a fair amount of work has been done with the mother including psychological help so that she can understand what she is doing we tell her when she signs the surrender form that there is no going back on it no waiting period no revocation and that this is the final decision and the end of her contact with the child But there are misgivings even among those girls who have unequivocally made up their minds to give up the baby Beth for example wondered Would they change the name tag on the bassinet in the nursery do you think So I wouldnt know which one was mine
MEDICAID CUT HITS AT CITY HOSPITALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/11/archives/medicaid-cut-hits-at-city-hospitals-officials-see-state-action.html,City officials estimated yesterday that the 18 municipal hospitals already up against a deficit face 15million to 35million of extra annual costs by having to take over poor patients eliminated from Medicaid benefits by new state legislation In another area affected by economy cuts Human Resources Administrator Jule M Sugarman said the city had only 31000 summer jobs scheduled so far by the United States Labor Department through the Neighborhood Youth Corps compared with 41000 last summer Mr Sugarman looked to help from President Nixons new request to Congress for more such youth jobs But he said state legislative cuts were eliminating 650 youth cleanup jobs here this summer as well as other city youth jobs while also cutting concert dance and other recreation programs and were likely to leave 15000 young people entirely idle Changes in Medicaid The Legislatures Medicaid changes effective May 15 mean that 25000 New York City families with 75000 people now enrolled will be cut off entirely from the Medicaid program Mr Sugarman said This he estimated will be the result of lowering of income ceilings from 5000 a year for a family of four to 4500 An additional 40000 families with 100000 people whose incomes are between welfare levels and the new Medicaid ceilings will be barred from Medicaid coverage for dental care nurses prescriptions eyeglasses rehabilitation services or any other care than hospitals and physicians according to Mr Sugannan With the former enrollees cut off entirely and the others spending themselves down to the welfare level Mr Sugarman estimated that the combination would thrust a burden of at least 35million on the municipal hospitals For the Health and Hospitals Corporation which now runs the municipal hospitals Paul J Kerz acting senior vice president for program analysis budgeting and planning said his preliminary estimate of extra costs was 15million to 20millionsolely for the 25000 families made ineligible by the Medicaid ceiling but then resorting to the city hoipitals Analysis of Hospital Use He said the average person in such a lowincome group spent 32 days in a hospital as a bed patient during a year and 24 days using the hospitals outpatient services The hospital corporation has already been facing a deficit estimated at more than 10million beyond its 6178million scheduled budget for the year ending June 30 The impact of the Medicaid cutbacks may add 2million to 3million to this gap by that date Mr Kerz said The municipal hospitals reported that they had already last week experienced a substantial increase in patients seeking abortions but turned away by voluntary hospitals that feared that they would not be reimbursed The state last Thursday banned the use of Medicaid payments for abortions unless there was danger to the mothers life or acute suffering Youth Corps Jobs Cut On the youth front the city had hoped for 45000 Neighborhood Youth Corps jobs for young people 14 to 21 years old in government and nonprofit agencies at 150 an hour this summer This envisioned a 21million Federal allocation up from 198million last year along with 21million in city funds and 13million in state money Mr Sugarman said the Federal Government had earlier cut this years work program from last summers 10 weeks to about eight The state Mr Sugarman said has dropped its state beautification program here this summer Last summer this operated through the Youth Services Agency with state funds of 169000 to hire youths to plant trees paint park furniture and clean vacant lots State actions he reported also cut 400000 from the Police Athletic Leagues summer program limited antidrugabuse programs for youths started this year and compelled the dropping of expansion of drug education into more than 100 schools and youth centers Welfare grant levels are being cut 10 per cent by state action effective May 1 from 231 a month exclusive of rent for a family of four here to 20790 Mr Sugarman said He estimated that 300000 welfare families with 700000 children would have their present 1 a day for food for each person cut to 90 cents and their 92 cents for other needs cut to S3 cents The State Board of Social Welfare last week protested this cut and called for a 72 per cent costofliving increase
Foreign Notes,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/11/archives/foreign-notes.html,A woman is France who undergoes an abortion or even makes the attempt is liable to six months to two years in prison Despite the heavy penalty it is estimated that from 250000 to perhaps a million abortions are performed in France each year In addition welltodo women can go to Britain or Switzerland for legal abortions thereby avoiding the dangers of illicit operations that kill several hundred women a year in France We Demand To remedy this situation at least partially the Ordre des Medecins equivalent to the American Medical Association has reluctantly approved a bill now before the National Assembly to authorize abortions where there is danger to the mothers life or health or when there is danger of malformation or in cases of rape or incest The French Catholic church has denounced the bill as legalizing murder Last week in the magazine Nouvel Observateur many of Frances most prominent women lent their support to the bill in a novel fashion A total of 343 women including the writers Simone de Beauvoir Franoise Sagan and Marguerite Duras and the actresses Jeanne Moreau Catherine Deneuve Marina Vlady and Micheline Presle signed a statement saying A million women undergo abortion each year in France They do it under dangerous conditions    Silence is kept about these millions of women I declare that I am one of them    Just as we demand free access to anticonceptional methods we demand freedom of abortion Famine For the last nine good years in East Africa the short rains that renew the pastures have come on schedule in October and November But last fall the rains failed and for almost 10 months now there has been no rain As a result ponds and small wells have dried up Grass has

Complicating the problem is the spread of cholera At least 30 people have died of cholera in the droughtstricken regions of Kenya The disease which is waterborne spreads when both humans and animals are forced to share the same polluted and dwindling water supplies Adding to the areas plight is the fact that the long rains usually due in March have so far made an unsatisfactory start The result is that skeletons of dead domestic cattle litter the roads wild animals are in desperate plight and village children with swollen bellies and emaciated limbs gather for soup kitchen relief As one priest said There is no water at all here The Government brings water in three tanker trucks but it is salty The hyenas dont even eat all the dead cattle They have had more than they can eat Roman

City Sues State Over Order That Limits Abortion Payments,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/13/archives/city-sues-state-over-order-that-limits-abortion-payments.html,New York City sued yesterday to invalidate a state order that limits Medicaid payments for abortions for poor women to medically indicated cases Supreme Court Justice Sidney H Asch ordered the state to appear at a showcause hearing at 930 AM tomorrow at 60 Centre Street The city contended an administrative letter by George K Wyman state Commissioner of Social Services last Thursday violated both state and Federal constitutions and laws An affidavit by Dr Joseph T English president of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation which joined in the suit said 10008 of 23530 abortions performed in municipal hosptials since July 1 involved women eligible for Medicaid During the same time Dr English said 6160 of the 28000 abortions in voluntary hospitals which are nonprofit private intitutions city involved Medicaid eligibles The court papers thus disclosed the first data on the use of the new abortion program by lowincome women Donovan Report Noted In Albany the State Department of Social Services said there had been 1850 abortions upstate under the Medicaid program from last July 1 to Feb 1 Commissioner Wymans administrative letter had followed a report by Senator James H Donovan Republican of Chadwicks that Governor Rockefeller had promised the state would temporarily suspend Medicaid payments for abortions while the Legislature has an opportunity to consider a permanent ban The Medicaid program uses Federal state and local funds to pay certain bills for socalled medically indigent peoplefor example families of four whose annual incomes have been under 5000 The Legislature has cut this eligibility starting 15 to 4500 State Rules Are Cited Senator Donovan had reported that in a dialogue with the Governor during the legislative efforts to cut the state budget he had argued to Mr Rockefeller that the Legislature never explicitly approved use of public money for destroying V 3 unborn However Commissioner Wymans letter to local commissioners of social services contended it was only a clarification of existing policies The State Commissioner cited the state Social Services Law and rules of the state Board of Social Welfare as holding that Medicaid funds could pay only for medical services necessary to prevent diagnose correct or cure conditions in the person that cause acute suffering enanger lite result in illness or infirmity interfere with his capacity for normal activity or threaten some significant handicap The state letter said the clarification would also change misleading captions on Medicaid fee schedules that have referred to elective induced abortions as reimbursable without having stressed the medical necessity Nevertheless the state department said yesterday if a doctor indicates that the abortion is a medical necessity we accept and we would not question his diagnosis in this case any more than we would do in other medical conditions Substance of Citys Suit The city suit was filed for Corporation Counsel J Lee Rankin by Assistant Corporation Counsel James Nespole It held the state proposal to limit the program violated legislative policy that amended the state Penal Law last year to allow abortions by consent of a woman within 24 weeks from the start of her pregnancy The city suit said the states refusal to continue to provide reimbursement for all abortions violated the Federal Medicaid law by reducing services without prior approval of the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare It also held the Federal law required a state Medicaid plan to cover all inpatient hospital and physician services The city further charged the state with violation of the Federal and state constitutions by allegedly depriving poor women of due process and equal protection without any compelling state interest In his affidavit Dr English said voluntary hospitals were already refusing Medicaid abortion patients throwing a burden on municipal hospitals which they could not bear Accordingly he predicted unwanted children would be born and become welfare cases for the next 18 years  or poor people would turn to unsafe and illegal abortion sources
Excerpts From Studies of Priesthood,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/15/archives/excerpts-from-studies-of-priesthood.html,Sociological Study There is no evidence in our research that Catholic priests are any more or less deficient in emotional maturity than other groups in American society Priests maintain a high degree of personal morale higher in fact than collegeeducated males in the same age categories Priests work moderately long hours evaluate themselves quite favorably in comparison with other professionals enjoy an adequate though not spectacular level of job satisfaction are inclined to pursue a good deal of professional reading and are committed to the need for more professional training A large majority of the clergy say that if they had the choice to make again they would enter the priesthood On the other hand there are serious problems facing the priesthood Large numbers of priests are dissatisfied with the way the ecclesiastical structure is shaped and the way decisionmaking power is distributed but the leadership of the church does not share this dissatisfaction Furthermore it would appear that differences between younger and older priests on the distribution of power and authority are rooted in ideological differences about the nature of the church and religion There are systematic and substantial differences between bishops and priests on almost every matter we Studied In most cases the bishops hold different points of view and positions than even the priests in their own age group Given the disagreements over power and over appropriate reforms in the church these systematic differences of conviction indicate a serious and potentially dangerous gap between the priests and the hierarchy number of summary comments may also be made about the resignees There is no evidence that the resignees regret their decision or are unhappy in their present state On the contrary there is considerable evidence that they are in a state of emotional euphoria characterized by what Karen Horsey has described as a binge of health  a binge that is underOandable and probably inevitable in their circumstances About twofifths of the resignees still consider themselves to be Catholics and part of the official church another twofifths are on the margins of the church and the remaining onefifth arc no longer affiliated with the church Apparently these proportions exist at the time of resignation and do not change much over time Thus one can tentatively conclude that the faith problem is overriding only in about onefifth of the resignations  though there may be faith confusion among many of those on the margins of the official church To attempt one final summary of our findings we have discovered no evidence that the Catholic priesthood is in a state of collapse or even near collapse There are many strong and positive forces at work in the priesthood and it would be an unwise man who would conclude on the basis of our data that it will disappear On the other hand the priesthood has certain very serious problems most of them centering around the highly volatile subjects of power and sex which indicate trouble and conflict in the years ahead Psychological Study The intensive depth interviews which were conducted with a crosssectional sample of American priests reveal them as neither sick nor mysterious They are instead ordinary men who reflect through their own personal experiences situational challenges and professional problems the common difficulties of the American male population from which they largely come RELIGIOUS FAITH Many priests experience difficulty in defining and discussing the nature of their religious commitment and the underlying philosophy or theology by which they lead their lives This incompletely developed faith seems related to incomplete personal development and a formation in and life by a religion that stresses the extrinsic aspects of belief AUTHORITY Surprisingly authority despite the widespread publicity about it as a problem within the priesthood did not emerge as a problem quite in the way that the popular impression would have suggested In depth interviews few priests complained about authority as their most serious problem Authority is more of a problem it would seem because of the unresolved and ambivalent attitudes toward it among priests This may be partly a function of the manner in which authority is exercised but it is also related to the fact that many of these men have not worked through their own attitudes toward authority Frequently priests do not take the dictates or attitudes of authority very seriously many of them devise means to get around rather than come into direct confrontation with authority CELIBACY There is no doubt that celibacy is a wellrealized value in the lives of some priests It does however demand a level of personal integration and dedication that is relatively rare For most priests and certainly for the underdeveloped celibacy remains an ideal which is neither vital nor dynamic There is little breach of the regulations of celibacy American priests are neither impulsive nor uncontrolled Celibacy as a personally developing and freeing condition of life just does not exist in the ideal manner in which it is described American priests as a group are not eagerly waiting to get married nor do they believe that optional celibacy will solve their problems Instead they seem to favor the option of marriage because of the freedom which is involved in the issue Many would not in fact immediately marry if the eccesiastical regulation were modified SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS The heart of the psychological recommendations centers on the question of whether those with responsibility for the priesthood wish to assist American priests to achieve greater maturity and therefore greater effectiveness in their work This is so because the chief problem described by this study is one of incomplete growth in the lives of many priests They are not sick they are not fully grown It is suggested that an increase of practical freedom as well as an increase of personal accountability for their work of ministry are essential elements in dealing with this problem American priests need a more genuine experience of freedom in all those areas of life which are recognized as significant to the process of personal development These include freedom concerning celibacy selfsupport place of residence lifestyle and mode of Gospel service What seems most important is not one or the other of these issues but the reality of the practical freedom which the priests would experience with enlarged choices in these areas It is also suggested that much greater accountability for the professional work of the priest is needed as a test and expression of their mature exercise of freedom
A Backward Step on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/15/archives/a-backward-step-on-abortion.html,The vehement emotion that marked last years battle in the State Legislature over abortion reform will be rekindled by the call of New Yorks Roman Catholic bishops for reversal of the decision made then to remove most of the archaic obstacles to legalized abortion Governor Rockefeller has sought to take the edge off the impending conflict by announcing in advance that he will veto any bill repealing the 1970 liberalization Desirable as this assurance is its credibility is seriously weakened by the Governors decisionin exchange for votes needed to pass his budgetto suspend Medicaid payments for abortion an action that could result in more unwanted children being born into the homes of the poor A report by the Health Services Administration on New York Citys record in the first eight months of legal abortions here is at once encouraging and disturbing It shows gratifyingly that there was only an infinitesimally small maternal death rate in connection with the pregnancies terminateda mortality far less than if these women had sought the help of illegal abortionists who flourished here before last July 1 The sincere concern of many opponents of legalized abortion that the state is in effect authorizing murder in killing the fetus must be weighed against the reality that large numbers of women wouldin the absence of the present lawhave risked death in the abortion mills But the total of almost 100000 abortionsmore than half of them involving women from outside New York Stateunderscores the need for much greater accent on family planning and birth control Expanded governmental programs in these fields are essential especially for those with least access to private sources of education and help The poor who most need freedom to avoid having unwanted children must not be denied essential help either because of lack of information or lack of funds For the Rockefeller administrations incomprehensible action in suspending Medicaid payments for abortions the state will pay a high price in blighted lives social distress and higher welfare costs The suit by New York City to invalidate Albanys callous move offers the best hope now for reversing a disastrous and expensive mistake
Most U.S. Priests Found To Oppose Birth Curb Ban,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/15/archives/most-u-s-priests-found-to-oppose-birth-curb-ban-most-priests-found.html,Two studies sponsored by the American bishops of the Roman Catholic Church have found that a majority of the countrys priests reject the churchs teaching against artificial birth control and believe that priests should be free to marry They also found however that despite recent unrest in the church priests maintain high degree of personal morale and that only one priest in five would be likely to marry if given the choice Excerpts from the summaries of two studies Page 31 The reports which together constitute the most comprehen sive survey of the priesthood in any country will be formally presented to the bishops at their spring meeting in DeItroit April 27 through 29 Summaries and selected statistical tables were mailed out to the bishops in the last few days A copy was made available to The New York Times The first studyfrom the sociological perspective  was conducted by the National Opinion Research Center a research organization affiliated with the University of Chicago It was based on questionnaires and some telephone interviews with 6000 priests former priests and bishops The secondfrom the psychological perspective  drew on indepth interviews with 271 priests It was conducted by the department of psychology of Loyola University in Chicago The findings brought into question a number of widespread assumptions about the priesthood and included the following Conflicts with bishops and other authorities are seen as a greater source of frustration to priests than restrictions against marriage Five per cent of diocesan priests resigned between 1966 and 1969 and three per cent said that they were likely to leave These figures the first authoritative ones to be released on the number of Americans leaving the priesthood are lower than many previous estimates Most priests who have left are quite satisfied with their decision and contrary to the statements of some priests groups only two out of five are interested in returning A Budget of 500000 A large proportion of priests are shown by psychological testing to be underdeveloped persons who do not make full use of the freedom they have The two studies are part of a sevenpart report on the priesthood that was initiated by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in the spring of 1967 It was intended as an aid to church reform following the Second Vatican Council but Was also seen by some as a way of responding to the issue of celibacy which at the time was emerging as a major source of controversy The study which has en overall budget of about 500000 was supervised by an ad hoc committee of 14 bishops and priests headed by John Cardinal Kral of Philadelphia In addition to the sociological and psychological studies reports are being drawn up on the history theology spirituality Scriptural basis and pastoral problems of the priesthood The sociological study which was headed by the Rev Andrew Greeley a University of Chicago sociologist drew on questionnaires from 5000 active priests 800 priests who had left the ministry and 250 bishops The active priests in the sample were roughly 10 per cent of total of such priests for the country and officials reported an 80 per cent response rate among them A major finding was the existence of drastic differences of opinion between priests and bishops on sexual morality The survey reported for instance that the churchs position on birth control does not command majority support among the priests Stand on Divorce Shifting Moreover the study found that support for the official position has deteriorated considerably since Pope Paul VIs 1967 encyclical Humanac Vitae which reaffirmed the traditional ban on artificial contraception Twentyseven per cent of the priests surveyed said that they had become more liberal since the papal proclamation Only 3 per cent indicated that they had become more conservative According to the document support is also waning among priests for the churchs teaching against divorce but there is little evidence of a change in position on either premarital sex or abortion On the issue of celibacy the study found that more than half the priests are at least somewhat in favor of a change in church policy while bishops remain strongly opposed to the idea Among priests between the ages of 26 and 35 the number favoring optional celibacy was 84 per cent In addition the study found that three out of every five priestsand a majority of all priests 55 or underexpect the church to change its policy on celibacy and threequarters of them expect this to occur within 10 years The survey also discovered however that the overwhelming majority of priests see [celibacy] as an advantage in their work and that only one priest in five would marry if given the choice Even among priests under 35 years of age the number who said they would certainly or probably marry if given the option was only 33 per cent The researchers explained the apparent contradiction by stating Apparently many of those who support a change do so because they are not convinced that celibacy is essential to the priesthood and because they think that celibacy can be harmful for some priests and is keeping many men out of the priesthood Acceptance of Values In general the sociologists found that there was a fundamental acceptance by priestsi of the basic religious values of the church that most priests enjoyed an adequate level of lob satisfaction and that al large majority would become priests if they had to make the choice again Evaluation of the responses of both active and resigned priests indicated that loneliness was the most important cause of leaving to marry but that a widespread sense of powerless ness and frustration in dealing with authorities was the most pervasive problem among those who remained In all age categories of active priests the most common complaint was the way authority is exercised in the church Even among those who had left the active priesthood only 15 per cent chose a change in the celibacy requirement when asked to make a single recommendation for church reform The problem of frustration was described as especially serious among associate pastors whose job satisfaction was reported to be even lower than that of unskilled manual workers The researchers reported that 5 per cent of diocesan priests resigned in the four years from 1966 to 1969 and that 3 per cent said that they would either certainly or probably leave the priesthood The main reason they found was the desire to marry They said that the dropout rate may not be high in comparison with other professions but that It is certainly high compared to impressions about what the rate was in the past They also found considerable decline in enthusiasm for vocational recruiting among priests and said that this could be far more serious than the resignation rate The sociologists said that resignees had apparently been moderately successful in their new occupations and that about onethird now made more than 12000 a year Fundamental Differences The study concluded that although bishops were somewhat more liberal than priests regarding ecumenism and social action their conservatism on matters of doctrine church government and sexual morality had contributed to a dan gerous gap between themselves and priests The sociologists warned that this gap was not merely a disagreement between those who have power and those who do not but also a sign of fundamental ideological differences about the nature of the church and religion The result they said is considerable potential for serious conflict The report did not contain policy recommendations but observed that the church faced two distinct problemsloneliness and conflict over centralized authorityand that no single solution including presumably a change in the celibacy requirement Would effectively meet both problerns The Loyola study was directed at a subsample of 271 priests from the National Opinion Research Centers sample and made use of twohour depth interviews by professional psychologists and standardized written tests The study was headed by the Rev Eugene C Kennedy a professor of psychology at Loyola The project director was Victor J Heckler a research associate in psychology at the same institution The most general finding of the researchers was that American priests were neither sick nor supermen but psychologically quite typical of the American male peculation as a whole They added however that both society and the church placed high expectations on priests such as the celibacy requitement and that many of their conflicts and challenges arise precisely because they are ordinary men who may have to live as though they were not ordinary at all The psychologists divided their subjects into categories reflecting the cadent of their personal growth and found that twothirds could generally be described as under1 developed A large proportion of priests in this crosssectional sample as in any crosssectional sample of American men have not developed to full maturity they declared The researchers said that the marks of underdeveloped priests included passivity selfdoubt uneasiness about intimate relations with other persons and a tendency to identify themselves through the role of the priesthood rather than through their own personalities The Real Issue While emphasizing that such tendencies are not limited to priests the psychologists suggested that isolation and protection from normal socially developmental experiences often contributed to the incomplete personal growth of priests The Loyola study confirmed the conclusion of the opinion research centers report that a majority of priests favored optional celibacy but that most would not marry if given the choice This suggests that the real psychological issue even when it is not identified consciously las such is greater freedom rather than the question of celibacy itself the researchers declared The psychological study agreed with the other one that priests tended to think of themselves as restricted by church authorities but suggested that these restrictions were more apparent than real The remarkable discovery of this study is that authority seems to impinge so little on the daytoday activities of these priests the authors said They suggested that the fundamental problem was thus not so much the way authority was exercised in the church but the fact that many priests with underdeveloped personalities still had an ambivalent and unresolved attitude toward it The researchers suggested that the problem of incomplete growth among many American priests could be largely solved by forcing priests to exercise more judgment and accept more responsibility They recommended greater freedom in such areas as celibacy place of residence lifestyle financial independence and continuing education This should be accompanied they added by increased demand on their professional performance as priests The authors rejected the idea that more freedom for priests could only be accomplished at the expense of the institution Most of them want to do their best they said and they would not flout the laws of God or the church if they were given a wider range of options Indeed they might as a group develop a more mature concept of authority than they now have
Survey Finds Population Growth Is Viewed as a Potential Problem,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/16/archives/survey-finds-population-growth-is-viewed-as-a-potential-problem.html,The Gallup Poll has found that an overwhelming majority of Americans think population growth in the United Staes is a potential problem but not necessarily for the immediate future According to the poll widespread public endorsement of family planning particularly among the young and highly educated suggests that there is considerable support for expansion of family planning and sex education programs Roman Catholics the poll found expressed less concern about population growth in the United States than do Protestants Nevertheless the poll found that differences between Protestants and Catholics were relatively small Polled in January The results were based on a survey of 3189 adults conducted last January by the Gallup Organization Inc Nearly nine out of every 10 of those polled or 87 per cent said the nations population growth was a problem now or would be by the year 2000 But only 41 per cent considered population growth a major issue requiring action right now Eightyone per cent thought that population growth could affect the quality of their lives but only 54 per cent expressed concern about that possibility The survey was part of an extensive testing of public attitudes by the research department of Planned ParenthoodWorld Population whose president Dr Alan F Guttmacher criticized yesterday President Nixons statement earlier this month that abortion as a means of birth control and abortionondemand laws were personally repugnant to him Speaking in Washington at the first public hearing of the Presidents Commission on Population Growth and the American Future Dr Guttmacher said he regretted that the President had made his statement at a time when this subject is at issue before over 20 state legislatures and the Supreme Court Dr Guttmachers statement was not connected with the announcement of the Gallup Polls results The poll found that of the Roman Catholics interviewed 33 per cent regarded United States population growth as a major immediate problem compared to 43 per cent of the Protestants
Is McCloskey The McCarthy of '72?,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/18/archives/is-mccloskey-the-mccarthy-of-72-is-mccloskey-the-mccarthy-of-72.html,ON Feb 10 Congressman Paul N Pete McCloskey Jr a 43 yearold Californian previously known chiefly for his victory over Mrs Shirley Temple Black in a spe cial election in 1967 made a speech at Stanford University It was an un usually biting speech for any mem ber of Congress to have made com ing as it did from a Republican who had been in Washington for only three years it verged on heresy Mc Closkey suggested a national dia logue to discuss the impeachment of President Nixon as a means of changing the Presidents war policy argued that Mr Nixon and Presi dent Johnson had breached the Con stitution through the arrogant use of power and asserted that what we are doing in Laos is as great a crime as those we executed Japa nese and German officials for in World War II Six days later in an interview with Elizabeth Drew on the National Edu cational Television network Mc Closkey developed his ideas remark ing at one point that weve lost the stomach to fight this war on the ground and yet we think its appro priate that we can kill people by pushbutton bombing from 50000 feet Two days after that he delivered an extraordinarily forceful summary of his position on the floor of the House and within a matter of hours he was telling correspondents who suddenly began seeking him out that if the President did not reverse his policy and if no one better qualified came forward he would run against Mr Nixon in the 1972 Republican primaries McCloskey expected to have his feet held to the fire for saying these things he told Mrs Drew that he realized he was probably serving his last term in Congress But he had been strongly influenced during the last two years by Allard K Lowen stein the man who started the dump Johnson movement in 1968 and lost his own Congressional seat in 1970 Like Lowenstein McCloskey believes as he put it in a recent interview that one of the major troubles with the Congress is that everyone is so pre occupied with calculating what will help him get reelected that he has no time to concentrate on doing the job I try not to do that The more conventional members of his party responded swiftly Mc Closkey was dropped as the mod erator of a national conference of Young Republicans he was de nounced by Republican members of the California House delegation and the ultraconservative California Re publican Assembly censured him as an enemy of the American political process and suggested that he find another party If he were to run for reelection tomorrow McCloskey might find it difficult as he has in the past to survive a primary The Republicans in his district which covers nearly all of San Mateo County immediately south of San Francisco tend to be conservative in 1968 McCloskey eked out a primary victory by only 3000 votes over Robert R Barry a forlorn itinerant former Congress man who has turned into a kind of California Harold Stassen since he lost his Westchester County Con gressional seat in 1964 But if he won the primary McCloskey would prob ably do well in the general election He has always appealed to independ ents and Democrats more than to Republicans and there is nothing to suggest that he has lost his grip on them Indeed a poll taken by The Palo Alto Times last month showed If theres no other way to end the Vietnam war but go into the primaries then Ill go into the primaries says GOP Rep Pete McCloskey Well he did beat Shirley Temple Black in 67 that an astonishing 50 per cent of the respondents agreed with his im peachment proposal and that 69 per cent agreed that Congress should cut off all money for the war on Dec 31 1971 ONE of McCloskeys practices as a Congressman has been to hold streetcorner meetings with con stituents about once a month and these meetings have undoubtedly helped him to bring many of his sup porters along with him as his positions have evolved Few Con gressmen hold such meetings and none other so far as I know goes to the trouble to notify by mail every voter in the area where the meeting is to be held The most recent series of meetings was held one Saturday last month It was one of those spring mornings in northern California when every thing looks more vivid than it should like the colors in a Kodachrome slide You could have taken your choice that day of swimming in the Pacific or skiing in the High Sierras but McCloskey  a trim very physical man who carries a pair of tennis shoes with him even when he forgets a clean shirtwas standing in the midst of a knot of 60 or so people outside the Straw Hat Pizza House in South San Francisco It served as well as anything could at this early date as a preview of 1972 There were a couple of beards in the crowd and a couple of black faces a onelegged Vietnam veteran on crutches who had argued with the Congressman at another meeting earlier that morning a lot of house wives including three Chinese Americans and several middleclass middleaged men McCloskey was taking questions on any subject and the first few were routine dealing with Social Security problems taxes unemployment the Middle East He was dressed in a rumpled blue buttondown shirt with no tie or coat between comments he was licking an icecream cone that one of his supporters had handed him Finally someone said Youve been making a lot of controversial statements lately I think thats what politicians are for McCloskey replied We need debate on these questions If you can marshal your arguments better than I can Im ready to change Im ready to listen to you but I Yeah you got guts a short bald man on the fringe of the crowd com mented Whats wrong with guts for a change McCloskey plunged on But this Administration has got into the habits of deception and concealment They dont even tell us what we need to know to judge their policies par ticularly in Southeast Asia Another man who was preserving McCloskeys every word on a tape recorder interrupted You dont listen to anyone when they disagree with you Everyone in the district is against your legalized abortion bill but you still push it Thats not true said McCloskey his always earnest squarejawed countenance made even more serious by his squint against the sun In the Shirley Temple campaign one pub licity picture made his jaw look so granitic that his staff began calling the photograph and occasionally the candidate Mount Rushmore All right how many people here want the Federal Government to finance abortions Lets see the hands Almost every right hand in the crowd went up and the critic un mollified muttered Aw all these people are your friends anyway Then to the heart of the matter What someone else asked was all this talk about running against the President I really have only one great goal McCloskey said and thats what I first went to Congress forto preserve our clean air and water and help keep California the loveliest place in the world But I cant do anything about that or any thing else until we get this war over So if theres no other way to do that but go into the primaries then Ill go into the primaries The problem he added a moment later is that weve got Richard Nixon who still thinks its his sacred duty to see that not one square inch of territory goes Communist Hes still back in the forties and fifties Why doesnt he invade Chile Its got a Marxist Government now This was no conclave of radicals this was South San Francisco middleclass and middlebrow and not very adventurousnot Berkeley But McCloskey speaking in a quiet but resonant voice strangely reminiscent of Ronald Reagans with intensity and a transparent honesty was get ting through to them Perhaps be cause at bottom he is not really very radical either ROBIN SCHMIDT a San Diego advertising man who went to high school with McCloskey and now serves as his administrative assistant describes him as the last great Vic torian In a day of shifting mores he clings to words and concepts like duty honor sacrifice loyal ty It shows in a number of ways His fierce affection for old friends for example transcends problems of geography time and ideology When McCloskey was the star second base man on the Sougi Pasadena High School baseball team the manager was John Rousselot latera key offi cial in the John Birch Society and now a Congressman They are still intimate and Rousselot lightyears ideologically from McCloskey speaks easily of his old friends honesty and devotion to his country There are limits however John D Ehrlich man one of Mr Nixons counselors who was with McCloskey at Stan ford Law School is said to have told the Congressman to shut up re cently a certain coolness has crept into their relationship McCloskey also has a traditional ists view of women He was one of only 15 Representatives who voted against the womens rights amend His administrative assistant describes hint as the last great Victorian He clings to words and concepts like duty honorsacrifice loyalty ment last year which prompted one female friend to comment that his view of  liberated woman is one whos allowed out of bed At a semi nar in Menlo Park last month he conceded that his attitude was grad ually changingbecauseof the holy beating Ive taken from my wife and others Butfor Pete McCloskey ironically enough the ultimate expression of duty and loyalty has always been rep resented by the military Before South Pasadena High he spent several years at Southwestern Military Acad emy where he fell under the spell of Matthew Bradys pictorial history of the Civil War and read endlessly about the exploits of Jeb Stuart and Lee and Stonewall Jackson Years later one of the reasons he chose the Marine Corps was the fact that the training was to be given at Quantico Va close to the battlefields he had always hoped to visit McCloskey went to Korea as a second lieutenant a platoon leader in Charlie Company First Battalion Fifth Regiment First Marine Division His company was the first to push off in the first American counter offensive against the Chinese with Gen Douglas MacArthur standing in the mud to salute it as it headed north He came home a hero with the Navy Cross the second highest decoration after the Medal of Honor for which a marine is eligible the Silver Star and the Purple Heart In retrospect the most impoitant incident of those years came when a Chinese sniper opened fire on the company from a village that ap peared to be deserted McCloskey threw a smoke grenade to mark the place and Navy Corsairs swept in dropping 500 pound bombs and can nisters of napalm firing rockets and strafing When the Marines searched the village they found the Chinese had fled and that the planes had killed 50 or 60 old men women and children There was no blinding light no Saul on the road to Tarsus for McCloskey but the incident lingered in his mind to be called forth later by events in Southeast Asia Charles Daly one of the other pla toon leaders in McCloskeys company and a confidant ever since came to believe in those harsh days that war was inherently evil but McCloskey did not He stayed in the Marine Reserve volunteered for active duty in Vietnam a decade later and when turned down signed on as an Agency For Pete McCloskey the ultimate ex pression of duty and loyalty has always been represented by the military for International Development pro vincial representative in the Mekong Delta Only the intercession of his brotherinlaw Charles McClung  who convinced him during a long talk that his eagerness to go was based not on a desire to serve but on a need to test himself against physi cal dangerkept him from spending two years or more in the war zone Some of McCloskeys seemingly ab errant stands on public issues are best explained by his military pre disposition not all of which has been obliterated by his views of the Viet nam war At the time of the capture of the Pueblo for example he issued one of the more jingoistic statements to come out of the House If the North Koreans failed to release the Pueblos crew he said in righteous tones that must have pleased the shade of Wil liam Randolph Hearst and if Presi dent Johnson were to ask for a declaration of war he would vote Yes Dick Tuck the impish Cali fornia Democrat who specializes in tweaking the noses of the opposition claims that he sent McCloskey two bird cages at the timeone for his Vietnam dove and the other for his Korean hawk And one of McClos keys closest friends Lewis Butler now an Assistant Secretary of Health Education and Welfare remarked acidly Well I guess Korea was always Petes war Astonishingly he said much the same thing about Vietnam in a little noticed speech eariler this year If the North Vietnamese held American prisoners after an American with drawal he would be ready to support an invasion to free them When I asked him about these comments McCloskey said there was no inconsistency at all Im a ma rine he explained brusquely and marines dont leave their own behind In the Marine Corps you get court martialed for leaving a mortar But at the same time he has no great respect for the tactical or stra tegic judgment of higher officers in fact although he is now a colonel in the reserves he still tends to take a platoon leaders skeptical view of the brass During his trip to Vietnam in 1968 he formed some of his basic conclusions about the war by seeking out sergeants and lieutenants and lowranking civilians especially in I Corps where many of his old marine buddies were serving and ignoring the revealed wisdom of Saigon Again in the midst of a discussion of EastWest tensions the other day he suddenly remarked My trouble is that I dont trust Russian generals any more than I trust American gen erals It is not surprising then that McCloskey remains a fervent advo cate of the draft In recent testimony before the House Armed Services Committee he astonished the hawk ish majority by arguing against a sudden abandonment of the principle that a young man should serve his country for a short time during his youth The potential combat soldier he said should be running 20 miles a day climbing a 50foot rope per haps five times a day and living a good part of his life either wet cold and miserable or dehydrated hot and miserable  Comfort has no place in a combat infantry unit par ticularly during training in peacetime This being so what reasonable young man is going to give up a life of drinking beer with his friends enjoying drivein movies with his girl and sleeping late on weekends If reasonable men will not volunteer for combat infantry duty in peacetime I suspect there is little benefit in seek ing to attract unreasonable men to volunteer There are men who love to kill but it seems to me the nation is far safer when its Army is made up of reluctant citizensoldiers than by men who take pride in being profes sional killers McCLOSKEYS current views of Vietnam began to take shape during the Shirley Temple campaign partly as a result of a long memo drafted by brotherinlaw McClung a rug gedly handsome Los Angeles lawyer whose conventional background law practice and suburban home in San Marino have never extinguished fondness for the heterodox and a gift for analysis McCloskey has followed McClung through skepticism about the practicality of the war into a conviction that it has been tearing the country apart and ultimately to the conclusion that it is immoral Another major factor in McClos keys attitude was his experience as the Ambassador in a massive Marine Corps training exercise Op eration Silver Lance in 1965 For six weeks at Camp Pendleton 25000 marines and 20000 sailors went through a dress rehearsal for Viet namcodenamed Lancelot by the majordomo of the exercise Lieut Gen Victor H Brute Krulak Mc Closkeys role for which he went on active duty was that of the civilian whose goals differed from those of the military men and he played it with gusto frustrating the Marine commander Brig Gen E Hunter Hurst with such ploys as protest ing to the President over the mock deaths of three Peace Corps volunteers When it was over Mc Closkey had learned a good deal about counterinsurgency including the crucial role of the peasant Hurst for his part complained that the fundamental problem with the Ambassador has been a lack of mutual understanding He doesnt understand the military problems His hero is Mr Justice Holmes who has the dual advantage in McClosheys mind of having been both citizensoldier and jurist McCLOSKEY began his first full term as President Nixon was taking office and although he had sup ported Nelson Rockefeller in the pre convention maneuvering he hoped that Nixon would end the war He intended to be a good Republican soldier His estrangement from the President on the war which his friend Daly who worked as a Capitol Hill liaison man in the Kennedy Ad ministration describes as a classic example of incompetence in Con gressional relationscan be seen in a series of five letters McCloskey wrote to Nixon none of which was ever answered directly In March of 1969 he urged the President to admit that Vietnam was a mistake and to begin a policy of withdrawal commenting that the elements of terrain history culture geography and human resources are just not present in a mixture which ever will permit a Saigonbased Gov ernment to control the area called South Vietnam It was a respectful letter in which McCloskey said It is an honor to serve under your leadership and it did not go much beyond the Presidents Vietnamiza tion proposals later that year But by December in his second letter McCloskey was complaining about the Presidents priorities noting that the withdrawal of three di visions accomplishes the same result that you feel Congress should ac complish by cutting back appropria tions for education water pollution and the elderly Social Security re cipient He questioned the depend ence on South Vietnamese progress implicit in Vietnamization urged more rapid withdrawal and com plained about the harsh anti civilian aspects of American counter insurgency Still he commended the President for his efforts in the areas of draft and postal reform minority employment revenue sharing local responsibility antiinflation efforts and the environment Cambodia pushed the young Con gressman over the brink on May 7 1970 he accused the President and Vice President Agnew of bringing this country perilously close to revo lution because it appears to our young people that you do not care about them nor have you been will ing to listen to them The young people he told the President as he appealed for a complete withdrawal by June 30 1971 are the ones asked to fight in a war in which they do not believe against people they do not hate Then on Aug 12 If we are un willing to ourselves die in a cause we should not seek to substitute our impersonal bombs napalm and massive rapidfire aerial gunfire for combat troops If I were a Viet namese Mr President and your fire power killed my mother sister or child you would have my undying enmity and desire for vengeance no matter how sincerely you professed the need to save me from the evils of Communism And on Nov 30 This war might not seem so easy to condone if we ourselves were living less safely and comfortably than in Washington and were instead exposing ourselves to the hardships and choices we ask our 19yearolds to endure As his oppo sition to Nixon stiffened McCloskey became one of the leaders in the House fights to pass the McGovern Hatfield and CooperChurch amend ments and to repeal the Gulf of Ton kin Resolution The success of the fight to repeal the Tonkin Gulf resolution whicn had been cited by the Johnson Ad ministration as its legal justification for waging war increased McClos keys fury at the Laos operation The Irish grin the hooded eyes and the curious shock of unruly hairit stands up in the back exactly like Woody Woodpeckers may make you forget it for a moment but McCloskey is a lawyer before he is anything else His hero is Mr Justice Holmes who has the dual advantage in McCloskeys mind of having been both a citizensoldier and a great jurist His father both of his grand fathers and two of his brothersin law were or are lawyers and he takes the law as seriously as a Nixon takes Communism Once convinced that not enough students understood what the Constitution really meant he wrote a textbook on the subject So when he went to Stanford to speak at the beginning of the Laos invasion he was outraged at what he considered the Presidents unconsti tutional behavior  committing new acts of war without Congressional sanctionand he was propelled as he talked toward a constitutional antidote Political pressure he said was one means cutting off funds another If all else failed he sug gested the final constitutional pro cedure was impeachment The last was the statement not of a politician but of a constitutional lawyer search ing for a means of redress it was but one example of McCloskeys naivet that he was astonished when news accounts focused on that portion of his speech THE law in fact is responsible for his involvement in politics Neither California nor McCloskey is suited to the clubhouse route that leads small time attorneys in Brooklyn and Chi cago to the marble mausoleum on Capitol Hill his was the citizen politics route that has been opened up by the growth of the suburbs and a new set of political concerns After Stanford and Stanford Law School he found bigfirm practice stultifying and opened his own office in Palo Alto McCloskey was willing to defend anyoneand he found him self in court as the advocate of homosexuals caught operating in a railwaystation mens room of citi zens groups opposing utility com panies power lines of conservation ists fighting the fillingin of portions of San Francisco Bay of a man charged with exposing himself in a supermarket parking lot He won the last case in a typical McCloskey tour de force of legal research by demonstrating that Californias in decentexposure laws were the direct descendants of 16thcentury English commonlaw cases stipulating that one must have acted in front of persons his client had exposed himself to a single girl as she walked past his sports car in the parking lot One of McCloskeys more interest ing victories came in the midfifties in a suit against the Pacific Tele phone Company the local branch of American Telephone and Telegraph His clients were the residents of a suburban subdivision called Green Meadows McCloskey whose finan cial situation at the time is suggested by the fact that he was still driving a red ModelA Ford collected 1 each from the several hundred families in the area who wanted their telephone exchange changed The subdivision lies between Palo Alto and Mountain View and part of the problem was prestige More important when the people in Green Meadows dialed the operator and asked for the Fire or Police Department they were auto matically connected to the Mountain View authorities because in terms of the telephone grid they belonged to that community But in terms of po litical geography they belonged to South Palo Alto and the Mountain View firemen and policemen couldnt help them More than one house burned down in the ensuing con fusion and delay McCloskey spent two months read ing through 60 volumes of cases de cided by the California Railroad Commission the predecessor of the Public Utilities Commission which had jurisdiction over the Green Meadows case They were not in dexed but McCloskey finally found the precedent he needed and he won This and similar consumer and environmentoriented cases helped to propel him into politics So did an encounter with President Kennedy in the summer of 1963 In the days after Birmingham Kennedy called a White House conference on civil rights and Daly added McCloskeys name to the list of lawyers who were asked to participate The President spoke for only about 15 minutes appealing to the conferees to go home and as members of the bar take the lead in promoting blackwhite understand ing To many of the older men there the performance may have seemed perfunctory but to McCloskey  a man who had read the debates of the Constitutional Congress as a sixth grader a man who took his illpaying clients cases so seriously that he would move into a motel to study on weekends before appearing in court it was call to duty He told Daly almost at once that he knew he had to get into politics BUT he never became a conven tional politician despite his bravura performance in winning a seemingly hopeless primary against Mrs Black He was a born Republican who in herited his political allegiance along with his illogical nickname Pete from his father But he was also inherently independentthe kind of man as Robin Schmidt recalls who could be part of our highschool gang be the leader reallyand still de cide to read a book when the rest of us went to the beach He refused to support Barry Gold water in 1964 put a bumper sticker for Pierre Salinger on his car in the same year and endorsed Wilson Riles against the archconservative Republi can Max Rafferty in the contest for Superintendent of Public Instruction last year A politician might have fudged the issue but McCloskey has a seeming compulsion to answer every question bluntly In another of his 1970 contretemps he said a few good words for Senator George Murphy another Republican con servative but then felt compelled to say a few about his opponent John V Tunney When a reporter pressed him later asking whether he in tended to campaign for Murphy he answered No and quoted Presi dent Kennedy to the effect that party loyalty sometimes demands too much There is even a story probably accurate that he flipped a coin to decide for whom to vote for President in 1968 HIS friends concede that he does it at least in part because he likes to shock people McClung recalls that when McCloskey decided to get mar ried he approached his fatherinIaw tobe and suggested that permission should be forthcoming promptly be cause his fiance who is called Cubby might be pregnant She wasnt and he knew it but the parental assent came quickly There is also in Pete McCloskey a streak of impetuousness which some times makes it difficult for him to approach problems with the delibera tion of say an Edmund Muskie In his book about the Shirley Temple campaign The Sinking of The Lollipop Rodney G Minott tells about McCloskey as a very young man sitting with some cronies in a restaurant in northern California and suddenly standing up with the com ment that he missed Cubby and wanted to see her With which he got into his car and drove 300 miles to Los Angeles Butler describes this sort of behavior as quixotic Ryland Kelley another old friend who has helped to run both of McCloskeys Congressional cam paigns confesses that he sees in McCloskey something of the hot dog  something of the flair for calling attention to himself that makes a football player fall harder or jump higher or play with a bigger bandage than strictly necessary The truth is that McCloskey a taut selfcontained man navigates by his own special compass If he finds himself part of a 3472 minority on a family medicalpractice bill because a friend has told him that it is unworkable that bothers him not one whit If colleagues in Congress express irritation at his tendency to speak and even help raise funds in their districts without observing the nicety of telling them beforehand that seems to him small potatoes One such colleague who went to considerable pains to arrange for Mc Closkey to be invited to a gathering of San Francisco movers and shakers was flabbergasted when McCloskey failed to appear He called McClos key a few days later and McCloskey said blithely that he had decided to stay with his family instead had meant to call but had completely forgotten about it McCloskeys political evolution has now brought him to the point where he likes very little about Richard Nixon He admits it reluctantly and only after hours of conversation pre ferring to tell you that he voted with Gerald Ford the conservative mi nority leader of the House on 88 per cent of the 1970 roll calls That may be He was with the Administration on a few key issues such as the attempt to override the Presidents veto of the Housing and Urban De velopment appropriation But on the major Vietnam votes the SST the Manpower Training Bill he was in opposition Americans for Democratic Action gave him a rating of 64 for the year higher than that earned by Tunney the new Democratic Senator from California and only 12 points below the rating of such a certified liberal as Representative Morris Udall of Arizona Only 10 Republicans scored higher McCloskeys rating probably would have been higher still had it not been for his often conservative views on fiscal questions He com mented recently that economics is an area where he feels somewhat unsure of himself and therefore tends to vote with his party leaders But indexes of liberalism dont tell as much about the way McClos key feels as he himself finally did one night last month in San Fran cisco over a very long dinner I had asked him at least a hundred ques tions without finding the key Finally I asked him to tell me what kind of President he thought Nixon was wholly apart from the war Now that he said emphasizing the second word as if in rebuke is a good question I WAS impressed by the inaugu ral and I really hoped for candor in the Presidency Several times since then I have thought that I was im pressedby some of the things he said on the environment for example but now I have decided that he is a wholly political man without prin ciple who is willing to do whatever is expedient I thought Wally Hickels letter was the single greatest act of this Administration because it dem onstrated honesty and commitment and a willingness to make this the kind of government people could believe in again Let me give you some examples Nixon sent Lee DuBridge his science adviser up to the Hill to testify against the National Environmental Policy Act Then when it passed he signed it and took the credit That was a classicrhetoric vs perform ance Then there is the whole question of deception and concealment What hes doing in Vietnam is bad enough I think its even worse that every time he reports on the war he is guilty of constant omission of key material facts In a law court thats a crime On the race issue his perform ance on the Voting Rights Act was a scandal It was appalling it was a sellout to the Southern strategy There he was in bed with Jamie Whitten [Congressman from Missis sippi] and all the others McCloskey worries occasionally that he might weaken Nixon enough so that the party would look elsewhereand find Reagan the most palatable alternative On the ABM hes building a singleweapon absolutely inflexible Maginot Line Thats one of the rea sons Nixon is such a damned tragedy hes still fighting the battles of the fifties Hes incapable of admitting error too because his concept of the Presidency is American power not American leadership I cant stand his assault on the Court either What kind of a Presi dent puts up a man like Carswell What kind of a lawyer He lets Bob Dole his national chairman go around denouncing Ramsey Clark for defending the Berrigans Does he think no one should defend them I almost quit the part
 over that And the 1970 campaign Before the election he called a bunch of us in and told us that his polls showed that law and order whatever that means was the biggest issue and campus unrest He urged us to stress that Im not suggesting that you demagogue it he said and then he kind of grinnedsuggesting that we go out and demagogue it all we wanted to I cant go for that That sounds of course like a campaign platform and that is what it is McCloskey has said all along that he didnt think he was qualified to be President that he would need seven or eight more years of season ing on the Hill to get ready But he also said during our interview I know Im not a great man but I look at Nixon and Agnew and I know that I couldnt be that bad He still hopes that someone  a Senator perhaps like Mark O Hat field of Oregon or Charles McC Mathias Jr of Maryland or Charles H Percy of Illinois or maybe Hickel or maybe John Lindsay or John Gardner  will challenge Nixon but he doesnt think they will He and one of his allies in the House Repre sentative Donald W Riegle Jr tried without much luck to persuade Lind say several weeks ago to make Presidential race in the Republican primaries SO he has made the commitment that must precede the commitment he has decided to do the best he can to prepare himself for the possibility that in November he will decide to make the race against Nixon That means at least a small staff to handle the mail and learn the filing dead lines for the primaries among a thousand other details It has meant a trip to Southeast Asia to famil iarize himself with the new situ tion It means money The office will be opened sometime next month and it is probable that at some point Sanford Weiner a highly successful professional campaign consultant from San Francisco who managed McCloskeys campaign against Shir ley Temple Black will begin to take a major role in planning for 1972 Money at least in the relatively small amounts required for this years operations seems within reach Already Norton Simon the California businessman has made a substantial pledge and two of the leaders in Business Executives Move for Vietnam Peace Henry Niles and Harold Willens have indicated that they will help too The money for the Southeast Asian trip was raised in one evening in New York by Daly McCloskey and Jimmy Bres lin the writer The three visited sev eral parties including a dinner given by Howard Stein of Dreyfus Corp a Democratic fundraiser in recent years and asked for checks We got carfare to Vientiane easy says Breslin and theres a lot more there Almost no one knows who McClos key is which is perhaps his greatest defect as a Presidential candidate That will be remedied to a degree by the media attention that he will inevitably get over the next ten months but he has had no chance to build up the almost unconscious im pressions in the public mind that most Presidential candidates begin with Moreover he is erratica man so well organized at times that a former secretary remembers with awe that he never made a correction on a Dictaphone belt a man so vague at others that he once left his brief case standing in the lobby of the Plaza Hotel and took the shuttle back to Washington He will have to learn as Don Riegle says that running for President denies a man the luxury of thinking out loudand the lux ury of total candor In other words he will have to learn to think politi cally at least some of the time The comparison to Eugene Mc Carthy is probably inevitable George Murphy a raffish San Francisco newspaperman who has worked for both as a press aide sees little that is similar in the two mens personali ties commenting that McCloskey always wants to talk about Henry Kissinger and McCarthy is much more interested in Teilhard de Char din A more important difference perhaps is that McCarthy was run ning in Democratic primaries and McCloskey will if he runs be running in Republican primaries Even before the Democrats 1970 reforms theirs was a far more open party far more receptive to insurgency because of the kinds of people who tend to become delegates McCloskey can ex pect to have the support of even fewer of his partys leaders than McCarthy did perhaps a halfdozen Representatives might work openly for him with a dozen or so Repre sentatives Senators and Governors helping him covertly To get anywnere then he will have to appeal over the heads of the leaders to the electorate But will Republican voters accept a candidate who goes around knocking his own partys leaders Al Lowenstein thinks they might if enough of the millions of potential new voters between 18 and 21 register and go to the polls That he thinks could change the character of the Republican elec torate Most political scientists disagree because they think young people will fail to vote heavily and will vote roughly the same way as the rest of the population The White House is ignoring McCloskey for the moment and the political operatives there whisper confidentially that Ronald Reapan is the real threat McCloskey worries occasionally that he might help to promote Reagan by weaken ing Nixon enough so that the party would look elsewhere and find Rea gan the most palatable alternative In 1968 Nelson Rockefeller stood in the basement of the Americana Hotel in Miami Beach and asked in response to a question about why he had lost Have you ever seen a Republican convention At this point the odds are that McCloskey will find many of those same people reassembling somewhere in 1972 to renominate Richard Nixon IT is still a long time until New Hampshire though McCloskey has not yet begun seriously to assay his potential around the country The polls show that the President is un popular now but they will oscillate wildly over the next 12 months if the past is any guide And who can say what will happen to the war as an issue Suppose the President re duces American casualties to the vanishing point as he certainly hopes to do Will McCloskey still be able to put across his central themethat American actions in Indochina are immoral even if the killing is done from airplanes Will he be able to develop other issues There are no real answers to these questions but it would be prudent to remember that the initiative will remain with Nixon McCloskey will have to play the game on a field largely of the Presidents choosing One of the hardest questions to answer is what would happen if McCloskey somehow managed to beat Nixon in two or three separate primaries or even sullied his reputa tion as McCarthy did to Johnsons in New Hampshire three years ago Without attempting entirely amateur onesentence psychoanalysis it seems reasonable to say that the Presidents inandout political career has left him somewhat unsure of himself particularly in terms of his hold on the voters But that is not much help adversity could drive him toward dogged persistence or toward retreat and we really cannot guess which route he would choose For what it is worth one politician who has known him well for 20 years be lieves that he would voluntarily give up the Presidency which he won only after so much anguish and hu miliation only if he were conclusively defeated in a representative series of primaries And that seems un likely Yet there may be currents running in the country that will make all of this somewhat irrelevant Perhaps as we are told the American people even the rather conventional Ameri can people who vote in Republican primariesare ready for a new kind of politician Perhaps McCloskey will be able to convince them that he can help them feel less cut off from their Government It is hard not to con clude that he would be a formidable adversary  largely because he is able whether on television or in person to convince people that he is sincere and that he cares about them Those are not things which Richard Nixon has often been able to do Weiner neatly captures this special quality in McCloskey with the re mark A good press agent would ruin him Nobody had ever heard of Mc Closkey in San Mateo County when he defeated a national institution in an area that Murphy calls a hotbed of social rest Given the party and given McCloskeys obscurity it seems unlikely that he is the Eugene Mc Carthy of 1972 But then it seemed unlikely that Eugene McCarthy was the Eugene McCarthy of 1968 in April of 1967,,
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/18/archives/abortion-and-population.html,To the Editor President Nixons recently expressed opposition to liberal abortion legisla tion discourages me profoundly When he says that abortion should not be used for population control he is in sense telling us that we should not have population control [Editorial April 5] Ruling out abortions would rule out the hopes for a strong program of population limitation and for intelli gent birth control in general World wide from thirty to fifty million abortions the low and high estimates occur yearly Would President Nixon like to see these prevented The effect would be to increase the global baby crop by some 40 to 70 per centan unthinkable horror All coun tries that have demonstrated the ability to stabilize population such as Czechoslovakia and Hungary have made abortions easy to obtain
Wilhelm Reich— The Psychoanalyst as Revolutionary,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/18/archives/wilhelm-reich-the-psychoanalyst-as-revolutionary-wilhelm-reich.html,DURING the student revolts that shook many European univer sities in the spring of 1968 the influence of the errant psycho analyst Wilhelm Reich was much in evidence In Paris Reichian sym bols depicting the human conflicts produced by societal repression of sexuality were crudely painted on the walls of the Sorbonne In Berlin student members of freelivingand loving communes pelted police with softbound copies of Reichs The Mass Psychology of Fascism Reich who died in an American prison in 1957 and who had been expelled from the psychoanalytic movement for his political involvements was being resurrected everywhere in Europe as a herosaint to students demanding social reform Many American young people are now discovering that Reich is very much their kind of revolutionary too Less cerebral than Marcuse the other wellknown exponent of the Freudian left Reich amalgamated Freud and Marx and created a credo that was actionoriented and at once antiin tellectual and antipolitical Where Freud had urged rational sublimation and adaptation and Marx political revolution Reich advocated the dis solution of the patriarchal family and the authority of the father Therein lies his appeal to European youth who feel more constrained by author itarian family structures than by political institutions Reichs appeal to American youth is a bit more manifold For Reich The most famous of which is shown on the book jacket reproduced on this pagean uppointing arrow that splits into two opposing arrows It suggests that when the integrated sexual im pulse meets repression the result is conflict between mind and body as for DH Lawrence and Rousseau an adolescents instincts are basically sound and good and it is only society disguised as the family and as educa tion that corrupts the young person Reich was an outspoken critic of all forms of institutionalized authority and a vociferous advocate of in dividual freedom and selfregulation in sexual behavior and in work His ideas were irresistible to the anti establishment writers and artists of the late nineteenforties a group that included Mailer Ginsberg Bur roughs William Steig and sculptress Jo Jenks and he seems to have equal appeal to the hippie communes of today Reich also has a following among the many students who feel that required examinations and eval uations limit their freedom and diminish their individuality and humanity The rediscovery of Reich in America is also being facilitated by the reissuance here of his books in paperback THROUGHOUT his career Reich worked in three different areas re search psychotherapy and what might be best called social psychol ogy simultaneously While it is true that Reich never lost complete con tact with reality it is also true that his contribution in these areas is often strikingly uneven as far as scientific acceptability goes Reichs early work was generally well regarded His innovations in psycho therapeutic practicenamely his method of character analysishas become an integral part of modern psychotherapeutic technique Moreover Reichs interest in the messages conveyed by the way in which people spoke held themselves and behaved is a direct forerunner of the modern science of kinesics the study of how people communicate through body movements and pos tures Finally Reichs early social psychological writing particularly his Mass Psychology of Fascism broke new ground in the study of the relations of social structure to in dividual character Reich thus fore shadowed the work of modern writers such as Marcuse Fromm and Erikson In contrast much of Reichs later work particularly that dealing with the treatment of cancer is gen erally regarded as scientifically un acceptable Wilhelm Reich was born on March 24 1897 in Dobrzynia a part of Galicia which at that time belonged to the Austrian Empire Soon after his birth the family moved to the equivalent of an American ranch in the Ukrainian section of Austria where Reichs father raised cattle for the German Government Reich and his younger brother Robert the An outspoken critic of all forms of institutionalized authority only Reich children grew up on the ranch and enjoyed the pastoral pleasures of riding and hunting The Reich family was welltodo some what proud and much more identified with German culture than with their Jewish heritage Neither Wilhelm nor his brother was allowed to play with the peasant children or with the Yiddishspeaking children of the ghetto Despite having been thrown together a great deal the brothers did not appear to have been very close and both seemed to have ex perienced loneliness as children Reichs mother was an attractive simpleminded woman who was com pletely dominated and cowed by her dictatorial and jealous husband When Reich was a young adolescent she had an affair with one of the tutors then living with the family It is likely that Reich bore some responsibility for his fathers dis covery of the affair and for his mothers subsequent suicide In her recent biography Reichs third wife Ilse Ollendorff Reich wrote that Reichs part in his mothers suicide might have been one reason why he was never able to successfully finish his own analysis There were certain problems he was never able to face During the First World War Reich was an officer in the Austrian Army and served in the Italian theater He seemed to enjoy military life which probably appealed to his over whelming need for activity and for enterprises that could absorb his extraordinary energy and vitality Reich was one of those people to whom everything comes easily He learned to ride and to ski with the same facility that he learned to play the piano paint sculpture or master difficult academic subjects After the war he made a brief try at law found it dull and switched to medicine He finished the sixyear program in four years and supported himself during the last years of schooling by tutoring other students Among his fellow students was Annie Pink whom he married in 1921 and who later became a wellknown analyst in her own right In 1919 while still a student Reich attended a lecture on psycho analysis and was so intrigued that he quickly decided that he wanted to be a psychiatrist He began to attend whatever psychoanalytic meet ings he could asked searching questions and even challenged some of the more established analysts Such was his vitality enthusiasm and obvious brilliance that he was admitted as a member to the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society and began seeing patients even before he had completed his medical training Al most from the beginning of his as sociation with the society Reich had free access to Freud who regarded him as a young man of considerable promise Freud was to think other wise before the decade was over REICH joined the psychoanalytic movement at the start of an extreme ly tumultuous period in Austrian history Inflation was destroying the savings of most Austrians even Freud was forced to borrow money a loan he quickly repaid and the political crosscurrents were many and disturbing The times and Reichs personality conjoined to make the next decade and a half a period of hectic even chaotic activities and accomplishments All during this period Reich was teaching seeing patients writing and engaging in a variety of political activities In ad dition Reich was also developing a theory regarding the psychosomatic determinants of neuroses Reichs consideration of the psychosomatic factors in the neuroses was stimulated by a case that Freud referred to him in 1920 Reich al ways treasured his collection of small printed calling cards which Freud used when referring patients to other analysts This particular patients symptoms were compulsive rumination compulsive counting anal fantasies and excessive mastur bation Reich snoted whenever the patient reported that he had mas turbated with complete satisfac tion that his symptorris lessened Reich proceeded to analyze the patients guilt over masturbation When this chronic guilt was alle viated and the patient could mas turbate regularly with complete gratification his symptoms subsided to the extent that he could work and socialize to a degree not possible for him before The patient later married and remained well for as many years as Reich kept in touch with him This patient and others like him led Reich to reconsider some of Freuds thinking regarding the origin of the neuroses In his clinical work Freud had early distinguished be tween two types of neuroses One type the psychoneuroses included all those cases in which somatic symptoms such as paralysis frigid ity impotence headaches etc were produced by mental conflicts The other type the actual neuroses in cluded all those cases in which the somatic symptoms mainly anxiety and its consequents such as sweating palpitation cardiac irregularity were produced physiologically rather than psychologically Freud at first thought these actual neuroses were produced by a dam ming up of the libido due to en forced abstinence coitus interruptus and related practices Freud under stood that the undischarged sexual energy was in some way transformed into anxiety Later in The Problem of Anxiety 1926 Freud modified this view and suggested that anxiety was basically a signal of danger from withinfrom ones impulses or from ones consciencemuch as fear is a signal of danger from without Reich however took Freuds orig inal description of the actual neu roses the damming up of the libido or of sexual energy as the underly ing cause of all neuroses In Reidhs view neurotic symptoms as well as character traits were deadend chan nels into which sexual energy came to be diverted as a result of the dam mingup process Therapy Reich con tended had to be directed toward a destruction of the dams against sex uality Once sexual energy could flow freely through its normal healthy channels namely genital or gasm the patient would be free of disturbing symptoms and inhibit ing character traits and could fully realize his potential Reich thus came to regard the fully realized and en joyed sexual orgasm as the sine qua non of individual mental health and argued that this was as true for wo men as it was for men These ideas regarding sexuality were put forth in Reichs book The Function of the Orgasm 1926 It met a rather cool reception among analysts on both theoretical and clini cal grounds On the theoretical side Reich seemed to be contending Freuds view that civilization and social progress were purchased at the expense of holding the instincts in check In Freuds view divergences of sexual energies into socially healthy channels which he called sublimations were essential for civilized society In effect for Freud neurotics were those whose attempts at sublimation railed and whose channeled sexual energies be came self  destructive rath er than socially produc tive A competent surgeons skill could represent a suc cessful sublimation of the ag gressive drive whereas the ulcerative colitis of a chron ically complaining housewife could represent an unsuccess ful handling of the same in stinct For Reich in contrast even sublimations were suspect and only the free and unmitigated gratification of genital sex uality could be truly healthy for the individual or for so ciety So while Reich built his orgasm theory on ideas origi nally put forth by Freud he reached conclusions that were at variancewith those of The Professor and they were not well received Reichs clinical emphasis on the completely gratifying geni tal orgasm as the major cri terion of individual mental health received an equally cold reception One clinician told Reich that he admired Reichs presentation but was glad that he had not written Reichs book In response to Reichs claim many analysts con tended that they had patients who attained genital orgasm yet remained ill Others argued that the orgasm theory could not explain the war neuroses produced by sudden traumatic events Still others said the orgasm theory could not ac count for the research then being conducted by Pavlov in Russia which suggested that neuroses could be experimen tally produced in animals by placing them in conflict situ ations Finally there was a general feeling that Reichs orgasm theory failed to make good physiological sense Sex ual substarices simply do not accumulate and produce ex periences like those coming from a full bladder although Reich insisted on using this analogy In responding to these ob jections Reich tended to ig nore much of the negative evi dence and responded mainly to the criticism that patients remained ill even while hav ing genital orgasms To the latter argument Reich re sponded that ejaculation itself was not indicative of what he came to call orgastic potency By this he meant complete reflexive and totally satisfying orgasm the major criteria of which were the involuntary contractions of the organism and the complete discharge of the excitation as well as the ability to concentrate oneself with ones whole personality on the orgastic experience in spite of possible conflicts A patient argued Reich could be orgastically impotent and still have an orgasm but it would be a feeble replica of the ex perience of the orgastically potent individual for whom or genii was a total relief from sexual pressure and a rejuve nating experience ALTHOUGH Reichs theory of the damming up of sexual energysexual stasis he called itis not supported by the preponderance of evidence his idea that orgastic potency is a criterion of mental health contains a partial truth Freud made clear that conflicts over infantile sexual impulses gave rise to the neuroses and that only when these conflicts were resolved could satisfying and mature genital activity occur Likewise Erikson suggests that successful intimacy in cluding sexual intimacy re quires a confirmed sense of ego identity This is true be cause intimacy presupposes the ability to give oneself more or less totally to another person and only those with a solid sense of ego identity re main unthreatened by the pos sibility of incorporating or be ing incorporated by another person Thus Freud and Erik son both suggest that mental and emotional maturity are essential prerequisites for or gastic potency in the Reichian sense They do not imply as Reich did that the reverse is also true and that orgastic po tency is an essential prerequi site to mental wellbeing Despite the negative reac tions to his orgasm theory Reich remained undaunted and convinced that he was correct Moreover the orgasm theory seemed to have important im plications for the psychothera peutic and political activities in which he also was actively engaged It is rather ironic that Reichs orgasm theory which is not generally ac cepted nonetheless led him to the valuable therapeutic in sights contained in his char acter analysis and to the valuable socialpsychological insights embodied in the Mass Psychology of Fascism A further irony is that it was not his wrong orgasm theory but rather his right under standing of character forma tion and mass psychology which led to his estrangement from psychoanalysis in gen eral and from Freud in par ticular Reichs ideas about psycho therapy were developing at the same time that he was evolving his orgasm theory and like that theory derived from clinical practice In 1922 Freud established a Vienna Psychoanalytic Polyclinic for less affluent patients which was modeled after a similar clinic that had already been established in Berlin Reich was first clinical assistant to the director Dr Edward Hitschman from 1922 to 1928 and was its vice director from 1928 to 1930 While working at the clinic Reich initiated in 1924 the famous Technical Seminar over which he presided for the next six years The seminar was concerned with practical thera peutic problems and was very popular among physicians training to be analysts In the seminar Reich and his students presented cases that had not gone well or that had not progressed at all One common factor in all these therapeutic failures was that the patients for one reason or another had not been follow ing the fundamental rule of psychoanalytic treatment The fundamental rule is that the patient must say everything that comes to mind no matter how trivial stupid bizarre hateful or amorous it might be Such free associations provided the material upon which the analyst worked to discover and to make con scious the conflict causing the neurotic difficulty If the pa tient would not or could not follow the fundamental rule then treatment of necessity came to a standstill FREUD of course encoun tered similar problems in his own patients and had written about resistances to the therapy He also suggested that these resistances which later came to be described as defenses of the ego had to be analyzed and interpreted to the patient Freud had not however provided a detailed discussion of the nature of these resistances nor had he provided many clues as to how they were to be analyzed and overcome Reich as a result of ques tions raised in the technical seminar and his own thera peutic experiments was the first analyst to present a sys tematic and detailed method for dealing with the patients resistances to the fundamental rule It is this method that Reich came to call character analysis Freud had demonstrated that dreams slips of the tongue and pen as well as other errors of everyday life often signaled the unconscious feelings and desires of the per son who made them Classical analytic procedure involved the interpretation of this kind of material Reich pointed out that the patients habitual bodily movements and expres sions his ways of sitting standing and talking also hinted at unconscious material What these habitual ways of behaving signaled however he said were the patients customary ways of defending himself from both inner dan gers his sexual or angry im pulses and his conscience and dangers from without the re actions of others to his be havior A man for example who habitually puts his hand over his mouth as he speaks could be defending both against the angry words he unconsciously wants to speak and also against getting hit in the mouth for saying them When patients failed to obey the fundamental rule therefore Reich advocated repeated in terpretation of the character istic defensive behavior as a point of therapeutic attack and as a way of getting the analysis unstuck Reichs method of character analysis is illustrated by the case of a 30yearold man whom Reich treated in Vienna The patient was impotent and complained of not getting much fun out of life His total manner was inhibited and he gave the impression of a person who was in a kind of huddle with himself He spoke in a low and hesitant voice and looked at the ground rather than at the person to whom he was speaking Dur ing the analytic hours he complained I dont feel any thing the analysis doesnt have any influence on me nothing comes to mind The classical way to handle such a patient was kindly encour agement to try harder or to say more about this or that topic Instead Reich repeatedly focused on the patients words and behavior and interpreted them as a rejection of him self and of the analysis Even tually the patient retorted that he was not rejecting the analysis and had in fact identified Reich with a close friend To this Reich replied that perhaps the patient ex pected the analyst to love him and admire him as his friend did Perhaps too Reich added the patients rejection of the analysis stemmed from his dis appointment and resentment at Reichs clinical reserve The patient then acknowl edged that he had always de manded love as a child and that he had continued this pattern as an adult It made him feel defensive with virile appearing men After this dis closure the patient was able to discuss more personal ma terial and the analysis got truly under way Reich de scribed the results of his new therapeutic procedures in the book for which he is most widely known Character Analysis 1933 In that book as in many of his later books Reich used drawings of amoe balike figures to illustrate his points At the same time that Reich was developing his orgasm theory and his method of character analysis he was also involved with the political activities which engrossed al most all of the young Viennese intellectuals The name of Marx came up so often that Reich decided to read Marx for himself and he proceeded to devour Marxs writings with the same fervor and singlemindedness that he had ingested Freuds a few years earlier Reich joined the So cialist party in 1924 and be came a very active party member He worked mainly in recruiting and in education and was more concerned with the humanistic reforms prom ised by the party than with its political platform as such But while Reich accepted the Marxian premise that the working class was exploited by the owners and managers of the middle class he did not detect a revolutionary spirit in the people The revolt of the masses predicted by Marx was not taking place It seemed to Reich at this point that neither Marxian nor Freudian theory while each contained a certain amount of truth could of themselves account for the po litical and social psychological realities of what was taking place in Europe In effect Marx lacked an adequate psychology while Freud lacked an adequate sociology Reich made a number of at tempts to integrate the theo ries without too much suc cess He then realized that a mere addition of the two theo ries was not enough and that something new had to be pro posed that would integrate the two systems and at the same time explain the socialpoliti cal realities of the moment Reichs solution was presented in The Mass Psychology of Fascism 1933 Reich introduced his major theme by asking why the vast majority of people allow them selves to be exploited over worked and underfed by the few The answer he argued resides in the fact that the owners of the means of pro duction also set the character structure of the society It is the middle class which deter mines the values and stand ards that predominate within any given society This value structure is then reproduced within every member of the society by the institution of the family The paternal au thoritarian family of Western Europe Reich argued pre pared people from early child hood to accept the omnisci ence of a powerful authority who was to be obeyed with out question Fascism was the natural political form for the character type produced by the patriarchial family and the potential for Fascism thus ex isted in any country where a patriarchal family structure was dominant From this point of view the progressive equalitarianism of the Ameri can family is a healthy sign THE publication of The Mass Psychology of Fascism in many ways terminated Reichs affiliation with psy choanalysis although the of ficial break did not occur until a year later in 1934 Reichs difficulties with his fellow psychoanalysts had been building for a number of years and were at once per sonal professional and politi cal Indeed it is not clear whether the analysts found Reichs unconcealed romantic affairs or his orgasm theo ry or his political activities most repugnant What is clear is that Reich managed to de stroy most of the goodwill he had established in Vienna with his clinical work and his technical seminar As Reich became more in volved in politics from 1928 to 1930 his writings more and more took on a political polemical quality This was embarrassing to Freud who wished to keep psychoanalysis quite separate from politics in those difficult and delicate times The discomfort Reich was causing may have been one of the reasons Freud en couraged Reich to move to Berlin where the Viennese analyst Sandor Rado had agreed to take him for a training analysis Reich moved his family to Berlin in 1930 The analysis however was shortlived because Rado de parted for America soon after Reich arrived in Berlin Reich in the meantime was getting ever more deeply involved in political matters THE final break with Freud came as a result of a paper Reich submitted to the Zeit schrift fr Psychoanalysis in 1932 The paper dealt with the masochistic character and contradicted Freuds interpre tation of how such character types came to be formed In 1920 Freud published Beyond the Pleasure Principle in which he proposed that in ad dition to the positive life prin ciple Eros there was an equally primary negative life impulse Thanatos which amounted to a death instinct Freud then argued that the masochistic person is one who is dominated by Thanatos the instinct of selfdestruction Reich argued that the maso chistic character could be ex plained entirely by the life principle Eros and that there was no need to postulate a death instinct Reich gave many cogent clinical examples wherein masochistic behavior was seen as an anguished cry for love Reich showed that the masochistic person was in effect saying Look at me see how I suffer I am so misera ble love me Masochism in Reichs view was just Eros in disguise Although other ana lysts privately agreed with Reich and had many reserva tions about the death instinct Reichs rather than Freuds interpretation of masochism prevails in psychiatry today they hesitated as Reich did not to speak out openly against Freuds hypothesis When Freud read the paper he was troubled less by Reichs arguments against the death instinct than he was by the political tone of the argu ments As he wrote Jones the editor of the Zeitschrift The paper culminates in the non sensical statement that what we have called the death in stinct is a product of the capitalist system Yet Freud recognized the clinical merit of the piece and recommended that it be published along with a statement to the effect that the Zeitschrift itself was non political and that it was not responsible for the political views of its contributors Freuds suggestion met with considerable opposition from the editorial board and the upshot of the matter was the paper was published together with a 30page rebuttal by a member of the board The whole incident created still more resentment against Reich for the continued em barrassment he was causing the entire German Psycho analytic Society This embar rassment became acute with the publication of Mass Psy chology of Fascism wherein an accredited psychoanalyst of national standing attacked Fascism from the standpoint of what was essentially Freud ian theory Something had to be done and the opportunity arose the next year In early August 1934 Reich received a letter from the analyst Carl Mueller which said that cir cumstances required that Reichs name not appear on the register of members of the German Psychoanalytic So ciety The register was being prepared for the 1934 Interna tional Congress of Psychoan alysis that was to be held in Lucerne Switzerland Reich was in effect expelled from the psychoanalytic society for his political views Ironically Reich was also repudiated by the Socialist and Communist parties at about the same time but for quite different reasons When Reich moved to Berlin in 1930 he became involved in the mental hygiene movement which at that time was politi cally oriented Since Reich be lieved that only a revolution in sexual attitudes and be havior could bring about a true political revolution he emphasized sexual freedom and sex education in his writ ings and lectures He also cre ated with the consent of the Communist party a German Association for Proletarian Sex Politics which by dint of Reichs avid recruiting at tained a membership of some 20000 persons The platform of this party which Reich called a sex political plat form contained the following aims which are rather aston ishing in their modernity 1 Better housing condi tions for the masses of people 2 Abolition of laws against abortion and homosexuality 3 Change of marriage and divorce laws 4 Free birthcontrol advice and contraceptives 5 Health protection of mothers and children 6 Nurseries in factories and in other large employment centers 7 Abolition of laws prohib iting sex education 8 Home leave for prison ers Reich was however a little too successful in recruiting people to his sexual politics platform The Communist par ty leaders began to distrust the interest generated by Reichs sexual reforms and began to fear that this inter est might dampen revolution ary ardor or direct that ardor in the wrong directions ie what for them were the wrong directions Party function aries put out orders that all of Reichs books and pamph lets were to be removed from party bookstores Shortly thereafter the Gestapo went even further and ordered all of Reichs books confiscated and burned Fortunately Reich was able to get out of Ger many before his name was put on the list of those to be caught and shot Whenever Reich was treat ed badly as he had been by the German Psychoanalytic Society and by the Com munist party functionaries he got bitterly angry but he could not or would not direct this anger at those who aroused it Instead he turned his rage on those nearest and dearest to him his friends and most of all his wife Reichs marriage was already shaky and the anger and abuse he poured on Annie at this time was enough to convince her that she could no longer live with Reich and still retain her pride and in tegrity as a person The final separation came in 1933 after Reich and Annie escaped to Vienna from Berlin Reichs reception in Vienna was even cooler than he had anticipated That fact to gether with the worsening po litical situation made Reich decide to leave Austria He moved to Denmark shortly afterward but his sexualpolit ical ideas were too much for Danish authorities who feared for the morality of their young people Reichs permit to live and work in Denmark was re voked after six months Reich then moved to Malmo Swe den where the same drama was played over again Reich left Sweden in the early sum mer of 1934 and spent the rest of it traveling about some times clandestinely and under assumed names in Denmark and Sweden and quite brazen ly in Germany THAT fall Reich moved to Oslo with his commonlaw wife Elsa Lindenberg a bal let dancer from Berlin whom he had met at a May Day parade two years before One of the reasons that Reich moved to Oslo was that a friend Otto Fenichel now famous for his classic Psy choanalytic Theory of Neu rosis had established him self in Norway and urged Reich to join him there Once Reich arrived in Oslo however the friendship de teriorated quickly In part the difficulty may have been Feni chels reluctance to accept Reichs sexualpolitical views But part of the problem may also have been the fact that students preferred Reich to Fenichel for their training analyses This hurt Fenichels pride as well as his income In any case when Fenichel left Oslo for America he left a trail of rumors in every country he visited to the ef fect that Reich had had a men tal breakdown and was com pletely insane This rumor which was not accurate per sists today Reichs stay in Norway was more prolonged than his so journ in either Denmark or Sweden Here he undertook experiments designed to meas ure and demonstrate the phys ical reality of the sexual ener gy whose suppression played such a large part in the per sonal and social misery of mankind At first he measured the electric potential of the skin during sexual excitation and fantasy But the results of the experiments were not satisfying because Reich re fused to see sexual energy as merely something electrical and mechanical Sexual energy had to be alive and pulsating Inevitably Reich came to think of this energy as no longer confined within the boundaries of the body It existed in the world at large not unlike the energy of t
e sun and was even locked up in inanimate material like sand and coal dust Reich then undertook a series of experiments designed to release the living energy bound up in inanimate mat ter in effect to transform nonliving matter into living material One at the methods used in these experiments was to autoclave pressurecook a solution of 50 per cent bouil lon and 50 per cent potassium chloride and then add coal dust or other material that had been heated to incandes cence When the experiment was carried out under proper conditions microscopic ex amination of the preparation revealed that small vesicles detached themselves from the larger particles moved about freely appeared to pulsate and gave off a blue or bluegreen glow Reich assumed that these vesicles which he called bi ons were midway between animate and inanimate matter and that they were emanating a kind of life energy It should be said that Reich was now working outside the scientific system of checks and balances and did not submit his work to scientific journals for re view He could thus reject or ignore negative evidence and alternative explanations for his findings This he proceeded to do and published his re search at his own expense in a book which was rather grandly entitled The Discov ery of the Bion Innovations were also oc curring in Reichs psychother apeutic work He no longer thought of character in psy chic terms but rather as a primarily physical and somatic affair Instead of character structure he began to speak of character armor by which he meant the chronic physical attitudes stooped shoulders stiff posture and so on which prohibit people from being free and open His character analysis now became a vegetotherapy which was a manipulative procedure aimed at eliminat ing the armor of stiffness in all parts of the body The procedure involved not only massage but also breathing exercises of various sorts The aim was to free the person to be himself It was a kind of chiropractic self  realization therapy The practice of veg etotherapy by Reichian an alysts in America later gave rise to the false rumor that Reichian analysis involved masturbating patients IN the realm of social psy ohology Reich gave up his ex plicit attempts to relate his work to Marx and Freud and moved instead toward the further exposition of his own sexual politics and what he came to call a work democ racy a selfregulated self governed commune type of community Reich continued to urge sexual reforms as the foundation for any real change within the society and he ar gued persuasively for sexual education and sexual freedom for the young He lectured and wrote a great deal on this topic and some of his articles appeared in a book first pub lished in 1936 which in Eng lish translation was titled The Sexual Revolution Although Reichs stay in Oslo was relatively quiet for the first two years of his resi dence there the publication of his work on bions vege totherapy and sexual politics eventually came to the atten tion of the public In 1937 a rather vicious newspaper cam paign was begun and more than one hundred pieces about Reich appeared in less than a year Although things were not all onesided the majority of pieces were of the kind sug gested by the headlines Quackery of Psychoanaly sis The Jewish Pornog rapher and God Reich Cre ates Life Oslo was a small enough community so that this publicity made Reichs personal life something of a trial Although Reich was angered by the campaign he refused to answer his critics except to say that his work ought to be judged by scien tists and not by laymen The anger aroused in Reich was again turned toward his wife and friends It led to a separation from Elsa in much the same way it had led to the break with his first wife Annie A few years later when Reich was well estab lished in America Elsa out of desperation she lost her job when the Nazis occupied the country asked him for help Reich could be generous when it came to such things as birthday gifts but he was penurious when it came to money for running a house hold or in other cases of real material need It was one of those realities Reich could not face He sent Elsa 25 REICHS decision to move to America was largely due to the efforts of a New York psychiatrist Dr Theo dore Wolfe who had spent a year of study in Oslo Wolfe was able to get Reich a two year appointment as associ ate professor of medical psy chology at the New School for Social Research in New York Soon after his arrival in 1939 Reich rented a house in Forest Hills where he quickly resumed the pattern of activities he had followed in Oslo Berlin and Vienna Reich soon had an institute and a publishing outlet The Orgone Press for his books and research articles When setting up his laboratory Reich hired Ilse Ollendorf whom he proceeded to court and marry Ilse helped to carry on much of Reichs ex perimental research After Reichs discovery of the bion which he re garded as embodying a gen eral life energy he sought a term to describe this energy and finally arrived at the name orgone a contrac tion of the words organism and orgastic Reich be lieved that orgone energy was an entirely new form of energy which was at one and the same time radiant and electrical Experiments led Reich to believe that this energy was reflected by nonorganic sub stances like metal and ab sorbed by organic substances like wood To collect this en ergy he therefore built or gone accumulators which were like telephone booths with metal inside and wood or other organic material added on the outside When any liv ing organism was placed in the orgone box its temperature rose Reich was so enthralled with this discovery that he wrote Einstein about it in 1940 and asked for an ap pointment The two men met on Jan 13 1941 Later Ein stein wrote Reich and told hm that he had replicated Reichs findings regarding the increased temperature in the box but that there was a simpler explanation than that of the accumulation of orgone energy There was no fur ther correspondence and Reich thereafter referred to the in cident as the Einstein affair ONE of the problems that began to preoccupy him more and more was that of cancer This preoccupation probably stemmed in part from Reichs response to Freuds stoic suf fering after he contracted can cer of the jaw in 1923 Freud remained a father figure for Reich even after their split But Reichs preoccupation with cancer was also stimu lated by some findings from his continued experimentation with bions Microscopic ex amination of bion prepara tions began to reveal some particles which did not fully develop into bions or which regressed after reaching the bion stage These abortive bions were elongated red bodies which Reich called T Bacilli Studies of T Bacilli revealed that they originated from the degeneration or disintegra tion of living or nonliving protein In contrast to rot bacteria which agglutinate after a few days T Bacilli took months to do so Fur thermore T Bacilli turned out to be quite deadly Mice in jected with large doses of T Bacilli were dead within 24 hours Further studies showed that cancerous and precan cerous tissue both showed high concentrations of T Bacilli Research also revealed that fully developed bions which Reich now called PA bions tended to attract and to kill the T Bacilli It was this research that led Reich to begin treating cancer patients with orgone energy His reasoning was some thing like this The PA bions are fully charged orgone units while the T Bacilli are weakly charged with orgone energy A person with cancer has too many T Bacilli and too few PA bions in his system By bombarding the patient with orgone energy Reich hoped to stop the production of abortive bions and at the same time to reinforce the potential of the PA bions to kill the T Bacilli Although Reichs reasoning was sound his premisesparticularly those regarding radiant orgone energywere completely at variance with known bio logical facts and principles Reich was however con vinced that his conclusions were correct and he pro ceeded to place cancer pa tients in the orgone boxes In fairness to Reich it should be said that he re garded this work as experi mental never claimed he had a cancer cure and did not charge patients for treatment It was nonetheless the dis semination of this material and of a small number of portable orgone accumulators that eventually led to Reichs imprisonment The work on orgone energy and on orgone therapy did not absorb all of Reichs energies and he continued writing books that are perhaps still best described as socialpsy chological Among these books many of which have now been reissued by Noonday Press the most noteworthy are Listen Little Man 1948 Cosmic Superimposi tion 1951 and the Murder of Christ 1953 The themes of these books chronicle Reichs transformation from a political and scientific revolu tionary to a religious evan gelist In them Reich raged against the characterological rigidity which kept the little man from really living and realizing his own potential It was the little man how ever who also impeded the work of the truly alive and creative big man among whom Reich numbered Christ Giordano Bruno and himself In Reichs view the religious savior and the scientific in novator are alike in that they both have a total investment in truth And this truth which is at once scientific law and religious faith holds the only answer for mans salvation Hence Reich came to see him self as analogous to Christ in having the answer to mans salvation and in being reject ed by the armored little man who was most in need of saving These books give abundant evidence that Reich never completely lost touch with reality and was for the most part rational and compre hensible It is also true how ever that at times his think ing seemed quite paranoid and ridden with grandiose and persecutory ideas He began to invent and designate or ganizations of all kinds such as EPPO Emotional Plague Prevention Office HIG Hoodlums in Government and DOR Deadly Orgone Energy Reidhs fictive organ izations were very real to him and later during his trial he signed his briefs as Counsel for the EPPO In addition he continued to introduce symbolic drawings and figures such as the upturned arrow splitting into two which then came at each other to il lustrate some of his concepts Reich got in trouble with the law in the United States when his distribution of or gone accumulators for the treatment for cancer came un der the scrutiny of the Fed eral Drug Administration There ensued a number of in vestigations of Reichs home in Forest Hills and of the steadily enlarging compound of dwellings and laboratories in Rangeley Me where Reich hoped to establish a work democracy and Which he called Orgonon Reich had purchased several hundred acres of land in Rangeley in the nineteenforties and he his family and coworkers be gan spending their summers there Several conferences of orgonomists were also held during these summers and Or gonon came to be the general headquarters of Reichs re search activities With the erection of winterized quar ters the Reichs moved to Rangeley permanently in 1950 The Forest Hills property was sold in 1952 All during this time the Government was building its case against Reich In 1954 on the basis of accumulated depositions it got an in junction against the Manufac ture and distribution of orgone energy accumulators only about a hundred were ever built and against all printed material which in any way suggested the therapeutic ef fectiveness of the device Reich defied the injunction on the grounds that no court of law only a jury of his scientific peers was qualified to judge the merits of his scientific work It was the start of a long and involved legal battle Reichs position was not helped by the fact that he refused to hire coun sel and by the fact that he had refused to go through the procedures required for him to be licensed to practice medicine in New York State History repeated itself again in Reichs reaction to the in junction by the FDA His an ger was turned against his wife and his friends Now it was rises turn to suffer Reichs jealous tirades and abuse Ilse left Reich in 1954 and took their son Peter with her al though Peter continued to see his father afterward and Ilse and Reich remained on rea sonably good terms and con tinued to correspond Reichs loneliness and frustration dur ing this period were height ened by the death of his good friend Theodore Wolfe who had handled so many of the publishing and administrative details of his work Reich went to the movies ate solitary suppers of boiled potatoes and despite an earlier heart attack and failing health begar drinking heavily He also expensively furnished the din ing room at Orgonon in hopes that President Eisenhower would visit him and get him out of difficulty There were several hearings in 1955 in which Reich re iterated his refusal to obey the injunction Again he offered to stand by the judgment of a board of scientifically trained persons The court said it had no power to convene such a body and set a date for a criminal contempt of court trial The trial took place on May 37 1956 Reich repre sented himself and acknowl edged that he had refused to obey the injunction but he also refused to plead guilty While Reich handled himself well in the interrogations his summation included many ref erences to HTG referred to FDA agents as spies and hoodlums and was often quite loose and abstract The prose cution claimed that Reich and his followers were keeping FDA agents off the Orgonon premises sometimes at gun point and that Reichs de mand for a jury of scientists hardly squared with the fact that Reich had never been licensed to practice medicine in the United States The jury needed only 10 minutes to decide that Reich had in fact violated the in junction and was in contempt of court The judge then fined the Wilhelm Reich Foundation 10000 and sentenced Reich to two years in prison An appeal to a higher court failed and Reich was admitted to the Federal Penitentiary in Dan bury Conn on March 12 1957 Ten days later he was transferred to the prison at Lewisburg Pa While Reich was clearly in contempt of court the sen tence seems considering the offense his age state of mind and health rather harsh Al though the prison sentence was unexpected Reich bore it well and wrote to Peter about the nroiects he planned to un dertake once he had regained his freedom A parole hearing was set for midNovember and Reich was optimistic about an early release Several days be fore the hearing on Nov 31957 Reich suffered a second and fatal heart attack Shortly after his imprison ment Reich was interviewed by several psychiatrists They found him to be impressively brilliant but also quite para noid and he spoke to them of the conspiracy against him plotted by Moscow and the Rockefellers Within the con fines of his paranoid premises however his reasoning was quite logical and consistent Although Reichs later work on bions orgone energy and cancer has yet to be fully test ed and evaluated by the scien tific community it seems to have some of the quality of his delusions and suggests a logically consistent theoretical edifice based on scientifically untenable premises Put differently Reichs rea soning remained relatively sound but his judgment and ability to test reality were often seriously impaired Even with this impairment Reichs later socialpsychologi cal books though marred by the intrusions of paranoid thinking contain many pas sages which in my opinion will be of lasting value to the study of men in groups IF the latex Reich of the Or gone Box and the EPPO is something of a tragic fig ure the early Reich of Mass Psychology of Fascism is as much a culture hero to the youth of today as he was to young people 35 years ago when his courageous revolu tionary books gave hope to the dispirited students of Western Europe oppressed by the specter of National Social ism The nature of the early Reichs appeal to youth was perhaps best described by Reichs oldest and stanchest friend A S Neil founder of Summerhill a school for adolescents run on Reichian lines In a letter written shortly after Reichs trial Neill said with the early Reich in mind Reich I love you  I can not bear to think of your be ing punished by an insane prison sentence  The fact is that you are being crucified fundamentally because you are the first man in centuries who has preached prolifeness be cause you are the one and only man to assert the right of adolescents to love com pletely In any court your de fense should be in big letters I AM FOR LIFE

Declining Memberships Forcing Changes in East Side Protestant Churches,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/18/archives/declining-memberships-forcing-changes-in-east-side-protestant.html,The wealthy influential and prestigious East Side churches that were for decades the show cases of Protestantism in the city are changing in varying degrees to cope with declining attendance and rejection of traditional forms of worship The avenue churchesso called because they are on Fifth Madison and Park Avenues are gradually expanding their religious missions from tradi tional Sunday services to deeper involvement in such disparate aspects of city life as housing group therapy modern music abortion advice coffeehouses for students and rest rooms for demonstrators Some of the new involve ment is moral or on paper or in the discussion stages Some members devote personal ef fort to it others provide only money And in some churches it is only grudgingly accepted or opposed outright by clergy men and their congregations But there is changea white minister working and living in Harlem a church employe hired specifically to work on housing redevelopment rock music at Holy Week services Some of the six or eight av enue churches say their mem bership Sunday attendance and donations have declined in re cent years Others deny this Many of them have endow ments as high as 25million which they use to pay part of their expenses But most of the heads of the churches agree that their mis sion is changing although they express their feelings toward the change in different ways New Missions Praised Im proud that this fatcat church is breaking out of the cocoon and reaching out into the city the Rev Dr Bryant M Kirkland of the Fifth Av enue Presbyterian Church at 55th Street said in a recent interview The Rev Frederick M Mor ris rector of St Thomas Epis copal Church 53d Street and Fifth Avenue said Churchgo ing is on the decline and were feeling it here He said that in the last five years Sunday attendance had dropped from 1000 at the morning service to 500 The decline he said is due to overemphasis on activism and the loss of personal piety and the basic motivations of Christian living While his church has been increasing its donations to vari ous secular programs St Thomas gave 174000 to non parish activities in 1970 Dr Morris said The churchs primary job is not to be a social agency The emphasis on social activism by the church tends to make peo ple lose sight of the fact that the main purpose of the church is the worship of God The Rev Dr John B Coburn of St James Episcopal Church at Madison Avenue and 71st Street said that there was a crisis of faith and that there was an eagerness to under stand the Spirit in forms that are secular TaxFree Property Cited Dr Robert A Edgar pastor of the Central Presbyterian Church Park Avenue and 64th Street said the 350 members of his congregation gave about 70000 last year toward the churchs total budget of 393 000 adding They know they havent any right to use this money for their small crowd Dr Edgars 34yearold as sistant James W Crawford said We do own a large piece of taxfree property and public space is in demand To determine how to use Central Presbyterians money and taxfree property the church had a study made of Protestantism in the East Side area bounded by 42d and 96th Streets Fifth Avenue and the East River The East Side Protestant community is not as large as it was in previous years the report said and it will be smaller in the future It is con tracting from an estimated 79 000 in 1960 to 35000 in 1980 The Roman Catholic community will decline while the Jewish community will continue to ex pand Nearly one half of the East Side residents in 1980 will be Jewish The report also said that 55 East Side Protestant congrega tions are losing members and the downward trend seems to be accelerating Losses began to appear in the early nineteen fifties and have continued to this year This is also true for Sunday school enrollment The report compiled by a church committee said that at Central Presbyterian for ex ample the average Sunday morning worship attendance in 1964 was 193 By midNovem ber 1970 the average was less than TOP Most East Side con gregations are experiencing a similar trend the report said Minister in Harlem We decided to create a new kind of church Dr Edgar said one that would serve not only our own membership but serve the needs of the community Dr Crawford is Centrals principal way of reaching out into the City He lives in East Harlem on 101st Street and spends much of his time work ing with black groups there Dr Edgar also works with socalled subcongregations at Central which do not attend regular Sunday services He calls these the music congrega tion the arts congregation and listening groups One of Bachs cantatas is worth 10 of my sermons Dr Edgar said he was recently told by his wife Dr Edgar also operates a coffeehouse complete with re corded rock music and walls for scrawling Asked what the room was used for before it became a coffeehouse princi pally frequented by Hunter Col lege students Dr Edgar said It used to be for Sunday school Dr Coburn said attendance at St James had been hold ing up in recent years and the amount of giving pledges is the highest in the history of the parish His churchs aid to the black community last year included 60000 for a Har lem storefront school Dr Coburn said the 3000 persons associated with the parish had contributed 408 000 last year although average attendance at Sunday services is about 600 The crisis of faith he said means preaching must be done within a culture that no longer accepts biblical doctrines Our assignment in part he added is to help people understand how the Spirit of God is being expressed in new forms Dr Kirkland sitting in his office at Fifth Avenue Presby terian said his churchs mem bership was 2400 of whom 1 100 live in Manhattan many of whom make up the average Sunday attendance of 1350 He would not say whether his the churchs endowment was as high as Centrals 25 million but added that the an nual endowment income was less than Centrals 175000 But with a 450000 annual budget Dr Kirkland sends money to various relief agencies and has made donations to vari ous local black community or ganizations To help him achieve the goal of making this one of the contemporary productive churches in New York City helping the city fulfill its life Dr Kirkland has also turned to music He scheduled performances of rock music in addition to traditional classical religious works during Holy Week Im not doing it for phony rea sons Dr Kirkland said This is what people want People also want the churchs rest rooms which Dr Kirkland said were regularly opened to persons demonstrating at Gov ernor Rockefellers office at 22 West 55th Street

walk between her home at 251 East 105th Street and the Union Settle ment House at 237 East 104th around the block is a walk to friends help companionship and in one sense her free dom Every morning for the last year she has taken her two little children to the daycare center on the second floor of the threestory red brick building It costs her 175 a week and allows her to work two blocks away in Public School 146 as a school aide The daycare center is only one of the settlement houses services to East Harlem Dur ing the 18 hours it is open each day it offers drug coun seling vocational training loans at low rates and even arrangements for lowcost funerals Every afternoon when Mrs Sabater picks up her children she usually spends more than an hour in the main lobby chatting with other parents the teachers the staff members and the community residents who gather there daily I stay and talk to every one Mrs Sabater said re cently To me its like my family there Its taking care al my children Its letting me work its giving me friends Its as if they are all my brothers and my sisters there and everyone is belonging to gether The Union Settlement Housesurrounded by the tenements bodegas churches and housing projects is a place where children adults and the elderly alike can find something they need or en joy At any one time for ex ample people are there to at tend a wedding reception play basketball borrow money get help with drug or abortion problems leave their children take typing lessens and look for a job or an apartment Or they may be there to arrange a funeral for 200 that might cost 700 at a private funeral home and that will still include a coffin hearse limousine and flowers Off to Early Start Every day of the week the center opens at 730 AM when the daycare classes start It closes at 12 or 1 at night when the last basket ball player wearily makes his way down the winding stair case and goes out through the swinging door For the rest of the time the rooms corridors gym nasiums and playgrounds echo steadily with the sounds of activity Supervising all of this are 135 staff members In a large yellow room on the ground floor for example an elderly man who receives biweekly welfare checks was borrowing 30 from the credit union to buy his wife a present Waiting her turn in line was a 12yearold girl a 5 bill in her hand This she said was to pay back part of the loan her mother re ceived 10 months ago so that her eldest son could be re leased from jail on 500 bail Down the hallway in a room lined with college hand books was Carol Barker a senior at Benjamin Franklin High School Carol who once thought she would never go to college was discussing ac ceptance letters she had re ceived from Pace Fordham and Long Island University Difficult Decision

citizen program at the settlement house for the last two years said that while the house helped each person in a different way the main thing it did was that It gives people encouragement Mrs Aviles first came to the center about six years ago to attend a meeting for parents Then she attended others about housing prob lems In time she joined a community action group and started to teach in the Head Start program there The daily schedule for old sters includes games crafts medical attention and meals Mrs Aviles sees 350 elderly men and women on a regular basis and about 600 dur ing a year

the Rev Wil liam Kirk an Episcopal min ister has been headworker of the center which was started in 1895 by two graduates of Union Theological Seminary Its pretty hard to say what the settlement house

move up We try to be part of moving up Of the settlements yearly budget of 12million 550 000 is city state and Fed eral money for the daycare center One of the largest ongoing programs in the city it

Negro Illegitimacy Rate Drops as Whites' Rises,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/20/archives/negro-illegitimacy-rate-drops-as-whites-rises-rate-of-negro.html,WASHINGTON April 19  Black women on the average had significantly fewer illegiti mate babies in the late 1960s than at the beginning of the decade while white women had more according to a Census Bureau study issued today The black illegitimacy rate 10 times higher than the white rate in 1961 dropped to about seven times higher in 1968 the latest reported year the study showed But even with this decline in the rate in actual numbers more illegitimate babies were born in 1968 to blacks who make up 11 per cent of the population than to whites Of the 339000 illegitimate births in 1968 184000 were black and 155000 were white The total about 10 per cent of all births represented a continued slight growth in the na tional illegitimacy rate The new census study enti tled Fertility Indicators 1970 is an unusually comprehensive compilation from Federal and private sources Its various find ings also include the following After a period of sharp de cline the national fertility rate appears to have stabilized at a low level In 1957 the women of childbearing age in the Unit ed States had a lifetime average of 37 children In 1968 1969 and 1970 the figure fell below 25 There is a rising number of prospective young mothers those in the early portion of the childbearing years which for most tables in this study were considered to be from 15 to 44 The number of children born rises as the number of women capable of bearing children in creases Thus the number of births increased both in 1969 and 1970 after having declined for eight years Young women with college educations are considerably more likely to have fewer chil dren than women with less than eight grades of education The findings that specialists found most striking were those concerning illegitimacy In 1961 the rate among blacks reached a record high of 101 illegitimate babies for every 1000 unmarried women By 1968 this had fallen to less than 87 Among whites on the other hand illegitimacy increased from 10 to more than 13 il legitimate births per 1000 un married women in the same period In 1968 5 per cent of all white births and 10 per cent of white first births were illegit imate For blacks the com parative figures were 31 per cent of all births and 48 per cent of first births Johns Hopkins Explanations A series of explanations for the large difference between black and white illegitimacy rates was advanced in a paper published last December by two Johns Hopkins authorities Melvin Zelnik and John F Kant ner They concluded that a black woman was more likely to en gage in premarital intercourse less likely to use contraception less likely to undergo abortion and better able to fell that her child has as good a chance in life as any legitimate child of her race born into similar eco nomic circumstances In an interview Dr Kantner said he did not know what ac counted for the narrowing of the gap between the black and white rates but he offered what he termed a hunch Illegitimacy is concentrated among women under 20 and it is at those ages that one is most likely to be influenced by pub lic information It could be that the use of contraception is catching on and that young black women are more willing to undergo abortions One popular thesis on the blackwhite differential  that black illegitimacy increases as welfare benefits increaseis sharply contradicted by Phillips Cutright senior research asso ciate at the HarvardMassa chusetts Institute of Technol ogy Joint Center for Urban Studies After a detailed analysis of welfare families he found that between 1958 and 1966 in creased benefits were followed by an increase in illegitimacy among whites and a decrease among blacks He concluded that there was no link between welfare bene fit levels and illegitimacy In a more general section the new census study reported a leveling off for all women of the total fertility rate The study concluded that women born in the late 1940s were becoming mothers at a much slower pace than women born 10 years earlier It was not yet clear the study said whether this decline simply meant that these women would have the same number of children but later in life or fewer children The total fertility rate is de fined as the number of births that 1000 women would have in their lifetime if at each year of age they experienced the birth rates occurring in the specified calendar year In 1957 the fertility rate reached 3767 meaning that 1000 women would have had 3767 children in their lifetime or 376 per woman The 1957 rate was the highest since the tabulation was begun in 1917 By 1960 the rate was 3654 and it subsequently fell to the following levels 19672573 1968 2477 19692477 and 1970 provisional figure  2472 To achieve zero population growth the rate would have to be 211 assuming no immigra tion In other words the rate has leveled off at a low figure after a period of very sharp decline according to Campbell Gibson the Census Bureau statistician who developed the report

the speech made a later ramble through historic parts of the tranquil city of 26000 more meaningful Mr Jones noted that the State Constitution had been drafted by 13 men of dis parate views who had met in the Kingston Courthouse where the effluvia from the jail stank so badly that Gouverneur Morris obtained permission for the members to smoke so they could con tinue their task As church bells tolled in the sunny afternoon the Senators walked to a small cemetery many of the tomb stones blurred by time be longing to the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church built in 1729 There they laid a wreath on Governor Clintons grave and set out for the Van Gaasbeck house which was sacked along with the rest of the city by the British in 1777 and later restored and renamed the Senate House The house now

High Court Upholds D.C. Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/22/archives/high-court-upholds-dc-abortion-law-supreme-court-rules-5-to-2-that.html,WASHINGTON April 21 In its first decision on the con stitutionality of antiabortion laws the Supreme Court up held the District of Colum bias abortion statute today by a 5to2 vote The opinion by Justice Hugo L Black held that the districts law which is typical of antiabortion statutes in a number of states is not un constitutionally vague However Justice Black de clined to rule on the further question of whether all anti abortion laws violated womens constitutional right of privacy by denying them the right to decide whether or not to con tinue an unwanted pregnancy This issue is posed by seven appeals now pending before the Court In some of them state laws were upheld and in others the laws were over turned raising the likelihood that the Supreme Court will quickly agree to hear one or more of the cases to settle the issue In the case decided today Dr Milan Vuitch was indicted under the district law that out laws all abortions except those performed by physicians when the abortions are necessary for the preservation of the mothers life or health The law was declared un constitutional and the Vuitch indictment was thrown out by Federal District Judge Gerhard A Gesell son of Dr Arnold Gesell the noted pediatrician Judge Gesell found that the law was so vague that a physi cian would not know if he was committing a crime when he performed an abortion be cause a jury might later dis agree with his opinion that the mothers health required it He said that the doctors problem was particularly acute because the burden was on them to prove that the abortion was justified The Justice Department ap pealed to the Supreme Court charging that Dr Vuitch oper ated an abortion mill and performed abortions for any woman who desired one with out considering the womans health Justice Blacks opinion al though reversing Judge Gesell Interpreted the district law to give physicians here considera ble latitude to perform legal abortions He declared that in future abortion prosecutions the Government must bear the burden of proving that the mothers health was not endan gered Moreover in considering a womans health doctors may consider psychological as well as physical wellbeing even if the woman has no previous history of mental defects This interpretation was taken to be so permissive by Pre term an abortion clinic that opened here after the Gesell decision that its officials an nounced this afternoon that the clinic would continue to per form abortions Chief Justice Warren E Burger and Justices Harry A Blackmun John M Harlan and Byron R White joined the ma jority opinion Justice Potter Stewart dissected saying that if a licensed physician per formed an abortion the law should accept that the patients health required it In another dissent Justice William O Douglas agreed with Judge Gesell that the law was uncon stitutionally vague Justices William J Brennan Jr and Thurgood Marshall ex pressed no view because they felt that the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case upon direct appeal from a district court without a rul ing from the United States Court of Appeals for the Dis trict of Columbia Samuel Huntington of the Solicitor Generals Office argued for the Government Joseph L Nellis of Washington and Nor man Drosen of New York argued for Dr Vuitch In a 5to4 ruling today the Court interpreted the refugee provisions of the immigration laws to permit the Government to deny permanent entry to persons who have fled Commu nist countries if they settled temporarily in another country on the way The ruling was supported by Justices Black Burger Blackmun Harlan and White Justices Stewart Douglas Bren nan and Marshal dissented The Court also upheld 6 to 3 a Selective Service regula tion that blocks a draftee from making a conscientious objec tor application after he has been told to report for induc tion The majority opinion by Justice Stewart noted that men could apply for CO dis charges after induction Jus tices Brennan Marshall and Douglas dissented
Albany's Welfare Warfare,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/22/archives/albanys-welfare-warfare.html,Across the whole desolate legislative battlefield Albany stark and shocking as it is no other program has suffered quite so much damage as the welfare pro gram Welfare has been a favorite target in this bitter year of budgetary retrenchment The most reactionary elements within the State Legislature have hoisted the banner of welfare reform and enacted a legion distinctly nonreform measures  Understandably angry at rising welfare rolls and ris ing welfare costs which siphon away desperately needed tax revenues the State Legislature has almost entirely neglected to do those things which it ought to do and instead has broadly slashed benefits to New York recipi ents by 10 per cent The effect of the cut actually goes deeper The Legislature rejected a request for a modest 72 per cent increase in benefit levels to bring recipients in line with the cost of living last year it was not even asked to raise the levels by an additional 8 per cent which would have reflected the cost of living for the current year Thus the effective reduction in levels not 10 per cent but 25 per centand the cost of living continues its merciless climb Can anyone eat on 1 a day This was the old level of benefits Can anyone eat on ninety cents a day Those on welfare will be forced to try There was an alternative course open to the Legisla ture A careful sifting of those on welfare could have eliminated the less needy from the rolls and made ade quate provision for the more needy Because welfare related to poverty and poverty all too often is related to excessive numbers of unwanted children the state could have begun providing more adequate family plan ning services Every responsible sociological study has shown that the poor beget more children than they really want It is the course of humanity to allow the poor to plan their families in the way that those finan cially better off plan theirs To deny the poor this right is to perpetuate the poverty cycle Recent revisions the administration of the states Medicaid program aimed at limiting a poor womans access to abortions run in exactly the wrong direction To make the government the employer of last resort has merit as an abstract proposition There are public sector jobs in areas of health care and environmental protection which are clearly worthwhile To force mothers of preschool children to accept such jobs however necessitates the provision of day care facilities which the Legislature in imposing this new requirement wholly neglects The Legislature will have time to repair its damage to the welfare program and to move in more positive ways toward a solution to the welfare problem in the remaining weeks before adjournment It will have the chance Time and chance however will probably prove no match for the juggernaut mood Governor Rockefeller seems determined to have still more regressive legislation put onto the books Although only about 1 per cent of those on welfare come onto the rolls during their first year in the state he is insist ing on a residency requirement that at best could have but small impact on the rolls if upheld by a Supreme Court which has specifically outlawed such restrictions in the past
City Hospitals Struggle With Nursing Shortage,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/23/archives/city-hospitals-struggle-with-nursing-shortage-city-hospitals.html,Several children in the South Bronx were hospital ized recently with possible brain damage because they ate lead paint from the walls of their slum apartments But because there was only one nurse foe their 40bed ward the children unattended ate the same kind of paint from the walls of Lincoln Hospital Nurses at Lincoln tell this story or similar ones to point out the effects of a nursing shortage on patient care in the citys 18 municipal hos pitals During tours of two of thesethe Hospital Center in Elmhurst a middleclass section of Queens and Lin coln serving a poor area of 400000 people in the South Bronx  nurses said patients often received minimal and sometimes negligent care It Can Happen There Nurses at the two hospitals said that they had not seen any patients die because no one was available but that it could happen The Society of Urban Physicians and the Committee of Internes and Residents have reported such deaths Hospital officials who de clare that nurses in the mu nicipal hospitals are among the best in New York say that they just have more work than they can do A nurse at Elmhurst where two nurses were as signed to a ward of 33 pa tients half of them critically illsaid Lets face it If Im working on a cardiac arrest and another patient has the misfortune to fall out of bed and possibly break something Im not going to stop and go down the hall and help him The city has 4480 nurses and needs at least 6000 ac cording to the Health and Hospitals Corporation which took over administration of the city hospitals last July 1 Recruiting attracted 1400 nurses to the cityrun hos pitals last year but 1200 of them left before working a full year according to Layh mond Robinson a spokesman for the hospitals corporation Some left to get married or for other personal reasons but most cited working con ditions saying that they could not give patients enough care and had to per form menial tasks Elmhurst is a 1008bed in stitution with an average daily bedpatient census of 876 and according to a March survey done by the corporation 187 nurses care for these patients There are 242 nurses working in the hospital in all its facilities The minimum need is put at 295 Lincoln has fewer than half the nurses it needs It has 385 beds and averages 330 bed patients a day They are cared for by 51 nurses The hospital needs at least 124 Voluntary private non profit hospitals here general ly have more nurses than the municipal institutions For in stance Mount Sinai has 1200 beds and 540 of the 614 nurses it needs and Monte fiore in the Bronx has 709 for its 1093 beds not includ ing 39 operatingroom nurses No Personal Touch Because city hospital nurs es have no time for tradi tional bedside nursing a pa tients stay often is as im personal as riding a subway It makes me feel terrible said Estelle Richman a pedi atrics nurse at Lincoln who works with two aides on a 40bed childrens surgical ward We have no time to give physical care here like holding the babies At Elmhurst one of the nurses said that when they cannot watch heart monitors closely to determine a change in a critically ill pa tients heartbeat a room mate of the patient will come down the hall and tell us something doesnt look right In Elmhurst recently a pa tient lay calling weakly for a nurse as his solution of dex trose and saline dripped onto the floor because the intra venousfeeding bottle had come loose Down the hall another pa tients bottle was empty for a half hour before a nurse was free to refill it Dr Stuart Koblenz asso ciate executive director at Elmhurst said he did not be lieve the nurses there were overwhelmed by the work even though working on crowded wards was diffi cult He said that it was not usual for a patient to be left for long with an intra venousfeeding bottle dis lodged nor for wards to be left without a registered nurse on duty He also said patients with heart monitors were checked frequently by nurses The monitors he said are equipped with a light and a buzzer that signal whenever there is an irregularlity At Lincoln Hospital Mrs Eunice Baskettsupervising three maternity wards of 16 beds each on three different floors with one nursesaid she believed nurses no long er want to work as hard as they used to Role of Nursing Schools A graduate of Lincolns nursing schoolsince dis continuedMrs Baskett said she believed nurses would feel stronger ties to the hos pital if there was still a nurs ing school affiliated with it For the first time the hos pitals corporation in addi tion to an intensive recruit ment program that reaches as far away as Europe for nurses41as begun a program to retain the nurses it already has To hold some of the nurses who come seeking a career in the municipal hospitals a campaign was begun to make staying more attractive A special task force within the corporation headed by Mr Robinson was set up in De cember to develop programs with that goal The corporation he said will ask for money in its next fiscal budget to build good inexpensive housing for nurses near the hospitals where they work provide money for taxi fares or chauf feur fees for those who must travel through high  crime areas to and from work and get enough money to pay decent wages and provide decent working conditions Municipal salaries com pare favorably with those of nurses in voluntary hospitals according to Eileen McCaul assistant executive director of the New York State Nurses Association The beginning salary for a staff nurse at Mount Sinai she said is 9890 a year and for a mu nicipal nurse 9500 Mr Robinson said the cor poration recognized that pro viding modern pleasant places to work was essential in holding nurses After years of delays he said a new Lin coln Hospital that will cost 120million has begun and should be completed in three years It will be on Morris Avenue between 144th and 149th Streets A committee also has been set up to establish what tasks nurses should do They com plain that they have to serve and pick up trays remove trash and do other jobs that should be handled by auxili ary help There has always been a shortage of nurses in the city hospitals but the care of pa tients has become critically affected in recent years be cause more services are re quired now The demand for new serv ices has outstripped the abili ty of hospitals to hire and keep enough nurses Hospi tals accomodating the spe cial needs of the communi ties they serve now provide narcotics detoxification units abortion clinics and special facilities for detecting and treating lead poisoning and sicklecell anemia Both Lincoln and Elmhurst have added practical nurses to compensate for the short age of registered nurses but Miss McCaul said Practical nurses are very good and the backbone of many hospitals but they do not have the thorough knowledge of a registered nurse The shortage has grown so acute that some doctors per form nursing duties At Lin coln some of them have act ed as scrub nurses in surgery when no one else is avail able Doctors Pitch In Dr Alan Charney working the adult emergency ward at Lincoln pointed to medica tions in the physicians sta tion there that should be ad ministered by a nurse but in stead are given by physicians Dr Asher Rosenberg was monitoring the blood pres sure of a critically ill boya nurses job He said he had also changed diapers and fed babies to help nurses who were overburdened on the pediatrics ward Nearby a monthold baby lay very ill with diarrhea which in babies can cause death from dehydration A nurse should have been avail able to make frequent checks on the baby but Marian Sheppard the afternoon supervising nurse said that because there was only one nurse on the 40bed floor anybody who can looks in on the baby Parents have taken to coming into the pediatric surgical ward at Lincoln dur ing visiting hours to feed their children and change diapers said Estelle Rich man a nurse Miss Richman is one of several registered nurses at the hospital who first was a practical nurse She was asked why she came back to Lincoln after seeing the pressures there and watching young nurses arrive only to leave within the year She replied I thought I could help

Education,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/25/archives/what-they-want-to-rap-about-are-adult-problems-youth.html,ESTES PARK ColoAmer ica spends much time and en ergy analyzing its youth but during the White House Con terence on Youth here last week youth was more inter ested in analyzing America  What emerged from the conference was a picture of young Americans that dif fered considerably from the general conception While the delegates dealt to some extent with such closeto home subjects as education grid family they were more Concerned with war racism poverty ecology the econ Only and the problem of ad usting to existing institu tions The discussions showed that youth as a whole is far less conservativefar more in agreement with the acti vist collegiansthan conser Vative adults tend to claim and believe Not Separate Because the youth dele gates were less concerned with their own affairs than with their countrys direction the conference really was a nieeting of rather than on youth Tt also raised serious doubts about the proposition that youth is as separate an interest group as legend and sociology often make it ap pear There was wide agree ment betvveen the young peo ple and their more expert elders at the conference It was an open secret that emote Estes Park high in the Rockies was selected as the conference site to avoid Confrontations in Washing ton One planner of the meet ings said privately that be cause President Nixon reacts so stubbornly against any mass demonstrations the best hope of making the conference recommendations count was to avoid such provocations In addition the youth dele gateswho comprised 900 of the total 1400were select ed to represent a far broader spectrum of opinion than that of the typically collegiate groups The racial minorities many from ghetto or poverty areas accounted for 30 per cent of the delegates high school and junior high school students some with 4H or Scout connections 85 per cent collegians 21 per cent and members of the armed services 45 per cent Nearly half of all delegates were either working youths or looking for work These statistics would sug gest that the assembly rep resented Mr Nixons Silent Majority rather than the campuses vocal activists But this proved to be a mislead ing expectation These are some of the key observations and impressions that emerged The groups were inde pendent and unpredictable During the opening session when two young activists took the microphone from conference director Stephen Hess and attempted to lead revolt against the manage ments procedures they were defeated by a crushing voice vote Nevertheless the dele gates took the libehl and even the radical position on many issues such as wel fare ecology population con trol and the Vietnam war But except for the war the anti Establishment voices usually were those of the poor A hastily convened cau cus on Indochina drew an au dience of about 500 with 315 youth delegates In informal balloting they voted over whelmingly for a variety of plans for United States with drawal by no later than 1971 Only 31 per cent supported the Nixon Vietnamization policy The conference as a whole voted overwhelmingly for withdrawal Yet it was also evident that emotions on the war had eased consider ably Lack of confidence In the nations political leadership was as often expressed in Southern drawl and Mid western twang as in Eastern accents The minorities proved ex tremely ambivalent about ra cial pluralism and separatism The task force on race could not agree to proceed with its deliberations without first breaking up into a variety of caucuses  black Mexican American Asian Spanish speaking Euro  American such groups as Italians Poles etc and a predomi nantly white nonethnic cau cus which at one point called itself just plain folks Serious dissent from the permissive position of liber als and radicals concerning drugs was registered by many of the poor and the blacks who see the drug cul ture as a serious threat to their own environment Observers were divided sharply occasionally angrily over the value of such a con ference Those who approved of the concept said that the Nixon Administration could not ig nore at least the most em phatic of the delegates recommendations They be lieved that in some pin pointed area legislative or executive action could be ex pected to follow They were cheered by the impromptu promise during the opening session by Elliott Richard son the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare that he would present the major findings directly to the Presi dent and the Cabinet But other observers ex pressed doubts One youth ful discussion leader on population control including abortion and birth control said Our recommendations will probably fall on deaf ears but lets make sure that well excite those ears Some expressed concern that particularly among the very young these heady dis cussions would raise unrea sonable expectations about the Governments obligation to implement proposals so seriously debated and sub mitted Forget About the Year I dont think anybody scored a victory said Jesse L Jacob president of Newarks Board of Education I say children got kicked in the teeth The state ment symbolized the strong feelings that lingered last week as Newarks 11week teachers strike ended and regular classes resumed The strike the longest ever by teachers in a major American city was set tled when the board and the teachers union accepted a compromise proposal by Mayor Kenneth A Gibson The primary sticking point had been the issue nonprofessional tasks the teachers would be required to perform but to most city residents the dispute grew into a struggle for control of the schools be tween the union and the white community on the one hand and the board and the black community on the other This whole messy business has become a racial fight Mayor Gibson said As for the stu dents one teenager expressed the general resent ment at the educational loss Forget about the classes forget about the Forget There was a tendency to personalize and oversimplify Im white and middleclass said one teenage girl I have problems I cant adjust to school I want to know why I cant make my own curriculum There was little indication that she and most of the delegates in her dis cussion group who agreed with her had a clear idea of what kind of curriculum she would create A more fundamental limi tation was that the discus sions rather than leading to original ideas tended to re flect political discussion and social strategies in the coun try at large but often with incomplete factual informa tion This often led to well intentioned but vague gen eralizations For example an education group of the poverty task force kept shuttling between enthusiastic support for com munity control of the schools and its inability to determine what this really means and where it might or ought to lead With the exception of wide spread antiwar sentiment it was only on rare occasions that hard action positions emerged This was the case only when real experts took the lead as in a condemna tion of strip mining and in an urgent demand for sum mer jobs for youths At best the White House Conference under present conditions of fragmentation and widespread doubts about national priorities was a cumbersome instrument The delegates themselves are not likely to form any judgment of its success until they learn what the Administration can and will do with their views Until then it will he impos sible to tell whether the out come is to be one of satisfac tion or frustration

Lor na Feinstein and Philip Sarrel were teenagers growing up next door to each other in Belle Harbor Queen N Y they would often spend their summer afternoons reading the Kinsey reports to each other  There were no adolescent giggles or blushes as they read The couple especially Philip son of a gynecologist were seriously interested in the reports findings Today the two are married and the parents of two small children Dr Sarrel 34 is a gynecologist like his father and Mrs Sarrel 32 is a psychiatrist social workers And for the last two years they have been running Yales pioneering Sex Counseling Service which Dr Sarrel says is the only one of its kind in the country We think of our service as preventive medicine Dr Sarrel a husky darkhaired man said recently in his office at the YaleNew Haven Medical Center We elimi nate a lot of lifelong traumas in terms of sex when people come to us with their prob lems at an early age The Sarrels who have been called The Masters and Johnson of Yale see pa tients in a small unmarked room on the third floor of the Department of University Health building Mrs Sarrel sits behind a desk while her whitecoated husband sits on a chair behind her Bath face the patient Working on Mondays and Wednesdays the Sarrels schedule about 35 appoint ments a week and are booked  two months in advance So far they have seen about 600 of the 800 undergraduate women and about 150 under graduate men Yale has 4200 undergraduate stu dents toward whom the pro gram is aimed Dr Sarrel said that recently many student couples  most of them unmarried  had been coming for the free counsel ing The most common request Mrs Sarrel said comes from women students seeking con traception The Pill is still the most popular method she said followed by the dia phragm and the intrauterine device IUD The questions the students ask the Sarrels said are often extremely candid deal ing with orgasm masturba tion impotence painful inter course and whether or not the student should engage in intercourse The Sarrels who will spend the month of August studying with Dr William Masters and Virginia John son in St Louis told of an engaged couple they had counseled who were nervous about getting married be cause the man was impotent He felt guilty about pre marital intercourse Mrs Sarrel a slender longhaired brunette said He had the feeling of having forced his fiance into a situation she didnt want We saw them six times and they finally de cided to go ahead with the wedding Theyve had several followup sessions since their honeymoon and everything is fine Range of Knowledge The Sarrels estimate that about half the students at Yale have had sexual inter course They said the stu dents they have seen for sex counseling range from very sophisticated about sex to abysmally ignorant Dr Sarrel said he had first become interested in sex counseling in 1963 when on the first night of his resi dency at YaleNew Haven Medical Center he saw a 10 yearold girl give birth to a dead baby Since then he has been associated with teenage pregnancy programs and set up courses in human sex uality that are taught at sev eral Eastern colleges includ ing Yale Brown Mount Holyoke Smith and Amherst He was also the supervisor of a candid 64page booklet Sex and the Yale Student which was given to all Yale students at the beginning of the school year At such New Yorkarea as Columbia New York Uni versify and Hofstra students can get help with sex prob lems from the regular stu dent counseling service But none of these colleges have services that deal specifical ly with sex problems] The Sex Counseling Serv ice was begun in the fall of 1969 Mrs Sarrel said be cause that was when Yale first started admitting women and the officials had fanta sies that all the young girls descending on campus would get pregnant That didnt happen of course and Dr Sarrel credits the Sex Counseling Service for helping to keep the preg nancy rate low on the Yale campus Weve almost eliminated the practice of abortion be cause weve had so few preg nancies he said declining to reveal the number of preg nancies this year Just say theres been a handful and I mean that literally he said Dr Sarrel said that women students who do become pregnant and want abortions usually get them at either the YaleNew Haven Medical Center on in New York by arrangement through New Havens Counseling Service for Problem Pregnancy If done at the Yale hos pital he said the patient be cause of the Connecticut state law must see a psychiatrist and obtain permission from a hospital committee Her cost he said would be about 300 to 400 more than if the abortion were performed in New York Dr Sarrel also prescribes the high estrogen morning after pill as an emergency measure for women who have had intercourse without con traceptive protection The pill which can be taken within three to five days after inter course is available only by special appointment at the Department of University Health Venereal disease which is a major problem among the young in many parts of the country is virtually nonexis tent at Yale Mrs Sarrel said Most of the kids are in a onetoone relationship she explained and the number of college men who see prostitute any more is zilch Womens Liberation Impact The womens liberation movement Dr Sarrel said has had a definite impact on the sex lives of the studerlts He said that the movement had made it easier for woman to have a relationship with another woman and that as a result more women students were into bisexual ity He said that also as a result of the womens movement students were discussing whether is was possible for a man to maintain a lifelong friendship with a woman and hot go to bed with her The girls feel it can be done Dr Sarrel said and the guys dont find it so easy Some of the Sarrelsother patients have expressed fears of homosexuality or asexual ity Two women came for counseling after they had been raped So far no one has inquired about group sex during a session Mrs Sarrel said but some students have asked us about it in public The couple have also seen many students who felt that they werent ready for inter course or couldnt make up their minds We just sit back and lis ten Dr Sarrel said They usually tell us what they want to do If they ask us we usually say Its just as OK not to have it

Science/Medicine,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/02/archives/the-fear-that-birth-control-may-mean-genocide-population.html,Concern over the worlds population explosion and the attendant dissemination of birth control devices and the liberalization of abortion laws have had their effects in the United States a marked decline in the birth rate But they have also spawned a growing contro versy over the implications of the zeropopulationgrowth movement for racial and ethnic minorities within the nation Traditional opposition to birth control measures of course has come from the Roman Catholic Church on moral grounds The new op ponents base their dissent on political and cultural grounds The position has been artic ulated most openly by Jews and Negroes Since many Jews have been active in the zero pop ulation growth movement observers have been partic ularly struck by the dissent ing views voiced in a recent issue of the magazine Com mentary In a lead article by Milton Himmelfarb and in a column by editor Norman Podhoretz the magazine asks in effect whether American Jews are not going to elim inate themselves as an im portant force in the society by their enthusiasm for pop ulation control The Arguments It has been argued that the birth rate among Jews is lower than that for most other groups and that any lessening would further de crease the relative size of the group in the society The statistical evidence for such conclusions however is in complete there are for ex ample no comprehensive census statistics on the trend over time of births deaths and contraceptive use among Jews The opposition to zero population growth among Ne groes has been more wide spread At the extreme militants charge that efforts to per suade black women to use contraceptives or to have abortions  where they are legally availableare really aimed at achieving black genocide A recent report by a black researcher Dr William A Darity of Amherst Mass suggests that these sentiments have large support in the Negro community In one New England city Dr Dar ity found that 88 per cent of the black males under 30 were opposed to abortion and almost half of them felt that encouragement of the use of birth control methods is comparable to trying to elim inate [blacks] from society Additionally some black nationalists have argued that it is important for the black population of this country to grow more rapidly than the white population so that Negroes can gain increasing ly more political power The more people the more pow er they proclaim In the case of nonwhite citizens the great majority of whom are Negroes there is a wealth of population and birth data particularly from a special Census Bureau study released last month The statisticians report that this countrys black pop ulation is actually growing rapidly both absolutely and relative to whites Between 1950 and 1970 the number of Negroes in this country increased by 50 per cent from 15 million to 227 million persons while the white popu lation increased by less than onethird Two factors explain the difference in growth One is the higher birth rate for non whites Over most of the past 20 years the nonwhite birth rate in this country has usu ally been 40 to 50 per cent higher than the white birth rate This marked difference has persisted even over the past decade when the birth rates of both groups have declined appreciably The second factor is the rapid decline in the non white death rate since 1950 Over the past 20 years that rate has fallen about 15 per cent and has reached rough ly the same level as the white death rate which has remained almost constant Last December in fact the nonwhite death rate was slightly below the white death rate One significant result of these trends is the increased percentage of nonwhites among the nations youngest citizens For the country as a whole one person out of eight is nonwhite but among Americans under five about one child in six is now non white By census definition it is worth noting the white category includes Americans of Spanish originprimarily Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans  whose social economic and demographic characteristics resemble those of blacks more closely than those of the descendants of European immigrants Aside from Negroes the non white category includes In dians Chinese Japanese and Hawaiians A census calculation pub lished two years ago sug gests that if recent trends continue they could produce further appreciable changes in the mix of the American population Census statisti cians calculated what they call the intrinsic rate of natural increase This is an attempt to make white and nonwhite rates of popula tion growth fully comparable by allowing for the differ ences in the age patterns of mothers and in the age pat terns of deaths On this corrected basis if 1967 trends were to continue for a substantial period of time the white population would grow on the average by 56 persons per 1000 women annually and the non white population by 182 persons per 1000 women annually or three times as rapidly Such calculations are pure exercises in theory of course for trends can and do change Thus some statisticians ar gue that as nonwhites rise in the economic scale and be come better educated their birth rates tend to fall in the same manner that birth rates of whites have declined Demographers have stubbed their toes so often with pre dictions that have turned out to be wrong that they are reluctant now to make rigid forecasts for the future even as regards total American population growth let alone its components

The Right to Breed,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/06/archives/the-right-to-breed-freedom-to-procreate-equals-freedom-to-starve.html,SANTA BARBARA CalifIs it wise to maintain that the decision with regard to the size of the family must irrevocably rest with the family itself Thats what the United Nations says We would like to believe it Having given up so many freedoms already it is natural to resist giving up this additional one the freedom to breed We remember Nazi Germany we fear 1984  Unfortunately logic and experience show that continuing to support the right to breed is suicidal The space ship we call Earth is already over populated We suffocate in our own waste products We need to have Zero Population Growth now better yet we should have a negative rate of growth for a while if we are to improve the quality of life Actually not a single nation in the world has yet attained ZPG Why not The answer is simple Overpopulation is a national or global concept but the decision to use or not to use birth control is made by the individual woman on the basis of forces impinging on her personal life Does any woman ask What does my nation need before she takes the Pill And if one woman does what about the multitudes who dont Birth control is not population con trol it is merely the means whereby a woman can have the number of chil dren she wants If she wants too many a perfect system of birth con trol enables her to produce too many Everywhere in the world the average woman wants more than the ZPG num ber In the United States this number is now about 21 children per woman but the average woman wants about 28 Population control is impossible so long as there is freedom to breed World population is now doubling every 35 years During the 50000 years before AD 1650 the doubling period was 5800 yearsalmost ZPG conditions How was this relative sta bility maintained Partly as everybody knows by the cruel negative feedback controls of starvation disease and war but only partly Family planning also played a role though it wasnt called that Contraception was not as good as it is now but it helped When contracep tion failed a woman might resort to abortion even though it was rather dangerous under primitive conditions If abortion did not solve the planning problem there was always infanticide to fall back on It was easy to pass off infant deaths as accidents when babies were born in the home Most people think that the practice of infanticide is confined to savages This is not true The Harvard historian William L Langer has conclusively shown that infanticide was an im portant means of family planning in Europe all through the 19th century extending even into the 20th Why were nominally Christian fam ilies willing to use such drastic means The answer is blunt because they were fully responsible for the care of their children If a poor couple had too many children when hard times came some of the children had to die Until recently charity was only a minor hobby of the rich and had little effect The community was willing to let ex cess children starve to death Poor parents knew this They had the power to control their own breeding and they were fully responsible for their decisions Power and responsibility were joined The result was population control In the 19th century all this began to change with the growth of the idea of the welfare state Men came to be lieve that it was a disgrace for a com munity to allow its children to starve to death If the parents could not take care of the children the community would not well perhaps but well enough to keep them alive and adding to the population problemand well enough to make the offspring resentful when they grew up What are we to do We have only two options We can go back to the world of two hundred years ago eliminating the welfare state and mak ing the family once more fully respon sibe for its breeding decisions Popula tion control can be achieved in this waybut only if we can with equa nimity watch children starve If we are unwilling to go back then we must go forward and bring power and responsibility together in a new locus in the community itself If the community has the responsibility of keeping children alive it must also have the power to decide when they may be procreated Only so can we save ourselves from the degradation of runaway population growth It is not a question of freedom vs nonfreedom If we defend the freedom to breed we shall ultimately lose all other freedoms as a result of unbear able overcrowding By denying the right of individuals to breed without limit we can at least make it possible to preserve other freedoms that may on examination be deemed more precious than the freedom to breed

rather than talent indeed his first interest is still the theater rather than writing prose  As a boy in the Depression he grew up on a grimly unprofitable dairy farm the fifth of 13 children in the cold Mohawk country along the CanadianNew York boundary His biting picture of the misery of oldfashioned country life in the Northeast  a life so rough that much of the rest of the nation was settled by people fleeing from itis a good reminder in this day of communes and summer retreats and gentlemanly farms He tells us too what we havent heard lately that big families are tough to come from emotionally he jettisoned his brothers and sisters With a brother or two in prison his father a suicide his mother insane he ran away to New York City and lived in the Brace Memorial Newsboys Home a refuge for runaways near the Brooklyn Bridge and the Bowery Again what he offers is not the usual Oliver Twist lambasting lost children receive in books but an unfashionable account of kindness on almost every hand where he had a chance to make a new start He saw the windup of World War II and about the Army he says what most of us who have been in uniform know but dont say that years in the service used to be generally fun and not to be missed except for good reason Later scrambling about Broadway to auditions and rehearsal halls he scrimped and was loyal and comradely to wife and friends until the inevitable divorce from his actress wife whereupon he abandoned the theater for a while lay low stacking books in the public library helped as at all of the other crash points of his life by motherly spinsters with white in their hair Marrying a more conventional woman who gave new support to his life he achieved some success for a decade managed publicity at Alfred A Knopf and reports on Byzantine office bitcheries there  a position from which he resigned to write plays and this book When writing about more familiar territory he finds a stylistic ease that the nightmare of his boyhood doesnt evoke He has had a great deal of trouble even remembering those years and sometimes sounds like a fellow from Health Education and Welfare testifying on conditions up North One reason for the indirect tone is that he managed to hide from any sense of emergency about his plight at the time by burying himself in books behind the wood stove and in a movie fanship of the most intense kind Until he was 30 years old he kept up a card file that was to contain the cast of every movie and play going back to 1900 Year after year he struggled to educate himself learning first by watching the movie queens then from classic literature As a dreamer not one of our modern survivalists his attitudes tend to be pleasingly uncontemporary He uses the word vulgarity with confidence for instance and has eschewed psychiatric explanations entirely What he has written in this crowded chronicle resembles Dreiser novel despite the confessional form Along with the poverty yearnings surmountable setbacks roamingthestreets go the spiritual ups and downs of The Genius say And Lemay the man refusing to make it big stepped aside offish true to his private aims Now naturally one doesnt expect to have all this set down with the primeval density and momentum of Dreiser himself nor ask of a person who tells us about his unpublished novels and unproduced plays an Exley or Conroytype brilliance But remarkably for a playwright Mr Lemay never sets any scenes never records an extended relationship He mentions who his friends were including some formal tributes but otherwise its just thumbnail synopses and summaries  usually a person receives only a single flying phrase  until he pauses upon the occasion of the breakup of his first marriage and reaches the publishing world The prose always in plurals reads like this Distraught girls requiring abortions showed up in hysterics at the apartment door and we calmed them down before initiating the series of underground phone calls that got them to doctors in Pennsylvania or New Jersey Romantic crises burglaries suicide attempts and assaults on homosexuals sent us to hospital wards police stations and in several cases funeral parlors Inside Looking Out is a book that one wants to like its failures are those of omission  he attempts too little One never disbelieves him and its rather a pleasure to read a book that is not hallucinatory nowadays Notwithstanding the skimpy uninflected style he gradually piles up an account that is absorbing like a man from Alcoholics Anonymous perhaps It is a story of suffering drained of suffering but so honest voluminous and modest that the life in it overrides the oblique approach and finally speaks for itself

Catholic Church Challenged in Ireland,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/09/archives/catholic-church-challenged-in-ireland.html,DUBLIN May 8  The Roman Catholic Church in Ireland one of the most conservative bastions of the Catholic world is coming under increased attack from both within and without On issues of sexual and social morality churchstate relations clerical dissent and disaffection of the young the church is facing unaccustomed challenge Some of the controversies are still only ripples But in the millpond of Irish Catholicism they loom like breakers At St Patricks Roman Catholic Cathedral in Armagh Northern Ireland William Cardinal Conway Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland said in an interview Obviously were living in very exciting times Theres a storm in Western civilization and the church is involved in it Things are not all calm and peaceful Emotions Run High But were not embattled I dont feel we have our backs to the wall The opinion of the people is very much on our side Others differ The Rev James Hartin professor at the Protestant Church of Ireland Seminary said Its the greatest crisis in their history and the hierarchy is not handling it very well Theres a great opportunity here for church renewal to keep Ireland Christian he continued But by refusing to trust its own people whose basic loyalty is never in doubt the hierarchy is risking alienation The issue of the hour is contraception All the other great issues confronting the church have been illuminated by the storm Since 1935 the import and sale of contraceptives in Ireland has been a criminal offense However birthcontrol pills have been prescribed for some 25000 Irish women as cycle regulators without prosecution But when a young law lecturer Senator Mary Robinson offered a bill to end the ban wide public controversy ensued The Government was not altogether displeased at the bill Prime Minister John Lynch and others have questioned the states right to impose Catholic moral teachings against contraception on the Protestant minority Moreover in the hope of wooing the Protestant majority of Northern Ireland for eventual reunification of the country Mr Lynch has encouraged debate on the changing of laws that Protestants might find objectionable including the constitutional ban on divorce For Cardinal Conway however the issue was one of sexual morality of opting for the permissive society He said that the dispute was over whether contraceptives should be freely available to teenagers in drugstores Archbishop John C McQuaid of Dublin issued a pastoral letter asserting that lifting the ban would bring a curse upon our country Parishioners at two churches walked out when the letter was read at mass Sixteen priests in an unusual protest for Ireland sent a letter to Dublin newspapers criticizing the preoccupation with contraception at the expense of concern over social ills such as bad housing and the lot of the underprivileged The overwhelmingly Catholic student body at University College Dublin made it clear to the Catholic chaplains there that they favored removal of the ban The hierarchy has reacted to this dissent with silence Conflicts Rare With emotions running high the Government in late March refused to accept introduction of Senator Robinsons bill But it left the impression it might introduce a bill of its own If it does a churchstate battle is inevitable The Irish hierarchy consists of 26 bishops covering all Ireland and is headed by the consensusminded Cardinal Conway A native of the slums of Belfast the amiable 58yearold Cardinal has tried to convey some of the modernizing spirit of the second Vatican Council The mass is sung in English and in Gaelic in some areas Friday fasting has been eased religious orders for women have been modernized and the ban on Catholic attendance at Trinity College which is predominantly Protestant has been lifted Simultaneously some relaxation in hook and film censorship has emerged But the Cardinal is said to be concerned that things are getting out of hand and to outsiders he appears to be becoming more conservative However the archconservative of the hierarchy is 76yearold Archbishop McQuaid of Dublin the undisputed authority in what has been called the Popes most loyal diocese Although he has inspired vast school and welfare programs The Irish Times has called him the very incarnation  of ob scurantism selfrighteousness arrogence and spiritual apartheid Dr McQuaid played a major role in the last great churchstate confrontation the 1951 diSpute over the Governments Mother and Child plan that proposed free state health care for maternity cases and for children up to 16 The church fearing that Catholic teaching on sexual relations chastity and marriage would he eroded openly intervened in opposition The bill was defeated and the Health Minister Dr Noel Browne a psychiatrist resigned Today Dr Browne as a member of the opposition Labor party is a leading church critic Last month he attacked the Catholic Church as being no better than the Protestant Orange Order in Northern Irelanda sectarian and bigoted politically conservative pressure group On the Defense But if Dr Browne is on the attack Archbishop McQuaid is on the defense He shows no sign of retiring while this Government ponders unpalatable change The church gossip in Dublin is that the Pope who has suggested that cardinals retire at 75 has acquiesced in Archbishop McQuaids continuation after that age so that he can fight the serious moral battles ahead The contraception issue is the most dangerous challenge in the eyes of the church hierarchy Any serious efforts to overturn the constitutional ban on divorce or to liberalize abortions appear remote But the hierarchy taking no chances has expressed its disquiet at attempts to sway public opinion An Irish divorce a local cynic said is when the man buys a oneway ticket on the boat to Liverpool Aside from these issues of sexual morality and churchstate relations more radical criticism of the church on grounds of social morality is increasingly heard from Catholic intellectuals At St Patricks College the Roman Catholic seminary at Maynooth a village 16 miles west of Dublin Professor Enda McDonagh is wrestling with issues of group conscience and group morality and expressing leftwing social and economic views that disturb both political and religious conservatives On the role of the church he said Priests have contributed a lot to local life and organization but within a limited social philosophy We dont seem to have any vision of our society to direct our energies toward On the mood of dissent he commented Its the beginning of fermentation but it has to get more intense to bring any great changes It might just peter out What you find here is a Lifeboat Ireland mentality said an Irish writer on religious affairs The feeling is that the worlds gone lost and that only Ireland is left But its really very hard to keep the world out of Dublin

Religion,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/09/archives/religion-womens-lib.html,Theologians may do a lot of talking about the next world but over the centuries their discipline has been strongly influenced by what happens in this one Kings in the Middle Ages justified their authority by religious sanctions Max Weber and other sociologists found a causal connection between the Calvinist ethic of frugality and the rise of capitalism Some historians have even asserted that the imperative in Genesis to assert dominion over the natural world has helped cause the current environmental crisis Now Christian theologys tics to sociology and economics are under attack from new quarter  the womens liberation movement In recent months a small number of women theologians has begun to argue that Christianity with its concept of God the Father has helped create and perpetuate social practices that discriminate against women The church has served to legitimize a patriarchal culture said Dr Mary Daly a theologian at Jesuitrun Boston College last week Its time to rework the basic myths and symbols of theology in light of the new awareness of how women have been exploited The feminist attack on Christian orthodoxy focuses on three areas The Masculine Godhead Genesis says that God created man in His own image and as male and female Nevertheless God has usually been portrayed as a man referred to with masculine pronouns and thought of as possessing masculine qualities like sternness Christians furthered the process by asserting that God became human in the person of a male Ethical Hypocrisy According to the feminist theologians Christian leaders develOped an ethics based on passive virtues like humility and obedience but then used them as a means of subduing the other sex While exhorting others chiefly women to practice Christian virtues they have themselves pursued power creativity and selffulfillment on levels far removed from obedience selfabnegation or for that matter chastity wrote Barbara Sykes in a recent issue Of The Episcopal New Yorker the diocesan newspaper Religious Symbols Feminists maintain that the fundamental symbols of Christianaty are permeated with male alauvinism For instance the story of Adam and Eve blames women for the presence of sin in the world Catholics complain that the figure of Mary has been idealized into a sexless projection of male vanities and that the usual picture of her kneeling before her Son is an affront to the role God intended for women There are still probably only a few dozen woman theologians and graduate students in theology in the United States but they have already begun the task of demasculinizing their discipline The obvious starting point has been to introduce female qualities to the concept of God in the manner that Christian Scientists have done for decades with their belief in a FatherMother God In a recent article in America magazine Esther Woo doctoral student at Fordham University speculated on the possibility of feminizing the Godheadincluding the essential nature of the male Jesusand creating a new Trinity of Mother Daughter and Holy Spirit She argued To pray to a MotherGod would be different from praying to a FatherGod There would be more trust in the efficacy of prayer if God is our Mother rather than our Father At a recent Episcopaliansponsored conference here Penelope Chen a British graduate student took a similar approach How much better to conceive of God the creator as pregnant with the world giving birth to it and nourishing it rather than as the divine watchmaker who never has to intervene in the machinery she said Female theologians are consciously seeking to play down the masculinity of Jesus and emphasize his universal qualities Its not the maleness of Christ that was important it was his humanity said Dr Elizabeth Farians whose PhD is from Notre Dame In accordance with this women theologians generally back the current trend toward thinking of Holy Communion primarily as a communal meal rather than as reenactment of the sacrifice of Christ for the sins of mankind The latter interpretation they charge gives too much symbolic significance to a male figure Finally feminist theologians are attempting to bring the womens point of view to bear on ethical thinking For example on the issue of abortion Dr Daly complained that Roman Catholic bishops and male theologians begin with masculine questions like the rights of the fetus Women start with different questions she said like How do you justify unwanted repeated and harmful pregnancies or What are the rights of other children  Likewise Dr Daly added church tolerance of war is rooted in masculine values like fighting and valor Only a male orientation would keep us in Vietnam because we dont want to look like were running away she said Although womenslib theology is still in the early stage of development it has already begun to draw some fire from male scholars James Hitchcock a specialist in Reformation history at St Louis University has charged that like black theology it is essentially an attempt to redefine theological terms and categories to serve political ends
". . . Or, Has Andy Warhol Spoiled Success?",https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/09/archives/-or-has-andy-warhol-spoiled-success.html,IT was a gas In Pasadena a panache in Paris and terrific at Londons Tate Now after a triumphal fourstar tour of world art capitals like it says in the press release Andy Warhols peripatetic Popshow has slipped into town for its final appearance at the Whitney Museum There generating nostalgia like a bunch of old TV reruns are the fruits of a decades labor going back to 1961  the Brillo boxes the soup can and flower paintings the portraits of Jackie Ethel Marilyn and the disasters explosions car crashes electric chairs  that rocketed Andy to sixties superstardom Art You can hardly see the works for the wallpaper the cows head wallpaper he did in 1966  with which the Whitneys fourthfloor gallery is plastered But thats the backdrop the artist wants We fixed it like this so people could catch the show in a minute and leave said he looking like an Andy Warhol doll in his corduroy jeans sweater and straw hair Its oldfashioned it really is Now that youve seen it lets go across the street to Schraffts Even though Warhols been out of Art and into Cinema for some time he still keeps in touch with the Scene I think everyones doing such great work now he said sipping a straight vodka at Schraffts for whom he once did an ice cream commercial Well like who Girl artists for instance Theyre really doing big things At the last Whitney Annual it was the first time you couldnt tell their work from mens In fact as it turns out Andy and his fellow hands at the Factory the downtown kibbutz that serves as headquarters for Warhol Films take a kindly view of Womens Lib We are for equal pay clay care centers free abortions announced Fred Hughes Andys business manager sitting across the table And lipstick for both men and women added Andy Musing over the decade Andy revealed that Fame which pursued him until he overtook it has not made all that difference Even if youre on TV and your pic tures on a magazine cover no one cares the next day he said insightfully I still do the same things I always did But visiting his show here and there on its tour he admits the most exciting thing that happened was hearing a stranger on a plane talk about having seen it at the Tate He went on for about 20 minutes It gets so you dont quite believe it Back home of course there are other adventures Last week Pork the first stage drama authored by Andy opened at the La Mama Experimental Theater And the next Warhol film following hard on Trash the smash produced by Andy and directed by Paul Morrissey will soon be released Its something called Politically Involved Girls or maybe Blonde on a Bum Trip the title is still up in the air starring three drag queensHolly Woodlawn Candy Darling and Jackie Curtis I dont know what its about Andy said They talk a lot I like to use actors who talk a lot What Id really like to do is go back and shoot movies for 300 and still make them entertaining BOOBY TAX Heaven knows what the aluminum sculpture that adorns the facade of the ParkeBernet building at 77th and Madison Avenue really means An art mademe work done by academician Wheeler Williams in 1949 and improbably titled Venus and Manhattan it depicts a nearly naked female figure poised above an equally nude recumbent male The suggestion has been made that she is the spirit of the auction market prevailing over the rival collective body of New York dealers Whatever the interpretation it periodically comes to light that the work is subject to a special tax or license fee collected by the city from the buildings owner Why Because the bare bosom of Venus projects no less than 24 beyond the building line while Manhattans ear sticks out 36 each a good deal over the allowable protrusion of 18 So every year Peter Sharp  Co the real estate firm which took over the building from City Investing Co in 1969 forks over to the Board of Estimates Bureau of Franchises a fee of 210 a sum which could eventually accrete to well beyond the sculptures original cost of 10000 Wouldnt it be cheaper to remove it Yes but no a Sharp spokesman said recalling the words of Robert W Dowling City Investing president who orginally commissioned the work Every shop should have a sign NEW MAN In the 76 years since its founding the William Hayes Fogg Museum at Harvard better known simply as The Fogg has become one of the countrys most formidable university art centers Traditional training ground for institutional talent its alumni include both museum directors and university art historians a triumph over the customary schism between the two Its most famous teacher of course was the late Paul J Sachs whose museum courses at Harvard sparked a slew of collectors connoisseurs critics and curators Founded In 1895 with a 200000 bequest from Mrs William Hayes Fogg and since expanded considerably the Fogg also possesses one of the worlds foremost academic collections of European and Oriental art  useful treasures that have long done duty as teaching aids to Harvard undergraduates The Fogg way of doing things has crept into museums across the countrylegend even has it that the U S museum habit of hanging pictures low on the wall originated in Sachss short stature In the staid museum trade appointment of a new Fogg director is thus something of an event Since Old Bostonian John Coolidge stepped down in 1968 to devote more time to teaching the post has been held by Agnes Mongan a distinguished editor and specialist in Old Master drawings And now on Miss Mongans retirement as director this summer she will continue as curator of drawings the job goes to Daniel J Robbins 38yearold director of the Museum of Art of the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence Robbins who made the University of ChicagoYale route is the first nonFogg alumnus to hold the job From RISD to Fogg is a small geographical move the two museums are 40 miles apart but a large career step for Robbins who served here from 19611965 as assistant curator of the Guggenheim Museum Starting at Rhode Island in 1965 he worked up a stir that turned the sleepy little college museum into a public facility whose doings spread the length and breadth of the state and points south At the same time he strengthened the link between academe and the museum both at the famous old design school that hatched it and at nearby Brown University Though the gamut of shows has run from The Renaissance of the 12th Century to The Vintage Racing Machine about 50 per cent of RISDs shows have been contemporary in line with a Robbins feeling that his Rhode Island constituents lacked exposure to contemporary art Its a terrific little place and I hate to leave it he says But who could turn down a bid from the Fogg Though Robbins has as yet no program for the Harvard museum traditionalists need not worry Respect for scholarship and for work of art are two qualities that the Fogg Museum will continue to instill in students he says firmly COLLAGE Erin goes arty this year with ROSC 1971 the countrys second international art exhibition from Oct 24 to

Nixon's Strategy for 1972 Beginning to Take Shape,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/10/archives/nixons-strategy-for-1972-beginning-to-take-shape-nixons-strategy.html,WASHINGTON May 9Without completely doffing the Presidential hat ha pledged to wear after his disappointment at the 1970 elections President Nixon has begun to channel larger amounts of his time and the resources of his staff to the political tests that await him in 1972 And bit by bit the essential ingredients of a strategy designed to win reelection are becoming increasingly clear Publicly Mr Nixon is addressing himself with greater frequency and fanfare to elements of the constituency that carried him to power two years ago but have grown restless with some of the Administrations policies Privately meanwhile a skeleton campaign operation has been established in an office on Pennsylvania Avenue and new faces have been added to the White House staff to help promote the President and his policies while some of his senior people have quietly shifted their energies from the creation of policy to the task of consolidating Mr Nixons grip on the bureaucracy and merchandising the legislative agenda already before Congress The most visible result of all this has been a monthlong campaign to reestablish Mr Nixons credentials with farmers businessmen Southerners advocates of law and order and various ethnic and religious groups This followed an earlier effort to test his appeal in a variety of formal and informal settings on television and radio During the same period by contrast he has devoted less and less energy to attempts to promote his Indochina policy or mollify its critics Five weeks ago in San Clemente Calif where he drafted his most recent troop withdrawal announcement Mr Nixon instructed his speech writer Patrick J Buchanan to keep it short and to the point The result was a far cry from the emotional appeals for national support that marked his earlier words on Vietnam Similarly with the notable exception of a long and unpublicized discussion between 13 Williams College students and N R Haldeman the Presidents chief of staff Mr Nixons advisers made little effort to open their offices to this years crop of youthful antiwar demonstrators as they did after the incursion into Cambodia last year This does not mean that Mr Nixon is any less convinced of the correctness of his course On the contrary his senior aides insisted in a series of interviews he is optimisticand in a sense fatalisticabout the outcome of his withdrawal strategy Pulling the Rug Out They quote him as saying in more than one staff meeting Anyone who tries to make a political issue out of Vietnam in 1972 will have the rug pulled from under him And in any case he is said to believe that any further major efforts to explain his policy would be repetitious or a waste of time or both The fact that after two weeks of ignoring demonstrators he opened his own backyard to a colorful canopied Salute to Agriculture is offered by his staff as a clue to his present sense of political priorities To summarize the Presidents activities and demeanor in the last month is to suggest where he feels he now ought to be directing his energies and also to suggest the outlines of a strategy for 1972 His audiences have been composed of faces he has always found reassuring Republican Governors in Williamsburg the Chamber of Commerce the Daughters of the American Revolution the leaders of the American Farm Bureau Federation in Washington the men of the First Marine Division in San Clemente Both in word and deed meanwhile he has recalled some of the conservative themes of his 1968 campaign a strong defense of free enterprise to the Chamber a tough stance against the legalization of marijuana in his San Clemente news conference When addressing any group on the subject of welfare he has chosen to emphasize the work requirements in his welfare reform program rather than its provisions for a minimum income Over roughly the same period he has resisted the critics of J Edgar Hoover although there is evidence that he will seek a graceful exit for the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation when the criticism dies down He has announced he will review the warcrimes case of First Lieut William L Calley Jr a move defended by his staff as a necessary response to national unrest and condemned by his critics as a political overture to the right wing And less ambiguously he has said he would uphold the Supreme Courts recent decision permitting school busing while refusing comment on its merits Criticism Increasing As for his potential opponents both Democratic and Republican Mr Nixon has authorized increased criticism of Senator Edmund S Muskie Democrat of Maine who has been challenging Mr Hoover while at the same time he has sought to keep harmony in the Republican family and assure himself of an ally in his quest next year for Californias 45 electoral votes by giving Gov Ronald Reagan what some critics think is an excessive amount of time to bring himself into compliance with Federal welfare regulations In the last few weeks too Mr Nixon has taken a strong stand against liberalized abortion laws and has called abortion itself an unacceptable means of population controlhis panel on aid to private schools has made a tentative finding that parochial schools need and deserve vastly increased Federal aid And while there is nothing that resembles a coherent Catholic strategy emerging from the White House there is increasing discussion of ways to tap the Roman Catholic vote and the President himself has long regarded Catholics who make up 23 per cent of the population as a strong source of conservative sentiment Behind the tone and tempo of Mr Nixons activity lies a set of basic political calculations The first is that while Mr Nixon cannot lose points by ending the war and stabilizing the economy he may not win points either in part because the country is not likely to reward the achievement of objectives it has been conditioned to expect anyway The second calculation is that the Democrats remain superior in the industrial Northeast that even New Jersey which Mr Nixon won in 1968 is highly vulnerable to Democratic assault and that the President must therefore make certain that he recaptures the affection of those who carried him to victory two years ago in the South the Border States the Middle West and the West The urgency of Mr Nixons task has been reinforced by the polls which have shown a steady erosion of support even among the faithful Efforts to reverse the trend earlier in the year by exposing Mr Nixon to the public in a variety of newspaper and television interviews failedthe President himself told Barbara Walters of the National Broadcasting Company that there was little he could do about his image Thus the decision was made to focus the Presidents energies on selected groups and issues and that is what he has been doing for the last month In the same period there have also occurred politically suggestive changes in the personality and functions of Mr Nixons palace guard The basic staff structure remains as before with Mr Haldeman the central figure around whom the Presidents other senior advisers on foreign and domestic affairs revolve But changes in and additions to the public relations apparatus provide the evidence of a mounting preoccupation with 1972 The catalyst for these changes was the departure of a young aide Jeb Magruder from the staff of Herbert G Klein the Administrations Director of Communications A Haldeman protdge Mr Magruder was instructed to form an embryonic Citizens Committee to ReElect President Nixon in space a halfblock from the White House and one floor below the Washington offices of the old Nixon law firm Several other aides soon joined Mr Magruder who had been a key figure in Mr Kleins operation and Mr Haldeman instructed Charles Colson a senior political strategist to replenish the public relations staff by bolstering the Klein apparatus Mr Colsons first discovery and appointee was John Scali the former diplomatic correspondent for the American Broadcasting Company Various others have been added to the staff on either a full or parttime basis to advise Mr Nixon how best to use the communications media and reach the public But perhaps the strongest sign of the Presidents belief that the time has arrived for promotion of existing policies as opposed to the invention of new ones is the sudden drop in creative activity in the Domestic Council which formulates policy initiatives for the President under the direction of John D Ehrlichman Many of the interagency subcommittees formed last year to devise policy have fulfilled their functions mainly the creation of the revenuesharing and health proposals and have disbanded And while individual staffers continue to discuss new proposals and initiatives the essential business of the council today is to win Congressional acceptance of the Presidents welfare health end revenuesharing programs an effort conducted by a small group led by Edward Morgan a senior Ehrlichman aide Given the quickening pace of political activity on the part of the President and his aides some observers here believe that the next logical step and final confirmation of Mr Nixons interest in 1972 would be for Attorney General John N Mitchell to leave his post at the Justice Department and assume direction of the campaign Mr Mitchell has reportedly told friends he would prefer to remain at Justice but observers here including those at the Citizens Committee believe that Mr Nixons recent rhetoric is merely a prelude to Mr Mitchells arrival in September to take charge of what is already a serious and sustained effort to retain the White House

Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/10/archives/letter-to-the-editor-1-no-title.html,The decision of the Supreme Court upholding the District of Columbias abortion statute appeared to be a disaster to the efforts now being made to prevent the overpopulation of the world But the situation was saved by the statement that the court would rule on the further question of whether the antiabortion laws violated womens right of privacy The human right of a woman to possess complete freedom and control of her body without limitation by the state or society is inherent in almost every article of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution Every judicial interpretation of these articles relating to the extension of civil rights included the personal rights of the mind and conscience of the individual and therefore extends to the use of a persons body This applies to the right of a woman to use or not to use contraceptives to prevent an unwanted pregnancy By the same token it applies to the womans right to use or not to use an operation to end an unwanted pregnancy Any attempt to regulate or to suppress any of these personal decisions or actions is beyond the jurisdiction of any law as there is no way in which use of these freedoms could harm another person Because of such a fundamental concept as this there is no need for a discussion as to how a law to regulate the use of contraceptives or abortions should be worded There should be no such law This is the foundation the Planned Parenthood League uses to present its thesis The purpose is defined in its name It allows a husband and wife to follow their own moral or religious principles regarding their most personal affairs upon their own consent without imposing a religious or moral creed on others It also means that these methods of birth control may be used only under the auspices of hospital and a physician Perhaps it also means that an adequate measure of the virtue of continence be used by the man as well as by the woman This is the course which our generation can take with intelligence wisdom and spiritual awareness to maintain a population at a level which will be able to support a social order of human welfare and contribute to the wholesomeness of family life The Rev RUSSELL J CLINCHY Princeton N J April 24 1971

Papal Letter Sets as Goal New Democratic Society,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/12/archives/papal-letter-sets-as-goal-a-new-democratic-society-papal-letter.html,ROME May 11In an apos tolic letter scheduled to be made public Friday Pope Paul VI urges Christians to take part in the search for a new kind of democratic society The 12000word document warns Christians not to espouse Marxism and unbridled liberal ism but calls for a pluralism of options for social change under which the same Christian faith may lead to different commitments The far  ranging document also discusses the disparities between rich and poor nations racial discrimination the eman cipation of women youth pro tests urban ills and what the Pope describes as the alienation caused by the consumer society In a short passage Pope Paul restates his condemnation of artificial birth control and abor tion The Popes pronouncements were contained in a letter to Maurice Cardinal Roy the Ca nadian president of the Pontifi cal Commission on Justice and Peace the Vatican body in charge of social reforms and other problems of the modern world The papal document is to be released officially in the Vatican on Friday Advance copies were sent to Roman Catholic bishops conferences in various coun tries during the last few days One such copy in one of the churchs major languages was made available today by source that did not want to be identified The document was described by an expert as a major social encyclical in all but its outward form An encyclical or papal circular letter is directed to the hierarchy at large whereas an apostolic letter is addressed to an individual or a group A theologian here explained that both encyclicals and apos tolic letters were expressions of the papal teaching office or magisterium The scholar stressed however that such documents are not manifesta tions of papal infallibility as defined by the First Vatican Council in 1870 Only pro nouncements in which the Pope speaks ex cathedra or from his pontifical chair are consid ered infallible under Roman Catholic doctrine The apostolic letter to Car dinal Roy marked the 80th an niversary of the encyclical Re rum Novarum  Of New Things by Pope Leo XIII Rerum Novarum dealt with what then was called the workers question It rejected socialism upheld the right of private property and a just wage and advocated intermedi ate organizations between the state and the individual Catholic Labor In Split Pope Pauls rejection of Marxism in the new document follows a split in a church backed Italian labor movement the 700000member Associa tions of Christian Workers Pope Paul himself then an aide to Pope Pius XII helped launch the movement 25 years ago The majority branch of the divided movement remains committed to socialism despite a disavowal by the Italian church hierarchy last Satur day A dissenting group de clared itself in opposition to the majoritys collaboration with Communists and Socialists In the letter to Cardinal Roy Pope Paul said The Christian who wants to live his faith in political action conceived as service cannot without contra dicting himself adhere to ideo logical systems that are radi cally or in substantial points opposed to his faith and its concept of manneither to the ideology of Marxism its athe istic materialism its dialectics of violence and the way it ab sorbs individual freedom into collectivism at the same time denying any transcendental character of man and his per sonal and collective history nor to the ideology of liberalism which tends to exalt individual freedom without any limita tion The Pope noted that Chris tians today are attracted by socialist currents and their various evolutions Pope Paul declared that many socialist systems were inspired by ide ologies that are opposed to faith and warned Christians not to idealize them Pope Paul conceded that some socialist movements were inspired by a generous aspira tion a research of a more just society but insisted that Christians must distinguish be tween the different socialist systems and earnestly examine to what degree they could com mit themselves to one of them Other Christians even ask themselves whether an evolu tion of Marxism would allow them to consider eventual col laboration the Pope remarked Marxisms Variations Noted He noted that Marxism had produced various schools of thought and practice on various levels He warned that it would be dangerous to accept Marxist methods and adopt the Marxist strategy of class struggle ig noring the type of totalitarian and violent society to which this process leads Discussing the search for democratic society based on equality and participation Pope Paul said Various models have been proposed some have been tested none gives yet complete satisfaction The Pope remarked that nei ther the state nor political parties had the right to impose an ideology by means that would lead to a dictatorship over minds the worst of all The Pope suggested that cul tural and religious groups should in all liberty seek to develop convictions in society that would ultimately lead to a new civilization Painting a somber picture of industrial society the Pope said its dehumanizing effects led to delinquency crime drug ad diction eroticism In many countries the Pope went on a status of woman that puts an end to de facto discrimination and estab lishes equal relations in her rights and the respect of her dignity is the subject of re search and at times of lively demands The Pope declared he did not countenance false equality that would deny the distinc tions established by the Creator Himself and that would contra dict theso importantspecif ic role of woman at the heart of the home as well as in the fold of society Rather the Pope explained legislation must protect wom ans specific vocation and rec ognize her independence as person her equal rights in par ticipating in cultural economic social and political life Discussing population growth particularly in developing na tions the Pope said it was dis concerting to note that a cer tain fatalism even among re sponsible authorities has led to a policy of limiting births prompted by active propa ganda in favor of contraception and abortion The Pope insisted that mar ried couples had the inalien able right to procreate and that families were entitled to assistance

Brownsville's Smoke Signals,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/17/archives/brownsvilles-smoke-signals-when-budgets-are-cut-its-the-poor-who.html,Splintered timbers rise on Sterling Place charred black against an azure sky They jut awkwardly from the upper floors of a totally gutted building The roof is gone The ravaged interior stands exposed to the sun Elsewhere on Sterling and on Saratoga for block after block the thin brick shells of abandoned tenements teeter on the brink of collapse This is the Brownsville section of Brooklyn where several weeks ago a group of touring mayors felt they saw the crumbling core of our urban civilization Drug addicts swarm like rats through the nibble Metal gates guard every door Cinderblocks wood and sheets of tin shutter windows This is an area of femaleheaded families illegitimate children high levels or crime and disease and low levels of education and employment Now that the angry fires of another social disorder have once more swept across this scarred terrain the rest of society is left to shrug its shoulders and turn away or in the alternative to look more closely to sift the warm fresh ashes The temptation to turn away is real Urban riots have begun to bore  Harlem in 1964 Watts in 1965 Cleveland in 1966 Detroit in 1967 Washington in 1968 Hartford in 1969 Asbury Park in 1970 Brownsvilles burning in 1971 Again Who cares Whats new Statistics released by Mayor Lindsays office indicate that the disorder in Brownsville the other day ranks at about the middle order of magnitude 84 fires 25 looted stores 46 arrests 33 injuries But these statistics hardly tell the story The Brownsville disorder grew out of a peaceful protest against state budgetary cutsof the kind being made nationwide in this paradoxical period of inflation and recessionand it reveals an entirely new cause for seething resentments This is not to imply that old causes have gone away On the contrary they lingerinadequate housing ineffective education poor health services economic discrimination New York Citys population is roughly onethird black and Puerto Rican but the citys Police and Fire Departments have only a or 7 per cent minority representation Mayor Lindsay believes that this is scandalously low He hopes for major breakthrough soon and talks of innovative uses of Federal funds to train minority recruits For now however the record remains These are the people at the very bottom of our social scale explained a black fire official touring the riot area They know hunger and injustice The American flag to them is its symbol Can you imagine how they feel when fire engines manned by allwhite crews race into their neighborhoods flying American flags They throw things John Gardner of Common Cause discussed the Brownsville disorder in national terms last week Theres been relatively little progress he said There has in fact been a sharp levelingoff in the national commitment to do something about the urban crisis Everything suffers from the Vietnam war A kind of pall has settled over domestic affairs Mayor Lindsay agrees Theres no doubt about it He worries about cuts in Federal funding for summer programs and yearround antipoverty programs as well as about cuts in state aid to cities When either employment cuts or programmatic cuts are made in governmental budgets it is the poor who bleed the last hired the least skilled the most needy They are bleeding now This is whats new The urban crisis continues slowly to worsenhousing deteriorates drug addiction spreads welfare rolls soar  while domestic spending cutbacks create additional hardships Too many political leaders shirk the really tough tasks and resort to essentially fraudulent rhetoric Man Nixon talks about workfare complained a Brownsville resident He talks about work and there is no work He talks about his mother handling bedpans These are the jobs the budget outs are ending Governor Rockefeller urged the enactment of a state law requiring mothers on welfarethe bulk of this states welfare rolls is composed of mothers and childrento accept jobs or job training The new law imposes a responsibility on mothers to find day care for their children Jobs are hard to find day care harder still The state and city are laying oft thousands of lowskilled workers rather than hiring them and neither the Federal state nor city government has moved adequately to provide family planning services and daycare facilities For shortsightedness and inhumanity it is hard to top the enactment of Medicaid restrictions in New York State which will deny financial assistance to poor women seeking abortions under the recently reformed abortion law These are the women for whom the reform was enacted The wealthy have always been able to obtain abortions To deny the poor funds is to condemn them to having unwanted children and to expand further the welfare rolls Those participating in Brownsvilles rioting the other day may not have been able

Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/19/archives/immorality-of-abortion.html,To the Editor One facet of your editorial policy seems to be completely inconsistent and wholly contradictory You state that the modern conscience deems capital punishment revolting and barbaric You further add that the hangman the electric chair and the gas chamber have no place in a civilized society Both premises are valid It is noble and humane to have compassion for a criminal Society may not have the right in todays culture to take the life of another no matter what heinous crime may have been perpetrated However your inconsistency is showing By any other name abortion is premeditated coldblooded murder Is not the wanton murder of innocent babies as equally revolting and barbaric to you as the use of the gas chamber for convicted murderers Are not the inherent rights to life of unborn babies equally as important as the rights of hardened convicted murderers On what moral grounds do you make your distinction BARBARA MCQUADE Staten Island N Y May 7 1971
Another Curb Upset,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/19/archives/another-curb-upset.html,ORANGETOWN N Y May 18A State Supreme Court justice ruled today that local laws limiting the places where abortions may be performed are unconstitutional because they conflict with state law which sets no such regulation Justice Leonard Rubenfeld in a 12page opinion ordered Orangetown not to enforce twomonthold law limiting abortions to hospitals or hospitalaffiliated clinics He found in favor of Dr Young W Kim a gynecologist who brought suit against the town shortly after the Council enacted the law Dr Kim who had been doing abortions in his office in the hamlet of Tappan maintained that the law interfered with his right to practice medicine and caused him financial harm Justice Rubenfelds decision is in direct conflict with a decision reached last week by another Supreme Court justice Joseph A Suozzi of Nassau County On May 10 he ruled that the village of Hempstead had the right to limit abortions to hospitals because the state had failedwhether by design or oversightto provide any statewide regulation Justice Rubenfeld took note of this difference of opinion He said in a footnote To the extent that judicial symmetry is lacking the issues must await resolution in the appellate court Justice Rubenfelds ruling concluded that the Orangetown law conflicts not only with the letter of the [state] law but also with the policy which induced the enactment of abortion reform legislation of the sweeping character here involved He noted that during lengthy debate on abortion reform last spring the Legislature was fully aware of additional restrictions it could have imposed but nevertheless enacted a law without the restrictions now sought to be imposed by the Town of Orangetown While he said he thought abortions in a hospital were safer and therefore preferable Justice Rubenfeld said it was up to the Legislature to impose additional restrictions William Snair the Orangetown Attorney said that the Town Council had not decided whether to appeal The plaintiff in the Hempstead case has announced plans to appeal Justice Rubenfeld said his decision probably did not apply to New York City which uses the Health Code rather than the Penal Code to limit places for abortions
Court Voids State's Limitation On Medicaid in Abortion Cases,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/19/archives/court-voids-states-limitation-on-medicaid-in-abortion-cases-court.html,The State Supreme Court annulled yesterday a state directive that barred Medicaid payments for abortions to all but medically indicated cases Justice Samuel A Spiegel wrote in a 28page decision that the directive handed down April 8 by George K Wyman State Commissioner of Social Services discriminated against the poor in violation of the equal protection and dueprocess guarantees of the United States Constitution Justice Spiegel acted on a suit that was filed April 12 by New York City against Mr Wyman and the State Social Services Department to invalidate the directive which was described as an administrative letter The justice held that the directive discriminated against the poor who were normally qualified for Medicaid assistante because it did not permit the elective induced abortions that have been legally available to those with private means since the liberalized state abortion law went into effect last July 1 In other words Justice Spiegel declared not everyone entitled to Medicaid or physicians services who wants an abortion would be able as of right to have Medicaid pay for it Those who want an abortion unless it is medically indicated would be obligated to pay for it themselves The problem arises as to those who want an elective induced abortion and are deprived of Medicaid because it is not medically indicated and yet cannot otherwise afford to pay for it Under state law abortions are freely authorized to women with the consent of their physicians within 24 weeks of conception Residency in the state is not required Between last July 1 and April 8 when the Wyman directive was issued Medicaid payments were available to those who sought an elective induced abortion without restriction or limitation Justice Spiegel asked Are the indigent eligible for Medicaid for medical attention who do not want a child because of handicaps such as too large a family already inadequate housing insufficient income of other personal reasons infairly and unconstitutionally being deprived of their right to an abortion by this directive Are thay unlawfully and improperly denied their right to Medicaid reimbursement for an abortion though eligible for all Medicaid approved medical treatment The Wyman directive must be condemned Justice Spiegel concluded when It deprives some indigents of rights which all others enjoy It is even less tolerable when it deprives some indigents of the rights other indigents enjoy Commissioner Wymans administrative letter  which he called a clarification of existing policiesfollowed a report by Senator James H Donovan an upstate Republican and leader of a move to repeal the liberal abortion law Senator Donovan said Governor Rockefeller had promised that the state would suspend Medicaid payments for abortions while the Legislature considered a permanent ban on such payments The Senator said that in conversations with Mr Rockefeller during legislative efforts to cut the state budget he had told the Governor that the use of public money for destroying the unborn had never specifically been given legislative approval Estimate Lacking City officials associated with the case said they could not estimate how many women might have been deprived of abortions as a result of the Wyman directive They indicated however that private hospitals had cut down their service to Medicaid patients Hospitals in Syracuse they said have now begun to demand affidavits from physicians asserting that the abortions they recommended were medically indicated When the city initially filed suit on April 12 Dr Joseph T English president of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation contended that 10008 of 23530 abortions performed in municipal hospitals since last July 1 involved women who were Medicaid patients and that during the same period 6160 of the about 28000 abortions in voluntary nonprofit private hospitals in the city also involved Medicaid eligibles The citys action against the state was supported by 14 nonprofit health welfare religious and civic organizations Among them were the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies and the New York County Medical Society A spokesman for State At torney General Louis J Lefkowitz said his office was reviewing the Spiegel decision to determine whether to appeal

Churchwomen Who Are Too Busy for Sewing Circles,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/23/archives/churchwomen-who-are-too-busy-for-sewing-circles.html,Mrs Donald Davis of Clin ton N J had her cats try out a new brand of kitty litter to help her church womens group raise funds to send an Indian girl to school Mrs Harry Roff of Stam ford Conn formed an old fashioned quilting bee and diverted her churchwomens group from talking about race relations to doing some thing about it Mrs Walter Staab of New York sent a letter from her churchwomens group to Al bany legislators to urge them not to place restrictions on the abortion law passed last year The three women are generation removed from the genteel ladies who ran the sewing circles of yesteryear for Philippine children or hosted cake sales for the poor starving children in China These days the womens guild or the womens auxili ary of white AngloSaxon Protestant churches are dis cussing such topics as drug and sex education prison reform and the new morality Community issues some of them thorny provide the ma jor focus of the groups time and money and interest But the traditional enclaves which turn their primary at tention to dogooding for a distant mission still remain Mrs Staab a 32yearold mother of two daughters is typical of the new Protestant churchwomen I dont really like to sit around in meet ingsI like to get out and do things she said recently  Sewing for missions as does the older womens group at her church  Episcopal Church of the Epiphany in New Yorkwas too dull So three years ago she or ganized a group of 40 wo men ages 20 to 45 whom Mrs Staab described as more outward more com munity  oriented One of their projects was to set up a film projector in the parish hall on Saturday afternoons and show the neighborhood children film classics like The Yearling or Alice in Wonderland Another was doing volunteer work at three nearby hospitals On May 19 her Junior wo mens guild will hold a con ference on prisons and it hopes to come up with ideas on how churchwomen can improve conditions We know nothing about prisons but this is a logical interest for churchwomen said Mrs Staab We should feel compassion more easily than others Churches should be a wonderful institution of social change Its their natu ral role but they havent really used it Mrs Davis had the same opinion as Mrs Staab of the ladies sewingcircle type of church activity At her small Methodist Church in Clinton the group of activistsmost young housewives and moth ers but some career women as well Mrs Davis is a night nurse  started brainstorm ing on theological and social questions Why they asked did the Federal Government and not the churches initiate the Head Start program Why do newspapers and not the churches promote the Fresh Air campaigns Last summer the Clinton women set up their own Fresh Air program for ghetto children from Elizabeth NJ I almost got cold feet ad mitted Mrs Davis But after Curtis and Patty came we got to know them as indi viduals I found out a lot about myself and my children I remember going to the farmers market with the two black kids and my own three she continued One of the vendors asked me Are these all yours I said Yes they are at least for a week  One embarrassing incident she recalled was her 3year olds remark to one of the black children I dont like you because youre black all over I had to rethink all the negative connotations we give black  about dirty hands and the black scary night said Mrs Davis That week was a good experience Id do it again This year the Clinton group has allotted its funds schooling for an Indian girl in New Mexico a project prompted by a study session on American Indians As one means of raising money they tested a new brand of kitty litter for a manufacturer At 50 cents per report they earned 17 In a variation on the Indi an theme they sponsored frontierstyle box supper and square dance as a money raising project in March We had a great time said Mrs Davis and it was a good excuse for us suburbanites to buy a prairie dress Like the Methodist groups box supper Mrs Roffs quilt ing bee was also a traditional idea with a new twist  mixing black and white rich and poor from the Stamford chapter of the ecumenical Church Women United group in a weekly project If you have eight women to decide on making a quilt said Mrs Roff you really get to know each other Its an exercise in getting along Occasionally the quilting bee buzzed with problems One incident was the unilat eral decision of the black cochairman to sell one of their handmade quilts at a raffle She reasoned explained Mrs Roff that a raffle would be a way to get a quilt into the home of some who couldnt otherwise af ford it But she announced the sale of chances without asking some of the other members and they thought buying a chance was gam bling Without group sup port the raffle idea died  Mrs Roff a mother of four and a member of the First Congregational Church in Stamford said she had stayed away from churchwomens groups until she moved to Stamford and became ac quainted with Church Women United I thought they were stuffy and old and didnt really care about the community Even in Stamford she re called they didnt seem to be concerned about Stam fords race problem  they were against busing for in stance But they asked me to be president so I suggest ed that we start meeting at Negro churches trying to draw black women into our activities As the topics get closer to home some Protestant wo men have begun to feel an identity crisis of sorts Mrs Alva Cox program chairman of the womens society at Diamond Hill Methodist Church in Greenwich Conn said her group had a pro gram series on revolution hunger in Biafra race rela tions and drug addiction two years ago We went hogwild on rel evancy she recalled over tea and cookies on a recent afternoon and I think some women got tired of it They want stimulating topics but they do weary of being bom barded with problems I think theyd like to have flower arranging but I told them theyd have to go some place other than the church for that

"At Downstate Center: Too Few Women Medical Students, Too Few Men in Nursing",https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/23/archives/at-downstate-center-too-few-women-medical-students-too-few-men-in.html,The Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn finds it self confronted with a prob lem these days that is typ ical of medical schools around the country Some staff members believe it has too few women among its medical students and too few men among its nursing stu dents Of the 809 medical stu dents at Downstate 104 are women The proportions are reversed in the College of Nursing where 45 of the 49 students are women While the Womens Equity Action League filed a suit last fall with the United States Department of Labor charging all medical schools in the United States with sex discrimination women at Downstate were starting their own feminist campaign A CounterConference A group called the Wo mens Caucus of the Medical Committee for Human Rights disrupted an abortion con ference at the school held a counterconference put out a womens newsletter and questioned the dean of ad missions about female quotas Only a minority of women at the school a branch of the State University of New York are actively involved in the womens liberation movement But interviews with pro fessors and students suggest that a large number of Downstate women support some of the feminists major ideas such as equal opportunity and the establishment of daycare centers Women doctors arent radical by any means said Dr Elaine Feldman an as sociate professor of medi cine at Downstate But most women physicians re spond favorably to womens lib because most of them have had problems with dis crimination Practically every woman doctor and medical student has a store of anecdotes about being referred to as nurse by hospital patients Youre always asked to bring a bedpan Dr Feld man said Then there are the troubles they say they have with their male colleagues both stu dents and teachers Susan Krown a fourth year medical student told of having a male student rail at her during her freshman orientation for taking up space while some of his friends were denied admis sion to the school After all he said she was just going to catch a husband and get married A Vocational Block Cecelia Johnson a second year student found that some men she met at parties would either stop talking to her or tell her all their aches and pains once they found out her vocation to be Similarly male nursing students say they too are having problems while mak ing inroads into what the general public still considers a womans profession At the Kings County School of Nursing which is part of the same hospital complex as Downstate there are 20 men among 500 stu dents in the registered nurse program Some of the men students including Salvadore Iacona a freshman who is married to a registered nurse complain that texts always refer to the nurse as she And some of the older in structors will refer to a male student inadvertently as she during a lecture Male nurses also get infu riated at the widespread view that the profession is one that appeals largely to male homosexuals Nothing could be further from the truth said Fred W Funnell an instructor at Kings County There are guys around here who would knock your head off for say ing something like that Karen Moyes another sec ondyear student noted that in psychiatry courses stu dents were subjected to sexist interpretation of sexuality such as the Freu dian theory of penis envy Freud she said wryly is alive and  at Down state Women Dr Feldman said have in the past been sys tematically downgraded by the committee that selects internes There is no dean of women at the school no wo man administrative officer except in the College of Nursing and only token fe male representation on the faculty senate she said Discrimination Denied Miss Moyes a member of the Womens Caucus said the group believed there was a quota system for women built into the admissions policy Dr Jerome Parnell the dean of admissions denies this He said that the average scholastic record of women who applied to Downstate was better than the average record of men applicants Downstates current per centage of women students about 13 per cent of the total enrollmentis larger than many medical schools Nationwide 74 per cent of physicians are women while 105 per cent of firstyear medical students are women The committee which con sists of nine men and one woman does have a special recruitment program for mi nority group students But Dr Parnell said he did not believe that women were in the same situation as blacks Id have to be educated on that he said Meanwhile the Kings County School of Nursing and Downstates College of Nursing are trying hard to recruit male nurses The reasons are manythe acute shortage of nurses the feel ing that male nurses consti tute a resource that hasnt yet been tapped significantly and the special talents of technological aptitude and emotional steadiness that men could bring to the profession A Long Involvement Mr Funnell notes that men have played a significant role in nursing as far back as the Middle Ages It was only since the appearance of Florence Nightingale in the last century he said that women assumed the prom inent position in nursing that they hold today Last month Kings County held an open house so that men interested in nursing as a career could meet with male students and ease their fears about entering a pro fession dominated by women Weve taken a rightful place here said Wallace Plato president of the fresh man class You dont have to feel strange because you are a man Mr Plato like many other male nurses turned to the profession after having served as a medical corps man in the armed forces According to Mary Ann Moran the schools recruit ment officer many medical corpsmen returning from service in Vietnam want to continue practicing the skills they have learned in the Army In addition she said many veterans find the gen eral employment outlook bleak at this time Began as Orderly Other men turn to the profession after serving in different medical capacities Mr Iacona for example began his career as an orderly before turning to nursing You realize that there are all these sick people he explained I was scared at first but I wanted to help them and I was very limited as an orderly Miss Moran noted that the pay for nurses at a city hospital is improving9500 to start and going as high as 11000 with night dif ferentials Higher salaries accrue with training and ex perience A nurse who ad ministers anesthesia can earn 1000 a month or more To dramatize what they consider maledominated at titudes at Downstate the Womens Caucus last fall dis rupted a conference on abor tion protesting that there were no women on the speak ers panel Later the group issued a newsletter explaining its po sition It was called Left Out At its own abortion con ference held in December all five speakers were women But although repeal of all abortion laws is an impor tant tenet of the Caucus and other womens groups there is no unanimity of opinion about abortions among the women at Downstate Issues of Agreement Although they may have differing opinions on abor tion almost all the Down state women agree on issues such as pregnancy leaves of absence increased daycare facilities and more intensive recruitment of women for the medical profession Dr Rita Harper who has three children under the age six recalled that she was the chief resident in pedi atrics during one pregnancy When the labor pains began she was at work I took care of the baby I was attending to walked across the street and stepped into the delivery room she said Now she solves her time problem in part by taking her two older daughters aged 5 and 3 along with her when she makes her Saturday hos pital rounds Its just possible they might follow in their moth ers footsteps The hospital is a way of life to the girls Dr Harper said proudly One day we were in the intensivecare unit It was very busy and the nurse asked them to leave They looked at me and said But Mommy I washed my hands and I put on a gown

Andy Warhol writing is not an easy one to grasp That may account for the snide rumor that Pork the real live roman a clef said to come from his pen was actually turned out by a tape recorder Like many rumors however this one has only an edge of truth The play which has just closed a twoweek trial run at the La Mama Experimental Theater here and will soon open in London was inspired by some taped raps between Andy and various hands at the Factory the downtown loft referred to in Pork as the Locale where he makes his films But boiled down and punched up by an inventive young director Tony Ingrassia the tape transcripts have been cleverly transmutedinto a satirical showandtellfest that in its attempts at out rageousness is occasionally revolting but more often good dirty fun Pork is really an in play and even though its made clear early on that any resemblance to people living or dead is purely coincidental those familiar with Factory doings will quickly latch on to the coincidences The charismatic ringleader is B Marlowe a deadpanned flaxenhaired voyeur who Warholishly keeps a Polaroid at the ready Playing up to him are two rivalrous side kicks Amanda Pork a fat bouncy overachiever in drugs and sex who shoots up with a euphemism called Vita meenaVegamin and Vulva a bitchy garrulous Vamp played by a male actor in drag and a Southern accent Marlowes special thing of course is watching his pals do theirs Chauffeured around the stage in a chair on wheels a nice touch he scandalhops from table to table the set is a mlange of the Factory Amanda Porks bed room and Maxs Kansas City keeping both his ears and shutter cocked He listens and snaps Snaps and listens as Pork who likes to go topless dishes spicily about her abortions and Lesbian forays as Vulva discusses the types of feces produced by different species and Josie a zaftig junior hooker describes her customers while actually douching back to the audience in preparation for one All in all its a cozy bunch take out the fornica tion masturbation defecation and prevarication with which Pork is larded and you might have a certain similarity to the juvenile gang in Youre a Good Man Charlie Brown Grooving on it all with the blandest of tool Marlowe contributes only one extended monologue himself an in cisive rundown of his days TViewing Honestly Mary Ford looked 80 she looked like Peggy Lee But in the end even he is wiped out by the jabber Disconnecting a recorder on which he is taping Pork he says Oh Im really so tired now and the play is over Its hard not to judge Porks players purely on their success as impersonators yet each of the principals manages to make it as a farceur on his own Anthony Zanetta made up as a ringer for Warhol plays Marlowe with fine passive aggression and Wayne County sic caught in a torrent of blonde hair is an absolute gas as Vulva I had reservations about Cleve Roller as Pork she substituted cutesy schoolgirl bounce for the sly sinister edge the role demands But she managed to be consistently funny Special mention should go to Suzanne Smith who leaking injured innocence couldnt have been better as Porks flashy trashy mother Those conditioned to War hols formless aleatory rambles in cinema will find the trim shape of this play and its realwell chore ography something of a sur prise Its due in large part to director Ingrassia who has not only molded Warhols found material some of which has already appeared in his movies but succeeded in giving it something akin to a point of view Ingrassia a dropout from the conserva tive Herbert Berghof Drama Studio who has directed several Off Off Broadway ef forts this past year says he approached his job by total ly disengaging himself from the Factory and thinking purely in terms of a play  Its about a bunch of peo ple performing for a mana strange quiet man who gets a vicarious kick from their lives I dont see them as sick particularly  theyre like everyone else interested in their bodily functions and discussing them  but a bit exaggerated beyond the norm Theres a power rela tionship between them and Marlowe he plays one role they play another Hes al mostI hate to say it it sounds so oldfashioned like a father but then ulti mately like a kid playing with his dolls Theres no question that Ingrassia a blackbearded giant of a man enjoys what he has wrought in fact as he watched each performance out front his laughter had a considerably higher decibel count than that of the audience Meanwhile back at the Factory Warhol who first spotted Ingrassia lying on the floor of a downtown gallery as part of an art act and later checked out his direc torial skills by seeing a play hed clone allows that his staging of Pork has been great Not Warhol adds gently that he himself might not have done it differently Id like to have it more open ended make changes in the material every day I also believe in changing directors and thereby interpretations And Id like to see real peo ple doing real things on stage really cooking for ex ample so theyd produce a real smell In fact the play did undergo considerable modification during its trial run one change made at Warhols instigation was the inclusion of some political material he thought topical It involves a paranoid news paper columnist who enters a scene convinced that hes being trailed by Weather people Warhol does not really see the play as a probe into the theater medium but as an extension of his films and possibly even a trial run for a TV soap opera Stressing that his primary ambition is to entertain he says The whole idea is actually a car toon a running comic strip Why not put such a thing on TV No ones doing TV as TV and our people make up stuff so well theres no work to it Its all improvisation They could read the papers discuss movies theyve seen and so forth Wed tape first to eliminate dirty words Porks most enthusiastic booster is neither its writer nor its director however but its producer Ira Gale a young Americanborn Lon don art dealer who stumbled on the play while pursuing Warhol in New York for his signature on a print Track ing him down to a Pork rehearsal he sat through it himself then volunteered to produce it abroad We couldnt get a theater in New York until the fall and I thought it should be done right away Gale whos taking his first flyer in production plans to open the play at the Round house the theater near Lon dons West End where Oh Calcutta was first hatched in time to catch the summer tourists Later hell take it to Amsterdam Convinced that Pork is a great at tack on middleclass moral ity he is sure that it will go well enough to bring back to Broadway Broadway might be ready for it
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/23/archives/nixon-you-might-call-it-a-suburban-strategy.html,KEY BISCAYNE Fla  Rich ard Nixon spent part of yester day with Lyndon Johnson in Texas the rest of the weekend in Florida and on Tuesday he will hobnob with Southern gov ernors editors and publishers in Birmingham and Mobile A year ago perhaps this quickie South ern swing would have evoked all sorts of political analyses drawing explicit parallels be tween Mr Nixons itinerary and his political ambitions in 1972 But no more What was once known as the Southern strat egy has come upon hard times in the past six months To be sure Mr Nixon retains high hopes of capturing Texas which helps explain John Con nallys present eminence in the Cabinet  but the dream once cultivated by a few of the Pres idents aides of turning the South into fairly solid Nixon ter ritory has largely evaporated The executioner was the Su preme Court whose composition Mr Nixon tried so hard to change with the unsuccessful nomination of two Southern judges Although the Court has since begun to move his way on criminal law it has not only asked him to desegregate South ern schools at a much faster pace than he would have pre ferred but in April it also im posed upon him the politically distasteful task of requiring the busing of black and white chil dren to eliminate segregated schools in Southern cities The Administrations an nouncement 10 days ago that it would require Austin Tex to adopt widespread busing to con form to the Courts ruling sug gests that Mr Nixon to use one of his favorite phrases has decided to bite the bullet and carry out the law as quickly and painlessly as possible To soften the blow he has ordered his Cabinet officers to cooperate with local school boards as much as possible But the fact remains that by 1972 more desegregation will have been achieved under Mr Nix ons reign than under any of his predecessors and this fact Is hardly likely to escape the at tention or the speeches of George Corley Wallace Thii does not mean of course  despite his troubles and re cent shaky standing in the polls  that Mr Nixon is without a strong constituency What it does mean however is that he has lost a marginal degree of insurance that the South might have provided it increases the importance of repeating his 1968 triumphs in the big Midwestern states and California and it plates a specie premium on re pairing his old alliances among Republican voters and building new ones among Democrats and independents who have recent ly escaped the cities for the sub urbs With both sets of voters in mind Mr Nixon has been tak ing a hard line against welfare recipients who can but do not work listening patiently to the complaints of Republican Gov ernors opening the White House to bigwigs from the farming community adopting a tough stance against the legalization of marijuana and  with an eye to Catholic voters every where  opposing abortion as a means of population control The visit to Birmingham Tues day for a background briefing for editors and publishers on his revenuesharing proposals the visit to Mobile the same day is a largely ceremonial exercise involving the dedication of a wa terway might also be included in this list in the sense that it is a further effort to advertise anew his concern for communi ties that are short of cash and shuddering under the burden of mounting property taxes Although none of these ges tures Will be as important to his reelection as for example a successful conclusion to the war and a visible upturn in the econ omy Mr Nixons concern for suburbia is not misplaced The suburbs now hold 76 million peo ple as compared with the 64 million in rural America and a like number in the cities and it is the suburbs that are growing If any further confirmation is needed of the Presidents inter est in this constituency it lies in the struggle now in prog ress between the White House and the bureaucracy over the Administrations response to the issue of dispersing low and mod erate income housing and in evitably much black housing to the suburbs Mr Nixon is on record against using the lever age of the Federal Government to change the economic charac teristics of suburban neighbor hoods Mr Romney his hous ing secretary  and others in the lower reaches of the Jus tice Department are for it A special committee on civil rights of the Domestic Council is now pondering the appropri ate Presidential posture and a statement of some length is said to be in progress The issue is an immensely complicated one but the statement when it comes should reveal more about the Presidents political calcula tions for 1972 than any single trip to the South

Albany's War on Welfare,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/29/archives/albanys-war-on-welfare.html,In the declaration of legislative intent which forms the preamble to the new residency requirement for wel fare eligibility the State Legislature in Albany in effect blames the poor for everything from inadequate housing to air pollution The logic seems to be that the poor must therefore be denied welfare benefits until they have lived in New York State at least a year This law is not only meanspirited it applies to such a small proportion welfare recipients as to be almost meaningless  A similar law enacted previously in this state and others was found by the Supreme Court two years ago to be an unconstitutional burden on interstate travel and a denial of the equal protection of the laws This one doubtless unconstitutional too Another equally meaningless measure requires mothers on welfare to make diligent efforts to find day care for their children although there is an appalling shortage of day care facilities and the Legislature makes no provi sion for more Those who are on welfare and are employed in public works programs do not have be paid prevailing wages This then is not so much program with the worthy aim of getting people off wel fare rolls and on to payrolls as it is a program for cheap labor The cuts in benefit levels enacted by the Legislature go deep For welfare they amount to 10 per cent of the basic grant in New York City which means that everyone who was eating on one dollar a day will now have eat on only ninety cents As the Citizens Committee for Children has poignantly suggested this mandates mal nutrition The US Department of Agriculture estimates that this paltry amount will not provide even a minimally nutritious diet Heretofore a family of four with an annual income of 5000 has been eligible for Medicaid benefits but the new eligibility level will be 4500 Medicaid will no longer pay for dentistry eye glasses or artificial limbs An administrative order precluding the use of Medicaid funds for abortions has fortunately been challenged the courts  To make sure that the states welfare rules and regula tions reflect the newly repressive mood other measures just passed will transfer administrative authority of the Board of Social Services to the Welfare Commissioner and make the Commissioner subject solely to appoint ment by the Governor A new office of inspector general has been created but he submits his reports to the Wel fare Commissioner and therefore cannot possibly serve an independent check on the Welfare Departments performance None of this repressive legislation confronts the basic welfare problem none of it can really prove effective The bulk of those on welfare are mothers and children Rather than force mothers to work the Legislature could have established family planning centers in that half the states counties now without them rather than punish unwed mothers and their often unwanted children the Legislature could have mandated effective family plan ning programs within the public schools Relief recipients should indeed perform useful work wherever possible but to require work imposes some obligation to provide opportunities for working There nothing wrong with public service jobs but these are the very jobs which budgetary cuts have curtailed Soaring welfare rolls do contribute to soaring govern mental costs and in this paradoxical period of recession and inflation public resentment against those on the dole is almost bound to rise It is an indictment of the Legislature however that these rolls continue to mount and that nothing meaningful is done to reduce them Jobs adequate wages and family planning programs these are the keys with which society will solve the welfare problem This session of the Legislature has continued to ignore them Members seeking to respond to pressures against escalating governmental costs can claim to have done something about the welfare prob lem but what they did was only to blame the poor A positive intelligent response to the problem apparently awaits a calmer time

"Berrigan, the Church and the ‘Nine’",https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/30/archives/berrigan-the-church-and-the-nine-father-berrigan-the-church-and-the.html,THE coming of age of the Roman Catholic Church since Pope John XXIII and the Second Vatican Council has been a rough trip The Trial of the Catonsville Nine is a small map of part of that trip It is hard for me to write about it for over the years I have been close to the agony and the wonder of the Church and its new life It is not easy for me to see what is going on It is dreadful too to have to criticize even gently the lucid and penetrating profession of faith in the Lord by my friends Daniel Berrigan is a friend He is a strong man blessed with a vision and burdened with the daring of a prophet He sees the horror of the war In Viet nam and speaks and writes about it with vigor and brilliance I do not think it is possible to fault Daniel and his fellow conspirators Their reading of the times is true the war is evil the death of the innocent does increase American guilt is clear the silence of the churches and the government is shameful and vile for in the face of the massacre they still are morally indolent The Trial of the Catonsville Nine as a cri de coeur is a luminous event in the history of this land It is a moral guide a warning and a radiant explication of the Gospels I do not think it is a play Many people think that the revolutionary Church evoked by the Berrigans In The play is the Church as it should be in the world I would try now to shift the emphasis a bit from the political vision of the Church to a more essential vision to a larger vision I do not question Daniels witness it is therepure strong and occasionally distractedfor all to see I ask simply if renewal in the Church will come solely from political and social action If one reads the Catholic left one would think that that is indeed the case the essential Church is the politically active Church and that Church began with the advent of the Berrigans and their crusade Any other Church one would think is irrelevant phoney and counterrevolutionary I left the play unmoved It was of course absurd for me to have asked of it what I hadthat it be a play an act of the imagination a created work that would illuminate not merely the facts of the case which every one knew but also something about life feeling and history It was a sermon an exhortation to action but it was not a play Is there any creative mind anywhere in the world today that could take the event of Catonsville and transform it into a work of the imagination Perhaps Cam us might have had an idea about that I heard the cries of and who stormed the heavens with their tremendous vision of the slaughter they were witnessing in Vietnam But I had heard those cries for years The moral and religious issues in Trial are not new issues in the Catholic Church I had learned from Dorothy Day that to be a Catholic was to be a man who fed the hungry clothed the naked and sought justice with all his heart No Catholic will dare affirm that the Church has ever met the challenges of history with all its spiritual and moral might It has been weak frightened and corrupt when it came to those decisions that would bring the fullness of the Gospels to the task of remaking the world The intensity of the Catonsville Nines witness decreased with the rei teration of the central theme and its origin the coming to consciousness and militancy of middleclass Catholic sen sibilities through the medium of the Vietnam war and the Black Revolution Personal witness guilt courage in the face of jail contempt of ones family and friends betrayal all the outrageous facts of life one faces when one must stand against the times cease meaning anything but something close to bathos when they are crashing down over ones head without art without reticence without style Only a middleclass Roman Catholic intellectual and all Catholic intellec tuals in America are middleclass can understand just what has happened since that Second Vatican Council in 1962 I bravely call myself a Roman Catholic though my friends who are Catholic call themselves Christians in cessantly That word is too large for me I prefer to slosh around in the village of Catholicism than to stride through the vast savannas of Christianity What is now the Catholic left the Catholic progressive the Catholic mili tant the Catholic avantgarde I dont know what to call it had been fed up until Pope John XXIII a heavy gruel of religious symbols pious banalities glorious theologies half understood vulgar art sublime art half under stood vulgar philosophy sublime phi losophy and political and social thought that ran the gamut from the enlightened thought of Pope John to the backward Suddenly Vietnam and the Black Revolution plunged the startled Cath olic into a topsy turvy world where all the things that he had been forcefed for so long turned ironically on the Church An energetic minority of Cath olics started putting the Gospels into their own lives and one day the bish ops woke up and found a Church no longer filled with the ancientofyears mumbling in the nave here and there in every other pew was a lionlike Catholic hungry for justice The hier archy had no way to cope it had been used to mumbling and yes men for too long Charity no longer meant dropping a dollar in a basket to buy good things for the poor on Thanksgiving a good militant Catholic got up cooked a turkey and brought it and his social conscience to the poor man and re turned home to begin changing his life and the poor mans not only through the organizations in the Church but through his own vision of what the Gospels meant Charity no longer meant saving green stamps so that a nun or priest out there in the bush could buy a jeep to use in pastoral visits to the nonChristian charity meant risking ones life ones fortune and ones livelihood to bring the good news and the Lord to the dispos sessed The war continued in horror and more and more Catholics decided to bring the law of love to the unloved and brutalized no matter what popes bish ops or priests had to say about obed ience loyalty to the Church or sin Christ and all one had been taught about Him by those dreadful nuns in those horrid parochial schools had found a local habitationin Selma in the burning of draft cards in morato riums The Berrigan event and the events surrounding it lack the clear light of intellect Csar Chavez Don Helder Camera Dorothy Day the Little Broth ers of Charles de Foucauld pastors and teaching sisters the cloistered Benedic tine nuns in Regina Landis Monastery in Connecticut are witness too to the glory of man and to the agony of the tines but not only from the point of view of political rage and consciousness In the militant Catholic leftand in the Black Militant left too there is an irrationality that taints the revolution and limits its chances of success I write of that crippled howling petulant spoiled brat anger and the self impor tance that traps revolutionaries in their own will and leaves their zeal their visions and their hope abandoned to their egos and to the collective egos of their followers I am not sure if I can bear any more the small voice crying alone in the wilderness One seeks the solitary searing voice of the prophet but I want to hear it in the street in the world in schools in politics where change is still possible The Catholic left has nurtured a community of para sites who freeload off the Gospels The Catholic Church is more than the Berrigan witness It is more too than the dull controversies about birth con trol abortion real and imaginary saints veiled or veilless nuns married or bache lor priests The Church will live not through the life it is given by the po litical witness of some of the faithful though that witness the Church must continue to have it will live only if it can elicit from its people and from its divine origins a new life for its whole body The Catholic Church is that whole marvelous neurotic tremendous fact of its life the Pope the bishops the Vati can the Gospels it is all her witnesses Pope Paul the bishops Ivan Illich Cesar Chavez Cardinal Cooke Camilo Torres Flannery OConnr St John of the Cross Caroline Gordon Charles de Gaulle I am not able any longer to set aside as lost those I do not dig and to receive into my liberal parlor only those I do I must admit that among the ones I dig least at this moment in my life are the Catonsville Nine I find much more to say to a contemplative nun like Sister Patricia in the silence of Regina Laudis Monastery I defend the Pope when liberal friends defile him because I hold him in deep honor and I defend Dan Berrigan when Catholics condemn him to madness or apostasy Now there is no intellect at work Just feeling rage and a sulkiness Fran cine du Plessix Gray and the Melvilles are the acknowledged legislators in these matters that traces the defection of every priest nun and theologian the origin of every revolutionary idea and the sexual and social maladjustment of man woman child or butcher to some nasty pope nun priest or rosaryclick ing grandmother I am tired of the lack of style and breeding in the hooting Catholic left Surely when the letters allegedly writ ten by Sister Elizabeth MacAllister and Philip Berrigan are put somehow into the picture of the Catholic left one sees just what dismal kind of fantasy can spring up from a Catholicism gone po litical Alas when the Berrigan business got down to the nitty gritty of prac tical revolution one just wished theyd all decide to do what they do best and leave the catastrophic worldchanging plots to South Americans Communists and the Green Berets I have however no less contempt for the lacecurtain militancy of William Buckley and the maudlin howls of the bishops I yearn for sanity I wish that the Catholic left in all their masks would open schools soup kitchens infirmaries libraries playgrounds and nurseries and stay the hell out of jail get off pot and stop gazing for a while into their religious navels and start life Perhaps then given sanity and char ity the Catholic revolution might give to this land of nonpoets nonplay wrights and silly turnedonprophets a rebirth of poetry drama and the novel and probe again with the tools the Church has still in its keepingthe Sac raments tradition history philosophy in all their contemporary brilliancethe mystery and wonder of the world Per haps somewhere hidden in a cellar or behind some bush there is an imagina tion the Catholic left is without im agination and humor that might risk speaking of the creative act God and man again without the fear that some militant Roman will accuse him of para noid orthodoxy But as long as the Catholic puts all his eggs in the political basket well get nothing but bad poli ticians and empty and tired ideas about man and life There is no recorder of these fruitful crazy days in the Church No Claude] P6guy Undset Waugh Flannery OCon nor or Chesterton around to give this intensity and life perspective language and wit The Church heads into the world pursued by the cacophonous ill will and confusion of a dwindling faith ful who cannot discover from anyone who speaks to them which end is up I hear though through all this in the timbre of the cacophony in the hard songs of the militants in the frenzy of the right and the more angular frenzy of the left the voice of the Holy Spirit I think this is a springtime of the Church and somehow there will soon be in her midst surprising the bishops and the left a new tribe of novelists poets theologians they are already around bishops philosophers and politicians who will make the Church sane and whole again or perhaps will make the Church sane and whole for the first time since Pentecost
The motive is not rehabilitation but revenge,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/30/archives/inside-prison-american-style-edited-by-robert-j-minton-jr-325-pp.html,All of us know what imprisonment is supposed to accomplish the dis couragement of further crime and the rehabilitation of the prisoners to be come responsible citizens Yet the national return rate is more than 50 per cent And if a minimum of five out of every 10 excons return to prison this can hardly be called suc cessful rehabilitation Nor is it suc cessful even for those who remain free Most of them will live marginal ly on the fringe of decent society because they will not be citizens with full civil rights thus theyll have to work at the most menial jobs or re sort to further crime  Consider In most states an excon cannot work for city state or Fed eral Governments cannot work in any civilservice job in any job that re quires bonding in most jobs that require a license in any job that re quires a record of good character in any job that requires a security check in any job that requires money handling Thats only a partial list and Ive already eliminated a major ity of the available jobs in the coun try Also closed of course are most of the professions and many types of businesses Additionally an excon who is on parole cannot get a job have a girl friend get married drink a beer drive a car stay out at night or go out of town without getting per mission And just to complete the ali enation he cant vote There is so much that could be said about our prison system  all hopelessly negative  that it stag gers the mind For those interested in what is the number one national scandal in America todaynow that abortion reform has begun  the book under review might be a good place to start Inside Prison American Style tells of the California prison sys tem In harrowing detail it documents the brutality injustice corruption and deadly hypocrisy of a system that murders mens minds as it de stroys their bodies It gives prima facie evidence that the systems mo tivating force is not rehabilitation but revenge One is staggered by the ac cusatory force of endless examples of mindless punishment and purpose ful chaos It is a snake pit designed to provoke insanity a circle of suf fering below even Dantes bottom pit How can man exist in a society where physical and mental tortures are common where deprivation is constant where racism is a religion where forced homosexuality is an everyday occurrence where murder and extortion are facts of life often viewed with tacit consent by the administrators of the society since they keep the subjects in line Even those among us who are veter ans of the American prison system  penologists law enforcement person nel excons  often find the actual horror indescribable and therefore unbelievable to societyatlarge Whats real in such a world Real ity thats being trapped in a narrow cell where you cant stretch your arms out Its waking up in the morn ing and discovering that all the water has been turned off  again Its waiting in line in the big yard for macaroni and beans or being jarred out of a sound sleep by a piercing buzzer so you can stand on the cold floor and be counted Reality is memorizing your number and forget ting your name shining your shoes when theres no place to go rolling your own cigarettes and bitter in stant coffee made with lukewarm tap water Reality is the big yard at noon where you see your image re flected in a thousand nameless faces Reality is also living In a tiny strip cell for 57 days or six months or two years naked with no bedding no furniture no water no toilet no light no air surrounded by caked layers of human offal and nightmare bugs If youre white its making a knife in the machine shop right in front of a guard who lets you do it only if youll use it on one of them nig gers If youre black its stealing a spoon and sharpening it against rock so you can protect yourself Its five minutes before a parole board once a year And in California its never knowing when freedom will come In some ways the California penal system is among the most regressive in the country Beyond its notorious racism in such hells as San Quentin and Soledad beyond its deprivation of civil rights for convicts and ex cons beyond even its strongly homo sexual prison psychopathology Cali fornia has the infamous distinction of the indeterminate sentence No convicted man knows exactly how much time he will serve Under the indeterminate sentence act California judges do not set the term to be served by convicted of fenders they are sentenced for the term prescribed by law The law establishes the minimum and maxi mum terms for each offense Then who sets the actual time The California Adult Authority pa role board which consists of seven members appointed by the Governor Each year each eligible con gets his five minutes with two of the members or their representatives And each year statistically they send the vast majority of convicts back to the cells for another year There is no lawyer present no recourse no due process A man does not see what is in his file nor is he told what the author ities may have written about him dur ing the year He cannot face his ac cusers if any Worse he does not know even if there are any accusa tions since he is never given a rea son for the parole boards decision And should be eventually gain pa role he can be returned to prison merely on the word of his parole agent without being told of the charge against him without an attorney without confronta tion of accusers and without opportunity for defense In ad dition the parole board can extend his term beyond that originally set His accusers are the judges and there is no appeal In effect he can be returned to prison for a mere violation of departmental rules All incredible but all frighten ingly true Kafka would recog nize the California penal sys tem Inside Prison American Style is a collection of writ ings mostly by inmates and ex sons of California prisons The book is divided into two sections The first part gives detailed descriptions of the prisons physical world prison society reading matter strikes racism sex treatment and time of internment the second part is devoted to semiofficial papersa lengthy convict re port on major grievances and a series of appendices dealing with parole reports and a parole board hearing The volumes editor Robert Minton has spent several years work ing with convicts at Soledad and San Quentin and has ob viously learned enough to let the men speak for themselves this horrific collection There are of course draw backs to this collection among the contributors there are men here who are stupid some who are fakers But the cumulative effect is corrosive to the spirit I especially recommend an ac count of a young narcotics of fenders 10 appearances before the parole board and his even tual parole after 10 years in prison on a onetotenyear rap and a reading of the transcript of a parole board hearing You may never hopefully get this close to insanity again

hoped she could teach her students to be less ethnocentric I want them to know that the Amer ican way is not the only way she said and that they should not look upon the Vietnamese as gooks and blacks as monkeys I want to show them that there is a universality of man At least two of the graduates are entering law school with visions of altruism rather than money guiding them on Ellen Futter 21 of Port Wash ington L I a Phi Beta Kappa graduate who will attend the Columbia Law School plans to make a dent in the world by going into either poverty or consumer law And Miss Eng who will attend Harvard Law School is thinking about returning to New Yorks China town to practice I think the growing ethnic conscious ness in the Chinese community and in the Asian community in general is really good said Miss Eng whose mother operates a hand laundry in Pough keepsie None of the graduates who were in terviewed at random said they were opposed to marriage But many repeated the sentiments of Miss Levin who said I do want to get married some day but it is not something I dwell on Miss Levin whose long brown hair tumbles down past her shoulders will enter the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce of the University of Pennsylvania this fall with hopes of becoming a hospital administrator Ive been active in womens health problems such as abortion and birth control she said in explaining her career choice and since Im not medi cally trained I wanted to help in some other way As one of Barnards two senators to the Columbia University Senate Miss Levin said she had learned from her campus political experience that it was impossible to change the world without starting a revolution Im not ready to completely tear it apart she said so for the time being Ill work with it Two black graduates Dorothy Van Buren and Rhonda Nunn will begin almost immediately to work with under privileged blacks Miss Van Buren will be a field worker with the Neighborhood Youth Corps in New York and Miss Nunn will leave for Africa to teach in either Tanzania or Uganda under the auspices of the Presbyterian church Miss Van Buren 21 a scholarship student who is the daughter of a Detroit postal clerk said that her eventual goal was to become a clinical psychologist and work with black people When you are black in America she said there are psychological problems that arent dealt with You just cant use the white definitions of neurosis or schizophrenia and apply them to black people Miss Nunn 21 whose father is prin cipal of an integrated school in Besse mer Ala said that her teaching job in Africa was not just to help the Africans I feel like Im broadening my knowl edge of my own past she said It will be helping me as much as it will be helping anybody Miss Ballinger the graduate who plans to be wed in the fall to a Colum bia law student laughed when she re called the jokes her Barnard friends had made about her upcoming nuptials Still Believes in Tradition I guess Im still traditional enough to want to get married she said Im not superradical Its just something that my fianc and I wanted Our par ents marriages have been very success ful and our friends marriages have been very successful Miss Ballinger who plans to attend graduate school at Hunter College said she wanted to have two children at the most and then return to a career in art She said she hoped to raise her family in a more real type environ ment than she had encountered in Scarsdale and expose them to more minority groups Scarsdale is a lovely town but its closed both economically and racially

Prenatal Diagnosis Is Reducing Risk of Birth Defects,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/03/archives/prenatal-diagnosis-is-reducing-risk-of-birth-defects-prenatal.html,Prenatal diagnosisthe de tection of birth defects at a time when the fetus can still be aborted  is drastically changing the nature and po tential of genetic counseling throughout the country For many severe genetic disorders it has taken coun seling out of the realm of such statistical probability statements as You have a one in four chance of having a child with disease X and made it a matter of near cer taintyThe child you are carrying will or will not have the disease Genetic counselors who use prenatal diagnosis report that it is bringing many high risk parents in for counsel ing who would not have sought it in the past As a result the birth of many se verely abnormal children has been prevented and hundreds of normal babies have been born to parents who might not otherwise have dared to have children In a few medial centers prenatal diagnosis is being offered to all pregnant wom en over the age of 40 when the chances of having a ge netically abnormal child are greatly increased Developed in Denmark The technique first per formed in Denmark in 1960 and in this country five years ago is now being used by ex perts in nearly three dozen medical centers Dr Henry L Nadler a pediatrician at Northwestern University who is a pioneer in the field predicts that a year from now every major medi cal center will be examining fetal cells for genetic defects in highrisk pregnancies In fact the stillexperi mental procedure has caught on so rapidly that at a news conference in Washington yesterday the National Foun dationMarch of Dimes cau tioned physicians not to at tempt prenatal diagnosis until they were certain they had mastered the tricky technical steps involved At the conference the foundation released a publica tion Intrauterine Diagnosis which will be sent to 110000 American physicians In it Dr Nadler urges that only people with a great deal of experience should undertake intrauterine diagnosis Dr John W Littlefield of Massa chusetts General Hospital expressed concern that the new technique could be spoiled with some bad results leading to some wrong coun seling Excellent Results Thus far however the re sults among the approximate ly 600 women who have undergone prenatal diagnosis are excellent Dr Nadler says He reported in a recent inter view that of 410 monitored pregnancies on which he has details no complications oc curred that could be related to the procedure and no inac curate predictions of defects were made Dr Nadler noted however the longterm risks of the procedure had not yet been defined In describing the value of prenatal diagnosis he cited the case of Mrs J who was extremely eager to have chil dren but terrified to try She was the only normal child among four Her three sisters were mentally retarded af flicted with Downs syndrome or mongolism a genetic dis ease that results from an ex tra No 21 chromosome in the childs cells A study of Mrs Js chro mosome pattern called a karyetype confirmed her worst fears  although she was normal she carried an unusual chromosomal defect that could be passed on to her children and result in mongolism A No 21 chromo some was stuck on a No 15 chromosome and each of her children would have about a one in three chance of inher iting this abnormal chromo some along with one normal No 21 from Mrs J and one from Mr Jgiving the child a total of three No 21 chro Although all cases of mon golism are genetic only a few result from the abnormality Mrs J has and most have a Chance of about one in 200 of recurring With a guarantee that her pregnancy would be moni tored through intrauterine di agnosis and the fetus aborted if abnormal Mrs J decided to become pregnant During the fourth month to her pregnancythe earli est the procedure can safely be donea small amount of amniotic fluid the waters in which the fetus is bathed was removed through the ab dominal wall with an over sized hypodermic needle The technique is called amnio centesis from the Greek amnion the membrane around the fetus and ken tesis meaning puncture The amniotic fluid contains cells shed by the fetus These cells are then grown in laboratory dishes and their chromosomes studied for pos sible defects Chromosomal analysis of the fetal cells during Mrs Js first pregnancy revealed that the baby would be a mongoloid Mrs J under went a therapehtic abortion and tried again Prenatal diagnosis during the next two pregnancies indicated that neither baby was afflicted with the chro mosal defect and the sub sequent delivery of a normal girl and a normal boy con firmed the prediction Truly a Miracle It is truly a miracle the overjoyed mother told her doctor I never thought I could have normal healthy children Mrs K of Boston whose genetic profile is described in the diagram accompanying this article was not quite so lucky She had already had one miscarriage borne one normal daughter who like her mother is a carrier of the chromosomal defect and a mongoloid son who died at the age of five months During her next two preg nancies prenatal diagnosis indicated that she would have borne two more mongo loid sons according to Dr Carlo Valenti obstetrician geneticist at the Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn In both cases she had an abortion and has not become pregnant again All the major chromosomal defectsthe absence or dou bling of a particular chromo some the loss of a large piece of one chromosome or the presence of an extra piece all of which can result in severe congenital disorders can be detected through anal ysis of fetal cells The sex of the fetus can also be determinedfemales have two X chromosomes and males have an X and a Y In the case of dis orders like hemophilia that are passed on only to male children male fetuses can be aborted If the mother Is a high risk to bear a child with a seri ous biochemical disorder such as TaySachs disease in which a missing enzyme results in death of the child usually before its fourth birthdaythe amniotic fluid and fetal cells can be ana lyzed for the presence or ab sence of critical chemicals So far a dozen different lifelimiting biochemical dis orders have been detected prenatally and three dozen or more others can probably be detected according to Dr Kurt Hirschhorn medical geneticist and pediatrician at Mount Sinai Hospital here But Dr Hirschhorn is quick to point out that prenatal diagnosis as it is now per formed is hardly a cureall for many of the problems encountered in genetic coun seling The two most common genetic defects in the coun trys largest population groups  sickle cell anemia which afflicts one black child in 400 and cystic fibrosis which afflicts one white child in 2000cannot now be de tected prenatally Another problem is that the fetal cells in amniotic fluid grow very slowly and occasionally do not grow at all making a second amnio centesis procedure necessary Dr Nadler says that it now takes an average of 30 days to perform a biochemical analysis on cultured fetal cells by which time the preg nancy may be too far along for an abortion to be per formed Also doctors cannot be certain that the cells they are studying are really from the fetus and not from the mother Several researchers includ ing Dr Valenti in Brooklyn and Dr Richard Doherty at the University of Rochester are trying to develop a fetal amnioscope that will help solve these problems Such a scope would enable the doctor to view the fetus directly and take a sample of fetal blood and fetal skin permitting a faster and more accurate diagnosis of more disorders than can now be diagnosed from amniotic fluid cells Other refinements includ ing special chromosome stain ing techniques and computer analysis of karotypes are be ing studied as a means of detecting small but medically significant chromosomal ab normalities not currently dis cernible Dr Robert S Ledley of the National Biomedical Research Foundation in Silver Spring Md has developed a com puter system that can pre pare a karotype in 40 seconds and make precise measure ments of all the chromosomes noting if any are of abnormal length or shape As exciting as prenatal di agnosis is Dr Valenti says it is but the first step in the revolution in human genetics The solution is not just in abortion of defective babies he says The next step is treatmentgiving the needed substance to the mother or fetus directly to correct the abnormality

Brookhaven Spurs Its Research Arm,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/06/archives/brookhaven-spurs-its-research-arm-brookhaven-spurring-research-arm.html,UPTON L I June 5 Physicists at Brookhaven Na tional Laboratory are com pleting installation of a 49 million machine designed to soup up this countrys most powerful research tool for studying the inner workings of the atom  With this new addition well be able to increase our capability for extending the frontiers of knowledge said Dr Maurice Goldhaber Physicist and director of Brookhaven This is why we were established Five blocks away in Brookhavens biology labo ratories a young ecologist poked a finger at the walk outside his office and scowled If I had a push button right now and I could shut off all physics research in this place Id push it in an instant said Dr Charles Hall who believes environ mental degradation is so seri ous that ecology research should be the first priority at Brookhaven A Growing Debate The contrasting views re flect a growing debate that involves nearly every scien tific institution The question is how to apportion a shrink ing sum of money among scientists for both basic stud ieswhich they contend is the wellspring of scientific progressand targeted re search to meet societys im mediate needs Nearly all agree that both are needed but the argument persists on where to draw the line The debate is particularly focused at Brookhaven be cause the institutions activi ties range from the most basic of studies on subatomic physics to the completely practical search for new medical techniques and con sumer products The Atomic Energy Com mission which now has 13 research centers established Brookhaven in 1947 as its only completely nonmilitary scientific facility It began operations with the Brook haven Graphite Research Re actor the first atomic re actor constructed for peace ful purposes since shut down Physicists used it to study the structure and properties of the atom Since then Brookhaven scientists have branched out into many sub divisions of physics chemistry biology medicine and mathematics The diversification in dis cipline has led to a diversity in the views of scientists Though ecologists argue the case for more practical re search physicists argue on different grounds that the simple pursuit of knowledge is worthy of an advanced society Brookhavens scientific complex is situated near the center of Long Island on the 7500acre grounds of what began in World War I as the Armys Camp Upton Most of the 40 major buildings oc cupy a large clearing in a vast forest that is partly na tive and partly the legacy of the Civilian Conservation Corps which lived and worked there during the Depression Many of the Army build ings still stand renovated from World War II when they served first for basic training then as housing for prisoners of war and finally as a medical rehabilitation center Today there are many new buildings with lab oratories offices and living space for visiting scientists Life in Brookhaven is an formal often relaxed With the exception of many phy sicians who wear coats and ties most of the scientists dress casually few even bothering with the tradition al white coat Long hair and beards are not unusual The atmosphere is that of a large college campus without students There is even a fourpage underground newspaper the Brookhaven Free Press which appears every month or so Articles generally in veigh against the Indochina war weapons research and pollution and for abortion law reform civil rights and more employe participation in Brookhavens administra tion Brookhaven employs some 3400 people including about 1000 scientists engi neers and other professionals and about 700 technicians At any given time scores of outside scientists are living on the grounds in dormitories and apartments They come to Brookhaven from all over the world to use its facili ties for their experiments A National Resource Because so few accelera tors and reactors are built for research the practice is to permit outside scientists with worthy ideas to share the equipment In many ways accelerators like the ones at Brookhaven are con sidered a national scientific resource For all the breadth of Brookhavens activity most of its budget still goes for physics research and the largest share of that sup ports highenergy physics ex periments that use one of the most expensive scientific de vices built for use on earth the 33billionelectronvolt synchroton which cost 34 million in 1960 It is a halfmilediameter ring of powerful electromag nets that can take a cluster of protons propel them around and around the circle ever faster until they have acquired sufficient energy to be beamed into a target When the speeding protons collide with the nuclei of target atoms part of the en ergy is converted into matter subatomic particles that fly off in different directions ac cording to their nature Study of the particles gives clues to the nature of matter Brookhaven is converting its synchrotron to be more efficient by adding a 49mil lion device that injects a volley of protons into the circular synchrotron more than twice as often as the old injector did This will allow experiments some of which take months to be carried out in less time Protons By the Trillions Under construction since 1967 and scheduled to begin operating this August the new injector is designed elec tronically to stampede two trillion freely drifting protons through a long airless tube that guides them into the synchrotron It does this by turning on and off a series of electrical charges down the tube so that the protons are attracted from one direction and re pelled from the other The effect is something like that of a bucket brigade in which each person adds a small in crement of speed to the bucket as it is passed along The synchrotron takes the cluster of protons and oper ating much like the injector propels them around its cir cle 330000 times in one second until the protons are moving at more than 999 per cent of the speed of light 186000 miles per sec ond Then the protons are beamed into a target This is the point at which the science gets done I really feel that high energy physics should be done said Dr Mark Sakitt a physicist who is also a leader of the antiwar move ment at Brookhaven This is how we get at the funda mentals of what our world is made of We use these machines to study the nature of matter and we find some very beautiful things Physicists like Dr Sakitt frequently speak of their subatomic realms as having elegance or great beauty Sometimes however findings that are difficult to interpret come up For example physicists are now beginning to suspect that just as atoms were found to comprise many par ticles such as electrons pro tons and neutrons so these particles may themselves have constituent pieces Fur ther study is needed to learn whether this is true These are questions that excite physicists said Dr Goldhaber We feel they should be answered This probing the frontier of knowledge this walking be tween light and dark pro duces a different kind of feeling The attitude is valu able in other fields Ecology research at Brook haven began nearly 11 years ago when scientists put a chunk of highly radioactive cesium in the middle of a forest to see what would re sult from longterm exposure The cesium was installed inside a wellprotected 50 acre area in the fall That next spring the nearest trees failed to sprout leaves With each passing year the circle of death spread wider leav ing stark skeletons of once lush trees and shrubs Its pretty eerie out here observed Richard Houghton ecology research associate as he stood on the edge of the ravaged circle It makes you think its going to be pretty difficult recovering from a nuclear war Dr George M Woodwell head of ecology research be lieves mans difficulties in survival are coming fast enough without a nuclear war He is beginning a series of projects to measure the local and global impacts of man on the environment Between the physicists drive to comprehend the sim plest units of matter and the ecologists need to under stand the most complex or ganizations of that matter lies much of the other work at Brookhaven Medical men played a major role in developing Ldopa a drug that shows prom ise in treating Parkinsons more were spent this way Electronics researchers are working on new kinds of electromagnets that produce more magnetism for less electricity than existing types do Biologists are using radia tioninduced mutations to de velop plants that are more diseaseresistant and also to study aging on the theory that it may result from ac cumulated chromosome dam age caused by natural radiation Research in these and in all the other areas at Brook haven will have cost the na tion 473million for the year ending this June 30 Some would argue the money could have been bet ter spent Others would wish more were spent this way

proposed by Governor Rocke feller creating a state agency to oversee the development and use of private and public lands in the sixmillionacre Adirondack Park  The bill passed 123 to 24 after an hour of debate in which Assemblymen from the vast northern tractthe size of Vermontargued unsuccess fully that it had been hastily presented to the Legislature and violated the homerule powers of the Adirondack localities The bill which is expected to be approved tomorrow by the Senate gives the state some controls over the hap hazard development of the region According to Mr Rocke feller it would insure opti mum overall conservation preservation development and use of the unique scenic his toric ecological and natural re sources of the park The debate lacked the ex pected acrimony Only a few days ago sources in the Gov ernors office expressed doubt that the hill would pass be cause of the pressures put on upstate legislators by land developers Disputes Are Settled But most of the disputes were reconciled behind the scenes and Mr Rockefellers staff agreed to some amend ments that soothed lawmakers from the area although the re visions did not persuade them to vote for the bill The bill would create an Adirondack Park Agency com posed of the director of the Office of Planning Services the Commissioner of Environmen tal Conservation and seven members to be appointed by Mr Rockefeller with the con sent of the Senate One of the concessions won by the area representatives was that four of the seven ap pointees be fulltime residents of the park area The agency will be required to submit a master plan for the park by June 1 1972 In the interim it is empowered to re view and approve land develop ments that exceed more than five acres or more than five lots within the park The bill is designed to imple ment some of the proposals made by the Temporary Com mission on the Future of the Adirondacks in a report to Mr Rockefeller in January Other developments as the Legislature inched toward hopedfor adjournment tomor row included the following ABORTION PROCEDURES Final legislative approval was given in the Assembly to three bills aimed at providing stricter regulations in abortion proce dures The bills would do the following prohibit commercial profitmaking abortion referral services from operating in the state and mandate that such services be handled by medical societies and nonprofit groups such as Planned Parenthood bar feesplitting between hos pitals and referral services that refer patients in volume and protect an abortion patients privacy by prohibiting referral services from providing infor mation on clients to anyone other than a lawenforcement agency INDEPENDENT PETITIONS Final approval was given to a bill increasing the number of nominating petitions that inde pendent candidates must ob tain to get on a ballot Oppo nents of the bill said that it was designed to discourage in dependent officeseekers A candidate for statewide office would have to obtain 20000 signatures instead of the pres ent 12000 Citywide office seekers in New York City would have to obtain 7500 signatures while borough of ficeseekers would need 5000 In a related development final passage was given to a bill barring a candidate who has received and accepted the nomination of a major party from accepting any independ ent endorsement for the same election Thus a Republican with Conservative backing could not run on the Conserv ative line on the ballot MARIJUANA OFFENSES After lengthy debate the As sembly gave final passage to a bill permitting a years delay before youths are tried in first offense cases for possessing up to a quarter of an ounce of marijuana The cases would be referred to youth counselors and the intent of the bill is to lessen the chance that a first of fender would be brought to trial and have a criminal record TEMPORARY COMMISSIONS The Assembly approved con tinuing the existence of several temporary state commissions including one to revise the social services law and one on cultural institutions A bill to continue the de Ia Salle Tercen tenary Commission in commem oration of the 300th anni versary of the de Ia Salle Expedition triggered debate As semblyman Seymour Posner a Bronx Democrat quoted from encyclopedia articles indicating that de la Salle was a minor explorer given to instability of character Mr Posner said the explorer had only visited the state twice the last time on a trip to the Bronx while he was on his way to visit his sisterinlaw in New Jersey The commission was continued and received a reappropriation of 15000 GAMBLING STUDY Final passage was given in the Assembly to a bill permit ting the state OffTrack Pari Mutuel Betting Commission to study and analyze legalized gambling in the state The bill gives the commission subpoena powers BIGCITY AUDITS Final legislative approval was given to a bill requiring Con troller Arthur Levitt to audit the school districts of New York Buffalo and Rochester each year The bill resulted from disclosure this year that the New York City Board of Education had overspent its budget by many millions of dol lars SUNDAY BLUE LAWS

"Australian Women's Lib Says: ‘Make War, Not Love’",https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/13/archives/australian-womens-lib-says-make-war-not-love.html,SYDNEY Australia June 12 On the inside of the wooden front door at 67 Glebe Point Road in the middleclass sub urb of Glebe someone had scrawled with crayon in big letters Make War Not Love The slogan is one of the bat tle cries of the spreading wom ens liberation movement in Australia a country where male dominance is a tradition as firmly entrenched as the popular belief in the comrade ly relationship among men known here as mateship These traditions like the widespread and disputed asser tion of egalitarianism as an Australian national trait are said to be heritages from the days when most white settlers in Australia were convicts Male convicts outnumbered fe male convicts overwhelmingly The inconspicuous house in Glebe is a center of activism in the womens lib movement here Besides being the head quarters of a pioneer womens lib organization called the Glebe Group it is the editorial office of the movements bi monthly journal Mejane named from an inversion of the line in the Tarzan movies Me Tarzan You Jane Grievances aired In Mejane and in conversations with lead ers of womens lib ranged from the Australian habit of segre gating by sexes at social gath erings to discriminatory em ployment practices official neg lect of working mothers and rigid antiabortion laws At mixed parties according to Gale King an artist and member of the Mejane staff Australian men would never think that women were there to talk to They stand on the other side of the room and ogle you and think they would like to race you off to bed Australian men dont knots how to treat women in bed Mrs Beatrice Faust a leader Id the abortion law reform movement in Melbourne told an Australian interviewer The best known Australian feminist is Germaine Greer the author of the book The Fe male Eunuch The London Edi tion distributed in the British Commonwealth is a best seller here according to sources in the trade A practical book the re viewer said of The Female Eunuch The woman manager of a leading Sydney bookstore who has not read the book herself said Everyone here who has read it agrees with it There are at least 12 wom ens lib groups in the Sydney area including one at each of the citys three universities ac cording to Mejane The move ment is spreading gradually to other cities Womens liberation in Aus tralia is not a freakish child of America We have our own traditions says a headline in the March issue of Mejane over an article describing an Aus tralian womens suffrage move ment going back to the 1880s Australian women got the vote on a national basis in 1902 long before most other coun tries Womens lib activists in Aus tralia have never burned bra Sue Bellamy a member of the Glebe Group told a re cent male visitor She de nounced such demonstrations at a symbol We are serious said Mrs Mavis Robertson member of al leftist oriented womens lib organization called the Work ing Womens Group which meets in the Sydney Trade Union Club The Glebe Group after a re cent meeting went to a leading Sydney department store that had a Mothers Day display They plastered the windows with posters saying This Ex ploits Women Who Makes the Most Out of Mothers Day and Mothers Want Peace Not Presents Activists also painted over department store windows dis playing foundation garments A group in Adelaide distributed leaflets on contraception and had a very hostile reception from many mothers of school Igirls as well as some lauda tory mail and phone calls Another Sydney group stormed the New South Wales 1Legislature with a petition for repeal of the stiff law against abortion Abortion Widely Restricted The operation is available on demand legally in only one of the six Australian states South Australia where Roman Catholic religious influence is weakest because there was never a penal colony there and hence no Irish political prison ers University girls in the wool ens lib movement have spe cialized in invading the Men only rooms of the Sydney pubs like the militants who in tegrated the once allmale Mc Sorleys in New York The result of the Sydney pub forays has been mixed Some pubs readily integrated some did not some never had a segration policy anyway As far as the law is con cerned a woman can enter any bar But neighborhood customs may be a different matter said a spokesman for the liquor industry Many womens lib groups are active in opposition to con scription and the Vietnam war in which Australia has a small contingent But the movement is far from leftist in political coloration said Beverley Dun nen who works on Mejane and also has a fulltime job at the Sydney Antiwar Center Mrs Robertson of the Work ing Womens Group is also the only woman member of the National Executive of the Aus tralian Communist party She was outraged recently when one of the men at a party meeting said that his wife was not along because she had to mind the baby Her role in the party she said has been assailed by some womens liberationists as male chauvinist tokenism

Madrid Psychiatrist Faces Jail For His Sex Survey of Students,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/17/archives/madrid-psychiatrist-faces-jail-for-his-sex-survey-of-students.html,MADRID June 16In many countries an investigation of this type would bring offers of fellowships I suppose it is a matter of some sociological interest that here it has led to criminal charges The speaker Dr Nicolas Caparros is a thin 30yearold psychiatrist with a thick black beard and an extensive practice among young people He faces a jail sentence of up to six months for circulating questionnaires at the University of Madrid last year as part of a study of sex attitudes and practices Kinsey Masters and Johnson the American specialists in sex research are not unknown in Spain but they have neither been published nor imitated here Aware of the rigid public attitudes on the subject of sex Dr Caparros conducted his survey with considerable discretionsacrificing he acknowledges a measure of scientific reliability No personal interviews were sought and the 6000 questionnaires were anonymous They were handed to students or slipped through their mailboxes with a note asking that they be mailed back only if the recipient felt able to answer them fully A Shameless Survey Nevertheless a local newspaper published an angry editorial on what it called a shameless survey A police inquiry followed and last month on the complaint of the Supreme Court prosecutor Dr Caparros was charged with creating a public scandal If the response of the authorities dismayed the doctor that of the students delighted him Nearly onequarter of the questionnaires were returned fully  and apparently frankly  filled out Considering the number of questions  370  and the details they ask about subjects that are not publicly discussed here such as masturbation and sexual initiation the rate of return was very high While awaiting his trial which may not come until next year Dr Caparros has been quietly collating the results of the survey His predicament is symptomatic of a general contradiction in Spanish society An older generation maintains rigid public if not private standards for what is permissible sexually culturally and politically and a younger generation seeks to move at least part way toward the more liberal standards of the rest of Europe Magazine Accused In recent months in fact there have been signs of an official crackdown on attitudes that elsewhere would seem fairly mild The magazine Triunfo has been charged with two administrative and two penal offenses for devoting an issue to the state of matrimony in Spain The unremarkable conclusion of the magazine was that Spanish women suffer from legal and sexual discrimination Perhaps the strongest statement in the whole issue was that of Lidia Falcon a lawyer who said that if the battle for legal divorce was ever won in Spain it would be time to fight for the abolition of marriage There have been officially inspired editorials lately urging a crackdown on what is termed a wave of pornography at the university an apparent allusion to the recent vogue for the works of the late Dr Wilhelm Reich the controversial psychoanalyst who was a pioneer of the bodyoriented therapies that are popular today But you see Dr Caparros said recently I get patients who belong to Reich reading groups at the university and who it turns out have never so much as kissed anyone Because work on the questionnaires is only partly completed Dr Caparros can present few broad or firm conclusions He has however come up with some interesting details Little Home Instruction For example sexual instruction appears to be all but nonexistent in homes of the Spanish middle and uppermiddle classesto which most of the students belong Only 7 per cent learned from their families schools or priests how babies are conceived The other 93 per cent had to rely on friends books or other means One figure that surprised Dr Caparros was the number of students who said they had experienced coitus at least once For men students it was 38 per cent for women 34 per cent There was a decided watershed in Spain four or five years ago he said It marked real generation break Other parts of the study however find a decided gap between sexual liberation in theory and in practice Twentyfive per cent of the students favored abortion and yet more than 16 per centapparently with considerable overlaphad never used any form of sexual caress Dr Caparros has found a tendency for students holding advanced political views to hold advanced views on sex But he has not found that these students are less inhibited in sexual practice than those whose ideas are more conservative We have in fact a student left of astonishing virginity he said
Can America Grow Up?,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/17/archives/can-america-grow-up.html,In 1950 there were 151 million Americans Today there are 208 million By the year 2000only 29 years from nowthat number is expected to swell to roughly 300 million In other words if present growth patterns persist the population of the United States will double in the last half of the twentieth century Citing those statistics Senator Cranston of California and 26 other Senators have introduced a joint resolution putting Congress on record in favor of zero population growth The fact that the cosponsors come from both parties and across the political spectrum from Barry Goldwater to George McGovern is positive proof that the population issue has moved to the forefront of public concern There are several misunderstandings concerning this countrys population problem There Is the belief that the introduction of the birth control pill and the wider availability of abortion are rapidly reducing the birth rate It is true that the birth rate which stood at 25 live births per thousand in 1957 declined during the subsequent decade But that decline leveled off in the last two years Last year it was approximately eighteen per thousand or nearly twice the death rate As we noted yesterday multiple births are rising because of increased use of hormones to combat infertility and in other respects as well there is nothing less than a scientific revolution going on at the present time in the field of human reproduction Women in their twenties produce the most children This country is beginning to have a rising number women in that age bracket These young women and their husbands are the babies born during the population boom of the late nineteenforties and early nineteenfifties A second myth is that excessive childbearing is primarily a phenomenon of the leasteducated low income elements in society It Is true that this group has proportionately more children But seven out of every ten children are born to middleand upperincome families In other words even if the poor began to have children at the same rate as the society as a whole this country would still have a rapidly rising population Yet a third mistaken belief is that if every American family began immediately to have just two children the problem would be solved Because of the postWorld War II population boom even the twochild family would mean continued population growth until the year 2037 when Americas population would level off at 277 million more than onethird greater than it is now The joint resolution introduced In the Senate proposes no drastic remedies It urges stabilizing the population by voluntary means consistent with human rights and individual conscience Its objective is to provide a declaration of national policy as well as a positive context in which the necessary attitudes policies and research can evolve If zero population growth is to be achieved many popular attitudes and expectations will have to change For three centuries Americans dwelling in a nearly empty richly endowed continent developed a cult growth Small towns dreamed that the railroad would bring growth or that new industry would boom land values The booster became an American stereotype and unending growth a national obsession But now Americans have to develop the selfdiscipline to prevent an overcrowded and impoverished society The question is no longer whether America will grow but whether Americans can grow up
Presbyterian Unity Is Foreseen; Compromise War Stand Taken,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/19/archives/presbyterian-unity-is-foreseen-compromise-war-stand-taken.html,MASSANETTA SPRINGS Va June 18The onemillionmember Presbyterian Church in the United States Southern ended its sixday General Assembly here this afternoon determined to stay together The Rev Dr Ben Lacy Rose newly elected Moderator or spiritual leader of the denomination said he did not see any immediate prospect of a split in the denomination Asked to comment on fears that the church was on the brink of breaking apart over differences between conservatives and liberals he replied in an interview I do not see our church going into schism Weve got to learn to live with diversity all the way across the board He was critical however of conservative factions in the church that have opposed reunion with the threemillionmember United Presbyterian Church and fought the churchs involvement in social action Both the Southern and United Presbyterians have begun twoyear study of a draft plan of reunion They split over the slavery issue during the Civil War The current Presbyterian problem is common to other churches In essence it pits advocates of innovation renewal social action and Christian unity against the defenders of tradition who criticize the socalled social gospel and want emphasis on evangelism and personal salvation Divisions within the Presbyterian Church in the US have been so serious however that church leaders have feared that some churches or presbyteries which are local governing units might break away over merger race or other issues Compromise on War Issue On the Vietnam war issue the Assembly came up with a compromise by combining and then approving two separate and amended resolutions One declared that the continuation of the conflict cannot be morally justified and that the killing must be stopped The other supported President Nixon in his efforts and those of the Government to bring about an end to the unfortunate conflict in Indochina and for the disengagement and return of our forces What was deleted were pleas to both sides to call an immediate ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of all United States forces in the immediate future It was suggested that the 400 commissioners or delegates express their views on the war to Mr Nixon and the Congress by letter by telephone and in person Sunday Oct 3 was also designated as a day of prayer and fasting for our concerns about the war and its consequences During the meeting here in this church conference center in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley the Assembly also took the following actions It reaffirmed its 1970 stand on abortion which declared The willful termination of pregnancy by medical means n the considered decision of a pregnant woman may on occasion be morally justifiable The procedure should be performed only by licensed physicians under optimal conditions and with appropriate medical consultation and ministerial counseling It called upon churchgoers to support and strengthen in every way possible the unified racially inclusive public school system in their communities and not support any group or educational institution which opposes a unified racially inclusive public school system This was obviously aimed at private schools recently established in the South to circumvent integration It supported the aims of the Consultation on Church Union which is seeking the eventual merger of nine Protestant denominations into one church with some 25 million members Only once before in more than a century was a plan formulated to bring the two churches together That plan initiated in 1955 by the United Presbyterian Church was defeated by the Southern Presbyterians The slavery issue has long been dead but over the years Southerners have regarded their Northern brothers as too liberal both theologically and sociologically
"For Gesell, Controversy Is Routine",https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/20/archives/for-gesell-controversy-is-routine.html,WASHINGTON June 19Controversial decisions are almost routine for Gerhard Alden Gesell the Federal District judge who late last night refused a Government request to halt The Washington Posts publication of a series of articles based on a Pentagon study It was not the first time that the 61yearold judge had made a decision of potentially farreaching consequence Two years ago he ruled that the District of Columbias abortion law was too restrictive and he broadened it to permit abortions virtually at a physicians discretion The ruling was not allowed to stand by the Supreme Court More recently the judge a Democrat and a graduate of Yale Law School ruled that the United Mine Workers president W Anthony Boyle and several others were guilty of misuse of union welfare funds The decision forced Mr Boyles retirement as a trustee of the unions welfare and retirement fund One friend has said of the judge that perhaps his most impressive quality as a jurist is his willingness and desire to come to grips with the issue in a case and to rule on the substance rather than duck it instead of seizing on a technicality to avoid a ruling His incisiveness may be a restilt of a legal expertise gained during more than 25 years of law practice in Washington where he was a member and later a partner of Covington  Burling one of Washingtons most renowned law firms The whitehaired pinkchecked judge the son of the famous pediatrician Dr Arnold Gesell is noted for his equanamity in court but is said to be a stickler for protocol in his chambers A few years back a woman recalled she had stopped by his office and picked up the nearest telephone Judge Gesell walked in furiously and told me if I said one more thing Id be in contempt of court she said I said My God the son of a great pediatrician and here he is losing his cool

City's Year‐Old Abortion Record Hailed,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/30/archives/citys-yearold-abortion-record-hailed.html,  In the first year under the nations most liberal abortion law New York City doctors have performed more abor tions165000than anyone thought possible a year ago maintaining what health offi cials regard as an excellent safety record Despite a host of institu tional difficulties public confusion and professional footdragging when the law took effect last July 1 today there are almost as many abortions being done as there are babies born in the city 950 abortions for every 1000 births And the number of abortions continues to grow rapidly At the same time the rate of medical complications has been lower than expected and compares favorably with that in other countries with liberal abortion laws A Good Example Basically the New York law leaves the decision to have an abortion up to the woman anditer doctor within the first 24 weeks of preg nancy It contains no resi dency requirement and 64 per cent of the abortions in the city have been performed on women from other states and other countries We have set a good ex ample for other states to fol low said Dr Jean Pakter head of maternal services for the city New York would be happy to relinquish its role as abortion center for the coun try At a news conference yes terday Gordon Chase the citys Health Services Admin istrator said that the catastrophe many foresaw a year ago failed to material ize We have been able to serve our residents as well as sub stantial numbers of outof state women and most im portant we are serving wom en safely he said Abortion capabilities out side of the city have evolved much more slowly The abor tions performed in other parts of the state will account for only about 20 per cent of the projected total of 207000 abortions in the first year and most of those were done in only five counties  Nas sau Suffolk Westchester Erie and Monroe Some of the counties have reported only a handful of abortions and a few have re ported none at all But a check of several major cities indicated that the needs there were being met Only about 3 per cent of the citys abortion patients are from upstate Trends throughout the year continued to move in direc tions that buoyed the hearts of city health officials At yesterdays news conference officials cited the following statistics More women today are seeking their abortions early in pregnancy when the pro cedure is safest easiest and least costly In July and Aug ust 686 per cent of the abor tions were done before the 13th week of pregnancy This percentage is now over 80 Medical complications as sociated with legal abortions have declined from a rate of 124 for each 1000 abortions at the outset to 87 for each 1000 by midJune The mortality rate s also dropping As of February there had been 15 abortion associated deaths eight of which followed abortions per formed under legal auspices There have been no deaths reported in the last four months Nonwhite and poor women who had little access to legal abortions prior to last July apparently are getting abor tions without much difficulty under the new law In the first six months nonwhites and Puerto Ricans received half the abortions done on women in the city and in the first nine months 31 per cent of New York City abortions done on state residents were reimbursable under Medic aid Illegal Operations Down Health officials also cited with gratification statistics indicating that the number of illegal abortions had in deed dropped since legal abortions became readily available Hospitals in the city report that they are treating far fewer victims of botched abortions than they did in years past The maternal mortality rate  to which criminal abortions have al ways contributed a major Portionis now at a record low of 23 for each 10000 live births compared with 52 for each 10000 at this time last year Illegitimate births have al so decreased for the first time in more than a decade and the rate of live births has begun to fall off in the municipal hospitals after years of steady increase All efforts in the Legisla ture to curtail the law with crippling amendments or re peal it entirely have thus far failed None of the proposals to amend the law even came to a vote during the last session The only action the Legis lature took concerning abor tions was to ban profitmak ing referral services and fee splitting between hospitals and referral services and to assure the confidentiality of abortion records Largely through the pres sure of nonprofit groups and the prolifration of lowcost abortion clinics the cost of an abortion has come down dramatically Whereas in July an early abortion was likely to cost 300 to 600 today no woman should have to pay more than 250 The cost of a late abortion has dropped from about 800 to about 400 Procedures Change Implementation of the abortion law has ushered in an entirely new approach to the delivery of health care More than half the abortions in the city have been per formed without costly over night hospitalization either as outpatient procedures in hospitals or in freestanding clinics Abortion clinics have sprung up throughout the city with current estimates of the number ranging well into the twenties and new ones are opening every week However only a few  the medically sound ones that handle large numbers of pa tients at low cost  are ex pected to survive Some communities how ever have moved to prevent abortions in clinics and re strict them to hospitals Dr Nathanson who had been highly skeptical of the citys ability to handle the abortion program remarked the other day I look around one year later and Im astonished to find how smoothly efficient ly safely and inexpensively its all worked out despite the prophets of gloom and disaster

Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/02/archives/the-vacation-reading-list.html,Lately people had been asking the re viewer to recommend some nice relaxing books to take on vacation with me But the reviewer found himself reluctant to answer them He had never much believed in vacation reading lists suspecting as he did that the urge to compile or read them was connected more with fantasies of the vacation than the real thingwith visions of hammock and beach that left out of the picture sand family responsibilities and other interferences Besides the re viewer was a secret puritan and thought that if people actually were going to read on vacation they should read the impor tant stuff they hadnt gotten around to beforeTolstoy Proust Gibbon the com plete works of James Fenimore Cooper the best books of last winternot special lazy books In fact now that he stopped to think about it the reviewer loathed vacation reading lists not to mention the prose that usually went into them Heres a diverting little ax murder to tickle you on a rainy afternoon  All the same the reviewer now had to consider certain facts The publishing sea son had slimmed down somewhat so that there were fewer books absolutely crying out to be reviewed Yet there had ac cumulated on his desk a pile of books that seemed at least worth mentioning The reviewer now faced his own vacation And the pile of books on his desk seemed in a way to reflect his own vacation fan tasies The Population Crisis To begin with theme were two books attacking our automobile culture Kenneth R Schneiders Autokind vs Mankind An Analysis of Tyranny a Proposal for Re bellion a Plan for Reconstruction 267 pages Norton 795 whose title more or less spoke for itself and Tabor R Stones Beyond the Automobile Reshaping the Transportation Environment 148 pages PrenticeHall 595 a carefully consid ered though succinct and even witty analysis of the advantages of a good mass transit system over our present highway chaos Let the vacationer consider those two books after driving to their destina tions the reviewer chortled or let them read them on the road for the reviewer distinctly remembered that a few years ago he had read about a hundred pages of a book called Tunnels while caught in a traffic jam in the Holland Tunnel no joke Next the reviewer would suggest that people enjoying peaceful isolated geta ways should read Dean Frasers The Peo ple Problem What You Should Know About Growing Population and Vanishing Resources 248 pages Indiana 695 an excellent if somewhat overbreezily writ ten summary of the impending world pop ulation crisis by a professor of virology and From Now to Zero Fertility Con traception and Abortion in America by Leslie Aldridge Westoff and Charles F Westoff 358 pages Little Brown 795 a lowkey but interestingly revealing ex amination and interpretation of the Na tional Fertility Study carried out in 1965 by the Office of Population Research at Princeton Then the reviewer planned to suggest that vacation time when the division of domestic labor usually gets altered some what might be a good time to read Wo man in Sexist Society Studies in Power and Powerlessness 515 pages Basic 1250 a collection of more than two dozen scholarly articles that seek to lay a foundation for a program of womans studies edited by Vivian Gornick and Barbara k Moran and Mans World Womans Place A Study in Social Mythol ogy by Elizabeth Janeway 319 pages Morrow 895 Both of these are books that help to calm and deepen the debate over womens liberation Let the slumber ing vacation mind wake to such Issues as these Feeling More Benign But having gotten such reoommenda tions out of his system the reviewer began to feel more benign Perhaps he was feel ing the first tendrils of vacation relaxa tion creeping over him in any case his eye now fell on what he had to admit were more appropriate books Calvin Trillins funny and touching US Journal 314 pages Dutton 650 a collection of re ports on local dramas from all over the American scene that originally appeared in The New Yorker or Peter Tompkinss Secrets of the Great Pyramid 416 pages Harper  Row 1250 a sometimes ar cane but generally exciting and attrac tively illustrated investigation of the mys teries of the Great Pyramid of Cheops or Broken Waters Sing Rediscovering Two Great Rivers of the West 283 pages Little BrownSports Illustrated 695 Gaylord Stavelys dramatic account of run ning the Green and Colorado Rivers in a wooden boat powered only by oars or Miriam Underhills Give Me the Hills 278 pages VikingChatham 695 the autobiography of a female mountain climber who pioneered manless climb In fact go rapidly was the reviewers metabolism slowing down now that he could no longer hide from the fact that something does happen to the vacationing mind that last summer it had taken him hundreds of hours to read one short his torical monograph hed meant to improve his mind with and that in despenation he had even laid aside a copy of Mario Puzos The Godfather which hed not yet read for the next time out So the reviewer finally had to admit that if he were you he would most definitely take along to the seashore Pierre Salingers novel On In structions of My Government 408 pages Doubleday 695 to get lost in And per haps James Micheners The Drifters 751 pages Random House 10 or Joseph Hayess Like Any Other Fugitive 446 pages Dial 795both long light and absorbing As for the reviewer himself well sev eral moods ago he had had ambitious plans But come to think of it there was this work to be done on the house and garden so his reading would probably be restricted to Wymans Gardening Encyclopedia by Donald Wyman 1222 pages Macmillan 1750 a seemingly exhaustive reference book from which the reviewer hoped something could be learned about garden ing the Homeowners Complete Outdoor Building Book by John Burton Brinier 470 pages Popular ScienceHarper  Row 895 a rather tasteless set of designs with interesting structural possibilities and The Complete Book of Pitfalls A Victims Guide to Repairs Maintenance and Repairing the Maintenance by Dereck Williamson 149 pages

coast The measure preserves the Dela ware Bay and Atlantic coastlines for recreation and tourism On the ground that heavy in dustry in the coastal area would add greatly to pollution of the beach waters the bill specifically prohibits refineries steel mills petrochemical complexes and off shore bulk transfer terminals It does not bar such nonpolluting industries as garment factories automobile assembly plants and jewelry and leather goods manu facturing establishments Both houses of the State Legis lature approved the bill despite strong opposition from the Cham ber of Commerce heavy

DIP IN BIRTH RATE ON RELIEF ROLLS REPORTED BY CITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/05/archives/dip-in-birth-rate-on-relief-rolls-reported-by-city-sugarman-calls.html,A dramatic reduction in births among welfare recipients here was disclosed yesterday by Hu man Resources Administrator Jule M Sugarman who attrib uted the decline to the impact of family planning services In an interview Mr Sugar man said a staff study had shown a decline from one of every five women on welfare 20 per cent giving birth to a child in 1968 to one of every nine 11 per cent last year While he did not have the study nor the precise statistics on hand he said there were ap proximately 250000 women here in the welfare category designated Aid to Families with Dependent Children This he noted would indicate a reduc tion from some 50000 births three years ago to about 27000 last year Job Effort Reported On another matter Mr Sugarman reported an effort by the city government to link the states newly mandated program of public jobs for em ployable relief recipients in re turn for their welfare checks to the forthcoming Federal program for public service jobs The hope Mr Sugarman said is to develop some career progression so that for ex ample a relief recipient as signed to a hospital as an or derly to work out his walfare check might look forward to a Federal opportunity for train ing as a paraprofessional such as a nurses aide In response to questions Mr Sugarman said the reduction in births had been most notice able in blackpopulated areas lof the city Puerto Ricans by contrast do net appear to be using the family planning serv ices he said We have long believed and long said Mr Sugarman asserted that people dont want to have children on welfare They know the problems on welfare The real problem has been availability of in formation Through 1967 amendments to the Social Security Act Mr Sugarman said the Federal Government made it mandatory for persons receiving grants un der Air to Families with De pendent Children to be offered family planning services Thereafter he went on New York State law and regulations required that as caseworkers first met each applicant they must offer such information The City Department of Social Services of which he is also Commissioner gives out pam phlets and advice to those inter ested but primarily it refers them to some of the many family planning services here Mr Sugarman stressed that no pressure was put on re lief recipients to use the birth limitation services In the 1967 amendments Congress stipu lated that acceptance by those aided must be voluntary and must not be a prerequisite for welfare help It has been estimated that the new state program will re quire some 60000 employable homerelief and family recipi ents here to report twice month to State Employment Service offices to pick up wel fare checks and be referred to jobs After 30 days if no regular jobs are available they are to work in public jobs The pro gram started Thursday President Nixon has indi cated he will shortly sign the Emergency Employment Act of 1971 under which Congress called for creating up to 200 000 public jobs nationwide in cluding transitional skill train ing Mr Sugarman estimated that 5000 of these might be available to New York City some 30 to 60 days from now Mr Sugarman said Mayor Lindsay had set up a cabinet committee to develop plans un der both programs with Mr Sugarman as chairman and Budget Director Edward K Hamilton as cochairman The Environmental Protection Administration Parks Adminis tration Board of Education and Housing Authority have indi cated they will develop emer gency jobs Mr Sugarman said Under the new Federal job program the city would pay 10 per cent of the salary with the Government paying the re maining 90 per cent There is potential saving for the city if it can move people into these jobs and off welfare rolls for which it now pays 25 per cent of the cost The slowdown in welfare births may hold down welfare costs which are also expected to be affected by the State Legislatures 10 per cent cut in welfare grant levels and last years changes In the state abortion law The citys Health Services Administration estimates that some 165000 abortions were performed here ih the year ended June 30 A study of 51000 involving New York State women indicates that 16000 or 31 per cent were financed by the Medicaid pro gram and state figures show that twothirds of Medicaid beneficiaries are welfare re cipients The city budget voted last month by the Board of Estimate and City Council forecast a slowdown in the growth of the welfare rolls Mayor Lindsay and Budget Director Hamilton accepted the budget only under protest The revised forecast looked to welfare increases of 8000 people a month from July through December and 5000 a month starting next Jan 1 in contrast with the 13000a month rise predicted by the Lindsay administration earlier The slowdown forecast had been pressed by Controller Abraham D Beame based on data showing that relief re cipients actually declined by 398 people here in April with preliminary indications that Mays rise was only about 300 Mr Hamilton however con tended that a similar AprilMay slackening last year was fol lowed by an explosion start ing in June which forced city borrowing to meet a relief deficit during the budget year ended last Wednesday The State Legislature re duced grants for family aid and home relief starting last May 1 from 231 a month here to 208 excluding rent and heat This may reduce particularly the eligibility for home relief which largely in volves supplemental help for the working poor The City Budget Bureau said the final appropriation for the Human Resources Administra tion was 2154900000 in cluding 1946900000 for the Department of Social Services of which 1159200000 was for actual relief payments Last years welfare appropriation was 1718600000 Ted Gross the citys new Commissioner of Youth Serv ices said in a separate inter view yesterday that 10000 to 15000 youths seeking summer Neighborhood Youth Corps jobs here had been left out when the 45000 Federally financed places available to the city had been filled The jobs start to morrow

British Findings on Aspirin May Lead to New Uses for the Drug,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/08/archives/british-findings-on-aspirin-may-lead-to-new-uses-for-the-drug.html,Although aspirin is probably the most widely used of all drugs its mode of action with in the body has defied satis factory explanation for genera tions Now however British researchers believe they have found the answer They have shown that aspirin and its close relatives inhibit the synthesis of hor hormonelike substances known as prostaglandins that can induce fever inflammation and headache The substances discovered relatively recently are believed to play a wide variety of roles affecting such diverse organs as the heart bronchial tubes uterus blood vessels and stomach The possibility of controlling the hormones with aspirinlike drugs has evoked considerable excitement in the British medical community Enormous Significance A British journal The New Scientist refers in its Tune 24 issue to the findings as an event of enormous signifi cance It holds out the pros pect the journal said of pro ducing much improved drugs to deal with such intractable ailments as rheumatic fever Furthermore the journal added the discovery offers hope for a better understanding of how prostaglandins function in the body Some are being used experimentally to induce abortion and there is hope that their control with aspirin like drugs could prevent unwanted miscarriages Aspirintype drugs are now given in massive doses to keep body temperatures down in cases of rheumatic fever The development of a more effec tive treatment has been hampered by uncertainty as to how aspirin does its job The findings on aspirin are reported in Nature a British journal whose June 23 issue was devoted to biology The findings are presented in three reports by researchers at the Institute of Basic Medical Sci ences of the Royal College of Surgeons in London The first report by Dr John R Vane professor of pharma cology tells of studies with guinea pig tissue showing that three aspirinlike drugs impede synthesis of a prostaglandin that in cats is the most potent substance known for the gen eration of fever One of the drugs was aspirin itself acetylsalicylic acid which occurs in a variety of marketed drugs such as Buf ferin and Excedrin Another was indomethacin marketed as Indocin The third was sodium salicylate which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis The lastnamed drug was the least effective against the par ticular prostaglandin used in this test This was considered puzzling since the drug is com parable to aspirin in controlling fever and inflamation Dr Vane Dr Sergio H Fer reira and Dr Salvador Monca da tell in a second report of their finding that aspirin and indomethacin block the release of prostaglandin by an intact organ Normally the spleen of a dog produces large amounts of these hormones when stim ulated for example by adren alin In the tests such produc tion was blocked by these drugs During this work two other researchers at the institute were studying the effect of as pirin on the production of prostaglandin in the platelets of human blood Platelets are the disklike objects that help the blood to clot The researchers Dr J Bryan Smith and Dr Anthony L Wil lis who is now at Stanford Uni versity in California found that platelets in the blood of those who had taken aspirin could not produce prostaglan dins This was the subject of the third report in Nature In assessing the implications of these findings Dr Vane noted that the taking of anti inflammatory acids such as aspirin while using introuter ine devices might account for their occasional failure as con traceptives Some believe intra uterine devices perform their role by stimulating the release of prostaglandins It is at least conceivable that a woman who takes aspirin to relieve a headache is also block ing the production of prosta glandins as a response to stimu lation by an intrauterine device Early Remedy In the June 2 issue of Na ture Dr H O J Collier of Miles Laboratories of Stoke Poges also suggested that since some prostaglandins induce nausea and diarrhea aspirin type drugs may prove useful in treating such conditions He noted that because aspirin seems to subdue the bodys de fense reactionsfever and in flammationhe had suspected an effect on prostaglandins three years ago As early as the 18th century it was observed that an extract of willow tree bark was effec tive in reducing fever The ac tive substance was salicylic acid which was too irritating for wide use Just before the start of the 20th century acetylsalicylic acid was synthesized by chem ists of the Bayer Company and aspirin soon became one of the most widely used of all drugs The prostaglandins got

Reversing a Welfare Trend...,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/10/archives/reversing-a-welfare-trend-.html,Belatedly but still too timidly public officials are be ginning to bring their critical faculties to bear on New York Citys frightfully wasteful and degrading welfare problem that mires more than one million in poverty and burdens the budget For far too long there has been an unwillingness to face the problem squarely to ask the obvious questions to move forcefully in response  The questions that needed asking have been simple ones Who is on welfare Why The answers have been no more difficult to obtain than the steadily rising welfare statistics themselves Women and children in the aidtofamilieswithdependentchil dren category comprise the bulk of the welfare rolls They are on welfare because they have been deserted by males They have been unable to escape from poverty because the women have continued to produce additional children These children in turn have often repeated the welfare cycle The professed reluctance of public officials to interfere with this life style has done both its victims and society a grave disservice Human Resources Admin istrator Jules M Sugarman now indicates that this dark donothing period is ending He cited figures the other day to show that there has been a declining birth rate among women on welfare in this city While there are far more women on welfare than ever before they are producing proportionally fewer children than several years ago The ratio of one birth per five women in 1968 has dropped to one birth per nine women Mr Sugarman credits the citys expanded family plan ning services for this reverse trend These services are still woefully inadequate however failing to reach a significant portion of the women who need them That they nonetheless may be having some salutary impact along with recent abortion law reformsunderscores the desirability of their continued expansion It should be the right of every woman to plan her family to have children when she wants to have them to avoid having children when she wants to avoid having them Illegitimate and unwanted births too easily trans late into human misery as well as public expense What is true for New York City is true for the nation at large where childrenoften unwanted illegitimate childrenand their mothers also form the bulk of the welfare rolls According to the Office of Economic and Social Research a great deal of existing poverty traces to a disproportionate increase in the number of families headed by females There was a 24 per cent rise in such families during the past decade compared to an overall 14 per cent increase in all families To a large degree the femaleheaded family is this nations poverty problem its welfare problem The num ber of families headed by males with incomes below the official poverty level 3700 for a family of four in 1969 declined by onehalf in the past decade but the number of poor families headed by females has remained virtual ly unchanged The poverty problem as it relates to female headed families is especially acute among minority groups living in urban areas Among the black poor for example the proportion of families headed by females is estimated to be 66 per cent This is what makes the new figures released by Mr Sugarman so significant A decline in the birth rate among women on welfare holds some hope for reducing the nations poverty problem and its welfare problem Any successful attack on poverty must be pressed simul taneously along a number of separate fronts Employment job training health education and housing are all pro foundly important Family planning is also important But it has been disgracefully neglected until now
Europe's First Feminist Has Changed the Second Sex,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/11/archives/europes-first-feminist-has-changed-the-second-sex-europes-first.html,THE music at a wedding pro cession always reminds me of the music which leads soldiers into battle Heinrich Heine once remarked at a time when matri mony seemed a less crippling en tanglement than it does today Per haps this explains his later readiness to throw caution to the winds and to marry Eugenie Mirat a Paris grisette with whom he had been living for some years in unheroic sin PARIS No one could accuse Europes lead ing feminist Simone de Beauvoir of lack of courage even though she has steadfastly eschewed the altar and the perils of motherhood Last April she boldly added her signature to a ringing manifesto in which 343 em battled French women many of them members of the MLFMouve ment de Liberation des Femmes publicly admitted that at one time or another they had undergone abor tion in defiance of a law dating from 1923 which provides punish ment therefor of 6 to 24 months in jail and a fine equivalent to 1300 Inasmuch as most French law courts now tend to leniency in judging such offenses the signatories were run ning little risk of mass arrest and collective incarceration The event however was somewhat epochmak ing if only because of the mani festos explosive language A kind of Molotov cocktail in prose it could describe the fetus as a tumor in the stomach refer to women as pro ducers and fling the gauntlet down to fascists of every hue who though they might be loath to admit it included in their ultramontane ranks President Georges Pompidou Minister of Defense Michel Debr and of course the Pope Fifty years ago such brazen fem inine defiance would have touched off a wave of counterterrorism from Frances wellentrenched maleo cracy As it wasand what a weathervane this isthe abortion manifesto provoked little more than a ripple of approval in Pariss left wing press and frowns in other quarters The Pope turned the other cheek Debit still the Catholic arch champion of a France of 100 million Frenchmen played possum and Pompidou lit another cigarette Beauvoirs critics and there are many might have concluded from all this that she was once again in dulging her talent for what the writer Emmanuel Berl has called the joining of lost causes just as they are about to triumph In reality she had no choice The pio neering feminist who 15 years ago supported Dr MarieAndree Weill Halls birthcontrol movement still officially anathema in a largely Catholic country could not but sup port a declaration which as she ex plained to the leftwing weekly Nouvel Observateur seems to me in accord with what I wrote 20 years ago in The Second Sex Her aversion to maternity is not a sentiment she has tried to hide though she has taken pains to make it clear that this is a purely personal point of view Some years ago while commenting favorably on Betty Friedan author of The Feminine Mystique and the mother of three children she declared I see women who can really be called feminine since they marry and have children living in a way I thoroughly approve of They have jobs and increasingly they entertain relations of equality sometimes even of superiority with their husbands For it would be an error to think that to be a feminist one must not have childrenfar from it Her own life history however has been oriented in another direction as is made abundantly clear in the three volumes of her memoirsa fascinating attempt at selfportrayal which will rank I feel certain with Rousseaus Confessions Chateau briands Mmoires outretorribe and George Sands unfortunately in complete Histoire de ma vie as autobiography of enduring value For psychoanalysts it may prove as in teresting as The Second Sex be cause of the insights provided of the youthful influences which go into the making of a militant feminist SIMONE de BEAUVOIR was born in 1908 into a respectable bourgeois family in Paris Her aristocratic Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter The Prime of Life and Force of Circumstance father was a Voltairian skep tic and an unbeliever her mother of provincial Verdun stock was an eminently pious lady who never missed a mass if she could help it The con sequence of this as the daughter was later to remark is that I grew used to con sidering my intellectual life incarnated in my father and my spiritual life directed by my mother as two radically different domains between which no intercourse was pos sible Saintliness was of an other order from intelligence and human thingsculture politics business customs and usagesdid not stem from religion Thus I banished God from the world which was destined to influence the later course of my evolution pro foundly  This disequilibri um which condemned me to a perpetual soulsearching largely explains why I became an intellectual THIS of course is only part of the story For in describ ing her infancy Beauvoir was equally frank in admitting that when she was only 7 or 8 she began to find organic phenomena a bore During her vacations in her grand fathers country house at Meyrignac in the Limousin she could get no particular thrill out of feeding the hens or the rabbits She was large ly insensitive to the softness of fur or eiderdown and as she bluntly admits I have never liked animals Col ettes first question to her when they met years later was Do you like animals The answer was a forthright No The young Simone could accept the idea of maternity provided it excluded its feed ing aspects Her main inter est when playing with her younger sister Poupette was to give their dolls an ideal education   But I refused to let a man frustrate me of my responsibilities our hus bands traveled In real life I knew it was different the mother of a family is always flanked by a husband and a thousand fastidious chores oppress her When I thought of my future these servitudes seemed so weighty that I gave up having children of my own what mattered was forming minds and souls I woluld be a teacher I de cided And she added at the end of the next paragraph I dreamed of myself as the absolute foundation of myself and as my own apotheosis What makes this confession so illuminating is the nexus of associations it reveals the psychic raw material out of which Simone de Beauvoir was to weave her life and her eventual career as an apostle of female liberation For it is clear that her antipathy to household work antedates the economic crisis which over took her family after World War I when her father ruined by the loss of Russian railroad bonds had to take a job in a shoe factory and her mother had to get rid of the maid and do all the drudg ery in a cramped bathless apartment on the Rue de Ren nes in paris Simone as her father used to say of his precocious ly intelligent daughter has the brain of a man It was a brain which was at home in the empyrean of theory but neither the hand nor the body could ever quite keep pace She was interested enough in the pattern to be able to complete a tapestry but her sewing and knitting were positively disastrous She learned to read English well but her pronunciation was dreadful She could de cipher a music score but her singing was painfully offkey and her piano playing was so clumsy that in endofterm trials she usually ended up near the foot of the class In all theoretical subiects mathematics for example she shone but her handwrit ing was deplorably sloppy and unlike her yolunger sis ter who later became a painter she had no aptitude for drawing THIS kind of physical gaucherie is of course fre quently encountered in chil dren of precocious intellect When she read Little Women the young Simone was delighted to find that she was not unique and that she had a youthful soul mate in Jo the girl who hated sew ing and housework but loved books The burning detesta tion of all domestic slavery which shines through The Second Sex was thus the magnified expression of a highly individual prejudice but it is a preiudice which is looming ever larger on the horizon of contemporary man and womankind For at the risk of sounding like a retro grade male chauvinist I sus pect that at the core of the Womens Liberation Move ment of which Beauvoir has somewhat ungallantly been called the Grandma there is a rockbottom aversion to all forms of manual as opposed to intellectual labor Many of these wouldbe liberators probably dream secretly of being Louisa May Alcotts if not Simone de Beauvoirs The Promised Land so many of them aspire to is not a dreary landscape of brooms and brushes it is a Land of Emancipated Oz gleaming with ivory towers Each tower inhabited by a Columbia PhD or a Doctor of Sociology from Berkeley That their greatest teacher and inspirer should have written a novel called The Mandarins is only approp riate For it is to the creation of a new mandarin ate that Beauvoir is really summoning the faithfulit is to the establishment of a Just Society of Unfettered Ladies in which the pen at last will have proved itself mightier than the skillet Giving birth and suckling are not activities they are natural functions no project is in volved that is why woman found in them no reason for a lofty affirmation of her existence she submitted passively to her biological fate CONTRARY to what seems to be the case with many militant feminists to day there is no trace in Beau voir of that antimale animus which recently led Betty Friedans exhusband to de clare that 50 to 60 per cent of these gungho tobaccochew ing types are Lesbians either overt or otherwise As the elder of two daughters in a family that had no sons the young Simone was the apple of her fathers eye She in turn adored him As she later wrote in Memoirs of a Duti ful Daughter No one in my entourage was as funny in teresting and brilliant as he no one had read as many books knew so many verses by heart or could discuss with so much heat A freethinker who believed in the church so long as it did not entail his having to go to mass a relatively soph isticated Parisian whose fa vorite authors were Voltaire Maupassant Alphonse Dau det Rostand and Anatole France Georges de Beauvoir bequeathed to his elder daughter an aristocratic love of irreverence which she of a more impassioned hard working and determined tem perament was to elevate to the status of a religion A re ligion directed against the very class from which she sprang the bourgeoisie whose crippling conventions poi soned her adolescent years In all civilizations and still in our day woman inspires man with horror the horror of his own carnal contingence which he projects upon her Nothing is more embitter ing to an ardent worshiper than a god that fails Which is what Georges de Beauvoir ultimately became Lacking the means or the title he needed to penetrate the beau monde of Paris this brilliant salon conversationalist who would have liked to have been an actor was too dilet tantish and indolent to make a truly successful lawyer Too physically weak to endure life in the trenches he spent the four years of World War working in the Paris War Ministry where as a second class private he earned ex actly 5 sous about 5 cents a day Too inexperienced in business to be able to restore the familys disintegrating fortunes he went from bank ruptcy in the shoe business to a precarious job in finan cial publicity dragging his wife down into a quagmire of increasing poverty Worst of alland this his daughter revealed only in the postscript to her memoirs which she wrote after her mothers death in 1963 Georges de Beauvoir proved an increasingly unfaithful husband When he finally died the resentment felt by the onceworshipful daugh ter against the man who had heaped so many sorrows on his longsuffering spouse was such that she could not bring herself even to shed a tear THE demise of this parti cular god did not however lessen the force of the ori ginal spell In a classically Freudian process of trans ference Simone de Beauvoir was led to seek in others the same gay imaginative flights of fancy she had once adored in her father A sense of irony an attitude of mocking irreverence an air of faintly aristocratic nonchalance  so different from the bluestock inged studiousness she her self displayed at school these were the qualities which attracted her to her first great friend Zaza Nabille and to her first youthful love her cousin Jacques And when at the age of 20 she finally en tered Frances foremost teach ing college the prestigious Ecole Normale Suprieure it was the madcap fantasy the irrepressible wit the inex haustible inventiveness every thing from scabrous ditties to comic drawings of Leibnitz bathing with the monads which drew her to that super lative philosophical mounte bank that genius of intellect ual juggling the capricious unpredictable ebullient Jean Paul Sartre Any intimate relationship between two headstrong in tellectuals inevitably poses strains and problemsas is well attested by Mary Mc Carthys life with Edmund Wilson or that of Dorothy Thompson with Sinclair Lewis But even in a country which like France has known many famous romancesbeginning with that of Abelard and Heloisethe 40year idyll be tween Beauvoir and Sartre is virtually unique It would be difficult to find another which has lasted anywhere near as long or been quite so produc tive Madame de La Fayettes liaison with the Duc de La Rochefoucauld was essentially a romance of old age and though Voltaires Madame du Chtelet kept a cabinet for chemical experiments and D Alemberts Julie de Lespi nasse wrote occasional por traits of her friends both were literary hostesses rather than dedicated writers As for George Sand her fiery affair with Alfred de Musset burned itself out in a couple of me teoric seasons Man has succeeded in enslaving woman but in the same degree he has deprived her of what made her possession desirable With woman in tegrated in the family and society her magic is dissipated rather than transformed reduced to the condition of servant she is no longer that unconquered prey incarnating all the treasures of nature Beauvoirs romance with Sartre on the other hand has lasted four decades and is now wellnigh indestructible This is not to say that it has always been smooth sailing Though Sartre volunteered to marry her in the early nine teenthirties to keep from be ing separated from her at a time when he was being of fered a teaching post in Japan she rejected his offer on the grounds that they had to re main celibate in the name of a freedom which might have been alienated had they bowed to bourgeois con ventions and allowed society to interfere with their under lying anarchism This morganatic mar riage as Sartre whimsically dubbed it thus became a union of two sovereign Egos whose emotional and erotic impulses were not always per fectly attuned Sartre who was 23 when they first met in 1929 felt that be had to expand his intimate acquaint ance of womankind beyond the cramped horizons of monogamy if he was to be the great author he was burn ing to become He thus in sisted from the start that while their own love was necessary it had to make room for others which in a mischievous distortion of Leibnitz he termed contin gent amours Given her more serious more straightforward and lets be bold and say it more feminine disposition Beau voir would probably have been happier had the result ant relationship contained more of the necessary and less of the contingent But rather than risk losing Sartre she accepted this metaphysical precondition So total was the ascend ancy that Sartre exercised over her during their first two years together that she had to make a strenuous ef fort to keep from being fatal ly bewitched My moral code she later confessed in her memoirs demanded that I remain at the center of my life whereas I spontaneously preferred another existence to my own This is a devastat ing admission of weakness on the part of someone who as much as any woman in our century has striven to exalt the unsubjugated independ ence of her sex And it also shows to what extent Sartres hairshirt prescription  I have often thought against myselfhas become a guid ing principle for Simone de Beauvoir as well That the gentlemens agreement thus reached gen erated anguish as well as felicity is obvious enough from the second volume of Simone de Beauvoirs mem oirs It is a reminder of how even the most realistic con cessions made to nature and the flesh can come to grief against the hidden shoals of human emotion Beauvoir candidly admits that she was consumed by jealousy when her friend Olga drifted a bit too intimately into Sartres life In a way it was a fruitful triangleto the ex tent that it inspired Beauvoirs first novel LInvite as well as Sartres oneact drama No Exit But life differing essentially from art no such hellonearth relationship could have lasted forever without some explosive cli max that climax fortunately for all concerned was averted by the appearance on the scene of Jacques Laurent Bost who by becoming Olgas lover transformed a trembling trio into a harmonious quar tet Now an editor of Le Nouvel Observateur Bost re mains to this day one of Sartres and Beauvoirs closest friends While the boy seeks himself in the penis as an autonomous subject the little girl coddles her doll and dresses her up as she dreams of being coddled and dressed up herself inversely she thinks of herself as a marvelous doll Thus the passivity that is the essential char acteristic of the feminine woman is a trait that develops in her from the earliest years But it is wrong to assert that a biological datum is concerned it is in fact a destiny imposed upon her by her teachers and by society It was another contin gent affair between Sartre and an American girl which later flung Beauvoir into the arms of Nelson Algren by a kind of reactive process Such emotional oscillations are often to be fetund in the lives of demanding women who have been disappointed or momentarily abandoned George Sands highly sensual affair with Michel de Bourges affords a classic illustration And John Weightman was probably not wrong some years ago in noting that if Sartre has played in Beau voirs life the role of Super Brain Nelson Algren has played the part of Instinctive Brute But if this is an apt description of the Lewis Brogan in The Mandarins whom he partially inspired it was because Algren in real life was like Sartre a tor tured intellectual ever ready to inveigh against the im placable constraints of an in iquitous society THE third important ro mance in Beauvoirs lifeher fiveyear liaison with Claude Lanzmannwas as she frank ly admitted in her memoirs a kind of despairing rear guard action aimed at retard ing the inexorable advance of old age When it started in 1952 she was already a matronly 44five years younger than the heroine of Alphonse Daudets Sapho while Lanzmann 17 years her junior was no longer the type of tender youth Colette so movingly described in Cheri But if this sugges tively incestuous relationship which a liaison between an older woman and a much younger man always is did not fulfill a latent maternal instinct she had long since stifled it did at least give Beauvoir a sense of spring time rebirth The ideal of feminine beauty is variable but certain de mands remain constant for one thing since woman is des tined to be possessed her body must present the inert and passive qualities of an object The most naive form of this requirement is the Hottentot ideal of the steatopygous Venus for the buttocks are the part of the body with the fewest nerves where the flesh seems an aimless fact The taste of Orientals for fat woman is of similar nature they love the absurd richness of this adipose proliferation enlivened as it is by no project with no meaning other than simply to be there Even in civilisations where sensuality is more subtle and ideas of form and harmony are entertained the breasts and the buttocks remain favored objects because of their un necessary gratuitous blooming Unlike Sartre who spent most of World War II work ing on a philosophical trea tise Being and Nothingness Lanzmann took an active part in the French Resistance be fore becoming a militant Communist This activist streak in him immediately commended him to both Sartre and Beauvoir when he first volunteered his services as a specialist in journalistic rewriting to Les Temps Mod ernes the leftwing monthly of which Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir along with Lanz mann remain the editors to this day Indeed though she has boasted more than once abdut her own political ex tremism in this case Beau voir had to admit that she had more than met her match there are few more pathetic passages in her memoirs than the paragraph in which she describes this 27yearold militant gradually wearing down her defenses and de stroying the last lingering vestiges of the idealistic moralism of her bourgeois youth In his capacity for right eous indignation against the capitalist Powers That Be Claude Lanzmann was obvi ously in the same league with Mgren and Sartre And it is obvious too that it appealed to that Manichean tendency in Beauvoir which led her in her youth to view the world in sharply defined blackand white terms as a Kingdom of Good inalterably opposed to the Realm of Evil Most adolescents pass through a mystic phase in which everything is exagger atedly exalted or debased but in Beauvoirs case this tend ency seems to have been un usually forceful and pro longed Like George Sand she was brought up on Thomas Kempiss Imitation of Christ and for years she dreamed of becoming a nun When in a mood for saint hood she would sleep on the floor sometimes going as far as to rub her skin with pumice and mortify herself with the little golden chain she wore about her neck until the blood came But none of these exalted reveries and mortifications of the flesh could affect her gradual real ization that the real world of men is more like a gloomy vale of tears than a radiant kingdom of goodness When her faith in God which is to say her God began to die she might had she been living in George Sands time have sought to satisfy her thirst for ecstatic communion with the divine in the sublime passion of a romantic love But ours being an increasing ly down  to  earth antipoetic and functional century she was left with no choice but to devote her exalted egotism to a more mundane and realis tic cause Unable or at least unwilling to become a nun in an increasingly agnostic world she became a revolu tionary crusader Here again her fathers In fluence seems to have been paramount For as she noted in the first volume of her memoirs Paternal skepti cism had opened the way It was easier for me to think of a world without a creator than to think of a creator charged with all the contra dictions of the world My dis belief never wavered This disbelief became and has remained a way of life for her just as it has for millions of others women as well as men The distance which sep arates the nun from the feminine revolutionary is not as great as might at first sight be supposed In a way they are opposing faces of the same uncompromising coin The world being what it is  a far from perfect place  someone Who starts out with too exalted an image of it can hardly escape a feel ing of having been cheat ed not to say bamboozled the word in French floue with which Beau voir closed the last line of her autobiography For those un willing to make their peace with the world there are really only two choices the passive course which con sists of turning ones back on the world and hieing oneself to a nunnery or the active course which is intended often it is no more than that to refashion the world in an entirely new image No one makes a more violent priest baiter than one who was brought up in the faithas was proved by Spains La Pasionaria and the mother of Ramon Mercader Trotskys assassin both of whom be gan as passionate believers in the Virgin before turning into equally impassioned atheists Nor is it probably an accident that a militant feminist like Kate Millett should have come from a Roman Catholic background Man swoops upon his prey like the eagle and the hawk woman lies in wait like the carnivo rous plant the bog in which insects and chil dren are swallowed up In Beauvoir the violent swing from mystic adoration to passionate disbelief was al ready accomplished by the time she met Sartre at the age of 20 What she found in him was a soul mate who if the published fragment of his autobiography Les Mots is to be trusted might have chosen to become a monk but for the schizophrenic influ ence of his freethinking grandfather The resultant disorder in his youthful con sciousness having become Ms own special order it remained only for the young JeanPaul to become a man of letters ersatz of the Christian I could not be an annalist of hell or as he later came to call it an crivain engag a writer committed to de nouncing the intolerable in iquities of the world It is an odd paradox that the male inhabits a sensual world of sweetness affection gentle ness a feminine world whereas woman moves in the male universe which is hard and rough her hands still long for contact with soft smooth flesh the adolescent boy a woman flowers fur the child a whole region within her remains unoccupied and longs to possess a treasure like that which she gives the male This explains the fact that in many women there [is a tendency toward homosexuality more or less marked AN annalist of hell A perfect description yes  not only of Sartre but also of the author of The Second Sex that long litany of female maledictions which she chose to preface with this remark of Kierkegaard What a mis fortune it is to be a woman And yet the greatest misfor tune when one is a woman is not to realize that it is one The old sayingIgnorance is blisshas here been stood on its head But all one has to do is substitute the word man for woman in the above quotation to realize that this is less a profound philosophical pronouncement than a Jeremian imprecation directed not against Society but against Creation itself It may well come as a shock to the booted and belted partisans of the Wo mens Liberation Front in America to discover that their pioneering prophet across the seas actually wallowed in a state of blissful ignorance for a good half of her adult life She was close to 40 before the scales finally slipped from her eyes and she realized that she had been living all these years in a world of masculine oppression her mind hope lessly hoodwinked by mascu line mythology It even took a man to provoke this mo ment of Damascene revela tion One day in 1947 seized by that irrepressible itch to write which has long been hersWrite anything no matter what her friend the sculptor Giacometti urged hershe told Sartre that she was toying with the idea of writing a martyr essay where one explains oneself without pretext Although she was forced to add her womanhood had never really bothered her no Frenchman having been un couth enough to say to her You say that because youre a woman Taking a long puff on his philosophic pipe Sartre then suggested that she look more closely into the matter Even if her father had said of her more than once Simone has the brain of a man something which had imbued her with a reassuring feeling of superiorityit didnt mean that she had been brought up in the same way as a boy It is a strange experience for an individual who feels himself to be an autonomous and transcendent subject an absolute to discover inferiority in himself as a fixed and preordained essence it is a strange experience for whomso ever regards himself as the One to be revealed to himself as otherness alterity This is what happens to the little girl when doing her ap prenticeship for life in the world she grasps what it means to be a woman therein The sphere to which she belongs is everywhere limited dominated by the male universe When after two years of intensive labor the Beaver as her friends at the Ecole Normale Superieure Used to call her finally delivered her self of the first volume of The Second Sex it sold 22000 copies in a single week Though later overtaken by the first volume of her memoirs of which more than 550000 copies have been sold in France alone it seems reasonable to suppose that the sales figure for The Sec ond Sex today is not far from the halfmillion mark The popularity of this monu mental opus which runs to a total of 1000 pages in the French edition may also be judged by the fact that it has been translated into 19 differ ent languages It is the work of which Beauvoir is most proud understandably since it is the one which has made the greatest impact abroad as may be judged by the sin gle example of Kate Millett mortally smitten by its argu ments while she studied English Literature at Oxford What is needed for sexual harmony is not refinement in technique but rather on the foundation of the moments erotic charm a mutual generosity of body and soul THERE is a price to pay for glory and Beauvoir like Sartre has had to pay it Having had the unpreced ented temerity to discuss such delicate matters as clitoral and vaginal orgasms and to describe some of the intimate idylls of her life she can no longer venture out to such old familiar haunts as the Caf de More at SaintGer maindesPres or to La Cou pole or La Palette at Mont parnasse without provoking the kind of spiteful Parisian gossip she so detestslike Oh look theres la grande Sartreuse She avoids the press rarely accords an inter view and has never deigned to appear on television to peddle any of her books Oc casionally she has even gone into hidingas in 1954 when The Mandarins was award ed the Goncourt Prize and her Gallimard publishers spent three worried days try ing to find her More and more her life has come to be centered around the groundfloor apartment situated not far from the Place Denfert Rochereau which she bought after years of living in tiny hotel rooms with her Goncourt Prize royalties A duplex which is comfortably but not lavishly spacious it is furnished with souvenirs picked up on for eign trips Chinese figurines Spanish bullfight posters as well as with the lampstands which Giacometti designed for her years ago From the upper floor one can see over the ivycovered wall into the Montparnasse cemetery When night falls she can watch the Eiffel Tower sweep its two parallel beams across the sky And when spring comes the street below her windows is heavy with the scent of blossoming lindens and alive with the gay warbling of birds calling back to mind the summers she knew as a child in her grandfathers house in the Limousin Sartre lives not far away in another relatively modest apartment Spiritually if not legally married they usually lunch or dine together and often spend the afternoon or evening talking or listening to recordingsincreasingly of classical pre19th century music Lassus Pergolesi Monteverdi Machaut for her a universe of inno cence because man is ab sent from it Part of each day is devoted to answering the hundreds of letters which reach her every month from all corners of the globe most of them from women who have been aroused by reading The Second Sex TiGrace Atkinson being one of her correspondents Refusing to employ a secretary to help her she answers each letter personally with a ded
cation which can only be called monastic in keeping with the solitude with which she has chosen to hedge her independ ence The gaucherie which in timidated her when she was younga rather gruff voice a determined mannish stride has never completely left her and though she is a dyed  in  the  wool Parisian there is still something faintly provincial in her appearance An introvert rather than the kind of extrovert that George Sand was she dresses with a sober discretion which might well distress the bluejeaned commissars of the Womens Liberation Front Try as she may to be brutally realistic in her assessment of life she has still not completely thrown off the puritanism of her youth To friends she couldnt help confiding that she was privately shocked by certain of the juicier passages in Violette Leducs brazenly Lesbian novel La Batarde but knowing how desperately short of money was the friend who had once written her I am a desert which car ries on a monologue she gave her a sendoff with a glowing introduction A POOR public speaker who tends to bolt her words when ever she has to make a plat form speech Beauvoir is con tent to be a writer and to leave the public antics to Sartre So similar are their outlooks on almost all poli tical questions that she sees no need for duplicating his efforts since our names are really one Her last public manifestation occurred in the spring of 1970 when she helped Sartre distribute side walk copies of La Cause du Peuple a cryptoMaoist pub lication which the Govern ment had just banned but she did so more out of a feel ing of solidarity with Sartre and the martyrs of the New Left than out of truly militant activism She did not accompany Sartre last October when he had himself driven out to the Renault plant at Billancourt with a retinue of Maoists in a vain endeavor to rouse the slum bering proletarians from their unrevolutionary torpor they closed the gates in his face Nor was she present when Sartre and several hundred arsonists converged on the summit of Montmartre last February with jerry cans full of gasoline in a comicopera demonstration apparently de signed to avenge the mar tyrs of the 1871 Commune by reducing Sacr Coeur to ashes She did last summer con sent to be named publisher of an extreme leftwing monthly in order to protect its young editors from arrest The French Government is not prepared to make martyrs of either Sartre or Beauvoir by having them actually im prisoned Though it was gen erous of her to offer to act as a shield against govern mental intimidation she was not long in regretting it The mrnthlys exhilarating title LIdiot International should have provided sufficient warning of the kind of jour nalistic high jinks to be ex pected from a crew of young hotheads including several from prominent Protestant families burning to use the illgotten profits of lucrative banking and other enterprises to hasten the destruction of capitalist society But in political acumen alas Simone de Beauvoir has never been much cleverer than JeanPaul Sartre Last February The International Idiot lived up to its cosmo politan name by angrily ac cusing other leftwing group lets of treason for failing to answer a call for a frontal assault on the Palace of Jus tice which could have re siulted in a popular fte of grandiose proportions Pre sumably it would have gone the way of the Bastille This time the fat was in the fire and Beauvoir had no choice but to denounce this polit ical adventurism and to retire from the awkward fray IN the second volume of her memoirs she wrote with her customary frankness that Sartre like herself was seek ing a sort of salvation And if I employ this vocabulary it was because we were two mystics And two mystics in a sense they still remain seeking to atone for the sins of the bourgeoisie they have never been able to shake off by indulging in public repent ance spasms For these two pilgrims of the absolute the process of conversion was already com plete even before they stum bled onto Marx in the early nineteenthirties We have her word for it that the labor theory of value in Das Kap ital came as a dazzling revelation into the root causes of proletarian exploit ation But while Marxs pains taking analysis may have satisfied her intellectually it was more likely the spon taneous nature of the revolu tion promised in The Com munist Manifesto which ap pealed to her emotionally When Raymond Aron a fel low student at the Ecole Nor male Suprieure joined the French Socialist party neither she nor Sartre could follow suit first as she explains in her memoirs because it had grown middleclass and also because reformism was re pugnant to our tempera ments society could only change globally at a stroke through a violent convulsion The real name for the phil osophy which Beauvoir and Sartre have been propounding in recent years is no longer existentialism with which their names are still usually associated It is in reality convulsionism the im patient expectation of a swift sudden global up heaval in which everything from capitalist society to bourgeois family conventions will somehow be transformed in one apocalyptic flash So far the messianic trumpet has failed to sound much more than a cracked note at any rate in France while the revolutionary gods of yester dayCastro is the latest keep falling from their ped estals Francois Mauriac was doubtless exaggerating last year when shortly before his death he suggested that it would be madness to put any one so incurably inoffensive as Sartre in jail One can argue about Sartres genius for spreading verbal dyna mite but Mauriac was cer tainly correct in thinking that the irrepressible Jean  Paul and his consort Simone de Beauvoir are not very gifted at subversion no matter

Suburban Babes on Broadway,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/11/archives/suburban-babes-on-broadway.html,FOR the class project The Behavior of Mid dle  Class Women in Groups I chose to ex amine a Saturday Mat inee Club to see how the members relate to such phe nomena as the Broadway the ater and how they behave once they leave the confines of their suburb and enter the theater district of New York My method of observation was to join a group of women in my home suburb of Madi son New Jersey who had or ganized a theater club To PROFESSOR SLAVITSKY Sociology 252 The Madison New Jersey Saturday Matinee Club con sists of approximately 20 married women between the ages of 25 and 45 They are a formal nonprofit group with a duly appointed chair man The composition of the group changes from year to year as husbands are re located by their compa nies but the salient charac teristics remain the same namely the women either work during the week or have preschool children for whom no babysitters are available otherwise they would probably belong to the Madison New Jersey Wed nesday Matinee Club a group large enough to charter its own bus The husbands of the Saturday Matinee women may either dislike the theater or dislike the cost of going to the theater Apparently they do not dislike babysit ting REGIONAL COMPOSITION OF GROUP Onethird ex New Yorkers one third na tive New Jerseyans onethird from outside states LEADERSHIP It is the duty of the chairman to ar range for meetings to write away for tickets to inform members when the tickets ar rive or when they dont ar rive because the play has been sold out or has closed to select a restaurant for lunch and to notify those on the waiting list if one of the ticket holders becomes ill and a replacement is need ed Obviously no one ever wants to be chairman It is therefore an appointed posi tion PROCEDURES The group meets once or twice a year in the home of one of its members to select shows and restaurants for the future months After the coffee and cake are served the group wrestles with such problems as Are there any good shows left Can we get tick ets for a hit this year Can you really trust the critics Can we be sure the restau rant will serve us a luncheon menu They were stung last year by a Japanese restau rant that produced a dinner menu at 1130 AM insisting that on Saturday lunches were not available Their memories have winced ever since SELECTION OF SHOWS This took place on a Tues day evening in the ranch house of the chairman About ten women showed up After the serving of coffee and devils food cake and some small talk on the compara tive merits of local nursery schools the chairman called the meeting to order In se lecting future plays about onethird of the group wanted to try an OffBroadway show which would call for a planned safari into the Low er East Side on a Sunday Two suggested the Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center The remainder of the ladies looked vaguely uncomfort able said nothing and ate more cake At the end of a long discussion the chairman settled things by reading off a list of available plays and allowing the group to vote on each The final selection two hit musicals one Neil Simon comedy and the years hit drama from England TRANSPORTATION One of the big problems for the Matinee Group is transpor tation There is a bus that goes directly to the Port Au thority Building and there is a bus stop for said bus do Hanover a mere 15minute drive from Madison However only native residents know exactly where the bus Is sup posed to stop and of course it wont stop unless someone is standing there It was therefore decided that Mrs ODonnell who knows where its at would arrive early at the bus stop across the street from the Acme supermarket and standing there in a red plaid wool suit would be a beacon for the others Once the group arrived in the Port Author ity Building the exNew Yorkers would take over and direct everyone to 50th Street and the Alpine Cha let which had been selected for lunch TWO MONTHS LATER The First Matinee First of all it rained Secondly Mrs ODonnell was not available as a beacon because she had caught the flu and had sold her ticket to an aunt in Liv ingston Nevertheless the group assembled in the gray drizzle at 945 in the morn ing on a little knoll across the street from the super market After boarding the Newark bus by mistake the group finally connected with the correct vehicle and we were whisked to the Port Au thority Building within an hour The Port Authority Build ing is a fine laboratory in which to study the behavior of middleclass women in groups The ladies walking in formations of twos and threes stepped carefully over the legs of assorted hippies who were sprawled on the floor in some sort of geome trical encampment skirted the assembly gathered around a Black Panther speaker something about pigs and smilingly declined the literature offered by an intense young man from the Anti  Abortion League All this without missing a step or interrupting their conver sation on the comparative merits of local nur sery schools We arrived without inci dent 15 minutes later at the doors of the Alpine Chalet The doors were firmly shut After 20 minutes of stand ing around in what had now become a fine mist one of the ladies decided to read the menu pasted up on the door It was at this point that we discovered the Al pirle Chalet did not open until 5 PM Some discussion ensued but luckily someone noticed Patricia Murphys Candlelight Room just down the block The group proceeded there and found it to be a well lighted wellserviced reas onably priced restaurant filled with walltowall la dies By some instinct the Saturday Matinee Group knew they had come to the right place RESTAURANT BEHAVIOR At the end of an enoyable lunch the waitress presented the check which she left dis creetly in the center of the long table One woman picked up the check out of idle curiosity and immedi ately the other 15 deluged her with five and tendollar bills Before she fully under stood what had happened she had become chief treas urer and was left with the job of handing out change and figuring out the tip It took a paper and pencil and at least 15 minutes Hey how did I get stuck with this she asked plaintively as she looked up from her figuring but It was to no avail The other women as soon as they had received their change were quickly and stealthily leaving the table for the Ladies Room or other destinations This was the only example I en countered of individual sur vival overriding group coop eration THEATER BEHAVIOR I had heard from various sources that ladies groups tend to be talkative and un responsive during the per formance To my surprise I found just the opposite Their behavior was decorous from the moment they entered the theater and had their tick ets snatched by a surly at tendent to the moment they were shooed out of the aisle by a determined seat clanking usherette If there was a strong reaction to the performance it did not mani fest itself at that time Talk during intermissions was primarily on the topic of lo cal nursery schools In fact it was not until 530 when the ladies were safely seated on the return bus to New Jersey that they began a lively discussion of the play For some reason the ladies do not like to divulge their opinions until they are on safe grounds GENERAL FINDINGS The group exists primarily for the sake of convenience since few of these women would face alone the bother of writing and waiting for tickets the uncertainty of un marked bus stops the rigors of the Port Authority Build ing the indifference of res taurants and the rudeness of just about everybody in New York As a group however they are able to face these impediments cheerfully and consider the trip to the city as an adventure  in the sense that climbing Mt Ev erest is an adventure On the basis of my re search with the Saturday Matinee Club I found mid dleclass women in groups to be competent wellorganized and capable of going to great lengths to achieve what they want The question now arises How much longer will they want the Broadway the ater The question cannot be answered here but Id like your comments I owe a term paper to Modern American Drama Decline and Fall

Medicine,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/18/archives/it-still-somehow-cures-agues-aspirin.html,On June 2 1763 a clergyman named Edward Stone read a paper before the Royal Society in London entitled An Account of the Success of the Bark of the Willow in the Cure of Agues Agues described high fevers such as those typical of malaria It was apparently a derivative of salicylic acid in the bark that reduced fever and it was found later relieved the pain of rheumatism Salicylic acid derivatives tend to be too irritating for use as general drugs but by the end of the 19th century one had been synthesizedacetylsalicylic acidthat was relatively innocuous Under the name aspirin it became probably the most widely used of all drugs Yet it also remained one of the least understood so far as its action within the body was concerned Now reports from the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences of the Royal College of Surgeons of England indicate that aspirin blocks production of a whole family of hormonelike or control substances within body tissues The discovery may explain not only how aspirin works opening the way for synthesis of more effective aspirinlike drugs but it may also make it possible for the first time to explore the workings of this mysterious family of control substances known as prostaglandins These substances derived their name from the early belief that they were exclusively produced in the male prostate gland In recent years it has been found that they are manufactured throughout the body and exert powerful influences on many organs including the heart blood vessels bronchial tubes and uterus Yet how they fit into the bodys normal functionsand how they might be used to correct malfunctionsis still largely unknown Aspirin As a rule this drug does not cure It mitigates the symptoms of diseasefever inflammation and painsome of which in themselves can be dangerous and impede recovery As many parents know a fever of 106 degrees Fahrenheit can produce convulsions in a child and delirium in an adult A fever of 108 can lead to permanent brain damage The reduction or elimination of fever with such drugs as aspirin does not in most types of disorder seem to impair the bodys ability to fight off a disease But aspirin is far from being totally safe Large amounts are fatal to infants and even standard doses can produce intestinal bleeding in children The massive doses needed to control the rampant high temperatures of rheumatic fever or the pain of rheumatoid arthritis tend to produce a variety of side effects such as dizziness mental confusion and impaired vision In such cases the relief provided by aspirin is inadequate and the physician will often increase the dosage until the side effects appear then back off slightly to provide maximum relief without such effects For this reason the discovery of how aspirin works chemically could clear the way for trialanderror tests leading to variants of the drug that do the job far more effectively Prostaglandins While various prostaglandins generate fever inflammation and headachesall symptoms that are relieved by aspirin and other such drugsthe study of their roles in the body has been far more difficult than that of hormones produced by special glands Such a hormone is delivered by a gland into the blood which carries it to remote parts of the body where it performs its task The role of the hormone can therefore be determined by removing that gland from experimental animals and observing the effect The hormone can then be injected to expose its function even more precisely Since the prostaglandins seem to be produced throughout the body such a line of attack is ruled out The discovery however that an aspirinlike drug can turn off one or more prostaglandins now opens the way for an investigation of their function comparable to that employed for hormones In the past few years it has been found that there are six basic prostaglandins each of them with a number of derivatives They are already being used experimentally to induce abortion without need for surgery Because many of them can now be synthesized simply through enzyme action on fatty acids laboratories throughout the world are exploring their uses An editorial in the Annals of Internal Medicine has predicted that even within the current decade prostaglandins may become major therapeutic agents The recent reports from London carried in the journal Nature New Biology told of three tests of the effects on prostaglandins of aspirin and other drugs with painand feverreducing action It was shown that synthesis of certain types of prostaglandins was blocked by these drugs in homogenized lung tissue from guineapigs and in excised dog spleens It was also found that in volunteers who had taken aspirin the production of prostaglandins by the platelets in their blood was turned off The disklike platelets enable blood to coagulate and thus help prevent bleeding The finding may help explain why aspirin can produce bleeding within the digestive tract Thus it appears that from a single group of discoveries light is being thrown on two quite separate mysteries a young one the role of the prostaglandins and one of long standing the operation of feverreducers like aspirin The hope is that these findings will ultimately enable the medical profession to relieve pain and suffering that lie beyond the reach of any drugs available today WALTER SULLIVAN
Supply of Adoptable White Babies Shrinks,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/18/archives/supply-of-adoptable-white-babies-shrinks-officials-of-agencies-warn.html,LOS ANGELESIntense pressures are starting to build on adoption agencies throughout the country as the supply of available white infants continues to dwindle Many officials are worried that the pressures could lead to widespread use of private channels charging excessive fees These private or independent procedures are legal in all but two states but established agencies feel they place more priority on a couples ability to pay a good fee than be a good parent At the same time many adoptive parents who have used the independent adoption procedures insist that there is often no other way to get a healthy white baby since agency red tape makes that avenue difficult or impossible In any event evidence of abuses is very sketchy because all the transactions are so private So far they seem limited to larger states such as California and less scrupulous lawyers But as Superior Court Judge Lester Olson who handled adoptions in Los Angeles County for two years said The situation has only one direction to go and that would be to get worse Stricter Rules Seen The California Legislature recently held hearings on a proposal to tighten the rules governing independent adoptions and a parade of agency officials warned that a private market was virtually inevitable as the shortage of babies grows The source of concern is simple supply and demand The number of children placed for adoption has plummeted sharply in the last few years For instance the Childrens Home Society of California one of the countrys largest private agencies placed 1903 children in 1968 This year if present trends continue it will arrange only 888 adoptions As of last month the society is no longer accepting applications from persons who want only white infants But the demand is rising Families that are worried about the population explosion are deciding to have no more than two natural children and adopt the rest and adoption in general is becoming more acceptable and laws are becoming more flexible One good result of this situation is that many more hard to adopt childrenthose who are either nonwhite handicapped or older  are finding permanent homes and not languishing in foster institutions The Pill and the Law There are three main reasons for the baby shortage the increased availability of birth control devices particularly the Pill liberalized abortion laws mainly in California and New York and a drastic increase in the number of unmarried girls who decide to keep their babies Add it all up said one lawyer and its as if someone had turned off a giant spigot As a result more prospective parents are turning to independent adoptions Regulations governing these procedures vary but in most states a couple seeking a child goes to a lawyer who specializes in adoptions The lawyer then tries to find them a child usually through a friendlyobstetrician who has an unmarried patient or through other lawyers who refer pregnant girls to him In all cases the adoption must be approved by the courts Established agencies have traditionally opposed these procedures mainly because they feel there is a greater chance the mother will try to get her baby back However the famous Baby Lenore case was handled by a prestigious New York agency In addition the agencies do exhaustive studies of prospective parents which lawyers are seldom willing or qualified to conduct Find Standards Rigid Independent procedures are defended by people who say that agency standards for adopting couples are too rigid and their examination too degrading One prime example is in New York where most agencies continue to insist that children be placed with couples of the same religion Independent adoption is thus the only way that many couples particularly Jews can find children According to the experts independent procedures have always been abused by a few unethical lawyers charging exorbitant fees to couples who could never qualify for an agency baby In a time of shortage the abuses get worse And adoption officials report that in recent months the growing droughtand the growing desperation of childless couples has produced the following incidents One Los Angeles obstetrician has been approached by several lawyers who have clients looking for babies The lawyers offered to pay an obstetrical fee of 1000 considerably above the normal price of 400 if the doctor referred an adoptable baby to them When someone offers that kind of money I feel its dishonest said the doctor who has two adopted children of his own Thats not a fee thats bribe The Los Angeles County Department of Adoption the nations largest adoption agency recently heard of two cases in which lawyers here placed babies in New York before the mother had completely decided what she wanted to do To get her baby back the mother would have had to go to New York and hire a lawyerwhich she could not afford to do A man came to Vista Del Mar the Jewish adoption agency here looking for a baby He told Mrs Annette Baran the director that in Florida it would cost him 10000 to knock the first person off the top of the list Legitimate independent adoptions usually run about 1000 to 1700 including the lawyers fee obstetrical costs and expense money for the natural mother all paid by the adopting parents But reports keep filtering in to the agencies that the going rates run from 5000 to 10000 Obviously said one lawyer in the field there is a great temptation to gouge for fees when you have one baby for every 20 couples in your file In California all costs of an independent adoption must be reported to the courts but judges concede there is no way to tell if a couple is lying Frances Mansfield chairman of the Maryland State Advisory Committee on Adoptions said she had evidence that all obviously pregnant girls on the campus of Georgetown University In Washington were approached by strangers asking if they wanted to put their babies up for adoption Adoption officials here have heard similar reports of lawyers paying high school students 25 for referring pregnant classmates to them Lawyers specializing in adoption are scouring the country for babies For instance David Leavitt one of the leading lawyers in Los Angeles discovered a legal loophole in Florida In that state if a woman is separated from her husband and becomes pregnant by another man she must still have her husbands consent to place the baby for adoption In California if the mother can prove that her husband was not the father she can place the baby herself Mr Leavitt has imported five babies because of that law In addition to their traditional objections to independent adoptions agencies denounced the private procedures for several reasons Just as a person I react negatively to it said Julian Brantley president of the Childrens Home Society We did away with buying and selling people after the Civil War Aiming at Good Home The main issue however is whether the child will get a good home One Miami lawyer put it this way Its obvious that a childless family with an income of 15000 a year will never get a baby through a lawyer whose file is full of millionaires willing to pay almost any amount for a white healthy child The other side of the shortage picture is the boom in hard to adopt children Those with nonwhite racial backgrounds or physical handicaps older children or siblings who want to stay together Prospective parents fall into two broad categories those who want to reproduce themselves and thus want children resembling the ones they would have had and those who want to give needy children a home Most hard to adopt are still taken by the latter group but a few of the former group are shifting over One survey shows that 35 per cent of the Negro children placed last year were adopted by white couples The figure was 23 per cent two years ago At the same time the established agencies are now able to spend much more time finding homes for problem children Have to Be Understood These children have to be worked with and understood says Walter Heath head of the Los Angeles County Department of Adoptions Sometimes they even need therapy especially older children who have been kicked around in a dozen foster homes  and now we have the staff available to do that You really have to find homes one by one for these kids you have to individualize them No one really wants the idea of a crippled child but when you say How about this particular child thats different The department can now find a home for virtually any child except for older black children The private agencies here place virtually 100 per cent of their cases In fact some agencies are now combing the rolls of foster children trying to find those who would be eligible for adoption In the past thousands of foster children who were abandoned by their parents could not be adopted because no one would do the necessary paper work In addition some agencies are able to provide more services for mothers who decide to keep their babies including day care centers and nutrition classes Others now offer outpatient counseling to families after they adopt children Artificial Insemination There are also signs that as the shortage gets worse a few couples are considering artificial insemination or even a baby maker a woman impregnated by the husband They used to say If it cant be both of ours wed rather adopt  said Mrs Baran Now that they find it hard to adopt a few are considering alternatives but the psychological problems are still tremendous Most experts agree that the shortage is likely to get more severe and this has prompted a reevaluation of some existing laws In states like California adoption agencies are pressing for tighter regulations of independent adoptions so that fees will be limited and prospective parents will be subject to a stricter review In states like New York where the law has helped create shortages among certain religious groups some forces are arguing for a more liberal approach on the religious issue Today Roman Catholic children still go unadopted even though Jewish couples are willing to take them All these efforts can only go so far In the end unless mores change sharply many couples are going to have to face the sad reality of a childless future
LAW ON ABORTION TESTED ON COAST,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/18/archives/law-on-abortion-tested-on-coast-doctor-arrested-6-times-is-freed.html,SANTA ANA Calif July 17 A 29yearold doctor who admits having performed more than 2000 illegal abortions has been released from jail here on his promise to stop practicing medicine while he challenges the constitutionality of Californias therapeutic abortion law The case of Dr John S Gwynne whohas been arrested six times in the last 18 months for providing abortions on demand has attracted the attention of medical men religious leaders and other groups involved in a widening controversy over the 1967 state law Four of the doctors arrests resulted from his operation of a clinic where until midJune he performed seven or eight abortions a day and collected 250000 or more in annual fees in open defiance of the California law which permits abortions only in accredited hospitals after approval by a hospital panel of three doctors Test Case Sought Dr Gwynne is seeking a test of the law in the State Supreme Court on the ground that it violates a womans constitutional right to decide for herself whether or not she wants to bear children The California law is more permissive than those of many statesbut less liberal than those of New York Hawaii and Alaska It sanctions abortions in some 500 stateaccredited hospitals after the medical panels have determined that a  womans physical or emotional health would be impaired by childbirth Dr Gwynne was jailed three weeks ago in lieu of 100000 bail after the police raided his green stucco clinic for the fourth time He was released Tuesday on his own recognizance for arraignment in Superior Court July 27 after agreeing to close the clinic and refrain from practicing medicine pending outcome of his case Three separate abortion cases against the doctor are now before the Superior Court here and a fourth indictment is pending in Los Angeles where he was twice arrested in early 1970 Doctor Seeks a Job The young doctor said that despite the 250000 or 300000 in fees he had collected from his clients he was nearly broke Bail bond attorney and court costs have amounted to more than 75000 He is looking for a job I maytry to enlist in the Peace Corps overseas where my medical training would be of humanitarian value or I may go to India or Africa or some other underdeveloped region where my specialty of abortion sterilization and birth control could be put to use to help people he said The doctor said that when he was graduated from the University of Southern California medical school in 1967 he had no intention of becoming an abortionist but that he quickly saw the injustice and inhumanity of the law and decided to do something about it whatever the risks Abortion is not the real answer to unwanted pregnancy I realize that he said Abortion is not right in itself The real answer is contraception But abortion often is the only means left to us to rescue a woman from a difficult and ruinous situation Abortion is a medical procedure and something we dont like to do Its something like an amputation I have been trying to build up reliable evidence to show that abortion as a regular office procedure is safe and medically sound and the only reasonable alternative to a law that is unfair cruel and unrealistic Standards Called Variable Dr Gwynne said each California hospital accredited to perform abortions set its own standards If a hospitals chief of staff belieVes abortion is justified only in the most extreme physical or mental cases he appoints doctors to his abortion panel who feel the same way he said A woman can shop around from hospital to hospital One may turn her down another may accept her If she has plenty of money the whole process is made easier Often in desperation she ends up in the hands of a quack in a dirty back room Probably 100000 illegal abortions occur in California each year twice the number of those performed in accordance with the law Dr Gwynne said his fees ranged from 235 to 350 or about half what a hospital usually charges for abortion surgery and care He recalled one unmarried girl who paid for her abortion with 10 books of trading stamps Another gave him a puppy Deputy District Attorney Martin J Heneghan questioned Dr Gwynnes motives in challenging the state law If the doctor merely wanted to establish a basis for a test case his first arrest would have served the purpose without repeated violations the prosecutor said
Armed Forces Assailed On View of Homosexuals,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/19/archives/armed-forces-assailed-on-view-of-homosexuals-researchers-study.html,A new study of homosexuality from the Institute for Sex Research founded by the late Dr Alfred C Kinsey has concluded that the military policy of the United States toward homosexuals is unwise unjust and in essence unenforceable In an epilogue to their study the authorsDrs Martin Weinberg and Colin J Williamswrote The majority of homosexuals who serve do so with honor and it seems foolish to pursue this group with the ardor that authorities exhibit If an individuals sex life does not interfere with his service activities it should be of no concern to military authorities If it is of such a type that causes problems then homosexuals should be separated but not necessarily in a way that is punitive Dr Weinberg a senior sociologist at the institute and Dr Williams a research sociologist at the institute estimate that 2000 to 3000 servicemen among the approximately three million on duty in any year receive lessthanhonorable discharges on grounds of homosexuality We know too the authors said that over 90 per cent of servicemen receive honorable discharge It appears obvious therefore that most homosexuals remain undiscovered by military authorities and complete their service with honor 64 Men in Study Nevertheless the authors said it remains the policy of the armed forces of the United States to prevent homosexuals or persons suspected of having homosexual tendencies from entering military service The study titled Homosexuals and the Military addressed itself to two principal matters the factors related to the process of discovery that led to lessthanhonorable discharge on grounds of homosexuality and the social and psychological effects of receiving such a discharge The research which was begun four years ago employed a sample consisting of 64 men all of them members of either of two homosexual organizationsthe Mattachine Society of New York or the Society for Individual Rights in San Francisco Half of the sample group had received lessthanhonorable discharges on grounds of homosexuality The other half which formed the control group had received honorable discharges The authors noted that there are difficulties in saying what the effects of a lessthanhonorable discharge are when we are using as a control group honorable dischargees who identify enough as homosexuals to be involved in a homophile organization Discovery Analyzed But the authors were also able to compare their findings to those in a more general study carried out in 1967 by the Institute for Sex Research among 458 Chicago homosexuals That study was not based solely on members of homosexual organizations for its sample On the subject of discovery of homosexuality in the armed forces the authors said that 54 per cent of those surveyed were discovered by being reported to authorities by another person 29 per cent through voluntary admission usually made as a means of gaining release from the service and 16 per cent through their own indiscretion The authors said they found that those who were discovered had had a higher frequency of homosexual activity prior to induction than those honorably discharged They also found that those who were discovered were more likely than those who had been honorably discharged to have had other servicemen as sexual partners In addition the authors said they found that those who received a lessthanhonorable discharge suffered few longterm psychological or social consequences except for those men who sought government employment or security clearance However the researchers said that those men as a probable consequence of their discharge were more likely to be known to their friends and families as homosexuals and that they were more likely to have considered or attempted suicide Major Study Progressing The study by Drs Williams and Weinberg will be published on Wednesday by Harper  Row and will carry a list price of 895 The study is not a part of major examination of homosexuality begun three years ago by the Institute for Sex Research which is a nonprofit corporation situated at Indiana University in Bloomington Ind Although the institute is legally separate from the university it operates in general like a department of the university The school audits its bookkeeping acts as a channel for its grants and gives faculty status to its senior staff Previously it has issued studies of sexual behavior in males and in females a study of pregnancy birth and abortion and a study of sex offenders The major examination of homosexuality now in progress at the institute is not expected to be ready for publication for at least a year

CITY CONTROL FACED BY ABORTION CLINICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/21/archives/city-control-faced-by-abortion-clinics.html,The Health Department would be given the power to register abortion clinics and to shut them down if they failed to meet standards under regulations published yesterday in the City Record If approved by the Board of Health this week the regulations would allow the department to shut down substandard abortion clinics on its own authority without going to court with a complaint Currently there is no requirement that a clinic register with the ctiy As a result department officials said its inspectors are unaware of the existence of some clinics A substandard clinic  one more than 10 minutes from a hospital or without the proper medical facilities  would be shut down with a seal of closure stamped on its doors The move is expected to clamp down on illegal abortion clinics

Year‐Old Hospital Unit Is Praised and Assailed,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/26/archives/yearold-hospital-unit-is-praised-and-assailed-yearold-city-hospital.html,After one year the citys new Health and Hospitals Corpora tion has received both official praise for management ef ficiency and criticism from many quarters that none of the gains have trickled down to the sick poor in the wards Mayor Lindsay in a recent interview pronounced the new system one of the great man agement achievements Critics reply that this is precisely the problem preoccupation with management science and too little concern for the quality of medical care The critics include four mem bers of the corporations board of directors who observed the first anniversary by calling for a special meeting to discuss a wholesale reorganization of the agency The corporation was em broiled in controversy even be fore it took over the citys 18 public hospitals on July 1 1970 The underlying concept was that the only way to improve the deteriorating system was to remove it from the restraints of municipal bureaucracy and place it in the hands of a quasi autonomous public benefit corporation Dr Joseph T English presi dent of the corporation acknowledged in a recent inter view Our basic problems wont be solved for five years Health Services Administra tor Gordon Chase who serves as chairman of the board of the corporation said it had in herited an incredibly difficult set of problems from the old New York City Department of Hospitals which had a long history of being underfinanced and undermanned Mr Chase added The most capable manage ment in the world could not conceivably solve many of the corporations problems in the course of just one year But both men pointed to a number of accomplishments of the quasiautonomous agency since it took over the hospital system They cited an intensive recruitment drive that added 1000 nurses to the city hos pitals success in coping with the demand for abortions de spite predictions of disaster and vastly improved billing and collecting Despite these achievements many doctors and nurses report they have seen little or no im provement in patient care Dr Marshall Brunner a resi dent physician at Queens Gen eral Hospital says of the year old system The central office seems to be interested only in computeri zation Nothing has trickled down through the administra tive maze into the hospital wards We dont have any more bed sheets than we did a year ago Dr Brunner is president of the Committee of interns and Residents which is the bargain ing agent for all house staff doctors in the municipal hospi tals The committee is compil ing a registry documenting in stances of unnecessary deaths and suffering among patients in the city system The doctors complaints were echoed by Mrs Mary Biris a supervisory nurse at the City Hospital Center at Elmhurst Queens Mrs  reported that the two wards under her super vision were meant for 42 pa tients but the usual census was 50 to 55 Were drastically short of supplies she said Were lucky if we can change sheets once every two days The Overtime Funds When she is short on staff and requests permission to keep nurses on duty for extra shifts Mrs Biris said Were told theres no money for overtime and well have to get along with the people we have She added And while theyre putting in new carpets at 125 Worth Street [the cor poration headquarters] nothing is being done for the patients comfort She pointed out that patients in her wards had no tables on which to set their meal trays and were forced to balance the trays on their laps The New York State Nurses Association which represents the nurses in the city system has consistently complained that its members are forced to do nonnursing chores includ ing serving meals housekeep ing duties and wheeling patients to the Xray departments Mrs Gloria Cappella of the nurses association said that at Metropolitan Hospital where she had worked If a patient misses the regular Wednesday Xrays he waits until the next Wednesdayat a cost of 113 a day A somewhat brighter picture was painted by Dr Saul J Far ber chief of the Department of Medicine at Bellevue Hospi tal The main improvement Dr Farber said has been relieving professional people of doing nonprofessional jobs Until recently he said it had been common for physicians to wheel patients to the Xray rooms A More Severe View We still have a long way to go though Dr Farber said He noted for instance that Bellevue had no bloodtaking team Staff physicians have to take blood a job that is done by technicians in virtually all private hospitals Dr Farber is president of the Society of Urban Physicians whose membership includes most chiefs of service in the city hospitals His predecessor in that post was Dr M Henry Williams Jr director of the chest service at the Bronx Municipal Hospital Dr Wil liams declared flatly I cant think of anything that the corporation has con tributed to patient care The creature comforts of the patients the niceties are no better than ever As for the nurserecruitment program Dr Williams said Wed have gotten the same re sults from the old department Dr Williams scoffed at the corporations contention that it had speeded the purchasing of supplies Almost a year ago he said we asked for ultraviolet lights in the TB ward to help keep the place sterile We not only didnt get the lights we cant get a direct answer when we ask about them In his official assessment of the corporations first year Dr English noted that in one year weve succeeded in recruit ing 1000 registered nurses which brings our total up to 5500 Now thats not enough We need a minimum of 6500 But it is significant progress He also cited the systems successful handling of the abor tion program which began on the very day that the corpora tion started inthe business You remember the predic tions he said It was going to be a disaster We were going to be swamped The hospitals just werent going to be able to meet the demand fore abor tions Well those dire predictions didnt come true Every woman eligible for an abortion in a municipal hospital got one At the end of the corpora tions first year 25896 abor tions had been performed in the municipal hospitals Another achievement Dr English said was a vastly im proved system for collecting socalled thirdparty payments that is insurance payments from Medicaid Medicare Blue Shield and private insurance companies By the end of the year he said we were making these collections at a rate two and a half times greater than had ever been done before This billing system involves what a recent staff memoran dum called an incredible mag nitude of paper flow  un paralleled anywhere in the United States except by the Social Security Administra tion At present the system is in the process of being con verted to automation The collection system was also listed by Martin E Segal an investment banker and in surance expert who serves on the board of directors among the enormous gains in the systems and procedures area in the past year Another gain cited by Mr Segal was the establishment of separate budgets for each of the 18 hospitals in the system This had not been necessary under the centralized mode of operation of the Department of Hospitals Each hospital is required to issue regular expenditure re ports so the central office can compare actual spending with budget This process too is being computerized These public contentions of achievement in systems and procedures are not always re flected however in interoffice memoranda In a confidential memo to Dr English last month Health Services Ad ministrator Chase called for a report on his plans for improve ment in this and other areas Continued improvement in the billings system is the No 1 priority at this time Mr Chase wrote Your plan in this area should outline in detail the steps that will be taken in the future to insure complete collection of receivables Mr Chase also told Dr Eng lish In developing your plan I would like you to note particu larly the financial and manage ment reports discussed in the attached paper As we have both noted this year the board of directors has had difficulty in reviewing operations in the absence of such reports The four dissenting board members who called for the special meeting are Dr Vernal G Cave director of the Health Departments Bureau of Ve nereal Disease Control Milton F Kirchman an architect Wil liam Michelson president of Local 2 of the United Store Workers Union and Dr Ed mund O Rothschild assistant attending physician at the Me morial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases They echoed many of the complaints of the systems doc tors and nurses In addition they said the corporation ought to clearly assert its independ ence of City Hall They pointed too to the absence of minority group members in policymak ing positions In response nine board members  including the five city officials who sit on the board ex officioissued a statement expressing our com plete confidence in and sup port for Dr English in his ef forts to provide  the high est quality health care to the citizens of New York City Representative Hernia Ba dillo a dissenter who resigned from the board last March had words of praise for the cor poration however when it was announced that Dr Antero Lacot a Puerto Rican who is administrator of Lincoln Hos pital in the Bronx would be come senior vice president in charge of medical and profes sional affairs Until then one of the most persistent criticisms of the agency had been that no policy making executive post was oc cupied by a black Puerto Ri can or Jew Dr Lacot without voicing criticism of past performance said his own priorities in the new job would be as follows Greater emphasis on pre ventive medicine The separa tion of the Health Department and the hospitals Dr Lacot said has made it difficult to introduce the concept of pre ventive medicine in our hos pitals An effort to get more work from the medical schools and private hospitals that are af filiated with the municipal hos pital system Improved cooperation among the many disciplines that func tion in the hospitals We talk a lot about the team concept he noted but do very little in practice partly because of arrogance on the part of some professionals In a reference to his own appointment Dr Lacot re marked Communication between the grassroots and the top eche lons of management is one of our major problems A related criticism of the new system has been its failure to bring into being the community advisory boards that were pro vided for in the law that created the corporation Last fall the corporation announced guide lines for the formation of these boards and instructed each hos pital adminitrator to submit his plans for establishing them The idea was that since each community has its own dynam ics and power structure each should select a hospital advisory board that would be truly rep resentative Up to now however not one community advisory board has been selected Under these guide lines Some community boards that existed before the corporation though have proved effective in getting their wishes convert ed to reality The board at Lin coln Hospital for instance was instrumental in getting Dr Lacot named administrator last year over the opposition of Jo seph V Terenzio who was then Commissioner of Hospitals

Londoners Who Prefer New York Tell the Reasons Why,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/31/archives/londoners-who-prefer-new-york-tell-the-reasons-why.html,Fed up with their own city not a few New Yorkers think that life must surely be bet ter in London A couple of former Lon doners Peter and Virginia Yates who now own an apartment on Park Avenue think that life is better here Well at least some impor tant aspects of it are better Since Mr Yates is a mo tion picture director Bul litt John and Mary Murphys War he and his wife and two children can choose where they want to make their home My work would let us live in California or London or New York or Paris said Mr Yates in the modern liv ing room of their Park Ave nue apartment its starkness softened by a trestle table holding about 50 plants We chose New York because we think its the most vital Praise Seldom Heard Then he added in a tossed off manner If I could speak French better I might want to live in Paris That random thought out of the way he and his wife who was curled up beside him on a sofa began to count the ways in which they like New York Theyve been here three years and their list formed the sort of paean that is not often heard these clays The 41yearold head of the house led off the list with his belief that a family is a closer unit here Be cause of the crime in the streets he said the mem bers are driven in on each other you have to know where everyone is at all times And while Mr Yates deplores the crime he likes the byproduct of a closer knit family Virginia Yates said she appreciated the day schools There are no good ones in London while here theyre marvelous Both 8year old Toby and 5yearold Mi randa go to Dalton and their parents are especially grate ful that Toby can go there In London said his mother its very difficult to send children to school after theyre 8 and still keep them with you the whole system in England is geared for boys to leave the nest at 8 if they are to have a good education Mr Yates added I real ly dont see the point in sending your children away for a year at a period in their lives when they are the most impressionable Also at a time when they are prob ably most appealing to their parents By the way its much easier for children to meet other children here Mrs Yates nodded When a child is accepted at Dal ton the parents are given the telephone numbers of the other parents and Im told that this is the system at other schools this would never never happen in Lon don There the childs social life is set by the nanny your child gets to know the children of a nanny who is liked by your nanny and thats about it Because the Dalton parents are encour aged to meet one another at school activities Miranda has made such good friends here that when we are in London she carps because she wants to be with the little girls she knows back here Theres no such thing as a PTA in London Mrs Yates said Parents are not welcomed at the schools there They are regarded as intruders while here they are urged to become in volved I like that I think we should be involved The talk turned from chil dren W housekeeping Its an absolute breeze here said Mrs Yates who does her own cooking in New York and used to do it in London where the family had a house We do miss the garden What makes housekeeping such a breeze here is that groceries may be ordered by telephone and food stores will deliver The talk turned to other differences Its easier to take exercise here said Peter Yates who plays ten nis regularly And I find that I have a healthier at titude toward exercise when Im in New York maybe be cause so many others do When we go back to London and say weve been living in New York people say Oh then youre into that psychoanalytic thingwhich were notor Oh youre into that health thing  which we are Of course its easier here because of the weather The talk came back to vio lence At least its more understandable here said Peter Yates It has a cer tain purpose since the im balance between the rich and the poor is so extraordinary London does not have such grinding poverty Virginia Yates said Weve had more burglaries in London than here and there are parts of London I wouldnt want to walk alone in at night But Id rather meet the burglar in London than the one here Mr Yates said What were other advan tages in London besides hu mane burglars and gardens Londons Clean Air The air is better said Mrs Yates Since London cleaned up its air some spe cies of birds that hadnt been seen there in 50 years have come back Its illegal to use a wood burning fireplace there now said Mr Yates Then he added Here its just terribly expensive What have been the hard est things to take in New York Mrs Yates said I used to get irritated at hav ing everyone ask me what I did All I was doing was fixing up a new apartment She and her husband ex changed glances and then she went on What really upset us was that when mentioned my pregnancy were

World of the City Prostitute Is a Tough and Lonely Place,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/08/09/archives/world-of-the-city-prostitute-is-a-tough-and-lonely-place-the-world.html,There are two closets in Rosies bedroom but she keeps one closed It is the other that she is staring at as she lies in bed the one whose door is always open the one with three mink coats  a dark brown one a lighter brown one arid her favorite a floorlength white one  In the fall she can wear them again That will be bet ter shes thinking It will be easier to get rich dates and maybe maybe this year one of them will marry her Rosie tries not to look at the other closet but does anyway As always it makes her glance at her watch 4 PM In seven hours she will be on the street wearing some thing from that closet the purple sequined sweater per haps and the black leather hot pants She wrinkles her nose and sulks looking for a moment like the girl she used to be sitting in home room A at St Annes being scolded by Sister Catherine for her poor arithmetic And then she looks at her watch again and rubs her finger over the diamonds It really is a pretty watch just right for her the man at Tiffanys told her last weekand how else was she to get it No other way Rosie tells herself So she is a prosti tute one of about 4000 in the city She lives with them in a special world a tough and lonely nether world a so ciety with its own mores its own social structure its own style of talking and dressing and playing its own drug problem its own brands of violenceeven its own snob bery A New Life Some Day Rosie says she hates that world and will leave it soon in a year maybe two years she doesnt like the mental strain of soliciting men on the street and trying to fig ure out who is safe and who is a sadist She doesnt like going home to Boston where her father is a policeman and her mother is a hair dresser where she pretends she is just a cocktail wait ress whose boy friends give her furs If only there was a way of making all the money I make without sleeping with all those men she says with a sigh But Rosie is luckier than many of the girls in the nether world  in four years she has been arrested only four times for she is never on the street very long and she has never had gonorrhea either because she goes to her doctor once a week for penicillin shots Other prostitutes in the cityat least half of them perhaps morehave a tar harder life West Side street walkers mostly they have The pimps are hardened criminals Police Commissioner Patrick V Mur phy said in an interview after he ordered a special unit to gather infor mation on them The pimps and the people behind them put up the money for the clothes and the apartments for the prostitutes when they are set up here by organized crime It is the pimps who pay the fines and put up the bail for the prostitutes that get them back on the streets These pimps with their new Cadillacs are trying to move up in the world of organized crime been arrested 30 40 or 50 times they have been mis treated often by their cus tomers for they unlike Rosie cannot afford to turn away men who dont look nice They have had gonorrhea and abortions and pregnancies and they have had their trick babies so named after the unknown fathers They forget to go to the doctor or to take birthcontrol pills And they go back each night to the same corner where they may have been arrested five previous times They let their figures go and their hair turn lifeless and their skin corrode But to the girls the lust for money is strong Just One More Hassle The police are conducting one of their periodic crack downs on prostitution In the nether world the crackdown is just one more hassle added to all the rest The girls adjust being more careful about the peo ple they talk to and where they go The life continues Four oclock in the after noon To Rosie 21 years old its the hardest part of the dayshe has seven hours to spend before she goes out to Lexington or Fifth Avenues She has no one to spend them withher few friends are also prostitutes and like her they stay at home in the late afternoon and early eve ning in case one of their regulars should call and want to come up for a 50 or 100 trick She gets out of bed and wraps on a peignoir she bought yesterday at Berg dorfs She looks around her room at the apricot walls the white and gold French style furniture and moves on to look at the living room with gold walls and more matching French furniture then at the second bedroom the television room She has spent 7000 decorating this apartment and pays 425 a month rentand each day she makes the same tour She goes to another closet in the hall She takes out seven wigs a hair dryer and a plate of curlers And for the next three hours she toys with her wigs washing them curling them combing them out I like to do it she says I wanted to be a hair dresser I still may be one some day She looks like a little girl playing with dolls and she does it each day hour after hourRosie the girl who came to New York dreaming of parties and travel and gay escapades of dancing at the Plaza and riding in racing cars of all the wonderful things her life would be as soon as she got some money Social Classes Rosie like many girls in her world is something of a snobthere is a social struc ture in the hustling life with class levels based entirely on the specifics of ones job I see those girls on Broad way I walk right by I pre tend I have nothing to do with them says Rosie who works the East Side limits her time on the streets to two hours a night four or five days a week and makes 1000 a week Theyre so bad Im ashamed to say Im a prostitute Dee is one of those girls Rosie ignoresshe works Broadway from 44th to 50th Street begins work at 2 AM charges 20 for a 10minute trick and 50 for something special Thats a lot of hard work all those beatings the weirdos want she says She makes 150 to 200 on a good night and most of her money comes from the weirdos Dee is 25 now and has been working for five years She appears to be 30 at least If one looks very carefully ignoring the huge wig and the thick makeup one can see that she must have been very very pretty oncetall and statuesque with smooth black skin and finely drawn fea tures But she is not so pretty now and it is not just the wig and the makeup There is a flat look in her eyes Dee like many of her colleagues seems totally devoid of emo tion She sits in the coffee shop at Manhattan Criminal Court freshly arraigned after her 47th arrest and says of her work It used to bother me at firstmy first night I felt so dirty I couldnt wash it off But now it doesnt Im used to it Now she adds I look at a man and all I see is dollar signs Sleeping with them its you know nothing she says Its like drinking a cup of coffee I never was all that interested in them My par ents always told me men were dirty Maybe thats why I do this And then she shrugs If you really want to know she says its the money I was working as a nurses aide and how much can you make HasBeens Still Are Below Dee in the nether world are haggardlooking 40and 50yearold hasbeens called dumpers heroin addicts girls in the 10 trickhouses the 15trick houses and the quarter houses 25 a trick These the most common type of brothel in the city consist of two or three girls working out of a not very glamorous two  bedroom apartment sometimes with a madam sometimes without But in terms of status in the hustling world the girls in Rosies class are below the straight call girls and they are nothing at all com pared to their societys stars the women who run the ritzier houses where prices start at 50 for a halfhour and can go as high as 1000 for a bachelor party or orgy There are women such as Jackie She is 27 blonde Europeanborn and bred Jackie runs a house in the East Fifties She spends weekends in the Hamptons during the summer in Puerto Rico in the winter She has more Puccis than most wives of Wall Street brokers and is beginning to collect Galanoss clothes as well She believes she should be treated like a stock brokers wife We dont hassle people she says Our customers call us It is one thing if the police want to arrest the street prostitutes who create hazards on the side walks But why she asks should they hassle us Jackie works and lives in a large apartment in a high rise luxury building on a treelined sidestreet there are five girls on duty Jackie presides in a negligee At my house she says emphasizing the my a man has a drink first lie relaxes Her house is open Mon day through Thursday with private sessions on Sunday evenings for those who would like a slave scene in which Jackie whips customers or otherwise satisfies their secret fantasies For those who want only companionship a dinner date perhaps Jackie can service their needs too drawing from a list of call girls and charging 100 an hour Jackie gets 50 per cent the standard cut for madams Jackie a former secretary was not always so high in the prostitutes hierarchy A year and a half ago she was working the quarter houses herself She had got into them when in the wake of a broken engagement she began a whirl of promiscuity to prove myself and then was told by a man that I was crazy to give it away for nothing And then as she tells it men told me I was too good to work for 25 So exerting what she likes to call her leadership talents she set up a house of her own Jackie delights in the life I love it she says Unlike the majority of the women in her business Jackie gets physical and emo tional pleasure from her work going so far on occa sion as to fall in love with some of my clients She par ticularly enjoys the slave scenes she says And it is not just the men she enjoys it is the women too the girls work ing for her with whom she parties when business is slow For all her leadership talents Jackie like most prostitutes needs some kind of private tiesthere are only a few girls like Rosie who work as independents So there is a family struc ture for prostitutes and as in the straight world there is one traditional unit and then there are variations for those who would be more modern Jackie is one of the modern types She has an old man as she calls him who keeps her He is a Jewish businessman who takes her to the theater on Saturday nights and to Puerto Rico in the winter And then she has a beautiful young boy She keeps the boy in the apart ment she shares with one of the girls who work in her house He is European and beautiful she explains and in his late twenties I give him presents and we have sex all three of us Quite a few of the higher class call girls in the city also have beautiful boys others have old men but few have both for as Jackie puts it the old man gets jealous Michelle is more tradition al She has a pimp she calls her husband She is one of the pimps wives and the five other girls in his stable are her wivesinlaw the whole group being the family On Thanksgiving and Christmas and Easter they all get together for a big meal Pretty and Polite Michelle is at least as pretty as Jackie5 feet 6 inches 108 pounds She has shiny brown hair falling mid way down her back and the general appearance of the models in Glamour maga zines college issue She is also polite A call girl she could stand in a line of debutantes and no one at the cotillion would notice the difference But she is not very bright like most prostitutes she spent her first few months working as a streetwalker and in that time was ar rested 11 times And she has no leadership talents at all if someone else can take care of the details of her life the way her parents back in Los Angeles used to all the better So she has a pimp She gives him all her earnings her fee is 50 for a half hour 300 for overnightand he buys her clothes and her furniture he pays her rent and her doctor bills and he arranges for a lawyer when she gets arrested She is his favorite wife at the moment he stops in to see her at least once a day Her wivesinlaw see him only every other day She was almost a virgin when she became a prostitute she says and shes more emo tionally attached to him than to anyone else before Michelle in fact is quite proud of her pimp He had one of the first bubbletops in the city on his Cadillac she boasts She is also rather proud as are many of the girls of the fact that he does no work himself Some girls are seduced by pimps courted for a month or so and then given the choice stay and work for me or get out A few girls the police say have been kidnapped beaten and given another kind of choice work for me or be killed But many like Michelle seek out the pimps themselves Some pimps set nightly quotas and beat their girls if they do not meet the quotas The police say some girls have even been shot Michelle asked about that looks away for a moment and pauses She has never been beaten she says shrugging and the only times she has a quota are when her pimp is broke Then he calls us all together and gives us a lecture he tells us to work harder She pauses again and looks around the apartment of her wifeinlaw where she has been staying since she was evicted from her own apart ment three weeks ago when her neighbors complained to the superintendent about her pimp and her customers She looks at the fourfoot high gilded statue of Venus rising from an equally gilded shell in the corner She frowns and says she does not like her life the hassles of it the constant pretense of romance But she does like her pimp And she says you cant be with a pimp if youre not working for him you know Michelle is white as are 60 per cent of the prostitutes in the city according to police figures Her pimp is black as are 95 per cent of the pimps here Little Bit a streetwalker on Lexington Avenue so named because of her tiny size has one of the few white pimps her life is markedly different than those of girls with black ones We split 5050 Little Bit says proudly and my pimp doesnt have any other girls College to Bed Little Bit is indeed some what atypical but not in terms of her pimps color For she comes from an Orthodox Jewish family in Brooklyn into a society where few are Jewish and she is temporarily on leave of absence from the City College of New York where for four semesters she had a B average And al though she became a prosti tute largely for the money she concedes that she was promiscuous and that the life of a prostitute intrigued her So why does she have a pimp Because she says sit ting crosslegged on her black plush sofa and pulling her white nightgown under her toes you need someone to come home to  you sleep with 10 men in a night youre a litle bit whacky She couldnt have a straight boyfriend she ex plains because he wouldnt understand Prostitutes in fact asso ciate almost entirely with other prostitutes pimps and as Dee puts it people in the business junkies con men people like that They have their own fa vorite spotsseveral bars in the Times Square area a couple more elegant estab lishments uptown for the madmen the 15 or 20 pimps here who have as many as 15 girls working for them some as prostitutes some as shoplifters They have their own after hours bottle clubs too and they have decadesold tradi tions about where to go on a big night outgirl after girl lists the Copacabana as her favorite nightspot The biggest night is a championship fight At the AliFrazier fight Dee was in white satin and feathers And even bigger because it means a whole weekend out of town is the Kentucky Derby They have their own fa vorite drugs too  not so much heroin but cocaine a strong stimulant that some pimps believe  wishfully to be an aphrodisiac Loneliness a Problem But the girls do not go out for fun very often Mostly they spend their free hours at home pacing with bare feet over the walltowall carpeting that each has in stalled to cut down on noise The worst thing about this life says Michelle get ting up to turn off her tele vision as a visitor arrives is the loneliness The girls also suffer under the knowledge they are doing something most people say is immoral To cope with it they have developed their own set of mores and their own vocabulary They call themselves working girls or if they are call girls courtesans Their customers are tricks and johns and dates Their work is a business or even to someone like Jackie a social service Little Bit will no longer take her dates to fleabag hotels because when she tried it once she says it made me feel like a whore Rosie will not have an abor tion she says because Im a Catholic By the prostitutes code prostitution is moral while as Dee phrases it whats im moral is giving it away free sleeping around with any one Policemen who lie are also regarded as immoral Pimps beating girls who hold out money is considered bad but understandable hookers beating other hook ers something that the girls say is increasing is consid ered bad and unforgivable Little Bit was robbed by a hooker a few weeks ago The other girls on her block have not let the responsible girl work their area since As for prostitutes robbing their johns no prostitute will admit to an outsider that she has done such a thing Those are the tough girls they say they are not really prostitutes the explanation usually goes theyre the crooks posing as prostitutes The life is still hard pimps and nights off and special mores notwithstanding You never know who youre going to meet up with says Rosie There are a lot of guys who like to cut girls up Tough Customers Rosie has not met with one yet but Little Bit has One night seven months ago she brought a man to her apart ment and he pulled out a gun Before he left he stripped her raped her and tied her up threatening all the while to shoot her if she screamed Then there are the arrests even when the city is not having a crackdown Jackie herself has had her tangles with the police and complains that the number of houses has dwindled under harass ment And there is not for many girls all that much money Independents like Rosie get a lot but spend a lotin four years Rosie figures she has saved about 7000 Girls like Michelle who give their money to the pimps have fancy clothes and apartments as long as they are working once they leave as Michelle says they dont even get to keep the furniture They rarely put much money in bank accounts for fear that the Internal Revenue Service may find them out and try to tax them So though a few girls say as Dee does that I couldnt care less about the future many talk of giving up the life and getting married Lit tle Bit for her part talks of going back to college But often the girls talk about giving up the life a year or two from now rather than tomorrow or next week I have a pretty good busi ness now says Little Bit and it might be stupid not to keep it for vacations when Im back at school And often they talk about marriage wistfully They say prostitutes make the best wives Rosie says but I dont know

"Why, Liberation Must Be Everybody's",https://www.nytimes.com/1971/08/12/archives/why-liberation-must-be-everybodys.html,LONDONThe most noticeable result of womens lib in England is that most women nave already benefited from it To some extent they are beginning to feel freer from doubletalk doublethink isolation and guilt Worry about sexual role and sexual performance physical exhaustion at the social and psychological load they have been carrying distaste for the projected images of womenall are being aired I dont know of any woman who isnt grateful for this But I wonder myself whether a thoroughly successful movement to help this current along might not in the end have the reverse effect For all the movements and programs I have observed imply dogma flagwaving articles of faith and some degree of fanaticism Liberation to me is the reverse of all these things it implies that free response is not enslaved under any kind of banner Lib is inevitably a different manifestation in different people Mass movements produce change not liberation Change is deceptive bringing temporary refreshment and breathing spaceas research done in a mental hospital recently underlines schizophrenic symptoms were dramatically alleviated when patients were simply moved to a new ward But change is often no more than the redistribution of the load onto other shoulders or the relabeling of an old situation only temporarily energizing never a reduction of the burden To me that reduction is the aim Liberation must he everybodys By that token my gain is yours Thats why I think the most useful voice is Germaine Greers who tells it as she finds it toes no party line has a constructive attitude to individuals and general difficulties is unsentimentaland lends help and support to the movement with discrimination not as a cardcarrying duty The groups of course are proliferating Eric Hoffer once pointed out in The True Believer that no matter what the underlying ideas movements tend to attract the same kind of people the bored the lonely the frustrated the ambitious Movements do this Not ideas Research results in group psychology show also that the feeling of belonging the kicks taken from power and status in the group or the sense of purpose usually override the ideas which first stimulated the formation of the group One can see some of this happening in the womens liberation groups Too often good sense is becoming dissipated in the chum of group dynamics tentative understanding is aborted into slogans and the gap grows between what is thought what is said and what actually happens A member of one of the womens workshops here for instance told me recently that the idea which had so animated her at first had frozen solid Her group was vaguely aware that something was going wrong and was blaming the obstruction on obstacles from outside from conventional maledominated society One example she gave me was sexual the group had discussed orgasms at some length and after the relief of discovering that they had the common experience of finding clitoral orgasm easiest to achieve they turned this into a dogma The problem was neatly wrapped up Clit Is It My friend thought the truth might not be so simplistic or might lie elsewhere the door should not be slammed so fast on other possibilities and she said so They treated me like a heretic she said with some pain All they seemed to want was unanimous agreement and there I was sowing doubts I had been brainwashed they implied so they shut me up Heretic In lib It would be a shame if womenwith thew relatively unspoiled ability to Sense and smell whole situations which cant be known by the limited frames of logicshould while seeking freedom be inexorably propelled into yet another prison These workshops are mostly middle class Working class women have neither the time nor cash for the selfexamination of the workshops Their need of womens liberation is economic and political when it exists There is however in spite of the differences in intention a great degree of cooperation on matters of outstanding need Certain matters have crystallized supported by political groups workshops and the older mainstream womens organizations the need for 24hour nurseries free contraception and abortion on demand provision for unmarried mothers equal opportunities in education and pay Having edited what might have been the first and underground womens lib journal myself back in 1962 and then walked away from it in inexperienced disappointment at the amount of obsessions let loose I have felt since that if the obsessions the fury and the maleroleimitating are to come out then there must be some vigilance to see that the baby doesnt go with the bath water If lib becomes a successful mass movement or infighting between the groups parallels that in the existing masculine institutions as it often does here then we may be in the position of people from developing nations so hungry for the new culture that they ignore what is of value in their own Women know that knowledge and sensitivity should be guarded Indeed women in other cultures less fractured than our own probably also know things which could profitably be sought and retrieved as one example techniques of autohypnosis in childbirth are handed on to girls in their puberty initiations among some African tribes And how is it that at least two countries whose women are purportedly less emancipated that we have produced prime ministers who are light years away from being butch Knowledge of both masculine and feminine needs to be better understood and more clearly acknowledged to exist in varying degrees in all of us This is something different from our social roles What we need as well as any social and political change is a process of lib or individuation or clarityseeking call it what you like Out of that we might get a situation rare in our culture which prefers meagerly to polarize good or bad up or down win or lose in which everyone wins
Queens Councilman To Succeed Leviss,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/08/15/archives/queens-councilman-to-succeed-leviss-queens-councilman-to-succeed.html,The next Borough Presi dent of Queens will be Coun cilman Donald R Manes a Democrat of Flushing a like lihood that is freely admitted by every politician around except Mr Manes He sits at his desk in the City Council Democrats of fice at City Hall A fellow Councilman strolls by and says Good morning Mr Borough President Mr Manes frowns Our next Borough Presi dent says another official introducing a constituent to Mr Manes who rolls his eyes in exasperation For Mr Manes although he is only 37 years old is a political traditionalist His county leader and fellow Councilman the outspoken Matthew J Troy Jr has let it be known that Mr Manes will step up as part of a package worked out by Mr Troy and others that out raged some politicians and editorial writers but rather pleased others who admire political professionalism The deal has been a matter of common political knowledge for weeks Surrogate Retires But Mr Manes holds to the old political school that does not speak publicly of such arrangements until they are fully consummated The round of political musical chairs part of a bi partisan agreement worked out by the new Democratic leader Councilman Troy and the Queens Republican leader Sidney J Hein has al ready begun It started when John T Clancy retired as Queens sur rogate recently end was re placed In that 391uU4year post by his political prot6g6 Louis D Laurino who was appointed to the State Court of Claims last April by Gov ernor Rockefeller Also involved in the ar rangement are six State Su preme Court judgeships Both major parties have agreed to nominate three Democrats and three Republicans for these 39100ayear posi tions Involved also is bi partisan support for Queens District Attorney Thomas J Mackell in his reelection bid next fall and the successor to Borough President Sidney Leviss To the Left Mr Maness oldfashioned attitude regarding discussion of such agreements is some what out of keeping with his own political background and political philosophy He first won election to the Council as an insurgent of sorts and has functioned as an occa sional maverick in his early days in the local legislature Asked to assess his philoso phy he muses then says thoughtfully that Im prob ably to the left of my dis trict He won the most public attention of his Council ca reer in a legislatively regular role as chairman of the com mittee that extended and refashioned the rentcontrol law in 1970 But he grins as he recol lects his first effort to push something through the Coun cil The first resolution I in troduced he says was one asking the Legislature in Al bany to release Al Blumen thals original abortion bill from committee I asked im mediate consideration La move that may be blocked under Council rules by one objection] Well I asked it and my God half the Coun cil leaped up to object Opposed Taxi Panel Over the years he has dem onstrated a willingness to worknot a universal qual ity in the Counciland an interest in housing legisla tion that eventually put him in charge of the rentcontrol extension probably the Councils major piece of legislation so far in the four year session that started in January 1970 A heavyset man with a politicians loud exuberant manner Mr Manes is one of the Councils best story tell ers and he is adept at build ing empathy with a crowd During the Councils tra vail over the legislation ear lier this year to create a taxi commission he went along with his laborunion supporters rather than the Council leadership and op posed the measure On the night of the final vote with taxi drivers pack ing the galleries and reacting loudly to the debate Mr Manes sizing up his audience stood to bellow Heres one Councilman wholl get a taxi cab ride home tonight  vote No And he got as he knew he would a thun derous cheer The Manes political career is likely to take its next step next month after Mr Leviss resigns as Queens Borough President to accept a bipartisan nomination as a Supreme Court justice and Mr Manes steps upa move that will be timed so that he will not have to face a chal lenge in the Democratic pri mary until 1973 Councilman Maness career began in 1955 when an un suspecting Democratic peti tion gatherer knocked on the door of the Manes family home and 21yearold Don ald then a Brooklyn Law School student answered Invitation Extended The guy said It was in reference to signing a nomi nating petition and I asked the candidates name Mr Manes now a veteran of such political rule and nutsand bolts work recalled Then asked where he stood on the issues The poor guy said Look this only qualifies him to run And I said we should care about who we qualify And he finally said Look if youre so interested maybe you ought to come down to the club  Down to the club young Mr Manes went to pursue a political career that saw him become an assistant district attorney then counsel to the Democratic majority leader of the State Assembly his Queens neighbor Moses Weinstein and then a candi date for the Democratic Council nomination in the 15th District in Central Queens against Mr Wein steins candidate in 1965 But apparently the sobriety of the effort impressed the voters Mr Manes won his primary easily and in the pre dominantly middleclass Jew ish district that he represents the Democratic primary is the only election that counts By 1969 when Mayor Lind say loser of the Republican primary for Mayor was lining up endorsements from every liberal Democrat in sight Mr Manes was able to turn the Mayor down and still win re election easily while the Mayor was carrying his dis trict Now although he flatly refuses to say anything pub licly about his impending step up to the borough presidency Mr Manes suggests that he is part of a newstyle leader ship team that is taking shape around Mr Troy He declined to be

A Sugary Approach to Helping Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/08/15/archives/a-sugary-approach-to-helping-women.html,ATLANTA Ga Aug 14 APBirth control and health information is being dispensed in Emory Universitys Family Planning Program through a sugarcoat ed pill  a pulp confessions magazine titled True to Life Its stories bear such titillating titles as Mother Made Me Do It But She Wouldnt Tell Me Why I Had to Prove My Manhoodand My Wife Had to Pay the Price and He Said It Was for My True Love Who Was Far Far Away Marjorie Crowe editorinchief of the magazine says a working class wo man sitting in a waiting room is far more likely to pick up such a magazine and learn from itthan she is a tech nical health magazine Birth control information and plugs for routine health examinations are subtly woven into narratives about ex tramarital love and premarital preg nancy Miss Crowe who is 25 years old is a member of Emory Universitys Family Planning Program which is part of the colleges School of Medicine She first got the idea for the confessionsmaga zines approach when she was reading a book Working Class Wife by Lee Rainwater a Harvard sociologist He talked about a group of women who read True Confessions in the sense that they identify with the characters and see them as essentially strong mor al people who have similar problems Miss Crowe said These women take a lot of comfort in the fact that others can have some really terrible things happen to them and can still be good women Many people consider these magazines racy and sexy but if you read them care fully youll see that sin usually is pun ished Miss Crowe three students on a sum mer fellowship program and an associ ate editor Felicia Guest began boning up on old confessions magazines to use as guides Then they wrote their stories slip ping in health messages for those wo men who would be sitting in a city hospital clinic waiting room Office of Economic Opportunity centers in Atlan ta and Planned Parenthood offices We departed from the usual con fessional magazine in that they tend always to show woman in a dependent relationship to a man Miss Crowe said We feel its important that she get away from that idea if she is to ex ercise control over her life For example I Had to Prove My Manhoodand My Wife Had to Pay the Price is a strongly feminist story about a woman who gets an illegal abortion because her husband kept her pregnant He didnt want her to work since she brought home more money than he did An excerpt from that narrative As selfish as I was being I still loved Kris and

"“The abused child is the responsibility of the community and society at large because, if he survives, he will strike out society and become the criminal; or the battering parent, tomorrow?’",https://www.nytimes.com/1971/08/16/archives/child-abuse-does-it-stem-from-nations-ills-and-its-culture.html,The screams carry beyond locked doors and closed windows but to the doctors who deal with battered children the sound isnt carrying far enough The incidence of reported child abuse in New York City went up 549 per cent between 1966 and 1970 and rose again in the first six months this year Part of the increase can be attributed to amendment of a 1964 New York State law requiring doctors nurses hospital and social service personnel and school officials among others to report cases of child abuse and neglect But some enerts see the statistics as sympto matic of the times and a result of the American belief that physical forces is a legitimate procedure in child rearing One or two children are being killed at the hands of their own parents in this country every day said Dr Vin cent J Fontana chairman of the Citys Task Force on Child Abuse and Neglect He quoted what he termed conserva tive figures indicating that 50 children in the city died each year as a result of maltreatment These children are beaten with in struments ranging from bare fists to baseball bats he said Others are be ing burned over open flames gas btu ners and cigarette lighters some are strangled others are suffocated with pillows or plastic bags and some are being drowned One of the most recent cases to come to light resulted in the arrest last week of a Brooklyn couple Amado Melendez 35 and his wife Herotida 27 were charged with child abuse after police found their 7yearold son wandering the streets with both his hands burned The police said all eight children ranging in age from 18 months to 12 years were scarred from beatings and that the youngest had been found bound to a crib And yesterday a Brooklyn woman was charged with murder after the police found one of her three foster children dead of malnutrition and the others close to starvation and bruised from apparent beatings There are no accurate figures avail able on the number of children physical ly sexually and emotionally abused in this country each year but estimates range upward from 500000 Dr David G Gil of Brandeis University after a twoyear analysis of about 13000 child beating reports in the 50 states esti mates that as many as 25 million chil dren are physically abused each year His definition however includes all types of physical attacks on children whether minor or serious What cambe done to solve or at least alleviate the problem Dr Gil impatient of what he calls BandAid shortterm procedures advocates a revolutionary change in the value system that per mits the striking of children If we want to do away with the phenomenon we must do away with the structural causes he said We shouldnt be satisfied with symptomatic treatment Dr Gils first priority would be out lawing the use of any physical force on children in the public domain At pres ent he said only two states New Jersey and Maryland have such laws There should be laws against corporal punishment in schools juvenile courts and childcare he said I personally feel the law should apply to homes too but Im not naive enough to believe that could be enforced Dr Gil a professor of social policy has found that American culture en courages in subtle ways the use of certain measure of physical force in rear ing children A public opinion poll taken by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago reinforced this be lief Americans in general were said to have a culturally determined permis sive attitude toward corporal punish ment Rarely if ever is corporal punishment administered for the benefit of the at tackedchild Dr Gilsaid Usually it serves the needs of the attacking adult who is seeking relief from his uncon trollable anger and stress His view that child abuse stems from societys sanctioning of corporal punish ment is based upon the very low inci dence of abuse found in cultures that have strong taboos against striking chil dren such as the American Indians The Indians disciplined their young mainly through example and shame The Effeet of Poverty Dr Gils second suggested solution was doing away with poverty a sweeping recommendation which would he said meet with considerable opposition The proposal stemmed from his study that found that abuse tended to occur more often in large families of low socioeconomic status and educational achievement It was pointed out how ever that children beaten in more pros perous homes were more likely to be treated by private physicians or go unreported And I believe that birth control and free abortion could also help a great deal he said Dr Fontanas experience as director of pediatrics at St Vincents Hospital and Medical Center of NeW York and medical director of New York Foundling Hospital has also led him to believe that some women simply dont want their children But he does not advocate birth control or abortion Any mother who has the feeling that she cant cope with a child and doesnt want it should be the responsibility of society he said Forcing a mother to keep a child is wrong Many women [who abuse their children] are really crying for help saying Take this child away from me His remedial suggestions include re moving abused children at an early age from parents At 3 4 and 5 years old he said the child is already emo tionally scarred He also recommends getting concerned individuals to help cafe for and sit with children of harried mothers We have to adopt a beyourown socialworker attitude he said The abused child is the responsibility of the community and society at large because if he survives he will strike out at so ciety and become the criminal or the battering parent of tomorrow Dr Ray Helfer who is with the De partment of Human Development at Michigan State University also ap proved the idea of parentaids or help ers supervised by social workers who could intervene in a family structure before abuse occurred Help fore Young Mothers We have to attack the isolationism often displayed by abusive parents he said This can be done by using non degree people like a friendly older per son to help a young mother He thought that removing children from parents was a short term ap proach and that psychiatric help for the parents was unrealistic in a practi cal sense Most social services are after the fact he said Its very difficult to get help for someone who is about to beat or may beat a child Who are the parents who abuse batter and neclect children General agreement is confined to only one factor The par ents themselves were almost always abused and battered as children Dr Fontana is of the opinion that the potential for child abuse is present in all ramifications of society The reason you hear more of lower income families is that the triggers are there he said Some of the triggers mentioned were financial stress pressures and over crowding There are fewer stresses and strains in the middle class he said According to Dr Helfer who has been involved in childabuse research for al most a decade the potential for abuse can be identified before a man or woman is married or becomes a parent Dr Helfer former chairman of pedi atrics at the Catholic Medical Center in Brooklyn and Queens outlined the abu sive potential as Men and women with a traumatic rearing physically or emotionally People who do not have enough trust or understanding to allow others to help them They do not have the acquired skill in learning how to use other people to bail them out Men and women with a unique ability to find a mate who had been either reared in the same way or was so passive that he or she did not inter vene Abuse is a family affair it is whole family structure that allows beiting to occur Individuals who expect children to take care of them as parents These are people with unrealistic expectations Dr Helfer said One mother put it vividly when she said waited all this time to have a baby and when she was born she didnt do any thing for me To that mother crying meant the baby didnt love her Dr Helfer pointed out that a special kind of child was also required to turn potential into reality In some families with several children one was beaten and others werent The victimized child could have any one of a number of traits that triggered or irritated the latent abusive qualities It could be the child who is ill has a birth defect cries a great deal doesnt smile or is the wrong sex he said Given the potentially abusive parent and the special child a third factor was also considered necessary by Dr Helfer There must be a precipitating cri sis he said The crisis can be any thing from very minimal to very major To Dr Vincent de Francis the prob lem of the abused child is an overall one encompassing not only physical but sexual and emotional abuse Dr de Francis director of the chil drens division American Humane As sociation noted that a threeyear study conducted in New York City uncovered more than 9000 cases of sexual abuse in children Incest accounted for 38 per cent he said but there are no limits to the kind of offenses other than ones imagination From the New York study one could estimate that there are 100000 sexually abused children throughout the nation he added The Child Who Is Rejected Families who do not physically or sexually abuse children but who fail to provide emotional sustenance were equally assailed by Dr de Francis The child finds himself rejected un wanted not loved or cared for he said He has no sense of belonging and feels inferior He is sometimes identi fied as the hyperactive child in the classroom but really he is shouting for help for somebody to do something for him Or he becomes the withdrawn child the one who gets into a shell This neglect influences behavior as an adult and as a parent The primary recommendation of the Mayors Task Force a centralized 24 houraday sevendayaweek telephone emergency service 4314680 has al ready gone into effect A social or case worker representing the Bureau of Child Welfare is sent out as quickly as possible on receipt of a call Frequently the local police precinct is also in formed Another recommendation a compu terized registry on child abuse has also been set up In five months of operation an average of 16 calls a day were suf ficiently serious to end up as entries on the registry In the past many doctors did not re port suspected abuses for several rea sons among them fear of involvement and according to Dr Fontana either not recognizing abuse or an unwilling ness to accept the fact that a broken arm or skull was due to the parents More than 2200 cases of child abuse have been reported in New York City this year The projected figure for 1971 s 4560 The easiest thing to do is shove under the carpet Dr Fontana said But if we dont take a stand it will hit our homes eventually We have to involve ourselves
CRITICS ANSWERED,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/08/18/archives/president-calls-for-sacrifices-critics-answered-plea-to-moral-power.html,President Nixon appealed here last night to the nations moral power and for tempo rary sacrifice to back up his new economic program He told a Knight of Columbus dinner audience at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel that he believed everyone who wants to work  in America should have the chance to work and said that his program was aimed at cre ating 20 million new jobs in the next 10 years And he moved to meet some of the criticism of the 90day wageprice freeze he announced in a sweeping fiscal program Sunday night He said his plan would require businessmen to hold the line while profits are slim and more than 20 million investors might have to forgo an increase in dividends Nations Heritage Cited kmerica became a strong nation and a great nation and a rich nation because weve always had a competitive spirit Mr Nixon declared He said that the country had helped wartorn nations and new nations during the last quarter century and that they had Scored successes The time has come he went on to be ourselves again still compassionate pouring out our wealth to all of those in need around the world when we can still with a sense of responsibility toward others in the world still fair still ready to help those who need help Proud of Precedent But also let us be deter mined to show wlat we cat do and let us compete with other nations without having one hand tied behind our back Mr Nixon declared that he was proud to be the first Presi dent ever to address the policy making Supreme Council of the Knights of Columbus the Roman Catholic fraternal so ciety It was the organizations States Dinner  incidentally with no alcoholic beverages with state names at tables and state songs sung to strains from a sixpiece band Mr Nixon banteringly said the state signs held up at his entrance gave me somewhat the feel of a convention  didnt say which party because I realize this is an organization above party this organization has one party the United States of America On the threetiered dais in front of perhaps 1500 diners Mr Nixon and Attorney Gen eral John N Mitchell stood out in black tuxedoes while other dignitaries were mostly garbed in white The gathering included lead ers of the citys financial po litical and social communities as well as Catholic prelates and leaders It took place under excep tionally strong security protec tion with hundreds of city po licemen on surrounding streets and buildings Outside was a variety of demonstrations About 50 mem bers of the conservative Young Americans for Freedom accom panied by a group of Chinese opposed the Presidents pro posed trip to Communist China Clash Is Prevented Leftwing groups including Youth Against War and Fas cism brought out about 200 people denouncing both the war in Indothina and Nixons war against the poor The po lice prevented 25 members of the Jewish Defense League from crossing police lines to en gage the leftist group when it began chanting proArab slo gans about the Middle East Mr Nixon frequently extem porizing added thoughts be yond a prepared speech He told the dinner audience that we live in a time when the free economic system of the United States can produce what we have not had in America for 15 yearsa new prosperity with full employment and with out war We cannot let the apostles of defeatism and selfdoubt chip away at the moral strength of America he went on Nor can the nation he said ease up and lose the economic leader ship of the world or fall prey to a new isolationismgreat as the temptations may be to do that Nor can the American peo ple pass the responsibility of leadership solely to Govern ment he insisted America he said became great because of what people have done for themselves and for this coun try It will not be easy he said for a worker to forgo for awhile a wage increase that he deserves or for a Federal em ploye to do more work because the Federal staffs would be cut down But I say Mr Nixon con tended that if the temporary sacrifice of each of these groups of America will result in stopping the rise in the cost of living for all Americans this is a great goaland this is worth sacrificing for Let no one expect to make his fortune or his reputation by selling America short he coun seled Mr Nixon also moved to widen support for his new eco nomic efforts by what Ronald L Ziegler White House press secretary disclosed was an in vitation to a breakfast consul tation this morning with Gov ernor Rockefeller The Governor often a rival endorsed the Presidents new initiatives on Monday al though they included a defer ral of revenuesharing which Mr Rockefeller has strongly urged Before the President spoke the daylong Knights of Co lumbus meeting had heard ap pealswith reminders of par allel positions by Mr Nixon in the pastin favor of such causes as help for nonpublic schools and against elective abortions The Presidential jet Spirit of 76 took off from Andrews Air Force Base outside Wash ington at 523 PM arriving at Kennedy International Airport 35 minutes later A score of po lice cars surrounded the site from which Mr Nixon went by helicopter to Coenties Slip in Manhattan There Mr Nixon got into the fourth car of a 16car motor cade that brought him to the 50th Street

greetings to the Knights of Columbus con vention in which he told the 12millionmember Catholic fraternal society that his ad miration for their community programs had grown through his public career And at a time when Gov ernments throughout the world ere increasingly depending on the participation of civic or ganizations in the work of so cial progress his message said you have won the respect confidence and appreciation of the leaders of the nations you have served I applaud you for the self less dedication you bring to your worthwhile projects for the unwavering patriotism that abounds within your ranks and for the timely constructive ac tion on which your reputation is soundly based Cardinal Cooke took the oc casion of last nights dinner to express confidence that ways would be found to assist the parents of nonpublic school children Supreme Knight John W Mc Devitt of New Haven chief executive of the Knights of olumbus since 1964 in his formal report to the organiza tions

ABORTION CHANGE STALLED OVER U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/08/20/archives/abortion-change-stalled-over-us-bills-offered-by-both-sides-but.html,Although 35 state legislatures have considered abortion reform legislation this year no new laws have been passed so far The proposed bills included attempts by some states to liberalize old laws as well as attempts by others to repeal or modify liberalized laws The national legislative plcture was revealed in separate checks conducted this month by The New York Times and by the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws While active antiabortion groups are credited with deteating or tying up new liberalized bills the same groups were unable to repeal liberalized bills passed in earlier sessions This was especially true in New York State where more than 30 bills were introduced to weaken or repeal the yearold abortionondemand law Among the significant activities in this years legal picture are the following In April the Supreme Court ruled that the Washington DC law limiting abortions to those necessary for the preservation of the mothers life and health was not unconstitutionally vague At the same time the Court said that doctors could consider the mental as well as the physical health of the mother even if she had never sought psychlatric care before New York State passed two laws regulating profitmaking activities on abortion and one prohibiting referral services from giving information on clients to other than law enforcement agencies The antiabortion movement which has been led by the Roman Catholic Church sought to broaden its appeal to include other religious denominations and otherthanreligious groups A report by the abortion law repeal association said This year established abortion as an individual rights and public health issue throughout the country More state legislatures considered abortion legislation and more total repeal bills were filed than in any previous year Among these states were five with reform laws they sought to liberalize further
Year of Legal Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/08/21/archives/year-of-legal-abortion.html,The first year of legalized abortion in New York City has brought a substantial decline in maternity mortality Also down significantly are the citys total birth rate and its rate of illegitimate births Equally important in social terms the years experience shows that women of all ethnic and racial groups have availed themselves of the opportunity to prevent unwanted births legallyand many cases at little or no cost One happy incidental result is that all of this citys shelters caring for unmarried pregnant girls have this year reported a sizable drop in admission applications The implications of this analysis just published Family Planning Perspectives go well beyond New York City or even New York State The authors Dr Jean Pakter and Frieda Nelson point out that New York City has been performing a national function in this initial period since roughly 60 per cent of the 164300 abortions here were obtained by women from outside the city On the basis of their data the authors estimate that there would be a national demand for about 17 million abortions annually if such operations were legal throughout the country If this estimate is correct New York City which has less than 4 per cent of the nations population met almost 10 per cent of the national demand for abortions New York Citys experience has proved that large numbers of abortions can be done safely and relatively cheaply once the legal barriers are lifted That demonstration further strengthens the case for similar liberalization of existing law throughout the nation Family planning remains the best way to guard against unwanted children but it is no service to society to keep on the statute books prohibitions that condemn American women to grim risks in abortion mills
‘Poor Little Rich Girl’ Who's Now 83 Adds New Cause to List: Women's Lib,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/08/22/archives/-poor-little-rich-girl-whos-now-83-adds-new-cause-to-list-womens.html,She was a debutante who marched in suffragette parades a secretary who couldnt type a mother who was scared to death of her baby and an activist when most of her contemporaries didnt know the word Now at the age of 83 Mrs Robert McCurdy Marsh has discovered the womens liberation movement Several weeks ago her niece took her to a meeting addressed by Jacqueline Ceballos head of the New York City division of the National Organization for Women NOW I dont want to leave this world without being a part of this Mrs Marsh said after hearing the objectives of the organization Im very much in favor of equal pay and equal opportunity for women and things like the abolition of abortion laws Theres been sin since Adam and Eve and if they want to sin they will You cant legislate against it Mrs Marsh the former Charlotte Delafield sat slim and erect in the living room of her Park Avenue apartment She had just finished her Yoga exercises and was ready to reflect on the rights still denied her sex A great deal of trouble in this world would be avoided if men did not legislate for women she said Although she will not be in the city to join the parade of activist women on Thursday she will she said be with them in spirit The March for Equality 1971 sponsored by a number of womens groups will begin at 530 PM Thursday at Fifth Avenue and 44th Street It will end with a rally to be held between 7 and 730 PM at Fifth Avenue and 72d Street The first such march was held on the same date last year commemorating the 50th anniversary of womens suffrage Mrs Marsh credits her mother with stimulating her interest in areas considered unusual for women shortly after the turn of the century My father was a lawyer and quite conservative but my mother was very liberal she said looking back on her girlhood spent in Riverdale N Y Her mother Mrs Lewis Livingston Delafield a descendant of the Wyeths who fought at Bunker Hill was also one of the founders of the American Birth Control League My mother started my interest in womens suffrage she walked in parades and I walked with her I probably wouldnt have started by myself I was too shy But it wasnt long before the shy girl became a party captain in the movement and every afternoon at 530 another girl and myself would put on our best bib and tucker and call on women in our district By the time Mrs Carrie Chapman Catt the womens suffrage leader was organizing her final campaign for the vote Mrs Marsh remembers that she was sitting at her feet She later went on to become leader of the 15th Assembly District of the League of Women Voters A charter member of the National Womens Republican Club and a Republican captain in her district Mrs Marsh was asked if she would work for Fiorello La Guardia during his first mayoral campaign in 1933 I was chairman of his noonday speeches she said We had two motors and the first would start out with band and women speakers announcing that he was en route When he arrived the first motor would move on to another corner He usually made five speeches every noon hour At one point in the campaign Mr La Guardia advised her to bet on his victory and shes still delighted that she was sufficiently astute to follow his suggestion I put up 10 and I won 100 she said After the campaign the mayorelect asked if she would like to help run the city I was what you would call the Mayors social secretary she said But I was really no kind of secretary I taught myself half the alphabet on the typewriter and I didnt get any further Most of the work was interviewing people he couldnt see and sending them away with a smile Mrs Marsh doesnt hesitate to admit that she particularly enjoyed the job because she was independent I didnt have to work and I didnt need the money Nevertheless when the first check of her 3000 annual salary That was good money in those days arrived she cashed it rather than putting it in the bank I wanted to feel the money in my hands she said It was her first and last paying job During her first day in the Mayors office she met her future husband They were married 18 months later He was with the Young Republican Club and came to congratulate Mr La Guardia Then one day he came in and I said Ill tell Mr La Guardia you are here He said I dont want to see Mr La Guardia I came to see you Mr Marsh a descendant of Lewis Morris one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence was a lawyer who later became a New York State Supreme Court Justice He died in 1957 I suppose I could have been called a poor little rich girl Mrs Marsh said I didnt know how to make a cup of coffee and if the cook left and it took two days to get another I thought wed starve Then when the baby came was scared to death of it The baby is now Mrs Donald Eldredge of St Louis Mo the mother of four children Mrs Marshs culinary talents havent improved much since that time I nourish myself she said When get very hungry I go over to the Colony Club Over the years she has devoted herself to numerous clubs and organizations including the Church Womens League for Patriotic Service and the Descendants of Signers of the Declaration of Independence both of which she served as president the Colonial Dames of America The National Society of Colonial Dames the Daughters of the Cincinnati and the Lords of the Manor My main interest in life has always been people she said Its one of the reasons Ive always loved parties My mother once asked me if Id never get tired of them and I told her I never would  and I havent The woman who can remember when it was unusual to own a telephone My sister who was a toddler used to call it the hellobyebye is encouraged at the changes and progress she has seen during her lifetime But I wish I could live long enough to see all

The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/09/19/archives/new-chance-for-nixon-to-push-court-to-the-right-exit-black.html,The retirement of Justice Hugo L Black last Friday after 34 years on the Supreme Court signals the end of an era His appointment to the Court in 1937 created a new majority which was no longer disposed to exercise sweeping judicial vetoes over economic legislation but which became increasingly solicitous of the individual rights of citizens in their relationship with government Justice Black was one of the principal proponents of his libertarian trend which achieved Its greatest following in the Warren Court and his retirement making way for another appointment by President Nixon further dilutes the old libertarian majority It has been said that the Warren Court was incorrectly named that it should have been called the Black Court after its chief philosopher Certainly Justice Black was identified with many of the landmarks of the Warren Court his insistence upon the application of the Bill of Rights to the states through the 14th Amendment provided the foundation for many of the criminal due process decisions of the Court his view that the Constitution required equal legislative representation was finally accepted in the reapportionment decision his insistence upon complete separation of church and state is displayed in the decision he wrote barring prayers in schools his absolutist theory of the First Amendment freedom of speech contributed to the Courts more liberal definition of obscenity its striking down of much of the subversive activities legislation of the McCarthy era and in the last case of Justice Blacks career The New York TimesWashington Post Pentagon papers case the continued rejection of prior restraint on the freedom of the prss There were however some significant jurisprudential differences between Justice Black and the dominant trend of the Warren Court His often literal reading of the provisions of the Constitution led him to disagree with more expansive construction of some of the Warren Court decisions Thus he disaented from a 1965 decision which struck down a Connecticut anticontraceptive information statute because he did not see In the Constitution a guarantee of the right of privacy He has frequently upheld the right of states to regulate commerce and taxation within their borders and has been unwilling to strike down state statutes governing such local matters as divorce and family relations Justice Blacks retirement will leave a void on the Court He was an accomplished craftsman in his legal opinions and he commanded the respect of all wings of the Court an especially important quality at a time when the Burger Court seems beset with factionalism and divisiveness However despite President Nixons expressed intent of replacing him with yet another conservative strict constructionist it is not apparent that Justice Blacks retirement will mean a substantial swing of the Court to the right On certain issues on which Justice Black retained his forceful libertarianism his loss may be felt For example the Court will be deciding a number of cases involving the constitutionality of obscenity laws including forbidding the distribution of obscene materials in the mail and in interstate commerce and the sale to consenting adults He would probably have added a vote against these statutes The Court will also be hearing cases challenge loyalty oath re quirements for public employes in which Justice Blacks traditional antiloyalty oath position would have been important On a number of other cases before the Court Justice Blacks position might have favored the conservative wing The Court will be considering a number of criminal due process casesthe right of an indigent to courtappointed counsel in misdemeanor trials and appeals the right to a jury panel representing a crosssection of the community the right to a unanimous verdict and the constitutionality of abortion statutes bail practices and the death penalty In recent years Justice Black has become increasingly lawandorder minded in criminal cases and his vote would have been uncertain in any of these cases Justice Blacks retirement providing President Nixon his third court appointment seems likely to give the President the type of Court composition he has been wanting With neither of his pre vious appointees Justices Burger and Blackmun showing much inclination to stray into judicial activism and with Justices Stewart White and Harlan frequently to be counted in the conservative corner the Court had already begun to cut back on some positions of the Warren Court The new appointment should further consolidate the position the President favors It appears unlikely that the Senate will easily confirm as Justice Blacks successor just any Southern conservative without distinguished legal record and Representative Richard H Poff Virginia Republican who is being prominently mentioned seems to fall in that category Justice Black will not be easily replaced but it can be expected that the Senate will demand an appointment of high quality EDWARD F SHERMAN Mr Sherman is assistant pro fessor of law at Indiana University School of Law

Another Susan B. Anthony Now Speaks Her Mind,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/09/21/archives/another-susan-b-anthony-now-speaks-her-mind.html,Susan B Anthony was in town yesterday talking among other things about womens rights and her fear that liberated women were too easily accepting the values of the malecreated society No not that Susan B Anthony The sternfaced suffragette who was perhaps the foremost of Americas womens rights crusaders would be 151 years old if she were still alive today It was her namesake and grandniece who sat curled up in a chair in the Dorset Hotel A 55yearold tan and slender transplanted Floridian with a controversial life of her own alcoholism blacklisting threatened deportation dramatic conversion to Roman Catholicism she has written a book called The Ghost in My Life Chosen Books 595 and you can guess who the ghost is Born a Quaker I dont think Aunt Susan would have approved of todays womens lib leaders she said in her throatybutrefined Yankee voice She was a Quaker born and bred a highly moral virgin and she lived like an absolute nun She would have deplored the sexual freedom aspects of todays movement The living Miss Anthony who retains her famous maiden name even though she is thricedivorced no children said that although she was battling for womens rights way back in the forties she didnt agree with everything todays feminists advocate Oh Im greatly for things like daycare centers and equal pay for equal work she said We wanted those things 28 years ago But I feel that practically everything were suffering in our country and the world today is a result of our malecreated society where things come before people wars before peace and exploitation before conservation And my big fear she went on is that from what I have seen and read some of these feminist leaders are buying these values of the malecreated society They are wanting in on this society without changing it I mean I dont want to be drafted and I dont want my niece to become an organization man and I dont want any woman that I know to become an unthinking cog in the wheel of the corporate state What she regards as the first sign of hope she said was the womens political caucus held last July in Washington She didnt attend but read the news accounts and said I saw for the first time that they were starting to move in the dilection of human rightsthe people first The person just has to come before power profits or property Her Own Solution Her porcelain blue eyes shining under her short blondishgray hair Miss Anthony said she believed that the new womens movement had ignored the inner woman while concentrating on the progress that the outer woman had made in jobs education pay and status Miss Anthonys personal solution for the interior regression of women was her sudden conversion from skepticism to Christ in a small room of a San Diego YWCA in 1960 Later she became a Roman Catholic and in 1965 received a PhD degree in theology from St Marys College of South Bend Ind But whether a woman be lieves in an orthodox God or not she said fingering the modernistic cross around her neck she still has an inner self that needs cleansing and nourishing to help her and her children become immune from things like liquor and drugs For many women meditation is the answer For Birth Control As a Roman Catholic she strongly disagrees with the womens movements stand on legalized abortion I feel that something like that is devastating to a woman psychologically but she does believe in birth control My ideas on that were all formed before I became a Roman she said I think a woman has the right to decide when and if she wants children This I will stick my neck out on Miss Anthony was born in Easton Pa where her late Quaker father wrote unsuccessful plays and dreamed about acting on Broadway She was graduated magna cum laude from the University of Rochester which her great aunt had opened to women in 1900 and then began a career of liberal causecollecting that ranged from support of the Spanish Civil War to womens rights to civil rights to fighting what she called the thought control of the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities She also worked as a journalist for several newspapers including The Washington Star was fired as hostess of a controversial New York radio show for women and in 1943 published one of the first modern womens libera tion books Out of the KitchenInto the War In 1954 while she was living on an allspice plantation in Jamaica with her third husband Miss Anthony took an oath of allegiance to the British Crown rather than return to the United States to testify at a McCarthy hearing about her earlier involvement in liberal causes and her former marriage to a known Communist They just wanted my name to generate publicity she said angrliy Frankly I was afraid to go back because I had been sober for eight years and I thought testifying might make me become an alcoholic again [She now has been sober for 25 years] Citizenship Troubles As a result of her refusal Miss Anthony fought from 1961 to 1969 a deportation order that hung over her head along with a loss of United States citizenship when she returned to this country after leaving her husband The Board of Immigration ruled in her favor in 1969 Today Miss Anthony lives a quiet life in a rented bungalow in Deerfield Park Fla concentrating her energies on The Prayer Community a group of 18 adult women who meet regularly to study the Scriptures and pray And that famous ghost in her life She smiled I spent so many years of my life resenting her and wanting to live up to her she said But now Im very proud of her I think she was a treat old gal

"The Last Word: Policy I, for Freshmen",https://www.nytimes.com/1971/09/26/archives/the-last-word-policy-i-for-freshmen.html,Pedagogy said Lionel Trilling is a depressing subject to all persons of sensibility Mr Trilling said so some years ago long before the appearance of hundreds of education books exhorting the pedagogue to save our souls and solve our social problems How Mama Sincere Reached the Recalcitrants Happiness Is a Warm Professor Absolute Truth for Break fast  the polonaise the clair de lune and the ritual fire dance of the radical reformers Even Mr Trilling didnt know how depressing the subject could become Depressing because schools andor universities are no more capable of saving a soul than the Army the Rotary Club the Rolling Stones or The New York Times Book Review Depressing too because the university ought ideally to be a place where people who know something teach what they know to people who dont know it in an agreeable fashion It should not be a place where the teacher contracts out to the messianisms either of the Defense Department or the Student Society for an Unobstructed Id Alas the times are perceived to be hard and in hard times knowledge for knowledges sake looks like selfindulgence The pedagogue isnt going to be permitted to do his own thing According to the new dispensation he has to do that thing which is most ardently desired by the most ardent of his students If he lusts for their approval and he does shamelessly he must be relevant Being relevant means solving problems in stead of describing them The pedagogue a good liberal knows that problems are complicated but how is he to dramatize the complications to Mama Sincere and the Absolutely Truthful without whoring after that exemption from culpability which all good liberals ultimately desire Oddly enough a partial answer is suggested not by the radical reformers but in two recent books by respectively a doctor of philosophy and a professor of social administration Daniel Calla han former executive editor of Commonweal and director of the Institute of Society Ethics and the Life Sciences is the doctor of philosophy Richard Titmuss chief adviser to the British Labor party on welfare policy is the professor of social administration They have both written books about problems which are in fact superb essays on the formation of policy Daniel Callahan began his book Abortion Law Choice and Morality Macmillan opposed to abortion He ends itafter a staggering amount of research and long chapters on the medical and psychological reasons for and hazards of abortion the fetal situation the various legal codes statistical experience and ethi cal perceptions of Eastern Europe Latin America Scandinavia Africa and Japan what philosophers biologists Roman Catholics and liberated women have to say on the subjectbelieving that the State has no right to refuse an abortion to a woman who wants one He proposes permissive legislation to this effect But he isnt happy He still hopes for a better method of birth control which does not require that we make a choice between the life of a conceptus and those other human values we count important Because whats legal may not necessarily be whats moral Legality is a shifting process of accommodations between individual rights and social needs If legal abortions do not threaten this society and he demonstrates that they do not then the individual right of a woman to control her own body and plan her own family takes precedence over such abstractions as the sanctity of life The abstractions however are important a form of counsel Policy is arrived at by weighing the argu ments balancing the interests consulting ones scruples decid ing and still not feeling happy The sanctity of life is one of the few useful moral weapons we possess to oppose what might be called an economizing of human behavior the kind of reductionism represented by say TiGrace Atkinson when she argues that a womans reproductive function and the fetus constitute her property and she can destroy the fetus as she might destroy a painting Richard Titmuss in The Gift Relationship Pantheon also opposes the economizing of human behavior His problem is blood donations His worry is the commercialization of the gift relationship the gift to a stranger of life His investigation like Callahans is exhaustivethe bloodcollecting systems of every country in the world with available statistics are examined His conclusions are shocking The paid donor system results in an appalling waste of 1530 per cent of blood collected It creates a blood proletariat consisting mostly of the poor the unskilled the unemployed It encourages a donors lying about his health to get his money It represses the expression of altruism erodes the sense of community lowers scientific standards  [and] places immense social costs on those least able to bear them the poor the sick and the inept Titmuss establishes the economic insanity of commercial blood collecting systems but his primary concern is moralor ideolo gical an adjective that goes down easier in the secular state His target as Alvin Gouldner noted in his review of The Gift Relationship in these pages last March is the bent commit ment of our type of industrial society to treat human labor as akin to other market commodities If we can and do buy and sell a mans lifetime and energies if we have consented to treat much of existence as a commodity we must not be surprised if men do not boggle at trafficking in blood The commercialization of blood tokens the extent to which the most sacred presuppositions of our culture have been penetrated and distorted by the norms of venality The most sacred presuppositions  the sanctity of life  what have these formless abstractions to do with the poor peda gogue and his anxiety to berelevant Well both Callahan and Titmuss have examined a problem in terms of the policies we have developed or might have developed to deal with it and the consequences of those policies Both have listened to the tes timonies of science medicine law sociology philosophy statisti cal analysis religion and radical ideology Both make us painfully aware of scruples and ramifications deceit and muddleheaded ness problems of forming a policy which are anterior to the problem that wants solving I cant think why a college course couldnt be constructed around either book or either problem Or another similar Invite delegates from the various academic dis ciplines to state their case defend their methodology prove

Plastic Surgery:,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/09/27/archives/its-no-longer-reserved-for-the-vain-and-rich.html,When I first began my practice cosmetic surgery was almost on the same level as performing abortions in a garage on Sunday said Dr Dorothea Weybright a West Palm Beach plastic surgeon who opened her office 11 years ago In the last decade cosmetic plastic surgerythat is surgery performed for esthetic rather than medical reasons has gone from being regarded as a surgical frill reserved for vain rich butterflies and aging movie stars to an accepted medical procedure for grow ing numbers of Americans of all eco nomic strata In 1949 15000 people a year under went cosmetic surgical revamping in the United States By 1969 the figure had swelled to nearly 500000 Persons who seek plastic surgery come from all walks of life said Dr Burton H Neft a Pittsburgh plastic surgeon There are teenagers house wives laborers and steelworkers A lot of workingmen have feelings about their looks Ive done quite a few nasal plas tic surgery operations for steelworkers While the traditional face lift and nose operation form the bulk of a cos metic surgeons work load an increas ing number of people are having other parts of their bodies altered as well These proceduressometimes called body sculptureinclude thigh trim ming breast augmentation and reduc tion stomach tightening and recontour ing of the buttocks Unusual Operations Who chooses to have these unusual operations A 15yearold boy with gynecomas tiathe breast swelling that makes a males chest look embarrassingly femi ninewho before the operation re fused to participate in gym a young mother with riding breechesthe ex cessive accumulation of fat at the top of the thighs which looks especially unattractive in a bathing suit a middle aged executive with a flaccid stomach who is about to marry a young girl Many surgeons and laymen frown on the idea of healthy people submitting themselves to the dangers of an opera tion for reasons of vanity Also with the shortage of doctors in other specialities they say plastic surgery should be limited to patients ravaged by car accidents or deformed at birth by such abnormalities as cleft palates and extra limbs And others see the desire to im prove on nature as an indication of a sick society in which the Playboy image of nubile youth has triumphed a society in which few people can be accepted as they are Cosmetic plastic surgeons all of the nations 1200 boardcertified plastic surgeons do some cosmetic work but 200 do little else counter these argu ments by saying that theirs is the kindest cut of all Rather than being an index of de pravity they say cosmetic operations amount to sophisticated civilization surgery that as one doctor put it goes beyond trying to bring a return to the normal Its improvement of the normal Its making normal better than normal Primitive Tribal Customs Actually their attitude isnt new An ancient art esthetic surgery goes back to primitive tribal customs of distorting the lips earlobes neck and feet in an effort to beautify the human form The operations used by surgeons to day however were given impetus by the two World Wars that established need for reconstructive surgery and from which evolved radical new tech niques The new emphasis on youth and nudity and the growing number of peo ple who are having cosmetic operations and talking about them Amy Vander bilt recently gave the readers of La dies Home Journal a cutbycut descrip tion of her face Ift are fosterng es thetic surgerys current popularity Cosmetic surgery isnt cheap While the costs vary in different sections of the country it is estimated that the price for a face lift varies from 1000 to 2000 An operation to enlarge the breasts costs 500 to 1000 the same price as one to remove loose flesh around the eyes These prices do not include the cost of staying in a hospital The average face lift patient is be tween 40 and 55 And though the num ber of men getting lifts has increased dramatically over the last few years women still outnumber them 20 to 1 Many people in this age group are job holders who are fearful of falling victims to the American youth cult and losing their employment because of ad vancing age Dr Paul Pickering a San Diego plas tic surgeon said When you see what a simple face lift can do for a depressed outofwork executive youve got to be impressed It changes not only his face but his whole outlook gives him new vitality and confidence There are several kinds of face lifts the basic lift which takes up the slack in the cheeks and upper jowls and the radical lift which cuts around the en tire hairline and then slits the back of the neck open The average face lift takes four hours and if all goes well the patient should be able to return to full social activity within three weeks The operation leaves scars but the surgeon tries to conceal them in the hairline Most surgeons agree that a face lift will last seven to 10 years Some skins react better than others to face lifting and for this reason many sur geons say they can tell in advance how a face lift is going to turn out Said Dr Herbert Carter of San Diego I have had cases where when I saw the patient six or eight months later I couldnt believe that I changed her looks at all In addition to the general and radical face lift there is the mini lift which involves the removal of skin in the tem poral region Many reputable surgeons frown on the mini lift saying that it produces miniresults that it only works for the rare individual who has only a sag ging of the cheeks and jowl area The eye job on the other hand is an operation approved by many sur geons Called a blepharoplasty the operation involves removing fat and ex cess skin from the upper and lower lids or both The surgery which usually involves a days stay in the hospital is a fairly  common procedure among models in their late 20s and members of the in ternational set who are either reluc tant or not yet ready for the big lift Princess Luciana Pignatelli the 35 yearold author of The Beautiful Peo ples Beauty Book admits to having silicone injections a nose job and the eye operation which she endorses as holding technique I prefer not to wait until something drastic has to be done she says There is no sense in trying to come out smooth as a baby when you go in looking like an old topographic map The most popular cosmetic operation is rhinoplasty commonly referred to as the nose job Surgeons can shorten lengthen tilt and straighten a nose For the humped nosethe most com monthe surgeon operates from the inside using a miniature saw and chisel to reduce the patients nose bone They just use a local anesthesia and its really frightening to hear the surgeon hammering away at your face said a pretty 29yearold Wash ington publicist who had her nose straightened last year I wanted a Greta Garbo pointed chiseled nose but all they did was trim down the one I had she said I guess they have to work with what youve got One of the most unusual nose opera tions occurred recently in Rome where an enraged husband bit off his wifes nose during a family argument The wife was rushed to the hospital and the surgeon grafted her nose back onto her face Esthetic surgery can be more than just skin deep Few people realize un less confronted with an accident that surgeons can change the architecture of their faces by reshaping their cheek bones and jaws Patrick OGrady author of The Youth Doctors writes that the late Marilyn Monroe was a 75aweek contract player getting nowhere fast when at a party she overheard herself referred to as a chinless wonder Miss Monroe had it corrected and her career sky rocketed Revolutionary New Techniques Revolutionary new techniques in breast surgery have taken place over the last two decades This factor com bined with the trend toward the no bra look has sent many womenthe majority aged 15 to 30scurrying to plastic surgeons Others come not for vanity but because they have masculine looking chests Prior to 1950 if a woman wanted to increase her bosom she had to relin quish a part of her buttocks Now all that has changed with the introduction of breast prothesis which are translucent silicone envelopes shaped like falsies and approximate the softness of real bosom Developed by Dr Thomas Cronin of Baylor University silicone implants la beled New Natural Feel Prothesis come in eight sizes ranging from mini to extrafull To insert the surgeon slits the skin at the base of each bosom slides the falsie through the incision and tucks it behind the mammary gland Inserts which are too big however sometimes lack the mobile quality of a natural bosom They can look like tennis balls said a New York nurse Doctors say that most women who have breast prothesis are content with the results The question most often asked sur geons about augmentation mamma plasty is Can it cause breast can cer So far the answer is no Dr Tibor de Cholnoky director of the Department of Plastic and Recon structive Surgery of Greenwich Hospi tal in Connecticut conducted a world wide survey of mammary augmentation operations involving 10941 cases re ported by 965 qualified plastic surgeons with up to 18 years followup Statistical Findings He reported finding no increase in cancer among patients who had breast implants A lighter and more lifelike type of insertion is the balloon implant The surgeon bores a hole at the base of each breast and then slides an empty sili cone balloon through the hole and places it behind the mammary gland Next he pumps the balloon with saline solu tion through the balloons valve Balloon implants are softer and have more mobility than the preshaped pro thesis Unfortunately they can also leak One of the least known plastic sur gery procedures is the technique to re duce the size of a womans breast Unlike augmentation breast reduction is performed more often for comfort than cosmetic appearance Overdevelopment of the breasts called macromastia is a condition that usually begins at puberty but it can also develop during pregnancy Much less common than face lifts or even bosom changes are operations on other parts of the body such as the thighs stomach or buttocks The thigh lift is particularly popular with men and women who have lost great deal of weight And one woman of about 50 who recently joined the growing California craze for bicycling wanted an operation on her generous buttocks but decided against it when her doctor told herwith her bulk he could never get her down to a rea sonable fit on a bicycle seat However reputable plastic surgeons are reluctant to perform the thigh lift and the buttocks lift because as Dr James Macdonald of New York put it They are poorly designed operations which leave scars deep enough so that they can sometimes interfere with func tion I dont know any plastic surgeons who like doing the operations said Dr Macdonald because the results are so poor While most plastic surgery utilizes the skin and bone of the patient silicone is sometimes used for a variety of opera tions ranging from reshaping polio legs to softening forehead wrinkles Liquid silicone injected in large amounts has a tendency to migrate in the body When the topless craze be came popular a few years ago surgeons started injecting massive doses of sili cone in womens bosomssometimes a pint in each breast These injections have caused large abscesses blindness and at least four deaths The problem has reached such proportions that last month the Amer ican Medical Association issued a full scale warning against injecting silicone in the bosom Because of the misuse of liquid sili cone by some doctors the Food and Drug Administration has approved its us by anly a handful of specialists in the United States on an experimental basis As a result of the Government restric tion a black market of industrial grade siliconethe type used for making auto mobile wax and furniture polishhas sprung up around the country Ive even seen cases where women who thought they were getting silicone have been injected with mineral oil looks the same said Dr Norman Oren treich a New York plastic surgeon Solid pieces of silicone are used for filling out sunken areas or even for missing appendages such as ears Surgeons have developed earshaped rubbery silicone pieces with smooth rounded edges approximating the con sistancy of cartilage Grafting skin onto silicone however is a very tricky opera tion Several complications can result from plastic surgery blood clots slough and necrosis a dying and sloughing off of the skin as well as nerve damage chronic edema swelling infection and scarring One member of the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery estimated that a quarter to a third of this work involved salvaging faces of patients who had been mangled by inept doctors Surgeons are reluctant to operate on patients who are emotionally unstable for fear of lawsuits and many screen their patients before operating on them You develop a sixth sense about who has unrealistic expectations said Dr Weybright A study by the Plastic Surgery De partment of Johns Hopkins University showed that there is a small group of insatiable plastic surgery patients who travel around the country seeking re peated operations Such patients are nearly all mentally disturbed unmarried males between the ages of 20 and 35 And there are other people who de cide after plastic surgery that they like their old selves better Some people are not ready to cope with looking better said Dr Frank L Gaunt a Hollywood plastic surgeon I know one lady who had to have a bad nose put back on after she had had a pretty nose made Psychologically she couldnt accept the change
Chase Urges Nationwide Adoption of New York Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/09/27/archives/chase-urges-nationwide-adoption-of-new-york-abortion-law.html,The citys Health Services Administrator urging yesterday that New York States liberal ized abortion law be adopted throughout the country dis closed figures indicating fewer illegitimate births and criminal abortions in the city since the law went into effect These were among the fa vorable social consequences of the states abortion law cited by Gordon Chase head of the citys Health Services Adminis tration in testimony that he is scheduled to give today before the Commission on Population Growth and the American Fu ture He also cited the safety rec ord on abortions performed in the city between July 1 1970 when the law became effective and Sept 1 1971 On the basis of the first 14 months experience Mr Chase said in an interview yesterday he was not hedging at all in his support for the adoption of similar abortion laws in other states and cities I think this is very very clearly a progressive piece of legislation he said and it seems to me terribly important I would like to see other states with this kind of legislation One reason for urging more uniform abortion laws he pointed out in his testimony was that the safety of abor tion would be greatly en hanced if women did not leave the state to return home the day of the abortion away from the source of their initial care The New York State law al lows abortion at the womans request within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy In the first 14 months since it went into effect an estimated 205 614 abortions were performed legally in the city 585 per cent of the women were from out side the state In his presentation to the commission appointed by Con gress to examine the countrys projected population growth and its impact on national life Mr Chase planned to stress emergence of several trends that he said were particularly gratifying from a public health standpoint These included an increase in the proportion of early abor tionsthose performed during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and a progressively declining maternalmortality rate In addition he said incom plete abortionsthose cases that hospitals see after an abor tion has begun elsewhere had declined from an average of 480 a month in the period from July 1 through Dec 31 1970 to 350 a month from January to July 1 1971 and to 243 per month during July and August This he called a possible indication that the abortion law is making inroads into the in cidence of criminal abortions The records of the 10 Municipal hospitals involved do not dif ferentiate between spontane ous abortions [miscarriages from natural causes] and in duced abortions But Mr Chase said it was likely that the number of spon taneous abortions would re main relatively constant [and that this decline is likely to be due to a dropoff in criminal abortions He noted later in his testimony however that seven women died of causes related to illegal abortion during the first year of the laws applica tion Evidently then there are still women who do not know about the law or who are unable to get themselves to legal care he said Stressing that it was too early to draw firm conclu sions Mr Chase said he be lieved it likely that the changed law will have a favorable ef fect on population issues such as outofwedlock births In a reversal of a fairly steady upward trend he said there may be a decline in such births which may become meaningful in the future During the first five months of 1970 he said there were 12538 illegitimate births in the city during the same five month period of 1971 the num ber of such births had dropped 63 per cent to 11755 Mr Chase said yesterday that this was a significant decline especially when its running against what history would have predicted But in the interview and in his testimony he also empha sized the necessity for really pushing very very hard on the familyplanning front where he said there was an urgent need for more work to be done He said it was discouraging for example that 603 women had more than one abortion during the first year of the laws application in New York City

"Birth Rate Declines Here, Reversing a 3‐Year Trend",https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/03/archives/birth-rate-declines-here-reversing-a-3year-trend-downturn-in-births.html,A downturn in the number of births and in the birth rate is being recorded by the citys Health Department this year reversing a trend of annual increases that began in 1968 A similar phenomenon though less sharply defined is being recorded nationally Though Health Department officials here warn that it is too early to call the downturn a new trend they say they are studying the figures carefully because the decline runs counter to their expectations National Birth Drop In addition the drop comes at a time when the birth potential of the citys populationthat is the number of women of childbearing ageis substantially higher than it was a decade ago Commenting on the figures Dr Jean Palter director of the departments Maternity Services Bureau said We expected another boom in births as children born in the postWorld War II baby boom reached the peak childbearing ages but it just isnt happening For the nation as a whole data compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics of the Department of Health Education and Welfare show that the number of births and the birth rate rose in 1969 and 1970 but began to decline this year Many planations Compar of the centers figures for the first six months of this year and the same months of 1970 show increases in the number cf births during February and March and declines in January April May and June By June the rate had dropped to 168 births for each 1000 of population dowm significantly from the rate or 183 the previcus June and lower than in any month in the previous two and a half years Though it is clear that fewer babie are being born this year both nationally and in the city it is not at all clear what the decline means and why it is happening Demographers health officials and sociologists offer a variety of explanations for the downturn in births Among the reasons they suggest are The decline in the economy which began last year and which may have forced young people to postpone marriage and familybuilding The growth of concern over the impact of an increasing population on the quality of the environment The availability and Increasing use of birthcontrol drugs and devices The migration from rural to metropolitan areas where the tendency isc toward smaller families The passage of liberalized laws in four states including New York that in effect permit abortion on demand The difficulty of assessing what the birth figures mean arises from the need to take into account several factors that are independent of one another Among them are the number of women in the childbearing ages of 15 through 44 a group demographers call the birth cohort the rate at which these women marry and the number of children they decide to have A study by the Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce published in April found the first two of these factors favorable to increased fertility The small birth cohorts of the Depression have already passed through the prime childbearing ages and are being replaced with the larger birth cohorts born following the Second World War the study said It also noted that the annual number of marriages has increased rapidly during the past few years After examining 1970 census data the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future established by Congress last year predicted in an interim report issued last March that by 1975 there would be 55 million more people in the prime childbearing ages of 20 to 29 than there were last year and that by 1985 the group would have increased by 55 million more Strong Pressure This will exert strong pressure toward increasing the number of births the commission said For the city the potential is especially strong Comparisons of the size and makeup of the population herein 1960 and in 1970 show that while the population as a whole grew only 11 per cent from 7781984 to 7867760 the number of women aged 20 to 34 increased 139 per cent from 803643 to 915229 And yet the apparent decision of thousands of women not to have children this year has caused that potential for a higher number of births not to be realized Figures compiled by Mrs Freida Nelson of the Health Department show there were 3972 fewer births in the JanuarytoJune period this year than there were for the same months in 1970 There were 60695 live births recorded for city residents for the first half of this year and the birth rate per 1000 of population was 170 For the same months in the three previous years the figures were  Dr Pakter said the decline in births this year was smallabout 6 per centand noted that further observation would be necessary to see if it continued She found it suggestive that the decline coincided with the introduction of liberalized abortion procedures in the state last year If the decline does continue it would put the city and the nation back on the generally downward course in births that had been apparent through most of the decade of the nineteensixties The decade began in 1960 with 4307000 births and a birth rate of 238 and continued this way  Some students of birth trends assert that the increases recorded in the last two years of the decade might have been an aberration and that the factors favoring continuing declines far outweigh those tending toward increase Professor Donald J Bogue a sociologist at the University of Chicago and director of its Community and Family Study Center confidently predicts that at least until 1990 and perhaps until the year 2001 what he calls the fertility recession will continue The reasons why birth rates are falling instead of remaining high are sociological and pertain to the changing value systems and life styles of the public he asserts and lists several reasons for the continuing decline he foresees The substantial number of pregnancies that are unplanned will be significantly reduced as contraception becomes more widely accepted and more effective The parts of the population with high fertility ratesblacks Spanishspeaking peoples and residents of rural areasare experiencing rapid declines in fertility while others principally white Protestants and Jews have already dropped their fertility rates to the replacement level The strong emphasis young people are putting on humanistic values leads them to plan their pregnancies more carefully than previous generations The womens liberation movement is expected to lead more women into the working force and working women bear fewer children The bearing and raising of children in a world where offspring reject their parents use drugs and engage in illegal acts makes parenthood less rewarding than it once was Summing up the effects of these forces in a paper he wrote for the 1971 annual meeting of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Professor Bogue said he finds it impossible to foresee a chain of developments other than the slow but steady decline of birth rates

Justices Face New Issues Tomorrow As Term Opens,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/03/archives/justices-face-new-issues-tomorrow-as-term-opens-justices-to-face.html,WASHINGTON Oct 2With two empty seats as a reminder of the changes that are overtaking the Supreme Court the Justices will meet Monday to begin a new Court term that will raise a wide range of new constitutional issues Even as President Nixon ponders the selection of strict constructionist nominees to carry out his campaign pledge to change the liberal doctrines of the Warren Court the Burger Court will begin to grapple with a docket laden with new issues that the Warren Court did not consider The Justices will meet briefly at 10 AM Chief Justice Warren E Burger will deliver brief tributes to the late Justice Hugo L Black and Justice John M Harlan who retired Then the Justices will leave the bench for a week of secret conferences on the business of the upcoming term Private Law on Docket For the first time in almost a decade the Courts docket is not dominated by the criminal law issues that led the Warren Court to expand the safeguards of defendants It was primarily those rulings that prompted Mr Nixons pledge to appoint strict constructionists and he has tended to select nominees with strong lawandorder leaningssome of whom have taken liberal positions on other issues during their careers There are still some important criminal questions to be settledcapital punishment is the most obviousbut the variety of new issues to be confronted this term indicates that a Nixon Court handpicked to take a lawandorder approach to crime may make its mark in unpredictable ways on other areas of the law The crucial feature of many of these new issues is that they concern efforts to reform the private lawthe rules that regulate dealings between private partiesrather than the types of rulings that the Warren Court used to changethe regulating relationships between individuals and the state In a series of six appeals the Court will consider allegations that the civil law has been perverted by landlords lending institutions and credit  sales stores to cheat the poorand frequently the middle class as well Repossession of Goods First the Court will consider the constitutionality of repossession practices that permit installmentsales stores to take back goods after a default in payment without giving the purchaser a chance to explain in court why he failed or refused to pay Also under challenge is the use by creditors of the ancient writ of replevin which can be obtained without notice to the debtor and which permits the police to break down doors if necessary to repossess articles These practices are said to violate the process and the Fourth Amendments prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures Second is the contention that the eviction procedures in about half of the states are stacked in favor of landlords These laws authorize evictions whenever tenants have missed rent payments and do not permit tenants to explain at eviction hearings why they failed to pay even if housing violations by the landlord were the cause Third is a challenge to the constitutionality of a widely used device known as a cognovit or confession of judgment promissory note When the debtor signs such a note he agrees that if he defaults on payments the holder can go to court and get a judgment without notice to the debtor This is said to violate due process of law on the ground that the purchaser of an article on installments cannot anticipate what flaws might later give him reason to withhold payments Fourth is a contention that Federal civil laws are violated by state laws that allow creditors to garnishee individuals wages without notice or any opportunity to challenge the debt in court Another issue that has not come before the Supreme Court in recent years is the matter of sexual equality One case challenges laws that prefer men to women for such duties as administering deceased persons estates Another disputes the widespread laws that deny unwed fathers equal rights with unwed mothers to the custody of their illegitimate children Abortion an issue that was skirted by the Supreme Court last year is back again with appeals from Texas and Georgia where the antiabortion laws were declared unconstitutional The Court will be asked to decide if the wording of these typical abortion laws is unconstitutionally vague and if all antiabortion laws violate womens right of privacy in controlling their own bodies The Court will also decide if states can constitutionally outlaw the distribution of birth control material to unmarried women A lower court struck down a law of this type that Massachusetts had passed to regulate crimes against chastity morality decency and good order and the Supreme Court will decide if states can enforce such laws Pressures for environmental preservation are reflected in two types of issues before the Court In one the Sierra Club contends that it has legal standing to bring suit to block construction of a 35million Walt Disney recreational center in Californias Sequoia National Forest If the Court agrees conservationists can intervene in Court whenever development threatens the environment The other environmental issue is the extent to which the Court will become involved in pollution control through its original jurisdiction to hear suits brought directly by states without lower court hearings Fifteen states have brought an original suit accusing the major automobile manufacturers of conspiring to delay the development of antismog devices on cars and Illinois and Vermont have sued to stop people in other states from polluting their waterways Campus Speech Issues The departure of Justice Black a free speechfree press zealot could adversely affect the prospects of students and teachers who are trying to secure First Amendment rights on the campus Students at the University of Texas are protesting the banning of an underground newspaper The Rag Faculty groups at staterun colleges are asking protection against dismissal for criticizing college policies In the only major civil rights case on the docket the Justices will decide if a lower court was right to strip the liquor license from the Moose lodge of Harrisburg Pa because it refused to serve a Negro Last year the first full term with two Nixon nominees on the Court there was a decided shift toward a lawandorder approach to criminal procedure This year with two more Nixon appointees joining Chief Justice Burger and Justice Harry A Blackmun that shift is expected to become more pronounced In the four capital punishment cases to be heard the Justices will finally settle an issue that the the Court has avoided for years  whether executions are unconstitutional under the tion against cruel and unusual punishment This is a question that a Nixon Court would not be expected to decide in favor of the condemned prisoners but the pressure upon the Justices will be intense because there are already 653 persons on Death Rows awaiting the outcome and opponents of capital punishment are warning that blood bath wil follow a decision against the prisoners Other criminal issues to be decided are whether suspects may be identified outside of a police lineup whether convictions can be issued on lessthanunanimous jury verdicts whether defendants in misdemeanor cases are entitled to free transcripts and lawyers and whether the Federal Governments laws against importing and mailing obscene material for private use are constitutional Nixon Policies at Issue In one final category of cases the growing impact of Nixon appointees could be decisive and if so could engender a backlash of resentment against the Nixon Court These are situations in which specific policies of the Nixon Administration will be coming before the Court The sensitivity of the cases has been increased because in each case the policy at issue is closely associated with the allegations that the Nixon Administration has been repressive in its lawandorder efforts The most sensitive is the contention by the Nixon Administration which no previous administration ever publicly asserted that it has the authority to use wiretapping without court approval against radicals who are considered subversive by the Attorney General Before Justices Black and Harlan left the Court even lawyers in the Justice Department were saying privately that this proposition faced uphill going in the Supreme Court But now the outcome is uncertain and if the new Nixon nominees tip the balance in favor of the Attorney Generals wiretap policy the Court could be plunged into a crossfire of political controversy

After the Fall,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/03/archives/after-the-fall-what-this-country-needs-is-a-good-country.html,THE counterculture is dying Left behind are a thousand hopeful articles about the New Consciousness a thousand photographs of halfnaked acidrich bodies jumbled together in some urban pad in mockery of the straights Countless people still live their own versions of the old HaightAshbury dream but there it ends Eaten away from within by its Establishment heritage the movement has lost its energy is left with nowhere to go The drugs were most obvious and the musk the dress the hair But at its best the movement came together first around a sense of community Appalled by the isolation and barren privatism of their parents the young banded together in political collectives urban crash pads rural communes And they shared money dope beds ideas It seemed a revolution and a lot of us set out to take part in it But it was a revolution manqu and we are left now with the long struggle to find what lies beyond  WE came to community Elena and I at the end of a long train of thought Together we had done a tour of duty in the real world I as Foreign Service officer and economic consultant Elena as language teacher and interpreter both of us as graduate students and then college teachers We were good at what we did and at first we liked it But it was the sixties for us as for everyone else We were in Ethiopia at the birth of a deep and continuing antiAmericanism fed by uncritical American support for the corrupt and repressive imperial regime We were in Nigeria for 11 months of the civil war We were teaching at a black college in Pennsylvania the year Martin Luther King was murdered We were in Cambridge for the first Harvard riot It was our very own prerevolution ary era with the special twist that much of it was played out for us against an African backdrop Some things seemed much clearer that way The empty pretentiousness of our own technologybound economic system for example was thrown into the most embarrassing relief In Africa stinking factories and tasteless highrises in the Western mold came across most strikingly as defilements of the ageless villages across whose life they were beginning to sprawl It was possible to grow very angry at those who would commit such violence for their own profit In contrast to such barbarism were the extraordinary ways of traditional Africa They could be seductive those old ways for many the worst culture shock from overseas living involved coming home again The means of my own seduction was a young Ethiopian couple who lived in a small village 20 miles from Addis Ababa As I got to know them watched them struggle to survive on a monthly income of 40 or so came to realize that they were at least as humanly fulfilled as and certainly more serene than other friends making 4000 a month in American suburbs The damage to the great American assumption Money Equals Happiness was nearly total A straightforwardness unobstructed by the Western penchant for abstraction characterized all of their relationships They could be so direct in fact that they would become almost nonverbal communicating by a kind of telepathy And the same sense of involvement extended outward to their families their extended families their tribal environments In other dimensions it went even beyond that an almost mystical sense of spiritual fullness seemed to entwine them with generations dead and yet unborn It all seemed wondrously human caring spontaneous clearly opposed to the world in which Elena and I spent most of our time There the choreographies were always designed to preserve peoples apartness interoffice memos private property cocktail parties the nuclear family For our Ethiopian friends the equivalent patterns were all constructed to build community We had to escape to find this other more human sort of consciousness which seemed to be embodied in collective Forgive us our flights of fancy it was by no means that simple But there was something special going on around us something that a lot of people were finding then in Africa in the cultures of the American Indians or simply buried deep within themselves And community seemed to be at the heart of it We then were left to figure out what the conununities we were going to build would look like what they would do for us For Elena and me it had a lot to do with overcoming the DavidandElena games our own versions of the usual barriers to healthy manwoman relationships We kept getting tangled up in these both of us losing perspective setting up defenses and indulging reflexes neither of us could see In a community of people interested in human liberation we could break out of these patterns gaining new perspectives on them as we shared insights with others into the games all heir to If the first result of this process would be a deepening of our cram relationship the next step would be an extension of this closeness to others in the community and beyond As the community began to feel its own identity it in turn would reach with new force into relationships with other communities It all would build toward an experiencing of the organic unity of things This would come back always to the particular people involved to their sense of greater human completeness But it supposed that individual completeness would not be achieved in isolation Rather individuals would realize their full capacities only as they saw the points of interpenetration between their own uniqueness and that of These forces would work themselves out most fully through common work and shared experience across the full range of human activities So it had been at least for us We had been most whole individually and together during those periods when we were involved in things jointly teaching at the same college working together on a study of West African marketing systems We had been least able to relate fully to ourselves to each other or to anyone else when we were doing wholly distinct things seeing each other in the corners of time left over from work If there were to be a revolution it would express itself in revised life patterns that integrated peoples lives instead of fragmenting them And the basic social expression of this community  WE came to rest at The Community and we came to The Community through Marthas House All was normal the afternoon we arrived The Houses five inhabitants were all there and the pace of things was just shy of hysteria Martha was cleaning up the debris left by a group that had been there earlier in the day to talk about radical economics John was cooking dinner with help from Cathy George was bringing in firewood Linda was on her way out to collect a woman referred to the House for a nights lodging by the local abortion counseling center Through the evening other members of The Community dropped in and out exchanging tales of that day in The Communitys life or partaking of the running discussion on Womens Liberation that lasted into the early hours of the next morning For Elena and me fresh grom a tooprivate California life style and temporary jobs as waitress and schoolbus driver it all seemed an exciting change of pace It had been long in happening For 18 months we had been transient the world of consulting and teaching abandoned in a search for some elusive next step We lived with various people community never quite growing out of what we found to share But we kept looking talking with community builders in Europe Canada New England Maryland and Virginia the Midwest California And we read the magazines the movement has spun off The Modern Utopian Alternate Society Mother Earth News Vocations for Social Change The Green Revolution The disparity between what we knew and what we practiced became more and more awkward When we found The Community we felt we were finally The Community was an urban group founded in the Pacific Northwest by exilesstudents and facultyfrom a local college When we arrived it had more than 50 members most of whom lived in a dozen houses like Marthas clumped together on the edges of the citys black ghetto The Communitys academic background surfaced in highly informal learning groups reflecting the interests of various members radical economics Old English dance science fiction woodworking But most activities were less formal still with people spending much of their time talking about ways to extricate themselves further from the straight environment For some this meant leaving the city and The Community was negotiating for 80 acres of land half an hours drive outside of town It was financially wellable to do this in its early living  learning experiment it had arranged a sizable foundation grant This money supplemented by voluntary contributions from members also made it possible for food and shelter to be provided everyone from Community funds IT was a dream come true for a while Then during a marathon Womens Lib debate at Marthas Elena and I began to find ourselves under siege What we were doing with each other it turned out was coupling images of dogs or railroad cars and those were exactly the overtones Coupling was a longterm relationship between two people and it led to stagnation parochialism sexism even worse In vain did we try to talk of working out those things in the context of a relationship maybe even a marriage Knowing smiles informed us of our naivet For the women of the house it was clear that to avoid the chauvinism required avoiding the males better to be asexual emotionally detached And the men grooving on their guilt fell willingly into line No relationships for them either at least until they had purged themselves of their chauvinist It wasnt all quite that selfflagellating For Martha on the mend from a shortlived highly traditional marriage to keep these distances was part of a totally serious effort to work out her own sense of self Ultimately she would be able to reenter with greater strength the social life of a world she justly saw as being male chauvinist to the gills But the party line within The Community toward human attachments tended to be much more crude  and very cold When one of the women in another house had an abortion she and her partner in conception were joking about it the next day Their attitude was consistent with the orthodoxy for the liberated woman abortions were nothing more momentous than cutting off a hangnail In the same way to stop sleeping with someone was no more serious than slipping off a jacket It was a shock where Elena and I had come to community to deepen our own relationship extend it to others we found the entire idea of serious relation The same was true of human intimacy in any form Community members were constantly on the go down to San Francisco back East moving in and out of The Community or from house to house within it This mobility was guarded above all else Martha for example held that her house would be a success if people living there could leave altogether without anyone feeling any special sense of emotional strain The points of human reference became diluted through both space and large numbers of people by all this motion At one paint I asked Linda how many people she could turn to if her head began to come unglued how many people would understand what was happening to her Dozens she said scattered all over the world and I could not explain the difference between an understanding among dozens and one evolved over time with a single person or two or three Much less could I explain why I valued that more intimate sort of understanding It was an awkward attempt at intercultural communication and TO guard against intimacy demands constant attention Gradually we began to see a brittleness in the ways Community members dealt with one another in the set of their faces in what they said Compassion was held to be condescending Favored instead as a basis for interpersonal style was a sort of brutal honesty that forced distances between people stressed their apartness Ideological confrontation was valued Thats a male chauvinist thing to say How can you have such a reactionary attitude People broke off conversations to analyze each others neuroses Youre just projecting when you say that Why do you have so much self  hatred Someone wrote in The Communitys weekly newsletter that I hope you [his fellow Community members] curl up and die Others laughed pleased at the directness of it It had to do again with preserving mobility Compassion would have led to involvement involvement to commitment and Commitment to chains on tomorrow The coupling phobia spilled work With relationship not an objective the idea of rela tionship around work became irrelevant Instead people sought activities that expressed their own special apartness Crafts were in favor since they were personal things done alone And writers artists and other solitaries were overrepresented As for the work that paid the bills the same centrifugal forces applied One person for example was economic consultant to a major health plan someone else worked the graveyard shift as janitor at a local hotel a third spent odd hours at a skidrow pawnshop Most people didnt work at all preferring to live off the foundation money or checks from home There was no sense that any of this inhibited The Communitys development in any way It began to seem instead that community was not really a Community objective was rather to be resisted as if it were simply a multiperson version of couplingas indeed It led people inward to an indifference to the experiences of others At one point I found an excellent postmortem of a failed commune the problems described hauntingly familiar in the Community context Several people refused to read it It was someone elses trip in some other placewhat could it possibly have to say to them Such an approach devalued the more extensive life experiences of The Communitys adults to the point where they became almost ashamed to take positions on things It seemed an unwritten law that they were never never to appear to know more about anything than the rawest escapee from some middleclass suburban home On the other hand they were allowed to do the tedious administrative work that those younger didnt care to do The allowable role seemed to be that of the Token Adult the ultimately permissive usefultohavearound parent viewed with the sort of tolerant affection that shaded off into We came to realize that everyone was in flight that The Community was bound together largely by its negativism Traumatized by courses assigned readings tests Community members would have learning groups where nobody had to read anything or even come Offended by the authoritarianism of their parents and teachers members would create an en We came to The Community to build a new culture but what we found was as alienating as the old vironment where age and experience were disqualifications for being taken seriously Antagonized beyond reason by the social pressures of the straight world members would see to it that nobody was required to do anything for the group Appalled by the empty possessiveness of their parents marriages members would ensure that nobody had any claims on anyone else They were right to flee what they were fleeing but in simply trying to turn it upside down they largely were functions of it still It all took its toll Signs At any given moment half The Community was sick an illness level we had seen before only among the people we knew in Nigeria during the worst of the civil war Or animals being a sensitive index of environmental vibrations take the Community dogs a sobering assortment of freakedout creatures howling and whining and snapping for attention The cats having a greater instinct for selfpreservation simply ran away Or worse still the Community children brittle supercharged alienated One spoke of himself as the computer The computer is ready to answer your question now They were peripheral to the point where one 5yearold called his own meeting to complain that The Community offered nothing in which he could participate Where children and dogs are out of WE left The Community the same way we entered itthrough Marthas House One day Elena and I went to the state prison to talk with a group of black inmates about Ethiopian culture The people we saw were open and eager to communicate reaching out to establish points of contact with us We went back to Marthas People were lying around on the floor as if paralyzed talking with their customary detachment about Womens Liberation It was shattering here were the imprisoned What we had originally thought of as The Communitys ever  provocative dialogue was instead we were finally realizing an elaborate mechanism of selfdefense Alone behind their walls of words people preserved distances between each other by ceaselessly talking It had become compulsive Theres too damned much verbiage around this place someone once said to John You and I had better have a long talk It was too much to bear We had come to The Community for intimacy and none was wanted We had come for communal work and none was wanted We had come to build a new culture and what we found was as alienating as the old At a meeting the next day someone said something about separation The Community 3  year  old who happened to be passing through was brought up short He thought about it for a long minute and then to nobody in particular he said Being separated is talking He was being childish and living around The Community he would outgrow it pretty fast But for Elena and me the signs were all too dear We could have stayed and talked with John about it I suppose but we packed and left    IF some things about The Community were unusual its affluence age range size it was in other ways typical of the movement as a whole white middleclass welleducated But those are just the demographic measures In its inner life The Community was strikingly representative of tendencies within the counterculture Living in The Community had catalyzed for us a sense of the counterculture that we had not really wanted to see A warning All generalizations are partially unfair to a movement containing within itself practically every conceivable variant of human living arrangement What is true of communes in New York is only partly true of communes in Colorado and the range within any given area is equally great Still there are patterns which cross many of these lines which apply to the great majority of people with in the counterculture and which therefore give the movement its tone The most destructive of these are a surprising number of basic attitudes borrowed from the straight world In large measure the counterculture has readied its current impasse through the extent to which its members are their parents children The straight world for example has come to place a premium on physical and psychological transience People are expected to move easily from place to place job to job product to product person to person fad to fad It is the natural consequence of a growth economy run rampant As workers or professionals people respond through movement to the shifting requirements of their work losing jobs finding others carrying out some shortterm assignment here transferring to a higher rung on some other corporate ladder there As consumers the same people are encouraged to change brands discard allbutnew possessions in favor of others support todays cause and forget yesterdays The only constant is inconstancy a state of mind that Elena and I were escaping in coming to Or so we thought We found instead that the counterculture has taken transience to the extreme It is reflected in the language People are into this or that And what you get into as opposed to what you take into yourself you can also get out ofand preferably do Someone once stuck into The Communitys weekly newsletter a line from a Janis Joplin song Freedoms just another word for nothing left to lose Their understanding of this was more clear than complete Youre free if you have nothing to lose if nothing or nobody has you It is curious In Alvin raffias phrase the counterculture is full of true Men of the Future mobile eager for the new The central message of the larger world has been absorbed dont get involved youll be somewhere else tomorrow IF discontinuity of lives over time exists in both cultures so does discontinuity at any moment in time We had become unhappy with blocking out chunks of time for clearly defined purposes My work Elenas work sochd life time together all had become separate activities within boxes handed to us by the straight world The counterculture proved little different People work in one place have a political collective in another live at a third go to womens consciousness groups somewhere else Sometimes it all comes together but not often It is as if an entire generation had been molded solely by television a sevenminute attention span an eternal restless changing of channels SUL it is a difference more in degree than in kind from the lives of their The two worlds share also a surfeit of abstractions In both everlarger parts of life consist of mental images of things taking place out of sight The adults have The War Communism the Gross National Product Problems of the Inner City the young have The War Cuba Our Black Brothers The Revolution Such mental geometries are better able to process facts and theories than to deal with the elusive realities of direct experience and in response people depersonalize even their human contacts We were part of a university audi ence in California which Jane Goodall addressed about her investigations among the chimpanzees in Tanzania For an hour she was questioned about aggresaion mating rituals leadership patterns methodology Nobody asked her anything about what it was like to live for months at a time in a community of chimps what it was like to go back to London afterward People in The Community asked Elena about the liberation movement in Ethiopia where she was raised Nobody wanted to know what it was like to grow up there Barraged incessantly by information most of it secondhand people naturally come to deal with the data glut and with each other in formulas What is surprising is the degree to which the counterculture has Made its The triumph of these tendencies owes a great deal to selfindulgence In the larger culture people feed TV dinners to their children push buttons on their cars instead of shifting gears or even walking pop pills to induce euphoria In the counterculture the search for the effortless takes the form of pills too but its more basic expression comes in the insistence on doing your own thing One thing this means is not doing anything you dont want to do which means in turn not doing anything that is too much work Someone at The Community told me shed given up yoga because it was nonorganic that is it involved motions that were not natural to the body Similarly the process of building personal relationships over time calls for stretching oneself in uncomfortable directions and most people are unwilling to make the effort In rejecting to distorting disciplines found in their schools and families those in the counterculture have by and large rejected as well the idea that some disciplines can be thing has become a counsel of flabbiness one which owes much to the value America as a whole places on the easy Finally the counterculture has accepted in its most atomistic form the American view that fulfillment lies in serving ones narrow selfinterest During our early years of driving for national economic expansion this was justified in material terms If everyone pursued his own profit the group as a whole would prosper Now liberated by enormous national wealth from such mundane preoccupations we hasten to convert the old rationalizations for material greed into new ones for psychological selfseeking In line with this the straights have produced such doctrines as that of selfactualization while each member of the counterculture asserts his right to his own special trip According to these new versions of rugged individualism everyone will be better off if each person seeks psychological completeness within himself taking from his surroundingsor from otherswhatever he needs to achieve this There is little sense here of any obligation to the outside world Even less is there any drive to know the great wholenesses of which we are a part starting from the wholeness of intimate personal relationship and moving outward from there Instead of developing a sense of the organic each person is to become ever the more complete The counterculture may see more sharing of worldly treasures but it joins the straight world in giving to others little of its inner selfand in then trying to make a cosmic principle of being apart Ironically it does this in communities which its members enter to avoid both aloneness and involvement By dispersing the claims on emotion through large group of people an even sense of good fellowship can prevail with minimal personal commitment The group can be left reentered abandoned with no particular sense of strain Community has become the television of the counterculture serving the same need that Americans of fewer radical pretensions fill by keeping the tube running even when theyre not watching just to have someone around the house If the counterculture has rejected grades authority the nuclear family it has thus carried over from the straight world psychological transience the fragmentation of lives immersion in abstractions selfindulgence and an atomistic version of individual growth And it would face the greatest difficulty in trying to move beyond these First because a system has been constructed where the least prevails No communal sharing of selves and work can rise far above the aspirations of the least willing to give and the movement has been diluted by thousands of hustlers and mediastruck newcomers with more interest in ripping off the counterculture than in salvaging its abortive moves to community Second the countercultures mobility keeps any group from remaining together long enough to build the attitudes and learn the skills necessary for a true alternative People will continue to move into the countercultare savor its partial freedoms and move out again but the movement already shows signs of fatigue And as an agent for radical transformation of peoples lives the counterculture is dead  WHAT this country needs is a good counter counterculture culture The danger instead is of a reaction that would obliterate much of what the counterculture has done without moving beyond If nothing else the energies of the young could dissipate through a movement that cannot provide answers leaving only a sense of hopelessness and apathy We would be back where we were a decade ago It would be a shame for even in failing those in the movement have given us much Many of their negative insights into the straight world were correct for example Their parents were living a life of senseless frenzy indiscriminately accumulating money and power and divorces and ulcers doing untold violence along the way to their children the blacks the environment the world And if the counterculture forgot to leave behind the basic attitudes that made all this carnage possible perhaps we will know better the next WHAT should the next try be like There is no blueprint but here at least are some qualities that might be built in Material sharing Sharing of selves Something of the African sense of the world as existing here now Something of the African sense of here being related to there of now being related to then A minimum of verbiage Productive work done together Knowing the names of birds and trees Things like that And maybe work should be the starting point Rather than innovate those in the counterculture preferred to support themselves within the patterns allowed by the straight world welfare odd jobs checks from parents It is hardly surprising that they stayed so close to home psychologically as well To build truly alternative communities however will require working units that are radically different from and maybe even independent Nobody knows how to do it yet but we at least know some of the problems to be solvedproblems the counterculture never even got around to posing What kinds of work bring people together instead of forcing them apart How can we adapt sophisticated technologies to relatively small groups of people working in community Can the income from such work be distributed on the basis of need rather than wealth or output Can we develop principles for exchanging goods among producing units that do not simply copy the exploitative ones of the larger culture What patterns of shared services or cooperation generally can be evolved between community groups The list goes on and on but it has to be tackled Instead of being quite so selfcongratulatory about in consciousness we now need a commitment to explore alternatives in all of the areas that make up life The job is made all the harder by the lack of historical precedentEarly communal experiments in this country and elsewhere were based on simple methods of farming and smallscale industry solutions will differ where a more advanced technology is available Even the Israeli collectives the closest existing parallel to what we seek have been so distorted by more than half a century of nationalistic struggle against an external enemy that the relevance to us of what they have done is not clear And the nearest thing to a theoretical framework for communitybased development  anarchismhas always been far enough from being applied in practice that its specifics of social and economic organization are few If there are invaluable lessons to be learned from all these sources though not by the counterculture which refuses as a matter of principle to examine them we are ultimately confronted by the need to come up with new answers relevant to the people and technology of And so to work We cannot know Elena and I what the answers will be we dont even know all the questions But we can commit ourselves to finding out And we have certain advantages in looking In contrast to the counterculture we seek longterm involvement with people and places and this is a minimum condition for those who would create alternative systems In contrast to the counterculture we can accept whatever disciplines are required to make sense of our lives and change requires this too Perhaps we will stumble upon the pattern for a new social order one that is truly counter to what now exists Perhaps a revolution will come of it Perhaps not but it will still be good to live
McCloskey Urges Repeal Of Most Abortion Laws,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/04/archives/mccloskey-urges-repeal-of-most-abortion-laws.html,WASHINGTON Oct 3 UPI Representative Paul N McCloskey Jr California Republican who is running for President called today for the repeal of most abortion laws Noting President Nixons opposition to the repeal of such laws Mr McCloskey acknowledged that the President will not win or lose the 1972 nomination because of his stand on the repeal of abortion laws but that does not mean that he should not be challenged for his stand Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion laws he said I stand for the rights of a woman to determine whether she bears a child and the right of a child to be wanted as being entitled to a heavier weight in the scales of justice in 1971 than the rights of the fetus to life
Doctor Leads Group's Challenge to Michigan Anti‐Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/05/archives/doctor-leads-groups-challenge-to-michigan-antiabortion-law.html,WASHINGTON Oct 4  A black doctor from Michigan challenged the authorities of his state today to prosecute him for abortions he said he had performed He said that in his judgment as a doctor the pregnancies had constituted a threat to the physical or mental health of his patients Michigan law forbids abortions except to preserve the life of the patient The challenge by Dr Edgar B Keemer Jr who has practiced in Detroit since 1939 was part of a concerted campaign to secure the invalidation or repeal of the Michigan law The campaign was decided on at twoday conference here by the National Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws The State of Michigan was chosen as the prime target according to Lawrence Lader the president of the Association partly because no state in the Midwest has a liberal abortion law As a practical matter he said this means that middleand upperclass women in the Midwest can obtain abortions because they can travel to New York or Western states where legal abortions are available But poor women cannot afford to do this even if arrangements are made for the abortion to be done free he said Michigan was also chosen he said because legalization of abortion laws is supported there by a wide cross section of clergymen more than 300 of them who make up the Michigan Clergy Counseling Service for Problem Pregnancy Dr Keemers challenge to the Michigan law may point the way toward similar challenges elsewhere which stand a good chance of success according to one of the leading lawyers at the conference Joseph L Nellis of Washington The central point is that Dr Keemer is contending that the abortions he has performedhe said he could not estimate how manywere performed in accordance with the Michigan law governing medical practice which is separate from the antiabortion law Mr Nellis said that he believed there was no legal basis on which any state could tell a doctor how to practice medicine except that his action should be in accord with generally accepted standards of good practice That is what the Michigan Medical Practice Act says The antiabortion laws on the other hand interfere with the physicians medical judgment Mr Nellis said Mr Nellis said that he thought courts would more eas ily strike down state antiabortion laws if the test case were presented in terms of interference with the physicians practice of medicine than if it were done on the basis that many womens rights groups have advocated  namely that antiabortion laws represent an unconstitutional interference with the right of a woman to control her own body Two of the women at the news conference after the meeting at which these statements were made took issue with Mr Nell is They were Betty Friedan the founder of the National Organization of Women aid vice president of the association and Carol Greitzer a New York City Councilwoman and president of the association Both seemed to feel that Mr Nellis was advocating a slackening in the organizations efforts to achieve repeal of all laws restricting abortion and both affirmed that this remained the highest priority of the organization Mrs Friedan also said that Mr Nelliss proposal seemed to imply the right of a doctor to deprive a woman of the right to choose whether she wanted to have a baby and we do not recognize that right Betty Hurlbut an officer of the association read a resolution that the group had agreed to that called on the United States Public Health Service to recognize the need for legalized abortion as a matter of preventive health care Illegal abortions are now the greatest single cause of maternal deaths in the United States the resolution said and legalization thus must gain official recognition as a legitimate public health issue

Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/07/archives/population-control.html,To the Editor The awesomeness and primacy of the world population growth problem the greatest basic contributor to a host of other problems causes one to wonder about the level of maturity awareness and responsibility of our Congressional and national leadership So little is being done to meet this greatest threat to the quality and survival of human life Here at least immediacy and urgency should prevail over political apathy and expedience Making due allowance for existing children and pregnancies the United States should lead the way by enacting legislation as follows Childless women upon reaching the age of 18 should be allowed a tax credit for two children The foregoing would go far to liberate women and equalize their pay with menone of the many gross and remediable inequities in our society And it would in the bargain permit or encourage later marriage and childbearing The credit would be available until age 50 or children are emancipated even single or childless For the first two children born after the woman attains 25 years of age the credit would be increased by say 50 per cent The additional credit or bonus would be lost on the birth of a surviving third child and the entire credit disallowed for four or more children Additionally men who have sired two or more children should be offered free vasectomies and a bonus of say 250 for undergoing the minor surgery Arid of course Federal law should assure abortion and contraceptive information and devices for all women after puberty The foregoing would do much to improve the temper and honesty of the social climate as well as help avert what surely appears now to be inexorably and ultimately a catastrophe New York Sept 30 1971

Gardner's Common Cause Widens Impact,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/11/archives/gardners-common-cause-widens-impact.html,SEATTLE Oct 6  The white smooth faces that filled the ballroom of the Olympic Hotel registered a kind of pleased surprise as John W Gardner denounced in ringing tones the blatant shameless pervasive corruption that he said infests American government to the top We are going to fight this fight in every open forum and every dark political alley in the country said the former Secretary of Health Education and Welfare long known as a moderate scholarly man who moves easily through high corporate and government circles Our opponents will know they have been in a fight Before he was done they were applauding in the aisles in the fashion of a heated political rally It was the same the night before in Portland Ore and on previous evenings in major cities across the country Mr Gardner chairman of Common Cause a citizens lobby appears to have organized a national movement that could have an important impact on the 1972 elections as well as on legislation and government procedures on the national and state levels Maverick Moderates He has drawn together a body of middleclass welleducated dissidents who like little of what they have seen in public life in recent years It is in Mr Gardners words a movement of maverick moderates people who have been active in the political processes but have become disenchanted with the organized parties They are the kind of people who were attracted to former Senator Eugene J McCarthy Democrat of Minnesota in his 1968 quest for the Presidency While the movement has no party and no candidate for office it is based on the politics of dissatisfaction  that employed by Mr McCarthy and on a different level by Gov George C Wallace of Alabama In the process Mr Gardner has toughened his language and carefully honed a more emotional and personal appeal to his audience One assistant called it the radicalization of John Gardner Mr Gardner founded Common Cause 13 months ago amid widespread skepticism about its effectiveness There are now about 215000 members paying a minimum of 15ayear dues and renewals after the first year are coming in at a rate that causes Mr Gardner to predict continued growth into 1973 Members Polled on Priorities A professional staff of about 50 and several hundred volunteers employ a variety of techniques from telephone campaigns to filing of lawsuits to bring pressures for change on the national and state governments and the courts A poll of members decides the priorities So far Common Cause has among other things done the following Helped to ratify the 18yearold vote amendment to defeat Federal subsidies to the supersonic transport plane and to institute a recorded teller vote in the House of Representatives Lobbled for ending the war in Vietnam by Dec 31 for controls on campaign spending for ending the seniority system in Congress for giving the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission enforcement powers for welfare reform and for the equal rights for women amendment Filed suit to force the political parties to obey legal restrictions on campaign spending to open the courts for more citizen lawsuits to block an Administration move to extend depreciation tax savings to a segment of industry without Congressional approval Set up campaigns in the states to make voter registration easier to open up public bodies to public inspection and to lobby against legislative control by the special interests In recent weeks Mr Gardner has been traveling the country to inspire members and drum up new support for Common Cause Except for banners and bands his visits have the earmarks of a political campaign There are advance men to organize the schedule and get out the crowds Mr Gardner is accompanied by a small entourage of staff peopleusually Jack T Conway the former labor leader who is president or Lowell R Beck the executive director Tom Matthews special assistant for public relations and one or two members of the regional office He appears on television interviews and meets with various groups prior to the evening rally In Seattle about 1400 people a mixture of members and sympathizers filled the seats stood in the aisles and sat around the rostrum It was a crowd of nottooshaggy youths adults approaching middle age many from the states college communities and retired people who are civic activists There was a feel of affluence and a suggestion of aloofness Mr Gardner 59 years old always the reasoned patrician blends well with this crowd An intensely private man who rarely displays emotion he nevertheless indicates a feeling of release from the frustrations he had endured as chairman of the National Urban Coalition There he found that the enlightened business executive would agree in private about what had to be done for the cities but he seldom could he persuaded to get out in front with the flag Mr Gardner a product of the academic community was a crusader without a strong base of support An Activist Constituency Now he has a hyperactive constituency people with considerably less power than the top business leaders but activists who constantly worry the Common Cause staff for something to do Stimulated by the response he fills his speeches with such phrases as If you want to clear the stream get the hog out of the spring As the Lord tempers the wind to the shorn lamb the politician lightens retribution to the fat cat A tidal wave of political flimflam It is our intention to get on the backs of the politicians Common Cause he says with pride is making an impressive list of enemies Our members sent one Congressman [Representative Charles S Gubser Republican of California] right up the wall by paying personal visits on every one of his financial backers Mr Gardner said This is really cutting close to the bone What emerges is a strong antiEstablishment feeling with Common Cause and the people pitted against the White House the Congressional leadership and the state legislaturesinstitutions that Mr Gardner says have inevitably become through public neglect an insiders game Gardner Questioned on Aims Most of the meeting is devoted to questions from the floor and one question always asked is what is Mr Gardner up to politically is he running for President or what kind of political force will Common Cause become He replies that he is not running for President that Common Cause will not endorse candidates and that the political system is now in such sad shape that if the ideal man were elected President in 1972 and Congress was vastly improved it would have very limited effect It was never expected that we should elect a big daddy and then lean on him he said We are up to something much deeper There has got to be an outside force to bring pressures to open up the doors and windows and give this country back to the people This of course does not rule out shaping the issues in 1972 Another frequent question is why are there virtually no blacks and other minorities in Common Cause especially in view of Mr Gardners close association with them in the Urban Coalition They prefer to work through their own organizations he said But what we are doing is extremely relevant to them When the political system fails to work it fails most grievously for those at the lower scale of the ladder Anything we can do to alter those conditions will help Causes Limited The meetings yield an outpouring of causes that members want the organization to pursuefrom abortion laws to prison reform to freeing political prisoners from the armed services Mr Gardner replies that Common Cause can do only so much He acknowledges a list of dangers for Common Cause including the possibility that it could take on the same atrophy and arrogance it is fighting in other institutions or that it could stir dissatisfaction to undesirable levels There is the danger that if we get 10000 young lawyers out filing citizens suits they may simply shut everything down he said But that is a chance we have to take He was asked about the possibility that he may be raising expectations beyond the ability of his organization to deliver I believe there will be substantial gains in reforms he said The mood of America is very restive There is a skepticism a feeling that things have got to work better I dont believe anyone can travel around as I do and not think that something is stirring out there
U.S. Agency Financing Sterilizations,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/11/archives/u-s-agency-financing-sterilizations-u-s-antipoverty-agency-is.html,OAK RIDGE Tenn Oct 10A Federal agency is providing money to sterilize men and women who voluntarily decide not to conceive any more children This is the first time that a Federal agency has given such aid on a large scale The pilot project by the Office of Economic Opportunity is beginning in the hill country of Anderson County where 30000 isolated and poor Appalachian people live untouched by middleclass comfort They are unaware of many birthcontrol methods and some of them have 10 or more children But now the poverty agency has provided 240773 for research clinics and counseling and for vasectomies for 150 men volunteers and tubal ligations tying off the fallopian tubesfor 150 women volunteers So far 10 men and 25 women have volunteered While the Department of Health Education and Welfare and state public health services have been assisting people who wish to be sterilized this project is said by those involved in it to be the largest Government undertaking of its kind The project was made possible by a recent change of policy in the poverty agency and by a new Tennessee family planning law The project is being administered through community channels by a professional team The administrators say that one effective element of their program is Bob Brooks who tells his people in blunt words and mountain dialect about his own vasectomy and how it helped his family Mr Brooks works with the Planned Parenthood Association of the Southern Mountains the local agency that is carrying out the new program The association has counseled people in Oak Ridge for a decade Mr Brooks is called an outreach worker meaning that he travels in the surrounding countryside The first outreach worker a woman was hired by the association in 1967 At first you couldnt talk about things openly said Mrs Jeannette P Smith the registered nurse who is director of the parenthood association and a resident here for 17 years People were taught that children were gifts of God They didnt know their own anatomy But we had excellent outreach workers and people began discussing rumorslike how the Pill caused cancer They began asking for more information more help While the association expanded its services to the hill people it attracted the attention of Warren Bern a young doctor in the Family Planning Division of the Office of Health Affairs of the Federal poverty agency who had spent twoyears in the Peace Corps in Peru In frequent visits to Anderson County Dr Hem won the respect ofprofessionals and also of local people like Bob Brooks Dr Bern wrote an article in The New Republic in which he concluded But one of the most important needs is freedom from the tyranny of their own biology Although the Federal poverty agency has been involved in family planning since the regime of Sargent Shriver in 1964 its regulations forbade providing money for sterilization or abortions But on May 18 a directive by Wesley Hjornevik deputy director of OEO announced that only abortions would be banned Meanwhile the Tennessee legislature passed the Family Planning Act of 1971 which provided for broad availability of services including contraceptive devices and voluntary sterilization Under the new law an existing fivecotinty public health project in west Tennessee using mostly funds from the Federal health department began providing money for sterilizetions Ninety have been performed in the last 84 days officials say Meanwhile a survey by the Federal poverty agency showed that 80 per cent of its Community Action groups around the nation favored funds for sterilization Trust of the People Work on the pilot project is proceeding toward actual operations beginning in January Patients can choose their family doctors but those with Medicare or private insurance are not eligible However the professionals insist that their program will succeed as longs as workers like Mr Brooks have the trust of the people] Mr Brooks 45 years old grew up on a tenant farm His large family split up He left school after the seventh grade and he says I saw times when I wasnt so sure it was a good thing I was born He came back from military service in 1946 and got work in a factory He Married and had three children I knew I was limited in earning power he recalls I wanted to take care of the kids I had I asked my doctor what I could do You know you worry about losing your manhoodwhen country people think of sterilization they think of farm animals being castratedbut I soon learned different and I had my vasectomy Mr Brookss two daughters have graduated from the University of Tennessee and his 16yearold son hopes to Mr Brooks works at Union Carbide and before the afternoon shift drives around the country roads Sex is important to the people he said Its about all some of them got Sure I tell them all about contraceptives But lets face it passion power overcomes will power anytime When they decide their family is the right size and they ask what they can do I tell it like it is The other day he stopped at a cabin where a woman sat in the yard surrounded by her six children During their discussion she said Seems like Maybe six is enough Too many kids can break up a marriage Mr Brooks invited her to the clinic He said that he could arrange transportation and babysitting Other times Mr Brooks speaks to men at factories and gas stations and pool halls His feeling is that men have traditionally left family planning decisions to the women But he tells the men that they are re sponsible for children too He says that men are getting more interested in vasectomies as they realize their sex lives will be better without fear of pregnancy A cold wife is often just afraid of pregnancy he told couple of men at the sanitation garage the other day The workers in the parenthood association say that there has been no negative reaction from people here as there has been in certain black communities where sterilization is often equated with genocide Blacks make up only 36 pea cent of the population here The people I know need this Mr Brooks said Theyre telling me this more and more Theyve been taught that large families are goodBut its just like the young people are saying around the countrywere not going to take what weve been told any more We want something different
Potential Risks as Well as Values Seen in Genetic Screening,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/13/archives/potential-risks-as-well-as-values-seen-in-genetic-screening.html,WARRENTON Va Oct 12  Genetic screening of population groups is potentially valuable but also presents potential risks of personal injustice some specialists suggested here today The values and pitfalls of screening programs to discover abnormalities in human hereditary material constitute one of the major topics of discussion at an international meeting here on the ethical issues in genetic counseling and the use of genetic knowledge Dr Robert Murray chief of the medical genetics unit of Howard University warned that the risk exists of stigmatizing a person who is found to be a carrier of an abnormal genetic trait even though that individuals health may not be affected Noting that screening techniques can be valuable tools for public health he said they can also if improperly used disrupt family relationships and be psychologically damaging to individuals He and others opposed the concept of compulsorygenetic screening as potentially dangerous Dr Daniel Callahan director of the Institute of Society Ethics and the Life Sciences said social pressure began to put in an appearance if a choice between having or not having an abortion to eliminate the birth of a mentally defective child was put in terms of responsible or irresponsible social action The institute a private research organization in Hastings NY is cosponsor of the meeting with the Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health At the meeting here scientists lawyers theologians and philosophers are discussing the promise the hazards and the dilemmas of mans rapidly in creasing knowledge of genetics and increasing ability to act on the basis of that knowledge The discussions today and yesterday have ranged from the morality of abortion to the theoretical possibility of growing a whole human being from the nucleus of one living adult body cell This feat known as cloning has already been achieved experimentally in frogs The creature produced is a virtual carbon copy of the one from which the cell was taken Although there is no indication yet that this could be done in man it is conceivable in theory and it would raise many serious ethical questions In general the discussions at the meeting here have centered on the worth problems and ethical issues of genetic counseling and the geneticists increasing ability to find abnormalities in the human hereditary material An example of a largescale screening program that is having clear beneficial effects was given in a brief report by a doctor from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine He has been a prime mover in organizing a screening program for TaySach disease in the Baltimore  Washington area that has screened 10000 persons in the past four months Five couples have been found with the defect The discovery that they are carriers of the genetic trait for TaySachs disease effectively safeguards these potential parents from having children with the fatal malady said Dr Michael M Kaback of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and also allows them a reasonable chance of having normal children Dr Kabacks report concerned a major program to find carriers of TaySachs disease a rare hereditary problem found primarily in some Jewish population groups Babies born with the disease appear normal and healthy up to the age of about four months Then they deteriorate rapidly suffering severe mental retardation blindness and paralysis from which they never recover Almost invariably they die by roughly the age of 4 The disease appears only when both parents carry the genetic trait that leads to it These same parents can also have normal children but they usually avoid having children after the birth of one with the disease because of the fear that the tragedy may be repeated
Decline in Maternal Death Rate Linked to Liberalized Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/13/archives/decline-in-maternal-death-rate-linked-to-liberalized-abortion.html,MINNEAPOLIS Oct 12  The maternal death rate in New York City has been cut by more than half since the liberalization of the states abortion law 15 months ago It was reported here today Dr David Harris speaking to the annual meeting of the American Public Health Association attributed the current low rate of two deaths for every 10000 live births the lowest maternal mortality rate in the citys history to the replacement of criminal abortions with safe legal ones In an interview following his presentation Dr Harris explained that through the years abortionand mostly criminal abortionhas been the single leading cause of maternityrelated deaths accounting for about a third of maternal deaths each year In the first year under the new lawJuly 1 1970 to July 1 1971there were 15 abortionrelated deaths compared with 24 in 1969 Most of the 15 deaths occurred within the first few months experience with legal abortions Deaths associated with legal abortions have since fallen off dramatically  to five in the first eight months of this year Another Factor Cited Dr Harris who is now associate director of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York was the citys Deputy Commissioner of Health during the first year of the new abortion law He added that another factor contributing to the reduction in maternal mortality is the probability that many women for whom pregnancy is hazardous are now receiving legal abortions instead of risking continuation of their pregnancy and childbirth which is a greater hazard than abortion Dr Harris expressed concern over the growing numbers of women from other states who are coming to the city for their abortions Whereas at the outset about 40 per cent of women undergoing abortions in New York were from out of state at the end of the first year 70 per cent were nonresidents At the same time the total number of abortions on nonresidents rose from about 2000 a month to about 15000 Now we are meeting the demand but I dont know what will happen if this keeps up Dr Harris remarked He urged other states to follow the example set by New York and liberalize their abortion laws New York Thanked A doctor in the audience who said he was from a state where the abortion law is still archaic thanked New York for its remarkable job and said he and his colleagues were extremely grateful there was some place they could send their patients and know they would receive safe excellent care He later identified himself as Dr Jan Schneider of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Michigan Most of the women from out of state who come to New York for abortions are white Dr Harris reported Among city residents however nonwhites and Puerto Ricans have received 53 per cent of the abortions performed indicating that the city has been meeting its selfproclaimed goal of providing abortions for the poor Another positive effect of the abortion law Dr Harris said has been the decline in outofwedlock births in the city He said that the rate of decline in illegitimate births75 per cent  was greater than the drop in total births for the city68 per cent
Horrors of East Pakistan Turning Hope Into Despair,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/14/archives/horrors-of-east-pakistan-turning-hope-into-despair-horrors-of-east.html,DACCA Pakistan Oct 10 The horror of life in East Pakistan shows every sign of becoming permanently institutionalized and most if not all the foreigners who came hoping to help are on the verge of despair In particular the chances of reversing the tide of millions of destitute refugees who have fled to India seem remote Most governments consider the refugee problem the main catalyst in the atmosphere of war prevailing on the subcontinent India charges that military terror in East Pakistan since the central Government moved against the Bengali separatists March 25 has driven nine million refugees across her borders Those people the Indians say are an intolerable drain on already vastly overtaxed economic resources and a force that could result in a political catastrophe or internal warfare The New Delhi Government has hinted that as a last resort it might try to change the situation in East Pakistan by force to induce the refugees whom Pakistan numbers at less than a third of the Indian figure to leave India Pakistan has hastened her own preparations for war Major troop movements have been reported here and in India in the past few weeks The Soviet Union China and the United States among other nations are deeply entangled in the feud The United Nations and other international organizations have been working with great urgency to alleviate the misery and especially to prevent a war Dozens of governments have teams of experts technicians and diplomats working in East Pakistan The United Nations East Pakistan Relief Operation alone has 75 officials here There is some disagreement among the hundreds of foreign officials about the techniques by which the refuges could be repatriated But there is apparent unanimity on one subject that East Pakistan should overcome its reputation as a place of endless horror and suffering To that end many Governments including that of the United States have pressed the Pakistani Government at Islamabad for fundamental changes in East Pakistan among them these No Real Progress Discerned The end of police and military terror directed against thousands of political suspects and millions of nonMoslem members of ethnic and religious minorities A reasonably representative government in Dacca capable of restoring the faith of East Pakistans population in the future of democracy A much more convincing effort by the central Government to relieve the physical suffering wrought on East Pakistans predominantly Bengali population by flood cyclone and war in the last year The consensus among the foreigners working here is that there has been no real progress in any of those areas Whispered conversations with Bengalis still have to do largely with alleged atrocities by the occupation army which is largely made up of West Pakistanis and is hated by most of the population One tale that is widely believed and seems to come from many different sources is that 563 women picked up by the army in March and April and held in military brothels are not being released because they are pregnant beyond the point at which abortions are possible A Government spokesman denied the report and challenged any accuser to name the place where the women are supposed to be held On the other hand a number of Bengali gynecologists are known to have been performing many abortions on girls held at army installations and released Two of Three Released In a clandestine meeting elaborately arranged to elude military surveillance a Bengali farmer told this correspondent about one such experience Talking with great reticence and glancing around in fear that he had been led into a police trap he said The army came to the village on the night of April 11 One patrol led me away from my house to identify something and when I got back I found my sister was missing Another girl the daughter of a neighbor was gone and there was a Hundu family whose girl was missing In the middle of May they released my sister and the neighbors daughter but the Hindu girl is still gone The two girls who came back are both pregnant and will have their babies At the place where they were kept there were 200 or 300 girls doing the same thing They had to wash clothing and to make love to soldiers two or three times a day My sister doesnt know where she was kept the farmer added Many Dacca residents including foreigners tell of having seen young women taken away by military policemen without even an identification check Other people obscure and prominent are also subject to arbitrary arrest although President Agha Mohammed Yahya Khan proclaimed a general amnesty for political prisoners last month and his action was warmly applauded by foreign diplomats seeking political accommodation in East Pakistan The diplomats who now say that the amnesty was purely cosmetic report that the Government not only has failed to release any important prisoners but also has continued arresting politicians professors lawyers and others by the hundreds According to a number of reports some from foreign observers a number of persons under amnesty have been arrested and shot The Most Prominent Prisoner The most prominent prisoner is Sheik Mujibur Rahman universally acknowledged as the political and spiritual leader of East Bengal Sheik Mujibs Awami League party won a sweeping election victory last December for National Assembly seats allocated to East Pakistan and he had been scheduled to become Prime Minister of all of Pakistan Most diplomats and other foreigners believe that a resolution of the East Pakistani crisis can be found only if Sheik Mujib is permitted to exercise the role of leadership in East Pakistan to which he was elected But he remains a prisoner undergoing a secret military trial and facing a possible death sentence Members of his family while not accused of any crime are held as virtual prisoners here Such political repression has extended not only to the banned Awami League but to any politician or group likely to embarrass the military regime The effect was dramatically underscored last week by a former chief of the air force who decided to try running for public office in view of the Governments announced intention of moving toward democratic processes The officer Mohammad Asghar Khan a retired air marshal is known throughout Pakistan as a patriot and political moderate He commanded the air force in 1965 during Pakistans brief but bloody war with India and has always insisted that Pakistan remain one country Program Was Censored Mr Asghar Khan a West Pakistani and a leader of the movement that brought about the collapse of President Mohammad Ayub Khans Government in 1968 offered a conciliatory program calling for major development efforts in East Pakistan and genuine political freedom for its people but it has been completely censored On Friday he announced that no candidate could run unless he could reach the public through the press so he was withdrawing Today is a black day for democracy in Pakistan he said when even I with a mild program breaking no martiallaw regulations am frozen out When the army occupied East Pakistan and banned the Awami League the election was in effect annulled Some elected assemblymen were cleared by the army to take their seats but most had fled to India or joined the guerrillas In July President Yahya Khan announced that byelections would be held to fill the seats Government  approved candidates and parties most of them strongly rightwing and fundamentalist Moslems and all heavily escorted by troops have begun giving speeches in East Pakistan and are reported on at length in the controlled press All have advocated a war to the finish against miscreants and Indian agents  words invariably used by the Government to describe the Bengali guerrillas Meflawhile the anguish of war continues in the countryside The guerrillas are taking an increasing toll of the occupation army and medical circles report growing numbers of bodies of soldiers The guerrillas are also said to be assassinating members of the local peace committees civilian groups made up mostly of nonBengalis and assigned to carry out army administration of occupied areas When troops or peace cammittees are attacked the army burns hamlets to the ground its reprisal and local reports usually tell of heavy losses of life In the prevailing circumstances according to most foreign observers stationed here the refugee crisis and the other major problems are not susceptible of solution however much foreign assistance is poured in It is especially unlikely they say that East Pakistans Hindu minority about 10 per cent of the March population of 75 million will ever return in any numbers The Hindus were particular targets of the soldiers Hindu communities and shops burned out by the army stand deserted their temples smashed The Government has made it plain that Hinduism will no longer be tolerated in East Pakistan to reinforce the point the new civilian Governor Dr A M Malik did not appoint a Hindu to his interim cabinet Centers No Longer Visited A foreign relief worker reflecting the failure of the Governments amnesty said We no longer bother to visit the Governments 60 or so refugee reception centers Its obvious they arent coming back in more than a tiny trickle none in some areas At one place he added we discovered the Govern ment had a staff of professional refugees that they brought out whenever visitors came to show that something was going on The army authorities tell you there are 2000 refugees at some camps another expert related You go there and find a handful of people wandering around and under continued questioning the authorities agree maybe there are only 200 After hearing as many deceptions as we do it quickly reaches the point at which we cannot take the Pakistan Governments word for anything however trivial There are universal complaints that even in the matter of humanitarian relief the army has commandeered all available trucks cars motor launches and boats  the only available means of moving food or supplies until foreign relief vehicles can be brought in Blame Put On India The Government insists that all or most of the troubles would disappear if India would end her provocations and stop infiltrating men and arms into East Pakistan The Pakistanis say Indias warlike actions are demonstrated by her unwillingness to allow United Nations or other foreign relief workers to enter the border zones near East Pakistan Pakistan on the other hand has admitted relief teams Some diplomats believe that a partial solution would be the imposition by the United Nations of a military peacekeeping force between East Pakistan and India through which refugees could move if they chose It seems unlikely that either country would agree to such a move The pessimism among foreign observers is formidable There is really nothing anyone with any amount of money can do for East Pakistan a relief expert commented It seems to be an irredeemable land whose people are doomed from birth and as the population of the subcontinent doubles every generation it will only get worse My own feeling he added and I know lots of us share it is that the outside world might just as well pull out now and let things here take their inevitable course
LEGAL ABORTIONS CLIMB IN BRITAIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/14/archives/legal-abortions-climb-in-britain-83849-in-year-reported-to-strain.html,LONDON Oct 13A large increase in the number of legal abortions accompanied by a striking advance In abortion safety was reported today by Britains chief medical officer in his annual review On the State of Public Health However Sir George Godber chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Social Security noted that the large number of abortions had caused serious problems for gynecology departments with delays in the treatment of other patients Perhaps the most serious objection to so many terminations of pregnancy is they would not have been necessary at all if the obvious and preferable alternative of contraception had been used Sir George declared He said that 56 per cent of the abortions had been performed on unmarried women The report also expressed hope that heroin addiction had been contained in this country noted a statistical correlation between maternal influenza and birth defects and branded cigarette smoking as the largest avoidable cause of death in Britain today After abortions were legalized under the National Health Service in April 1968 the number of abortions rose sharply from 22256 in the rest of 1968 to 54158 in 1969 and 83849 last year One pregnancy was terminated for every 10 births to women living in England and Wales the report said In addition more than 10600 women came to Britain for legal abortions last year mostly from Gremany and France compared with about 4900 in 1969 when the women came mostly from Germany and th eUnited States Despite the increase in numbers deaths from abortion have fallen in striking fashion the report said From an average of 52 a year in 196466 and 40 a year in 196870 they fell to 29 last year the lowest ever recorded The report expressed concern at the rise in the number of girls under 16 having abortions The figure rose from 525 in 1969 to 1686 last year Optimistic on Heroin Sir George expressed guarded optimism about the containment of heroin addiction He said that Britains 14 drug dependency treatment units which supply registered addicts with limited quantities of heroin were issuing only about twofifths of the amount of heroin issued two and a half years earlier In December 1970 1358 grams were issued compared with 3000 grams a month in mid1968 The number of patients remained fairly constant at 1200 The number of new addicts in 1970 was reported as 353 well below the 652 of the previous year Sir George said recent statistics suggested that babies whose mothers had flu during pregnancy ran the risk of being born deformed or of dying soon after birth However this suggestion was dismissed by an expert in the field Dr Geoffrey Schild director of the World Influenza Center at the National Institute of Medical Research in London said there was no direct laboratory confirmation that the flu virus could cause fetal abnormalities or death of newborn children He said statistical evidence was not very strong but conceded the matter warranted investigation Sir George based his suggestion on the fact that Britains infant death rate rose last year for only the second time since 1945 He said that this was due to a secondquarter increase in the deaths of newborn infants which came three to five months after the severest flu epidemic for years The only other occasion since World War II when infant mortality rose was in 1951 again after a severe outbreak of flu In a general comment Sir George said that the average Britons health was improving but still not good enough for he still has a distressing tendency to smoke It is necessary to repeat Sir George said that cigarette smoking is the largest single avoidable cause of death in Britain today

ground and four huge Gen eral Electric jet engines to lift it into the air Last week the United States Air Force grounded its entire fleet of 47 C5Asand when they will fly again remains uncertain The order to ground the C5A came when cracks were discov ered in an engine mounting of one of the planes at Charleston Air Force Base in South Caro lina That was only two weeks after an engine on another C5A had broken loose and fallen to the runway as the plane was preparing to take off from Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma The C5A has had its troubles since it was first conceived on the drawing boards of Lockheed Aircraft Corporation  troubles that have been technical eco nomic and political The Air Force had originally ordered 115 of the mammoth jets then cut its order back to 81 leading to a 200million loss to Lockheed that it was forced to absorb at the insistence of the Defense Department The cause of the latest diffi culty is a mystery though Air Force technicians say it may be a

plead ed guilty to two felonies selling unregistered securities and mak ing false entries in a bank ledger He has also been charged by the Securities and Exchange Com mission with systematically looting at least three banks and insurance companies And dur ing the investigations of Mr Sharps dealings it was revealed that Mr Wilson had accepted an interestfree loan of 30000 while Attorney

Early Miscarriages Found Prevalent in Operating‐Room Workers,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/19/archives/early-miscarriages-found-prevalent-in-operatingroom-workers.html,PALO ALTO Calif Oct 18Women who work in operating rooms seem to experience more spontaneous miscarriages in early pregnancy than other female health workers a team of Stanford University scientists has reported The researchers suspect the difference in miscarriage rates may be due to chronic lowgrade exposure to anesthetics that leak out into operating rooms Such contamination has only recently been measured and seems to be found in all operating rooms The Stanford scientists are Drs Ellis N Cohen J Weldon Belleville and Byron W Brown The results of a study they conducted recently on anesthesia pregnancy and miscarriage appear in the current issue of Anesthesiology a medical journal Two groups of women were surveyed the scientists said The first consisted of 159 married operating room and general duty nurses from ages 25 to 50 from three large northern California hospitals The women were carefully interviewed by a nurse and a psychologist 297 Miscarriage Rate Among operating room nurses it was found that 297 per cent of their pregnancies ended in miscarriage over a fiveyear period Only 88 per cent of the pregnancies among general duty nurses ended in miscarriage over the same time Further It was found that operating room nurses tended to suffer their miscarriages around the eighth week of pregnancy while the general duty nurses had theirs around the 10th weeks The second group of women studied included 50 physicians whose specialty practice was limited to anesthesiology Another group of 81 women physicians from ages 25 to 50 with specialties in other areas served as controls They were surveyed over a sixyear period The women anesthesiologists had a 378 per cent spontaneous abortion rate the study found compared with a 103 per cent rate for the other women doctors The women anesthesiologists also underwent spontaneous abortions about two weeks earlier than their colleagues There can be little doubt that the spontaneous miscarriage rate is significantly higher in both operating room nurses and anesthetists compared with their control group the doc tors said and this may be related to something tin the operating room environment possibly the trace concentrations of anesthetic gases present In a companion report in the same journal three Stanford scientists Charles Whitcher Ellis Cohen and James Trudell reported on recent measurements of the level of exposure to anesthetics in operating room staff They found that halothane an anesthetic showed a marked increase in concentration within the operating room throughout the day Anes thetists were more exposed to the gas than other operating room personnel they said The researchers said that pending further studies all anesthetics present in operating rooms must be held suspect of the possibility that they play a role in the higher abortion rate noted among operating room personnel The researchers emphasized however that no causal link between the two phenomena could yet be made More studies need to be done to determine causation they said

Bello Silver man from Brooklyn To her husband she is Bubbly to her friends she is Bub bles and to her fans she is Beverly Sills Americas most famous opera singer a prima donna at the pinnacle of a spectacular career And now she has a new title She has just been named chairman of the 1972 National FoundationMarch of Dimes Mothers March on Birth Defects It is not one of those honorary titles that some social lionesses or bubble headed celebrities accept to get their names in the papers Beverly Sills well equipped for the job She has been there first hand as the mother of a deaf daughter and a mentally retarded son One of her three stepdaughters is also mentally retarded but not as severely as her son I feel a very strong emotional com mitment to these children the volup tuous 42yearold diva said the other day during a conversation about her family life in her sevenroom apartment on Central Park West Every time I took my son to doctor I would ask Why did this happen and the doctor would say dont know Thats one reason Im so interested in this Mothers March be cause I want to be able to know whyand because I want other mothers to be able to know why Each year she said 250000 children are born with mental and physical damage some of it similar to that suffered by her own children As chair man of the campaign she will visit Mothers March leaders mainly in cities where she has singing engagements and inspire them to work harder towards raising the 1972 campaign goal of 10 million Last year 8742000 was raised Often her pep sessions will take place on days when she is scheduled to give an evening performance a fact that would drive some prima donnas up the wall but doesnt seem to faze Miss Sills a bit Im not a nervous woman she de clared as an unusual modernistic water sculpture gurgled in the background Im a very energetic woman I prefer to be out meeting people on days when Im to sing I thrive on that I just get so bored sitting in my hotel room star ing at things The redhaired Miss Sills is a friendly downtoearth woman who radiates warmth and joy even when talking about the grief she suffered when her children were born defective She views the tragedies along with the rest of her life as things that were preor dained all part of a grand design My mother once said to me that God gives those children to people who are best able to cope the singer said She said that my daughter had been given to me because I lived in a world of sound and that I would spend my whole life trying to give her sound Well its true The singers career as a wife and mother began in 1956 when she married Peter Greenough a wealthy Boston Brahmin descended from John Alden whose family holdings then included The Cleveland PlainDealer They had met year earlier when Miss Sills was ap pearing in Cleveland with the New York City Opera Their daughter Meredith Muffy was born in 1959 and for 22 months no one in the family had any inkling that anything was wrong with her She was bright thumbed happily through books for hoursbut didnt say a word Finally Miss Sills took her to a doctor for a hearing test and within minutes it was learned that Muffy had a pro found hearing loss We dont think of her in terms of being a handicapped child said Mr Greenough a big burly man as he entered the living room He recently gave up a 35year career in journalism to devote his time to his family Muffy travels all over the world with us when her mother is singing he went on She orders her own meals in restau rants and her two closest friends are girls who can hear At 12 Muffy is an attractive girl with long blond hair who has become pro ficient at swimming and tennis A cita tion hanging above her bed says that she had excelled at swimming tennis golf canoeing and archery at Camp Starlight last summer She is in the sixth grade at a school for deaf children in Manhattan but would like to attend a regular high school and college At present her career goal is to become a veterinarian perhaps because of her fondness for her highspirited white poodle Gigi and the oversize goldfish that swim lazily in tank beside her bed Even though she wears a powerful doublebattery hearing aid at her waist with a wire running up to her ear Muffy is barely able to hear sounds But she is an expert lip reader She lip reads like a dream her mother said One day we were having lunch at Blums and she looked over at another mother and daughter who were sitting nearby and said That girl is very fresh to her mother I told her wasnt very nice for her to be reading other peoples lips but she looked back at them anyway and then she said Why she uses dirty words too Muffys hearing loss has posed a few minor problems for the family Miss Sills worries constantly about her daughter crossing the street She cant hear horns honking And then of course certain insensitive children have made fun of Muffys hearing aid But she has grown tough enough to cope with them by saying I feel sorry for you because you are so stupid Peter Jr Bucky now 10 came along two years after Muffy and there was much rejoicing in the family because he was the first male Greenough born in 47 years Plans were made for him to go to Harvard where his father had gone before him Then when he was 2 months old baby photographer was called into re cord Bucky for posterity Miss Sills recalled the event quite vividly The photographer looked startled and said Hey lady theres something wrong with him I cant get him to look at the birdie Today Bucky along with his half sister Diana now almost 19 attends a school for mentally retarded children in Massachusetts The Greenoughs visit them once a month and plan to see the children more often when the whole family starts spending more weekends at their farm near Concord Bucky is severely retarded Miss Sills said He doesnt speak and hes also epileptic Last May he diedhis heart just stopped beating He had grand mal seizure They revived him with mouthtomouth resuscitation She said that after the boys retarda tion was discovered she and her hus band decided not to have any more children We had talked about having three or four she said but I thought we were courting disaster Neither of our families had any history of mental retardation or deafness but we just decided that something must be askew between the two of us Doctors agree too If abortion had been legal then would she have considered terminating either pregnancy if she had known in advance of each childs defects I think that if I had known I was going to have a severely

Gains Forecast in Genetic Intelligence,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/28/archives/gains-forecast-in-genetic-intelligence.html,ALBANY Oct 27A Mich igan biologist has advanced the thesis that contrary to pre vailing opinion current trends in reproduction indicate that more intelligent people will outbreed the less intelligent The net result he predicted at a meeting on heredity and society that ended here today will be a genetic upgrading of the general level of intelligence The biologist Dr Carl Jay Bajema based his view on the findings of numerous fertility studies and on a variety of social trends among them the growing availability of contra ceptives and increasing educa tional opportunities Dr Bajemas view runs counter to that held by many experts and laymen who after observing that members of lower socioeconomic groups tend to have larger families conclude that society is becom ing genetically less intelligent A number of population ex perts interviewed by telephone today remarked that little data exist on which to base any firm prediction of where society is heading with regard to genetic intelligence And they added there are many changes taking placeamong them the wom ens liberation movementthat could grossly distort projections based on the behavior of past generations Two out of three experts said they shared Dr Bajemas view however The biologist who is on the staff of Grand Valley State Col lege in Allendale Mich out lined his theory at a meeting sponsored by the New York State Health Department and its Birth Defects Insitute Dr Bajema cited three studies  in Minnesota Michi gan and Massachusetts  to support his theory In relating the intelligence of school child ren to the number of brothers and sisters they had all three studies found that the less in telligent children tended to come from larger families When the children became adults and were followed through their reproductive Years it was found that the more intelligent had more chil dren than the less intellegent had Dr Bajema said that it doesnt mean the brighter chil dren had larger familiessim ply that a larger proportion of them had children period The Rural Norm He added that most of the studies that related large fam ily size to low educational occupational and income lev els were based on studies of families that had migrated to the cities from rural areas and brought with them the rural norm of large family size As more people are born and raised in urban environments this relationship disappears Dr Bajema said The increasing availability of contraceptives and abortion to all levels of society should further the trend toward fewer births among the lower socio economic classes the biologist said When every child is a wanted child he continued those who can best afford to have children and who have the most to offer them will probably have the larger fam ilies He suggested that people Would have children more for altruistic reasons because in an urban society children are a liability and a great expense Dr Bajema also noted that the increasing availability of a college education to all with ability regardless of means should foster matings between intelligent people and tip the scale in favor of increasing genetic intelligence He cited studies of married collegeed ucated women indicating that throughout this century an in creasing proportion of college educated women have borne children Many Disagree When asked to comment on Dr Bajemas theory Dr Nor man B Ryder Princeton Uni versity sociologist and expert on fertility trends said that there are many men of good will who disagree violently He added There are no good data on which to base a case one way or another Dr Bruce Eckland sociologist at the University of North Carolina also lamented the lack of reliable data But he added I would have to agree that if family planning is having any effect it would be toward re ducing the differences in family size between the social classes The result would have to be to move the whole distribution of the intelligence curve up ward he said Dr Arno G Motulsky genet icist at the University of Wash ington said that he was not worried about what is happen ing to the intelligence of the population but added that he was leery of making any long term predictions
Survey Finds 50% Back Liberalization Of Abortion Policy,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/28/archives/survey-finds-50-back-liberalization-of-abortion-policy-50-in-study.html,WASHINGTON Oct 27 General concern over popula tion growth has become so in tense a new Federal study shows that half the public now favors liberalization of restric tions on abortion That finding the authorities say represents a dramatic change in public attitudes As recently as 1968 survey data showed that 85 per cent of the public opposed more liberal abortion policies Results of the new study were made available today by the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future for which the study was made The survey involving inter views with a national sample of 1700 adults was conducted by the Opinion Research Corpora tion One question concerned the circumstances under which abortion should be permitted Among all persons 50 per cent said the decision should be one left up to persons involved and their doctor Fortyone per cent said abortion was permis sible only in certain circum stances Only 6 per cent said it should not be allowed under any circumstances The remain ing 3 per cent had no opinion Almost identical results were obtained in answer to a second question Do you think abor tions should be permitted where the parents already have all the children they want Forty nine per cent said yes 42 per cent said no and 9 per cent had no opinion Wide public attention to population growth was reflected in a series of findings includ ing the following Almost 80 per cent of those surveyed favored voluntary sterilization This represented a significant increase over the 64 per cent approval found it a 1966 survey More than half think Gov ernment should try to slow population growth and to pro mote the development of small er cities for better population distribution An equally large number believe people should volun tarily limit the size of their families even if they can af ford more children This belief is strong enough that abort 56 per cent  a surprising total to experts  said they would consider adop tion if they decided to have more than two children Of those half said they would approve of adopting a child of a different race John D Rockefeller 3d the population commissions chair man said today While we had expected to see consid erable public interest in popu lation growth problems we were quite surprised at the ex tent of this interest The commission proposed by President Nixon was estab lished by Congress in March 1970 It is expected to begin issuing a series of public re ports next spring Officials also were struck by the specific abortion findings Frankly Im surprised said Charles F Westoff executive director of the commission at the extent of apparent sup port for easing of legal restric tions surrounding abortion Earlier surveys have showed that in 1965 91 per cent dis approved of liberalized abor tion policies By 1968 this dropped to 85 per cent and by 1969 to 79 per cent While the new survey showed 50 per cent in favor of liberal ized abortion policies there were variations among sub groups Percentages in favor of leaving the decision solely up to the couple and their doctor were as follows Under age 30 58 per cent over age 30 45 per cent White 51 per cent black 33 per cent Men 53 per cent women 45 per cent Protestant 48 per cent Ro man Catholic 39 per cent Jew ish 91 per cent In accord with the commis sions responsibility the new survey covered issues of pop ulation distribution as well as growth One finding was that residents of rural areas are far happier with the kind of area they live in than are bigcity residents When asked if they prefer their present area to others 39 per cent of those in large metropolitan areas said yes For residents of mediumsize metropolitan areas the figure was 55 per cent For those out side metropolitan areas the figure was 88 per cent Another finding showed that blacks are highly impatient with the pace of integration of suburbs Among whites 18 per cent said it was proceeding too slowly with the rest di vided between too fast and just right But among blacks 56 per cent said too slowly
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/29/archives/the-limits-of-roths-satire.html,OUR GANG Starring Tricky and His Friends By Philip Roth 200 pages Random House 595 Oddly enough Philip Roth has neglected to include a disclaimer in his latest book Our Gang Nowhere in its pages could I find any statement guaranteeing that the characters here represented are purely imaginary and that any resemblance to persons living dead or otherwise is purely coincidental This is most unusual in an imaginative work of this sort in which a President and a Vice Presi dent appear not to speak of a Secre tary of Defense a Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a Mayor of New York But then I guess it doesnt matter about the missing disclaimer Our Gang isnt very realistic any how I mean I even had trouble understanding the internal logic of this book let alone its bearing on the outside world Take the opening chapter for instance where Mr Roths hero Presi dent Trick E Dixon what kind of silly name is that anyway comforts a troubled citizen Tricky you see has recently come out foursquare against the practice of abortion and in favor of the rights of the yet unborn in a statement that is sup posed to resemble something that someone I forget whoactually uttered last April 3d in San Clemente Calif Abortion at Mylai The troubled citizen in this chapter is worried because it has occurred to him that an alleged person called Lieutenant Calley a character in the Roth story I find it ex tremely difficult to give credence to by the way may have committed an abortion by killing a pregnant woman at the Mylai massacre Might not this possibility work to said Calleys disadvantage in the Presi dents review of the lieutenants appeal Could Tricky really he objective in the light of his belief in the right to life of the yet unborn the citizen wonders Trickys answer is that for several rea sons it is most unlikely that a violation of such sanctities of human life could have occurred at the massacre And having once been a lawyer he can make it all per fectly clear To begin with even if such an alleged woman had been pregnant and tried to communicate the fact to Calley the lieutenant would not have realized it because of his inability to understand Viet namese Second if by chance she had been showing Calley probably assumed in the heat of the moment  that she was just stout since considering the way these people go around in pajamas it is not even possible to tell the men from the women let alone the pregnant from the unpregnant And third if in the unlikely event that she had succeeded in presenting herself to Galley as pregnant it would come down to this issue of abortion on demand which  is totally unacceptable to me on the basis of my personal and religious beliefs so that under such circumstances said woman would have been taking extraordi nary risks anyway and perhaps Calley should be cited for bravery for attempting a delicate operation under battlefield condi tions Besides which if in reviewing Calleys appeal Tricky were to discover one shred of evidence that he could not square with his personal belief in the sanctity of human life including the life of the yet unborn he would disqualify himself as a judge and pass the entire matter on to the Vice President All of which struck this reader as com pletely bewildering since according to Mr Roth himself there is no Vice President only a whats his name who keeps pop ping up at sword swallowers conventions spouting alliterative nonsense How could he judge the Calley case on its merits Improving on the Original So it went for this reader throughout Mr Roths fantasy I didnt understand how Tricky intended to implement his ex tension of the franchise to the yet unborn even if he was right that they deserve it for going through the most complex and difficult changes in form and structure  without waving signs for the camera and disrupting traffic and throwing paint and using foul language and dressing In outlandish clothes I was perplexed by the way the FBI had worked out a case against Trickys assassin and pinpointed the murder weapon even before it had figured out who had killed him and how In fact the only thing that really made any sense inside the plot or out was the final chapter where Tricky has gone to hell and is campaigning to be elected devil of all the fallen and leader of all the damned And this part seemed plausible only because Mr Roth has taken actual speeches that someone I forget who once made and substituted words like God of Peace for Communism as in And that is why I say the time has come to stop appeasing the God of Peace Which makes this version of the speech consider ably more plausible than the original It suddenly occurs to me that Mr Roth intended some sort of satire with Our Gang But what leader of the American people can he possibly have had in mind The present one Hasnt Mr Roth ab sorbed the message of Joe McGinnisss The Selling of the President that we are now governed by a package put together out of TV images and publicopinion polls And isnt he confusing the present art of leader ship with an idyllic past when leaders could afford to behave like reasonable men In other and more serious words as funny and malicious as this satire is it doesnt really touch the source of the folly that it is trying to ridicule As Norman Mailer pointed out some time ago there is even a limit to the humor of Nixon jokes
Medicine,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/31/archives/disturbing-hints-of-a-possible-link-to-cancer-estrogens.html,Thirtythree years ago a British biochemist Sir Charles Dodds accidentally discovered diethylstilbestrol manmade chemical that behaved remarkably like the natural female sex hormone estrogen This first synthetic estrongenic drug and others that followed paved the way for a whole new range of therapeutics treatments for menopausal symptoms estrogen deficiency diseases and certain forms of cancer and eventually the development of oral contraceptives None of them would have been possible on widespread scale if doctors had had to rely on a limited costly supply of natural estrogens Today diethylstilbestrolDES for shortis mired in a national controversy over its cancercausing properties the resolution of which might ultimately spell its demise Ironically the controversy is coming to a head at the same time that doctors are proclaiming yet another victory for the drug Left out of the current oral contraceptives DES has now shown remarkable effectiveness as an afterthefact contraceptive or morningafter pill Last week a physician at the University of Michigan Health Service described a study of 1000 women most of them university coeds who had been spared unwanted pregnancies through treatment with DES starting within three days after sexual intercourse Under normal circumstances at least 20 to 40 pregnancies would have occurred Dr Lucile Kirkland Kuchera said in her report in the Journal of the American Medical Association The drug is believed to work by preventing the implantation of the fertilized egg According to Dr Kuchera and Dr John McLean Morris Yale University obstetrician who discovered the morningafter pill DES is being used by many physicians as an emergency contraceptive for women who are inadvertently or unexpectedly exposed to the risk of pregnancy These would inelude rape victims women who act on impluse and those whose partners condoms have broken A few days after Dr Kucheras report two environmental organizations filed suit in Federal District Court in Washington D C to stop the feeding of DES to beef cattle and sheep Their charge Residues of the chemical which is routinely used to speed the fattening of animals had been found in meat sold to consumers And last Friday the Food and Drug Administration indicated it would order changes in the labeling of DES and related estrogens Behind both actions was concern over the chemicals carcinogenic potential That DES can cause cancer in animals was first demonstrated in the late 1950s According to Dr Samuel Epstein professor of environmental medicine at Case Western Reserve University the chemical has been shown to produce cancer in a wide range of animals including rats hamsters and guinea pigs According to the two environmental organizations the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund mice get cancer when as little as 625 parts per billion of DES is included in their diet By law no residues of the chemical are permitted in meat sold to consumers But the environmental groups say that among 10 randomly selected animals tested by the Department of Agriculture this month DES residues up to 154 parts per billion were found in cattle and residues as high as 369 parts per billion were found in sheep Routine department tests have indicated that residues above 2 parts per billion exist in two out of 500 animals slated for the market Last February the Government began criminal prosecutions of farmers who shipped livestock containing DES residues And this month the Agriculture Department ordered farmers to stop feeding DES to animals at least seven days before slaughter in an effort to prevent residues in meat The House Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations is scheduled to begin hearings next month on DES residues in food DES has been prescribed for the treatment of a variety of human ailments for 30 years with no apparent cancerous effect It has actually been used to treat prostate cancer and advanced breast cancer in women past menopause But recently three Boston Physicians uncovered an unusual link between DES and cancer in humans The doctors reported last April that seven young women most still in their teens had developed an extremely rare kind of canceradenocarcinoma of the vagina The physicians traced the apparent cause of the cancer to DES which the mothers of the young women had taken during pregnancy In the 1940s and early 1950s DES was used frequently in some parts of the country in an effort to prevent threatened miscarriage Subsequent to the Boston report the New York State Health Department found five more such cases In one instead of DES a similar estrogenlike hormone dienestrol was used Nearly 50 additional cases have since come to light New York States health commissioner Dr Hollis S Ingraham was so alarmed by the findings that last June he issued warnings to doctors throughout New York State and urged the Food and Drug Administration to warn all of the nations doctors about further use of synthetic estrogens during pregnancy and to tell them to be on the lookoutfor cases of vaginal cancer in young women The FDA has not taken any action to date but last Friday a spokesman said the agency was changing the labeling for DES and related estrogens to say that they should not be used during pregnancy Although the formulation of DES produced by Eli Lilly  Co comes with a warning against its use in pregnant women without the careful weighing of benefits and risks none of the other synthetic estrogens marketed currently bear such a cautionary statement And one of the drugs dienestrol made by Schering Corporation under the trade name Synestrol lists as one of its uses the treatment and prevention of habitual abortionie repeated miscarriage Dr Morris explained that he and others use DES mainly because it is commercially available in tablet form at the dosage level required for this purpose Other estrogens would probably work just as well but they would require FDA approval before we could use them clinically Dr Morris remarked He added that even if DES can cause cancer in the fetus and even if the drug given as a morningafter pill should fail to prevent pregnancy it would be taken so early in gestation that the chances of affecting the fetus are nil It is generally believed that to affect the vaginal development in female fetus the drug would have to be taken between the eighth and tenth weeks of pregnancy The future of DES remains uncertain But medical authorities are convinced of the need for close surveillance of girls whose mothers received estrogenic drugs during pregnancy The most common symptom of vaginal cancerabnormal vaginal bleedingis easily dismissed as normal in adolescent girls they warn

Falling Birth Rate,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/03/archives/falling-birth-rate.html,Is the muchpredicted and oftlamented baby boom of the 1970s turning into a baby bust It is still too early for a final answer but some provocative and unexpected data on this subject have been emerging in recent months The Census Bureau for example recently reported that for the fifth month in a row July saw a decline in the national birth rate for the first seven months of 1971 the total number of births in this country was 2 per cent below the comparable 1970 figure And this is hap pening when the number of persons in the age brackets most likely to produce children is increasing rapidly It may be of course that the decline is simply a temporary phenomenon The demographers who take this view attribute the slump in births to the current reces sion and argue that once the economic curve swings upward again the curve of births will follow suit No doubt the recession is one factor at work but equally clearly there are other less temporary forces involved as well The increasing availability of contracep tive devices and federally supported family planning services cannot be ignored nor can the spread of abortion services in New York and some other states Perhaps most fundamental is the growing consensus that a new population explosion would be a human and ecological disaster a view that many young people are translating into personal determination to limit the size of their own families The decline in the birth rate so far is too small to contribute seriously to the goal of zero population growth but it could signal new public attitudes that may make that objective less of a fantasy than many have considered it Uncertainties about the reason for the downturn and its implications emphasize the need for more research Indeed this encouraging but limited trend toward population stabilization should spur the Nixon Administration to move more boldly in utilizing all of the funds authorized by Congress in the landmark Family Planning Services and Population Research Act of 1970

U.S. Population Growth Rate Declines,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/05/archives/us-population-growth-rate-declines-three-studies-find-that-the-rate.html,WASHINGTON Nov 4  At a time of wide concern that the population is growing too fast three important new reports showed today that the rate of the nations population growth is turning rapidly and dramatically downward In addition to an abrupt but shortterm plunge in total births the new reports gave strong evidence of longerrange reductions in birth rates If such reduced rates persist they will result in a population as much as 30 million smaller than the 300 million widely predicted for the year 2000 The population is now 207 million The three reports are the 1970 National Fertility Study a survey by the Census Bureau and a compilation by the National Center for Health Statistics Some authorities have already begun to talk or a birth dearth and a baby bust But several leading population experts warned today that the possibility of a population bomb still remained They cited historical swings to show that the trend could turn up as fast as the current trend was turning down The three new reports disclosed the following findings There is a rapid and sharp drop in the number of children women intend to have according to the 1970 National Fertility Study preliminary results of which were obtained today Women in their late twenties who married in their early twenties for example now expact to have an average of 253 children Demographers regard this as a startling drop from the 1965 figure of 303 This change alone involving only married women would mean notably slower population growth At the same time there is a striking increase in the number of young women who stay single according to a Census Bureau survey report issued today In 1960 about a third of women aged 21 were single Now almost half are single Thus not only do married women expect to have fewer children but there are fewer of them to have children Total births in August fell below the total for August 1970 according to a new compilation by the National Center for Health Statistics The monthly decline was the fifth in a row and the steepest since 1947 Most experts discounted this plunge mainly as an inevitable shortterm result of the recession But in July and August the number of births dropped so low that the resulting fertility rate now grazes the significant figure of 211 This is the number of children for each woman that would in 70 years produce zero population growth For July and August the figure was about 22 the lowest since Middepression years when it was about the same In the first eight months of 1971 there were 2356000 births a drop of 3 per cent from last year This drop is the more notable because the number of women of childbearing age has in the same period increased about 3 per cent It had been widely throught chat the national growth rate would now increase slightly as girls who were part of the postwar baby boom became young mothers That boom peaked in 1957 with a fertility rate of 38 children the highest since 1917 when the statistic was first compiled Between 1957 and 1968 the rate dropped gradually to about 25 in 1968 A slight upward turn was recorded in 1970 The new reports are a strong indication however that the echo effect of the baby boom a secondgeneration baby boomis not occurring It may be that it has just been postponed demographers said today as women decide to have children later But even postponement would mean a slower growth rate particularly if women chose at older ages to have fewer children Even small differences in the fertility rate can have dramatic effects in a short time A rate of 31considerably less than the rate in 1957would mean a population of 321 million in the year 2000 A rate of 21 would mean 266 million Population experts suggest a variety of explanations for the new downward shift To varying degrees they cite the economy legalized abortion oral contraception more working women concern over population pressure on the environment and the marriage squeeze This last is a shortterm phenomenon now evident As young women born during the baby boom come of marriage age they find a shortage of older men part of a generation born in the lowbirth depression years Basically however demographers express modesty about their explanations There are all kinds of theories said George H Brown director of the Census Bureau hut intelligent people should recognize that these rates have changed  and can change again  for reasons not well known to us The changes have affected all income groups and education levels There are deeper factors at work here even than income and education And the lesson is not to get carried away in either direction Paul R Ehrlich a Stanford biologist and author of the bestselling The Population Bomb took a similar view today It would be nice for me to be able to say that our propaganda is paying off but that would he reckless he said These reports are extremely encouraging But what has come down quickly can go up quickly In the opinion of another noted demographer Philip M Hauser of the University of Chicago there is still a bomb there Basic changes in reproductive behavior must be measured in generations not years he said A distinction must be made he said between shortterm changes like the economy and longterm changes History documents that people defer having children until good times he said The oldest war babies still have 11 years of reproductive life left Professor Hauser observed The youngest ones have their entire reproductive life ahead of them They havent been heard from at all yet A somewhat different position is expressed by Ben J Wattenberg a Washington business consultant and student of demography He is the author of a new study The Birth Dearth and What It Means now being circulated by Family Circle magazine Granted that a slower growth rate is not a hundred per cent certainty still for anyone involved in business or institutional planning it is far safer to prepare for slower growth he said This is what the trends show and we ignore them at our peril In his study he predicts that smaller family size and increasing affluence will mean even higher discretionary income The impact on business he said today will be enormous Mr Wattenberg acknowledges however that the new era of low fertility may conceivably prove to be only shortterni aberration a demographic willothewisp That possibility is emphasized by Robert Parke Jr deputy director of the Federal Commission on Population Growth and the American Future There are great dangers in trying to read too much into shortterm trends he said The new National Fertility Study was directed by Charles F Westoff who is also director of the Population Commission and Norman B Ryder a Princeton demographer The preliminary results showed that women aged 20 to 24 who were married before 20 now expect to have 265 children In 1965 their counterparts expected to have 311 These are the prime childbearing years and the new figures Mr Ryder said represent a decrease of 16 per cent While these figures wiggle around a bit over time and while women do give moderately unreliable answers he pontinued these are really very considerable changes  about 3 per cent per annum The growth rate of the population averaged only 13 per cent a year during the sixties Adding the newly reported increase in young single women to recent birth expectation findings might mean we are approaching the replacement level of 211 according to Herman P Miller chief of population studies at the Census Bureau But whether it will stick is another question he said The new Census report like the National Fertility Study is based on a random sample ational survey The findings the report said mean that people are postponing marriage until they are older But they may also demonstrate a newly developing tendency for more of the young persons of today to remain single for their entire lives It will take several years of study to tell which it is the repbrt said It may even be that this is a cyclical phenomenon which will eventually alternate with younger marriage patterns later The report showed that 45 per cent of women under 35 are now single This compares with less than 38 per cent in 1960 The most striking change occurred among women aged 20 and 21 the most marriageable ages for women The median age at marriage for women is 208 years At age 20 the proportion that are single rose between 1960 and 1971 from 46 to 58 per cent At age 21 the change was from less than 35 per cent to almost 47 per cent The new Census report Marital Status and Living Arrangements March 1971 P20 No 225 is

The venereal disease pandemic,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/07/archives/the-venereal-disease-pandemic-v-d-pandemic-cont-most-doctors-says.html,LOS ANGELES THE Los Angeles Free Clinic is a small rather shabby building wedged between a Chicken Delight We Deliver and an appliance store Quality Merchandise  Best Service across Fairfax Avenue from the West Coast headquarters of CBS At about 530 the young people start crowding into a narrow alley alongside the clinic waiting to sign in for treatment They include wellscrubbed college students and scruffy street kids both sexes all colors as young as 15 and as old as 35 Despite their diversity they have two things in common They need medical help and they cant or wont get it elsewhere Many just cannot afford a private doctor others cannot afford to have their parents find out whats wrong with them Whats wrong with them could be almost anythingpregnancy hepatitis various infections and fears tired blood and tired brains maybe just the flu or a bad cold but more than 25 per cent have VD venereal disease What passes for interior decoration at the Free Clinic is a bright mixture of the psychedelic and the scientific One poster shows two bodies whirling in a sea of purple another gives the symptoms for VD and advises women If a guy you balled has it come for treatment If not treated germs will spread up causing great pain and inability to have kids One night recently two boys and a girl from a local high school were exchanging typical teenage chatter I had him for chemistry I used to go to a lot of dances at    in a corner of the cramped waiting room The girl who wore her name on a gold chain around her neck wanted birthcontrol pills She was getting anxious about the time for she did not want her parents to start wondering where she was Have you ever tried being honest with them gibed one of the boys Yes she answeredr a little grimly it doesnt work The second fellow was tall curlyhaired radiating what used to be called boyish charm Had he ever had VD Im in the process Had he been concerned about getting it No I never really thought about it I got it and Ill take care of it Its a big pain but Ill make sure it doesnt go too far Was he surprised This thing shocked me he admitted I knew the people I was with pretty well and I didnt think they had it I really cant figure out who I got it from I guess I had a bad stereotype of the person who has VDthats why I was shocked I thought the only one who got it was a girl or a guy who balled an awful Pot without any real feeling about itsomeone who didnt take care of his body I guess if I can get it anybody can That is hardly overstating the case Anybody can get VD and more and more people are getting it The United States is in the midst of a monstrous epidemic Within the last year according to the American Social Health Association a private organization that studies such matters there has been a VD pandemic an epidemic of unusual extent and severity The association says VD has reached such proportions only twice before in the last 53 years after World War 1 and toward the end of World War II before penicillin came into wide use Robert R Lugar an adviser to the Los Angeles County Health Department described the situation this way If you pose the question Where is VD the answer is Everywhere My God if theres anything in this world today we cant stop its VD Its no more possible to restrict the spread of venereal disease than it Is to keep the flies in one room of your house THE phrase venereal disease comes from Venus the goddess of love and refers to maladies that are virtually always transmitted by sexual contact Some infections such as vaginitis can be caught in a variety of ways including sexual intercourse but they are not included here Of at least five known types of VD only two gonorrhea and syphilis are important Gonorrhea commonly known as the clap is milder but much more prevalent In the fiscal year ending last June 624000 cases of gonorrhea were reported nationwide a jump of 9 per cent over the previous year and 130 per cent over 1963 There were 23500 reported cases of syphilis last year an increase of 156 per cent over the previous year These figures indicate that reported cases of gonorrhea outnumber those of all other communicable diseases combined Between June 1969 and June 1970 for example California reported about 105000 cases of gonorrhea In the same period it had only about 10000 cases of hepatitis 6000 of mumps and 4000 of tuberculosis A random sampling of 164000 women revealed that 1 in 10 had gonorrhea though most of those infected did not know they were ill But such statistics represent merely the tip of the iceberg About four cases are treated for every one reported to publichealth authorities and other victims simply do not seek treatment The estimates are that about four million Americans contracted venereal disease last year and at least 500000 people have undiagnosed cases of syphilis DOES it matter Publichealth officials say yes Most cases of VD do not cause longterm complications But if 10 to 12 per cent do as the American Social Health Association estimates that is still a lot of people When it goes untreated syphilis can cause insanity paralysis blindness heart disease sterility and death The National Communicable Disease Center in Atlanta reports that 9000 patients were hospitalized with syphilitic insanity in 1968 at cost to the taxpayers of 41million Unchecked gonorrhea causes more sterility in both sexes than any other disease and also produces a painful form of arthritis In women it can lead to such problems as pelvic infection and tubular pregnancy which occurs when the Fallopian tubes are blocked by scar tissue and the fertilized egg cannot reach the uterus In men untreated gonorrhea or repeated cases even if theyre cured can scar the urethra making urination painful and difficult Venereal disease although it is concentrated in larger cities and industrial states is a national problem Alaska and Georgia have the highest rates of gonorrhea California is third just ahead of Illinois and makes a good case study California agencies particularly the Los Angeles County Health Department have made special efforts to control the diseases and their experiences tell lot about the problems involved It should be stressed however that VD is not just another kooky California phenomenon The city with the highest VD rate is San Francisco but the top 10 include Atlanta Washington DC Newark Cleveland and Chicago About half the cases of gonorrhea nationally and almost 70 per cent in California occur in people under 25 Los Angeles officials estimate that 1 in every 10 of the citys teenagers will get VD this year and 1 In 5 will have had it by the time they leave high school If present trends continue half of Los Angeless high school graduates in 1980 will have had VD The Free Clinic is a good place to find these youngsters for there they will talk openly about a disease that often causes as much embarrassment as pain One clinic patient was Bushy an 18yearold runaway from Kansas City and the proud possessor of his third case of gonorrhea Im one of the experts he declared I get it about once a year its one of the chances you have to take these days Jeff 24 was suffering his first case since coming back from Vietnam five years ago and he was angry Ive been pretty careful I thought I was smart I try to trust my judgment on who I bed down with but sometimes it doesnt work out I guess Im mad mainly at myself though Whoever I play around with I expect to be playing around tooIm one of the boys like shes one of the girls This is the first time in five years I guess thats bad Carol squeezed onto a crowded couch trying to read a magazine She was 22 very petty and a little uneasy Things havent been normal so Im playing it safe she said Im not really worried though Ive always been going with one guy Suppose the guy had gotten it somewhere else and given it to her I never thought about that one she said THE cause and the cures of the VD epidemic are varied and complex They involve behavior patterns scientific problems andprobably most importantpublic attitudes For even now despite our selfproclaimed and well ublicized liberation in sexual matters venereal disease remains clouded in myth and taboo Dr Theodor Rosebury n his new book Microbes and Morals put it this way VD is shameful   Nice People dont talk about the whole subject or if they do it is with mincing and blushing or with a phony solicitude under which fingershaking is more plainly visible than the Nice People can imagine Or as the Los Angeles Health Department said in a recent publication One of the reasons for the continued existence of gonorrhea and syphilis is the widespread belief that decent people dont acuire the disease decent people dont talk about the disease and decent people shouldnt do anything about those who do become inected Syphilis and gonorrhea present somewhat different probems but both are apparently being spread by the sexual evolution Some researchers do not think anything more s happening now than 30 nears ago but most doctors who treat VD feel that increased sexual activity particularly indiscriminate activity contributes to the epidemic One of the favorite examples among VD people is the San Francisco man who recently contracted gonorrhea after a brief liaison with a stewardess in the bathroom of a jetliner 30000 feet above Kansas Dr Geoffrey Simmons who works in several VD clinics also cites the new morality I think it exists and I think it is significant Girls are coming and getting birthcontrol pills who are 14 15 16 years old These girls arent aking them for menstrual cramps theyre taking them o balland they admit it reely When I went to high school which was not that ong ago talk about sex was ot that common Most fenales I went to high school with unless I was sheltered idnt engage for fear of regnancy But when you have he pill youre not afraid of ecoming pregnant The fact hat you can get an abortion ow adds on to this new morality Its quite open its just like eating a meal to them They want to screw they want to have fun Theyre upset when they have VD not so much because they have VD but because they have to abstain for two or four weeks Sex is probably most indiscriminate among homosexuals and about 40 per cent of the new syphilis cases come from homosexual encounters the gonorrhea figure is much lower Treatment is still hampered by the reluctance of some homosexuals to name their contacts and many doctors just do not remember to check for infection of the anus a common homosexual malady But partly as a result of educational campaigns by homosexual groups more are seeking help One of the patients at the Free Clinic was a male hustler named Gerry who shrugged off his infection as an occupational hazard The birthcontrol pill is a major cause of the epidemic for in addition to ending the fear of pregnancy it replaces that traditional if inconvenient means of contraception the condom or rubber Condoms were originally designed to prevent VD and remain the most effective prophylactic method90 per cent sure against syphilis close to 100 per cent against gonorrhea Moreover many doctors believe that the pill actually changes the chemical milieu of the vaginal area from acidic which tends to kill germs to alkaline which does not According to one estimate about 20 to 30 per cent of the women who are exposed to gonorrhea and are not on the pill actually catch it Among women who take the pill and are exposed to the disease the infection rate is over 90 per cent WHEN you talk about scientific and technical causes there are important differences between syphilis and gonorrhea Syphilis is carried by tiny organisms called spirochetes and is virtually always transmitted by sexual contact The old canard about toilet seats and door handles is a convenient but untenable excuse The disease first appears as a lesion or sore where the spirochete entered the body This is usually in the genital area but could also be around the mouth for example The lesion is painless appears between 10 and 90 days after infection and goes away without treatment Two to six months later the second stage appears in the form of a rash sores falling hair or fever These signs too disappear without treatment But years later the spirochetes can invade and destroy vital organs causing severe disability or death Thus it is quite possible to have syphilis and not know it which is one reason why there are a halfmillion undiagnosed cases This silent character of the disease is a major obstacle in controlling it Fortunately there is an accurate blood test for syphilis and many cases are detected that way In addition since the disease has such a long incubation period publichealth authorities are able to use the casefinding method of controltracing all known sexual partners of an infected person and getting them treated before they spread the disease to others Gonorrhea which is caused by the gonococcus germ is also transmitted by sexual contact but there the similarities end In the male the symptoms are usually obvious a burning pain when urinat ing and a discharge of pus But 10 per cent of the males and 80 per cent of the females who get gonorrhea have no visible symptoms As a result there is a huge reservoir of infected women an estimated 60000 in Los Angeles County alone who spread the disease without knowing it If you could sum up our problem in one word it would be female said Robert Lugar How great that reservoir is is only now beginning to come to light Moreover there is no screening process comparable to the blood test for syphilis Taking a vaginal smear and growing a culture from it is timeconsuming expensive and only about 60 to 80 per cent accurate Even if you could detect gonorrhea easily the incubation period is so shortabout three daysthat the casefinding method is all but useless Tracing gonorrhea lamented one doctor is like trying to trace the cold If that isnt enough some strains of VD are developing considerable resistance to the drugs usually used for treatment particularly penicillin The dosage given today is 48 times what doctors prescribed 20 years ago and a certain number of cases still defy normal treatment The resistance problem seems to be aggravated by the importation of new and hardier strains from Southeast Asia Indeed VD must rank close to heroin addiction on Vietnams list of exports There is a debate raging over the proper treatment of VD Some physicians including Dr Walter Smartt head of VD control in Los Angeles County have abandoned penicillin which is injected in favor of orally administered drugs particularly tetracyclines Dr Smartt contends that he gets a 10 per cent higher cure rate with Vibramycine the drug used in Los Angeles But the United States Public Health Service still maintains that penicillin is the drug of choice In fact Dr Robert J Brown until recently chief of the VD branch of the Center for Disease Control blames the oral drugs for contributing to the epidemic Practicing physicians insists Dr Brown are not giving adequate amounts of antibiotics to cure the disease and are not properly informed as to the best method of managing gonorrhea With oral drugs the level of patient error is highpatients lose pills forget to take them give them to friends They think they the infection spreads The real point is that even the professionals do not agree Not enough is known about the diseases to resolve the squabbles and no one is willing to spend money to find out THIS raises the question of public attitudes There is still a widespread belief that VD is caused by sex itself not by an organism and that anybody who contracts it gets what he deserves Most physicians agree that we could solve the syphilis problem if we really wanted to but apparently we dont really want to Syphilis was a scourge until penicillin was discovered The rates dropped swiftly after that and in the midfifties health authorities relaxed thinking the disease was headed for extinction But the rates jumped again as soon as control efforts eased In 1962 after the Surgeon General called attention to the renewed problem the Federal Government put about 7million a year into syphilis control most of it to pay case finders In the last two years Federal funds have held steady and dropped in some cases in a time of inflation this has produced havoc At the peak Washington was financing more than 600 case finders today it pays only about 450 A few years ago health authorities were tracking down 98 per cent of the syphilis cases today they can reach only about 50 per cent Thus after a steady decline syphilis rates leaped 8 per cent in fiscal 1970 and 156 per cent last year Scott Winders a drugcompany executive who heads the California VD Task Force spoke for many when he said Weve had a copout by the Federal Government and frankly if they dont get off the dime were going to have syphilis in epidemic proportions The states are no better Each one gets a block Federal grant for health services and few rank VD higher than hangnails in setting their priorities VD is just not a popular disease it never has been explained Dr Warren A Ketterer head of VD control for California A tremendous number of people moralize about it They think that if you stop sex youll stop VD Thats true but you never think of stopping TB by stopping breathing We could have controlled VD 50 years ago if we tried But we never had a President with VD who said Lets go on a VD campaign Its not an honor to what it costs society If they realized it cost 1billion a year to treat VD they might do something When it comes to setting health priorities VD just cannot compete with cancer say or heart disease In most cases that are diagnosed cure is relatively simple and fatalities are rare though doctors love to speculate on how many heart failures are really syphilis Yet as one doctor said It is the only disease I know of where we have a known cure and yet still have an increasing incidence Government money is not the only victim of public ignorance and indifference There is also education Only twothirds of the nations schools teach anything at all about VD and much of the information they dispense is incomplete or inaccurate The subject makes parents and educators so nervous that many textbook publishers just omit it from standard health texts though the rate ofinfection is rising faster in the 15to19yearold group than in any other CALIFORNIA is probably the best example of timidity triumphant Two years ago the Legislature passed a bill sponsored by John Schmitz a member of the John Birch Society and now a Congressman The bill declared that before a school could offer a course on sex education parents had to be notified and given a chance to withdraw their children from the class The procedure was so costly and confused that many schools dropped the whole thing Despite the pleas of health authorities that VD should be discussed under disease not sex school officials were running scared according to Mrs Mabel S Rickett a specialist in VD education Teachers now feel they cant talk about sexual organs and therefore they cant talk about VD Everyones afraid the kids will ask embarrassing questions or the teachers will be quoted out of context Mrs Rickett explained In schools that do offer sex education only about 2 per cent of the parents take their kids out of class but that small minority wields enorm ous power This year the Legislature passed a bill that clarified the distinction between sex education and VD education so schools would feel free to talk about the disease But Governor Reagan bowing to conservative pressures vetoed the bill The subject is so sensitive that even in schools where VD is discussed in health classes instructors are not allowed to talk about prevention The same is true in county health clinics Some parents are petrified that if their kids know how to prevent VD they will have one less reason to avoid sex Statistics indicate however that Junior is having plenty of sex even without adequate information and conversations at the Free Clinic suggest that if youngsters know something about VD they tend to be more selective in choosing sex partners not less Even Bushy the 18yearold runaway said If someones really funky Im not going to chance it But reason often crumbles in the face of righteous indignation fear and confusion It is not easy being a parent at a time when 15yearold girls are chunking down birthcontrol pills like OneaDay Vitamins And if the reaction to VD in some quarters is indignation among doctors in private practice it is disinterest Dr Smartt describes the attitude this way The medical profession sees VQ as no problem The private physician feels that since he has good treatment this disease has been eliminated You schedule a meeting on VD for private physicians they wont come They figure I know how to treat that disease what do I want to go listen to that nut in the Health Department for Private medicine isnt interested it couldnt care less it doesnt give a damn A lot of the people who get VD dont give a damn either At the Free Clinic Dr Michael Talbot who is not much older than some of his patients said There are people who we find have had the disease many times People arent afraid of it anymore its like a cold Its not that serious it can be treated They view it as a part of living a part of growing up Its terrifying said one clinic nurse to realize that we see the more intelligent ones we dont know whats out on the street Bushy one of the intelligent ones says Nobody really sweats it Just about everybody I know has had it its a big joke with us Tom 29 was at the Free Clinic with his girl friend Susan If you know what to do about it you dont worry like anything else he said You just go get it fixed Susan a gentle eirl of 22 wasnt worried either Truthfully she said I wouldnt ball anybody I didnt know was clean I dont ball anybody but him and my friends But since even friends sometimes dont know they have VD the waiting room was full of people who were confident they could never catch it GIVEN these attitudes can anything be done to control VD If the money were available researchers could probably find a cheap and easy screening test for gonorrhea some progress in fact has already been made Better drugs could be produced that dont build up resistance in the VD organisms Doctors could learn more about why some patients suffer longterm complications and others dont More case finders could be hired But as everyone in the field agrees you dont treat a disease out of existence Walter Smartt fumes All were doing is treating treating treating and we cannot get rid of the epidemic that way If this epidemic is ever reduced itll be because somebody has guts enough to do what we did for pregnancy In other words the answer is prevention There are ways to prevent VD now The best of course is abstinence but that is hardly a likely possibility Washing before and after intercourse and urinating as soon as possible both help kill the germs Then there are prophylactic devices A vaginal gel called Progonasyl has been around for years but never fully tested A group of prostitutes in Nevada are trying the substance now as part of a study by the State Bureau of Preventive Medicine The pro kit used by the armed forces during World War IIa device used to inject a disinfectant is probably too annoying and inconvenient Some doctors place their hope in the condom but others think that is unrealistic Mr Lugar the health adviser here insisted Its been demonstrated over and over again that the pro miscuous individual will not use a condom When it comes to such a mechanical approach sex just loses its flavor Out of dozens of youngsters we interviewed not more than one or two would consider using a prophylactic It kind of takes the fun out of it said Bushy Its a little awkward at times you know Awkward and these days insulting If a girl is on the pill the only reason to use a condom is to prevent VD and some people are likely to resent the implication no matter which partner makes the suggestion Two possibilities remain One is a vaccine The scientific and financial obstacles are enormous but Dr James N Miller of the University of California at Los Angeles a leading researcher in the field predicts a syphilis vaccine within five years A gonorrhea vaccine on the other hand seems almost impossible at this point And of course if people wont allow their kids to read about VD will they allow them to be inoculated against it The other possibility is a pill taken regularly to suppress infection In a recent study Dr Smartt gave a group of highly promiscuous individuals Vibramycine pills In more than 5000 sexual contacts he reports only two cases of VD were contracted The procedure is expensive and dangerous however Some people are allergic to antibiotics and widespread use of any drug would cause a certain number of adverse reactions Moreover no one knows what the regular ingestion of antibiotics would do to the bodys normal defense system against disease The outlook then is not very promising particularly for gonorrhea There is not enough public support for treatment research or education Though we spend 41million a year just to care for syphilitic insanity and the total cost of VD from absenteeism lost income and the like might reach 1billion annually according to one estimate the total Federal outlay comes to less than 10million The cost in human suffering is also rising more sterility more blindness more babies born deformed from congenital syphilis One thing is certain VD will continue to spread as long as it is considered dirty and shameful something nice people dont talk about a just punishment instead of a crippling disease

hard to classify as Norman Mailer His first book Goodbye Columbus fitfully brilliant collection of short stories on JewishAmerican themes won the 1960 National Book Award Was he the new Bellow His next Letting Go 1962 was a regression to conventional JewishAmerican fiction turgid with angst and alienation The new Malamud Five years later he published When She Was Good a psychological dissection of a sick gentile heroine in the context of a sick gentile society done with 19thcentury amplitude It didnt work Is a new Flaubert or Eliot George possible Then after a decade of false starts he found his true voice  like an actor who discovers his limitations and so his possibilities  with Portnoys Complaint 1969 which didnt win the National Book Award Portnoy was the Jewish novel to end all Jewish novels which it unfortunately hasnt a ribald frenetic Bronx cheer to the whole schtick all the more effectively disturbing because it was delivered with love and even a kind of nostalgic reverence It was important to Roth personally  killing not the father but the momma But its importance to him as a writer was greater he discovered his congenial mode satire and his natural style the vernacular which he used with an unerring ear to get humorous effects that are most serious when they are funniest Dwight MacDonald edited ParodiesAn Anthology and is the author most recently of Politics Past and Present Our Gang is a political satire that I found farfetched unfair tasteless disturbing logical coarse and very funny  I laughed out loud 16 times and giggled internally a statistically unverifiable amount In short a masterpiece The most fantastic assumptions  fantasies we alas read daily in the papers and see nightly on TV  are worked out with the lunatic logic of Swifts A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland From Being a Burden to Their Parents and Country ie by fattening them for consumption as English breakfast bacon How unfair can you get Our Gang is a strong second And as an inveterate American Im delighted by the way Roths most extreme satirical flights  like those of Mark Twain Ring Lardner and Nathaniel West  take off from a sound base of volkische knowledge our lingo and the national character it expresses seems to alarm him as much as it did them and does me It all began with an appalling statement by our President last April which I must admit I hadnt noticed  so much competition Speaking ex cathedra from San Clemente Mr Nixon issued a bull that with Mr Roths patient and tireless assistance now appears more Irish than Papal It is printed in caps at the beginning of Our Gang FROM PERSONAL AND RELIGIOUS BELIEFS I CONSIDER ABORTIONS AN UNACCEPTABLE FORM OF POPULATION CONTROL FURTHERMORE UNRESTRICTED ABORTION POLICIES OR ABORTION ON DEMAND I CANNOT SQUARE WITH MY PERSONAL BELIEF IN THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFEINCLUDING THE LIFE OF THE YET UNBORN FOR SURELY THE UNBORN HAVE RIGHTS ALSO RECOGNIZED IN LAW RECOGNIZED EVEN IN PRINCIPLES EXPOUNDED BY THE UNITED NATIONS A mouse surely compared to the Presidents daily elephants nothing worth squashing under a mountain of satire Especially since President Nixon was meeting a clear and present danger he had just discovered that Under liberalized military procedures the wives of servicemen were able to obtain abortions more easily than they would have under state regulations He put a stop to that instantly  hes the Commander in Chief after all  and if he only hadnt felt obliged to rig up a philosophical base for his ukase Our Gang wouldnt have been written Eisenhower would never have been so gauche nor his Republican predecessors in the twenties but Nixon is more in the recent Presidentially articulate style usually practiced by the Democrats Also as Roths President complains to his Cabinet when the Boy Scouts gather for a protest march on Washington with placards reading TRICK E DIXON FAVORS SEXUAL INTERCOURSE What did I say Lets look at the record I said nothing Absolutely nothing I came out for the rights of the unborn I mean if ever there was a line of hokum that was it Sheer humbug And as if it wasnt clear enough what I was up to I even tacked on as recognized in principles expounded by the United Nations One really feels for the President The punishment seems excessive considering his more serious crimes But this was a crime against language and Roth is a writer I might add that the sanctity of human life foetal division bull shared the front page with the Presidents intervention to ease Lieutenant Calleys punishment after his fellowofficers had convicted him of killing Vietnamese civilians adult division And so there came that moment in a writers life when the lemons and oranges and bells all click into place and the satirical jackpot is ready and Roth began to nurture from his little acorn an extravaganza of imposing dimensions and intricately branched consistency Our Gang begins with Tricky reassuring a citizen who is troubled lest Calley may have killed a pregnant woman either inadvertently he assumed she was simply overweight Tricky suggests or advertently On the latter option Tricky hypothesizes This woman presented herself to Lieutenant Calley for abortion with some kind of note say that somebody had written for her in English and Lieutenant Calley lets say in the heat and pressure of the moment performed the abortion during the course of which the woman died Such a case would be abortion on demand and Tricky admits he would be prejudiced I will disqualify myself as a judge and pass the entire matter on to the Vice President I think we can all sleep better at night knowing that the citizen The last chapter Tricky in Hell takes place after his assassination a baffling one because there are many groups with motivesthe Boy Scouts the Danes for reasons too intricate but logical to go into here  and too many suspects tens of thousands of them in fact converging on Washington each with his or her confession claiming credit with documentation and insisting on being arrested by the overworked police force Tricky is running against Satan for the Presidency of Hell My fellow fallen Let me say at the outset that of course I agree with much of what Satan has said in his opening statement I know that Satan feels as deeply as I do about what has to be done to make Wickedness all that it can be and should be in the creation  And now let me say a word to those who point to my own record as President of the United States and contend that it is less than it could have been as regards suffering and anguish for all of the people regardless of race creed or color Let me remind these critics that I happen to have held that high office for less than one term before I was assassinated Despite my brief tenure in the White House  I think I can safely say that I was able to lay the groundwork for new oppressions and injustices and to sow the seeds of bitterness and hatred between the races the generations and the social classes that hopefully will plague the American people for years to come I think I might point with particular pride to Southeast Asia His clincher is the Book of Job This document I am holding in my claw is the Holy Scripture It doesnt lie That is why it is nothing less than the Bible of our enemies He quotes the secret conversation between God and Satan in Job which does in fact show Satan as Gods stoolie provacateur And did Satan spare Jobs life as God instructed him to I am afraid the answer is yes he did that too We all remember I am sure that unhappy ending to that story Jobs faith was not broken And the Lord as the record here states gave Job twice as much he had before In between these termini Roth has constructed a complete mininovel coherent in its plot line and full of recogniz able characters whose speech mannerisms are expertly paro died As his epigraphs from Swift and Orwell suggest his theme is the abuse of words Erect Severehead the Rev Billy Cupcake and the members of Trick E Dixons Cabinet are especially memorable abusers Each jigsaw piece is fitted with esthetic precision or lunatic if you prefer and do lets quarrel over words into the ingenious and sustained narrative structure I cant think of anything like it Of course its all very exaggerated one  sided fantastic etc Common sense tells us that But common sense is as often wrong In the week I was writing tins review a Nixons own nutrition expert Dr Jean Mayer of Harvard called his proposal to cut a million and a half needy children from the Federally subsidized school lunch program meanspirited and the House and Senate restored the cuts with no dissenting votes b Will R Wilson the chief enforcer of Federal criminal laws resigned saying he sought to spare embarrassment to the Nixon Administration because of his association with a Texas stock manipulator c Harold Goldstein the economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics who dealt with monthly unemployment figures was relieved of this job because he had called last months figures mixed while his boss had thought them heartening d Asked at a press conference whether he was planning to end at least the American ground combat involvement in Vietnam by the time he goes to Moscow in May 1972 the President replied The American presence in Vietnam in terms of ground combat forces and air power will be maintained to meet the objectives that I have often times spelled outincluding the return of our POWs and the ability of the South Vietnamese to take over the responsibility themselves Next question Swifts peculiarity wrote Leslie Stephen is in the curious sobriety of fancy which leads him to keep in his most daring flights upon the confines of the possible I think this might be said of Philip Roths satire also Or as his peer Jules Feiffer put it recently in a Playboy interview Thats all satire is  creating a logical argument that followed to its end is absurd Satire concerns itself with logically extending a premise to its totally insane conclusion thus forcing onto an audience certain unwelcome awarenesses
F.D.A. Warns on Hormone in Pregnancy,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/10/archives/fda-warns-on-hormone-in-pregnancy.html,WASHINGTON Nov 9The Food and Drug Administration proposed today labeling changes that would warn doctors not to prescribe the synthetic hormone diethylstilbesterol for pregnant women A spokesman for the agency said it was also planning a study to assess the effects of this drug on the daughters of women who took it during pregnancy Reports in the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year cited cases in which the daughters of some women who had taken the hormone developed a rare type of cancer of the reproductive tract At least 60 such cases are known Those reports were a major factor in the agencys decision to make pregnancy a contraindication for use of that and closely related hormones said Dr John Jennings Associate Commissioner for Medical Affairs We have long felt that extreme caution should be exercised in the use of drugs of this sort in pregnancy he said in answer to a question on the proposed labeling requirements He said that there had already been some cautionary statements in the labeling of most estrogen products  the hormones of this general type The new labeling proposal adds the warning that diethylstilbesterol and its closely related compounds should not be given to a woman who is pregnant The proposal will be published in the Federal Register tomorrow It notes that the hormone is considered effective as an estrogen replacement in women who need such replacement During the nineteenfifties the drug was also used quite widely to help prevent spontaneous abortion and some other complications of pregnancy A specialist said today it was no longer widely used for this purpose evidently because doctors had concluded that it was not effective Diethylstilbesterol has been the subject of controversy recently for an entirely different reason It is widely used by livestock producers to fatten their animals before slaughtering Traces of the hormone have been found in a few of the animals livers although Government regulations have tried to prevent this by setting 48hour period before slaughtering during which the substance can not be used The Department of Agriculture has moved to extend this period from 48 hours to seven days but bills have been introduced in Congress to achieve more stringent controls One such bill was introduced yesterday by Senator William Proxmire Democrat of Wisconson Another was introduced today by Representative Ogden R Reid Republican of Westchester

Rabbit returns; Updike was always there—it's time we noticed,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/14/archives/rabbit-redux-by-john-updike-407-pp-new-york-alfred-a-knopf-795.html,In 1939 Thomas Mann sent his brother a fan letter Heinrichs new novel he wrote is great in love in art boldness freedom wisdom kindness exceedingly rich in intelligence wit imagination and feelinga great and beautiful thing synthesis and resume of your life and your personality Though fulsome and obviously written in the first flush of enthusiasm for Heinrichs now all but forgotten book these are the hyperboles that come to mind after reading John Updikes new novel Rabbit Redux It must be said Mann continues that such growth such transformation of the static to the dynamic such perseverance and such a harvesting is peculiarly European Here in America the writers are shortlived they write one good book follow it with two and then are finished Theres truth as well as wellearned snobbery in this observation American writers do tend to flush and then fizzle The casualties in our postwar fiction are legion writers as different as J D Salinger and Joseph Heller immediately spring to mind John Updike knows this well in an essay on Nabokov he argued that this Russian emigre was the only writer practicing in America whose books considered as a whole give the happy impression of an oeuvre of a continuous task carried forward variously of a solid personality of a plentitude of gifts explored knowingly His works are an edifice whose every corner rewards inspection Each book  yields delight and presents to the aesthetic sense the peculiar hardness of a finished fully meant thing But keeping this high professional standard in mind are there any contemporary American writers who are steadily producing distinguished work not one or two but say a minimum of four fulllength books Who are the novelists who have tried to keep a grip on our experience as weve wobbled along in the past decade or two the writers to whom we turn to find out something of where we are and what were feeling the writers who give the secular news report Id suggest that there are five Saul Bellow Norman Mailer Bernard Malamud Philip Rothand John Updike himself There are to be sure many other gifted authors at work but these five and possibly Joyce Carol Oates are wrestling most fiercely with the novel as historyhistory as the novel Barth Vonnegut Barthelme Hawkes are up to something else In the past two years Bellow Mailer Malamud and Roth have written books that cluster like angry hornets around a few big news items chiefly the moon shot and racial turmoil Now in a surprising return to the hero of his most unequivocally successful novel Rabbit Run John Updike plunges Harry Rabbit Angstrom ten years older into the late 1960s where he tries to cope with sex fatherhood marriage drugs Vietnam blacks the moon shot And Rabbit Redux is the best book of the lot Of course to praise Updike on these terms to place him in the company of the other four is either an outrage or a truism depending on whos listening He began as the darling of The New Yorker in the mid 1950s and by the age of 30 in 1962 had published two novels two collections of short stories a childrens book and a book of light verse He seemed to have made it as nearly everybodys favorite best young American writer from Granville Hicks in the Saturday Review to Mary McCarthy in Paris to Stanley Edgar Hyman in The New Leader Yet even then there were qualms Melvin Maddocks sounded a first graceful note in what became a symphony of critical opprobrium in a few years Infinite care is bestowed an infinitely small passions When the time comes to touch the essential the writers grip slips almost from embarrassment into rhetoric and sensations When Updikes third novel The Centaur appeared in 1963 Commentarys editor Norman Podharetz laced into him Updike he wrote is callow sentimental cruel adolescent and fashionably audacious in his treatment of sex given to selfconscious efforts at verbal brilliance and fake profundity to cover up his lack of substancea writer who has very little to say and whose authentic emotional range is so narrow and thin that it may without too much exaggeration be characterized as limited to a rather timid nostalgia for the confusions of youth When the novel won the 1964 National Book Award it was the kiss of death Updikes books might be popular but serious people didnt really have to read them In 1965 his short novel Of the Farm was almost universally misunderstood and dismissed as trivial And then in 1968 came Couples a huge best seller but a critical disaster It was Alfred Kazin who sealed the coffin Among American novelists he wrote John Updike is the college intellectual with genius  I mean someone who can brilliantly describe the adult world without conveying its depths and risks someone wholly literary dazzlingly bright the quickest of quick children someone ready to understand everything and to describe anything for nothing that can be put in words is alien to hire But when he describes situations that in life do bring terror to the human heart his facility reminds one of many other college intellectuals brought up on Criticism Psychoanalysis the Death of God Words become all and what the words show most is the will to be as effective as one is gifted Nevertheless when Updike brought out a collection of stories in 1970 about the imaginary Jewish writer Henry Bech the critics loved it Though many had reviled him for trivia they lapped it up when the literary world they knew and loved became the focus of such elegant satirical attentions Bech was proclaimed Updikes best book But almost everybody knew the serious case against him was closed He was precious facile pretentious When he wrote about rural family life he was too small they said except when he dragged in all the highfaluting mythological nonsense in The Centaurwhich was too big When he wrote about suburban sexual behavior he was merely sociological and much too longwinded Only in Bech did he keep his place as a country cousin with a charming eye But he had nothing to say Just a boyish cry of Look ma no hands in the prose Or so they said There remains at the very least one large stubborn fact in the 15 years since Updike began to write professionally he has published an astonishing range and volume of work that cannot be airily dismissed as the mindless gush of the steady best seller pro nor the dreary stream of a genteel quality author There are three collections of verse a large anthology of parodies essays and reviews four childrens books four collections of short stories and six novels This may not in Updikes mind or ours constitute a Nabokovian oeuvre but when one sits down and begins to read through these books the variety and professional effort command respect and critical scrutiny The publication of Rabbit Redux necessitates revaluation of his work Updikes three collections of verse The Carpentered Hen 1958 Telephone Poles 1963 and Midpoint 1969have genuine charm and offer the simple delights of wit Such wit depends of course on shared assumptions and social values the poems are very much on the Harvard LampoonNew Yorker bias and tend to whimsy and worldly word play with a Rolls Royce ad a clothes line cocoa cooling in the cup a Bendix washing machine There are more serious poems including the apologia pro vita sua Midpointwhich has much thought and confessional emotion obscured behind a picket fence of formal tricksbut on the whole the verse is small clever oldfashioned in its classy gleam no more than it pretends to be Yet a good light laugh is not to be taken for granted these days The anthology of Assorted Prose from the New Yorker which appeared in 1965 is more substantial It opens with a batch of parodies and Talk of the Town sketches Of these Updike once said in an interview it was playful work that opened the city to me I was the man who went to boating or electronic exhibits in the Coliseum and tried to make impressionist poems of the objects and overheard conversations They might be read as Updikes Sketches by Boz Then come editorial Notes and Comments on subjects of the day and the famous essay on Ted Williamss last baseball game Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu As sports writing only Mailers accounts of Patterson and Liston equal it Its significant that Updike admires most of all Williamss professional discipline and energy his batting prowess like Nabokovs literary skill is a model that Updike at 28 clearly wanted to imitate in his own career The autobiographical pieces that follow lack bite as Updike acknowledges in his foreword But the most Impressive section of Assorted Prose is the last the 17 reviews and literary essays As a reviewer Updikes great intelligence and technical skill are immediately in evidence His interests are wide Beerbohm Karl Barth Muriel Spark Denis de Rougemont his prose is clear and straight and his powers of organization and explication are formidable In recent years he has discussed in the New Yorker such writers as Drieu La Rochelle and Alfred Jerry Kierkegaard Joyce Olinter Grass Knut Hamsun Raymond Queneau There is an immensely attractive nonacademic attentiveness to his reviews At his best he goes right to the human center the heart of a writer expressed in his art Borgess cold bibliophilic stoicism Nabokovs lepodopterist urge to kill and fix the objects of his love Yet even in his enthusiasms Updike is judicious He doesnt roll literary logs He doesnt preen and hasnt a speck of competitive spite Of American novelists only Mailer again though competition incarnate is his match as a critic See Mailers essays on Henry Miller and D H Lawrence buried in The Prisoner of Sex As a short story writer though Updike often gives the impression of a man who is warming himself up for a longer race Too many stories feel like expensive limousines idling The focus shifts away from individual stories scenes and characters and back to the writer and his verbal skill He has published four collections The Same Door 1959 Pigeon Feathers 1962 The Music School 1966 and Bech A Book 1970 The autobiographical Olinger Storiesa group of nostalgic epiphanies about growing up in rural Pennsylvania in the 1940s  were plucked from the first two collections and published as a Vintage paperback in 1964 In the preface to this anthology Updike writes that he wanted to capture moments when the muddled and inconsequent surface of things now and then parts to yield us a gift Divine grace he implies is experienced as a moment of heightened perception and feeling In the attempt to convey this belief the stories in their modesty and vulnerability take on a certain hothouse blush When youre reading them you go along willingly but when you look back they tend to melt together in a reverent hush of lyrical lissome linguistic curlicues It is this that so excites the ire of Updikes critics But when Updike writes about Bech the wit cuts both the Olinger pathos and the too easy flow of the more diversified and Cheeveresque New Yorker stories In Bech Takes Pot Luck Bech Panics Bech Swings and The Bulgarian Poetess the prose is light and free and the silken mechanism whereby America reduces her writers to imbelicity and cozenage descends oer poor caricatured but lovable Bech Updikes six novels are of much greater critical interest than his short stories They fall into three groups The Poorhouse Fair his first novel and Couples his fifthboth romans et these which work least well The Centaur his third novel and Of the Farm his fourth both novels about Updikes family that draw in unexpected and highly different ways on the same material as the Olinger Stories finally and most successfully the two novels about Harry Rabbit Angstrom Rabbit Run Updikes second novel and its sequel Rabbit Redux his sixth which has just been published The two thesis novels  The Poorhouse Fair 1959 and Couples 1968were written to make a specific point about society God and Man A religious argument hovers in the background and Updike focuses on a group of people as they interact not on individuals Above the human comings and goings looms the God of Calvin and Karl Barth absolutely transcendent inhuman wholly Other brooding over His Creation turning the seasons unexpectedly granting tiny rewards illuminations grace Thus it is the landscape the changes in weather the surface of material things the collective fantasies and feelings of a community that are the chief objects of Updikes attention His complex metaphors strive to link these elements together His goal is to achieve a deliberate generalizing impersonality and distance But this is what makes The Poorhouse Fair so claustral and cautious and makes Couples so endlessly detailed and confusing in its characters and affairs The Poorhouse Fair is a miniature ballet of crossing and crisscrossing characters voices points of view overlapping feelings and events Slowly quietly the thesis emerges In a bland totalitarian future America a group of indigent old people wander around the grounds of a state poorhouse where theyre confined and prepare their yearly handicrafts fair for the delectation of the neighboring bourgeoisie Out of the delicate suite of voices there arises a debate between a 94yearold religious patriotic relic of the age of individuality and the prefect of the poorhouse whose ideal of a paradise achieved through secular social reform Updike clearly opposes The religious backdrop gives the prose a consistently heightened air One is left with the impression of an infinitely patient intelligence deliberately at work on every filigree that composes this microcosm I find it claustrophobic Like some of the stories does indeed deserve the label precious Yet if The Poorhouse Fair is too tight its cousin Couples sprawls In it Updike delineates the heresies of the postPill paradise of suburban Massachusetts engineers brokers dentists contractors and their wives who engage in ritual games of weekend sports parties and adultery in order to break back into hedonism and figuratively form a church a magic circle of heads to keep out the night Updike drowns the reader in detail blending the characters and their feelings to achieve a generalized effect But he buries the religious thesis and its intricate symbolic details so deeply that it detaches itself from the realistic surface of the novel and feels willful whenever its alluded to The novel is insufficiently dramatized Wilfrid Sheed has argued that this slackness is a necessary result of Updikes decision not to play the novel as another suburban sexual tragedy But there is within the Christian novel another book a tragedy of a modern Tristan and Iseult No matter how carefully Updike gets inside this tortuous love affair he is always reversing gearsbecause of his overriding thesis pulling back to the more impersonal Christian novel about the suburban heretics Hes caught between the secular and the divine the narrative and visionary the realistic and symbolic To keep the narrative of the central love affair going he resorts to awkward melodrama an abortion a quid pro quo wife swap and obligatory confrontation scenes To stop the reader from simply drifting along through the story he keeps it slow and swells the language and the background details He continually withdraws from individual psychology and motivation into long shots of the group as a whole or zooms in so far that individual erotic fantasies are done as revelations of eternal grace and the strains However the sociological details of suburban professions and possessionswhich were too lightly dismissed by reviewers  are excellent accurate social observation even when its too much of a muchness as it is in this case cannot be taken for granted The infamous prose style is not so florid as critics made it out to be while reading the book you float along quite easily and only start to sink in the lush sexual descriptions where the language is striving for visionary metaphors drenched feathers pulled his tip Though Couples is reputed a dirty novel its not voyeuristic almost all the eroticism is portrayed from inside a characters mind not outside his body peeping in Of postwar American novelists only Mailer again attempts to write this seriously about sexual feelings And Mailer in his aggressiveness is far removed from Updikes masculine tenderness In short Wilfrid Sheeds explications of the structure and the symbols and everybody elses outrage are both correct the book was intended to be much as it is but as Beth described his own long novel Couples is a noble failure It blurs and then fades rapidly from the mind Unlike the thesis novels Updikes two family novelsThe Centaur 1963 and Of the Farm 1965 the first about his father the second about a mother figureare enormously readable and unexpectedly varied Although The Centaur is now commonly regarded as a pretentious mythic allegory piled on top of a tiny boyhood recollection it is in fact intensely realistic in its rendering of small town Pennsylvania high school days and is filled with energetic narrative and vivid characterization It is not by any means all written in mythic elevation There are no less than four modes one a third person realistic narrative of three days in the life of George Cauldwell a high school teacher Two his sons first person realistic memoir of these same three days told within a small but intrusive and unconvincing framework in the present Three the notoriously florid mythological style in which the centaur talks with milady Venus or finds himself in a bosky glen although this tone is intended to serve as an ironic counterpoint to the dominant realism there is unfortunately a patch of it in the first 20 pages of the book which may well have put readers off in all there arent more than 10 pages in this style in the entire 300  page book And four a brilliant double focus mode a rapid surrealistic simultaneity of myth and realism that achieves a genuinely Joycean brio This last is most fully achieved in the books first chapter which culminates in a breathtaking rapidlire class room lecture on the history of the universe Stanley Edgar Hyman wrote of this chapter I can think of nothing in fiction to surpass it since the Nighttown scene in Ulysses This praise is too high but the impulse is right Nothing in the critical cliches about The Centaur could lead one to imagine such an enjoyable comic tour de force of an opening But the great triumph of the book is not Updikes technical lan It is the portrait of the fatherthe centaur himselfone of the best portraits of Depression man or the Middle American in postwar American fiction Dramatic selfpitying generous fearful obsequious and absurd careless and stubborn plugging away at a killing job with a violent energy that continually exasperates and embarrasses his loving son George Cauldwell is a rural IrishGerman Protestant Herzog His voice once heard is never forgotten As for the offending myths when they spontaneously appear as dim presences at the edge of a realistic character or setting they do indeed evoke the breathless quality of adolescent emotions and nostalgia At its worst the book has a small town Thornton Wilder wistfulness but this is rare The minor mythic correspondences listed in the embarrassing index at the end are arbitrary and easily ignored But the central metaphor works well George Cauldwell is a wounded workhorse giving up his life for the welfare of his son by sticking at a draining job he does not as some have thought from the unfortunately lush last pages commit suicide But the son it must be admitted never convinces on the mythic level He is not a budding artist a fire giver a Prometheus he is a sensitive loving 15yearold no more But no less either there is little of the sugary Olinger mist in The Centaur Rather than exemplifying pretentious selfindulgence The Centaur read now after the bloom and decay of black humor and pop absurdity is a genuine if much smaller American son of the mythological novels of Joyce and Mann Its not offensive in the least its an enjoyable and moving book Updikes other family novel Of the Farm is quite short less than 200 pages and when it appeared in 1965 reviewers seemed to feel it wasnt about anything A 35yearold New York advertising man and his second wife and her son visit the farm of the heros mother recently widowed In the course of the weekend the son mows the field buys some groceries goes to church watches over his mothers spell of angina and then drives back to New York But within this tiny frame Updike has written a novel that in its careful description of the agonized incestuous combat between the four characters is a perfect rural Protestant complement to Portnoys Complaint Instead of comedy and psychoanalytic hyperbole Updike chose a chaste Chekhovian realism He dramatizes the crippling exclusive love of mother and son The most frightening betrayals and sexual drifts are conveyed almost entirely through the dialogue Im surprised at you says mother to son that you would need a stupid woman to give you confidence  I look at my son and see a man his father wouldnt recognize  Dont mind me Joey Im just a crazy old woman whos gone too long without talking to anybody except her dogs I thought I could talk to my son but apparently Ive presumed Unscrupulously the mother plays on her illness and approaching death and uses her sons love of his absent children and his first wife to poison his second marriage After two days at home the mother has her son at point where she can ask him outright if he doesnt feel hes made a mistake in remarrying at all and with subtle sexual appeal and a flattering allusion to their shared superiority she wraps him in her net The parallel jealousy of the hero for his new wifes former husband is brilliantly worked out the more he comes under his mothers sway the more preoccupied he becomes with his new wifes previous sexual life The verbal battles between the women are shocking In Of the Farm Updike writes with a precision that is totally at odds with the received opinion of his style The book is small the way Flannery OConnor is small It is one of the finer American psychological novels despite its limited scale Updikes Rabbit novelsRabbit Run 1960 and its sequel Rabbit Redux just publishedare his best books The thesis novels failed because his will and intelligence took the place of emotional force The autobiographical family novels were full of emotional force yet in the effort to keep it under esthetic control The Centaur sometimes became a shade too big and Of the Farm a shade too small But in the Rabbit novels the use of the present tense and the choice of a character who stands at one remove from Updikes personal experience shield him from the overpowering rushes of feeling that result in ornate prose willful intricacies or problems of scale in his other novels In Rabbit Run a young man deserts his wife on an impulse takes up with another woman goes back to his wife and then runs off again When the book first appeared Richard Gilman described it well On one level Rabbit Run is grotesque allegory of American life with its myth of happiness and success its dangerous innocence and crippling antagonism between value and fact But much more significantly it is a minor epic of the spirit thirsting for room to discover and be itself ducking dodging staying out of reach of everything that will pin it down and impale it on fixed immutable laws that are not of its own making and do not consider its integrity Norman Mailer writing in Esquire greatly disliked Updikes prose but he did concede that Updike has instincts for finding the heart of the conventional novel and brilliantly expressed the emotional and ultimately religious intensity of the book the merit of the book is not in the simplicity of its problem but in the dread Updike manages to convey despite the literary commercials in the style of a young man who is beginning to lose nothing less than his good American soul and yet it is not quite his fault The power of the novel comes from the sense not absolutely unworthy of Thomas Hardy that the uni verse hangs over our fates like a great sullen hopeless sky There is real pain in the book and a touch of awe What distinguishes Rabbit Run from all of Updikes other work until the appearance of its sequel is its dynamic balance between description and narrative energy as Rabbit escapes from one enclosing situation to another the pace never flags and yet the physical and psychological details have never been more sharply in focus The minutiae of the Eisenhower agethe paradigmatic Mickey Mouse TV show the religious revival the allAmerican glamor of highschool heroes the cramped apartments of small town sweethearts who married too young the hallowed authority of athletic coaches and parents all are perfectly there But the verisimilitude is more than skin deep Updike meticulously conveys the longings and frustrations of family life the interplay of love tenderness aggression and lust with selfesteem the differences of feeling and speech from class to class and generation to generation The prose speeds along with grace and strength the present tense has given it dramatic immediacy and yet permitted a rapid flow of psychological nuance Rabbits wife his mistress the disapproving parents his old coach an all too modern Episcopal priest and his wife the two young children all are brilliantly drawn Rabbit is caught in the centera kind of antiJob who wont abandon the pleasure principle or a male Madame Bovary who instead of killing himself simply runs away Thus the essential theme of Rabbit Run is civilization and its discontents the opposing claims of self and society the sacrifices of energy and individuality that civilization demands In Rabbit Run Updike pulled against the 1950s defending the claims of the libidinous presocial self against the smothering complacencies of small town white America Now in Rabbit Redux that is Rabbit returns he pulls against the 1960s and defends his heros new commitment to civilization his longing for social and personal continuity in an age where both are hard to come by In the new book Rabbit has greatly changed its been ten years since he last ran away At 36 hes no longer a bounder but plugs away like his father as a linotypist in a local print shop He sticks to his responsibilities and lives by the old American rules which it cost him so much to learn family loyalty hard work sexual compromise But in the 1960s such rules no longer seem to apply Everybodys the way I used to be he says Rabbits wife Janice has also changed She is restless no longer the gloomy stayathome Now she bustles out to work at her fathers new Toyota agency while Rabbit is stuck in his dwindling blue collar trade and is finally laid off as obsolete Janice not Rabbit is the one who has an affair and runs away from home for much the same reason as he once did This time he is left behind the town cuckold caring for his teenage son Lonely adrift Rabbit takes an 18yearold runaway girl into his house he becomes her lover and father The family expands when she brings home another stray a black Vietnam veteran on the run who styles himself an agent of apocalypse and indirectly brings down fire and brimstone on the house Rabbit returns to his parents home Once again he sleeps in his old room regresses into adolescent fantasies But in the end his wife decides to let her lover go and comes back to her family A more complex health and order is achieved The action takes place in the summer of 1969 and the Apollo moon shot is used as the organizing image of the book As Rabbit and his father sit drinking in a bar and he first learns that his wife may be unfaithful the astronauts are taking off As Rabbits life falls apart Armstrong sets foot on the moon Everything in the middle sections is in free fall as Rabbit spins around the dark side of the moon In the end Rabbit and his wife home in like space capsules and of course like rabbits in a hutch The lunar wasteland of contemporary America is everywhere The tacky houses of the suburban development where Rabbit lives blister the landscape like craters on the moon Downtown there are deserted lots and empty stores Desolate shopping centers are lit by burger joints where the drinks all taste like chemical sludge and Luna specials two cheeseburgers with an American flag on top are sold The endless electronic buzz of television fills the air with news reports of rocket launchings and racial turmoil The young trip out on pot and heroin their sexual license is bombed out arid frozen All these elements are subtly brought together in the controlling image of space exploration a journey out into a void and then back to earth In Rabbit Redux for the first time in his career Updike deals in a large way with public subjects violence the Vietnam war black revolution drug addiction middle American anger and frustration hippie lifestyles the moon shot With great narrative facility he has integrated these volatile elements within a realistic novel of suburban life in 1969 In outline the book may seem populated with clichs but on the page they are redeemed by Updikes accurate evocation of peoples voices and feelings as well as his description of physical details Updike has always written about the inner surface of banal experiences in Rabbit Redux he shows highly familiar subjects in all their human particularity For example Rabbit has a series of violent political arguments with his two sexual rivals his wifes lover and the young black In Bech Updike wrote even in an age of science and unbelief our ideas are dreams styles superstitions mere animal noises intended to repel or attract In the give and take of these debates it is nearly impossible to detach the ideas and political opinions from their psychological novelistic base Rabbit gets wild about Vietnam when he feels personally and sexually threatened he overcomes his fear and dislike of blacks when he himself is an outcast and a cuckold The wide range of tones and rhythms in black speech has never been so well reproduced in contemporary white writing The apposite comparison is Ralph Ellisons Invisible Man Bernard Malamuds stereotyped black novelist in The Tenants and Saul Bellows wordless menacing black pickpocket in Mr Sammlers Planet come nowhere near the depth and accuracy of Updikes black characters a printer a lowlife singer the young Vietnam veteran Although symbolically Rabbit is clearly the suffering servant and father and this young black is clearly the Antichristpreaching sermons that mix AfroAmerican history and religious nihilism and administering the saciaments of drugs and sexthis black is portmyed with enormous sympathy and force and is anything but an allegorical cutout In Rabbit Run the hero confronted an essentially static social situation and dove into his inner spaces to avoid it In Rabbit Redux he confronts an unnervingly dynamic social situation that plunges him into outer spacebeyond his family his class his race and his normal earthbound feelings and behavior Rabbit Run was a major b
ok about the fifties Rabbit Redux is like Mailers Armies of the Night a major book about the sixtiesthe period when the struggles of the private self became political events and political events broke in on private lives Of the writers who are work ing in a professional way to help us come to some unsteady and evolving understanding of our human and cultural predicament as we slide into the seventies two in recent years are complementary Norman Mailer and John Updike A metaphor might help us here Mailer is a mountainclimber Updike a miner Mailer is heroically scaling the heights of himself of ideas of urban life of the future of the sky the outer spaces He is aggressive public ostentatiously political outrageously daring unsparing of himself Updike is an underground worker chipping away at banal circumstances and minute feelings trying to find jewels in a little space Until this book he was nearly apolitical and even here he carefully grounds his characters political opinions in their immediate social and psychological conditions He is tender not aggressive His sexual descriptions are not boastful but reverent His major characters include women as well as menwhich is remarkable in American fiction He is our finest writer about children He treats his characters with respect there are no villains In an interview in 1966 Updike said I like middles It is in middles that extremes clash where ambiguity restlessly rules In an interview two years later he continued Everything unambiguously expressed seems somehow crass to me  everything is infinitely fine and any opinion is somehow coarser than the texture of the real thing My work says yes but Yes in Rabbit Run to our inner urgent whispers butthe social fabric collapses murderously Yes in The Centaur to selfsacrifice and duty but  what of a mans private agony and dwindling No in The Poorhouse Fair to social homogenization and loss of faith but  listen to the voices the joy of persistent existence No in Couples to a religious community founded on physical and psychical interpenetrations butwhat else shall we do as God destroys our churches  Domestic fierceness within the middle class sex and death as riddles for the thinking animal social existence as sacrifice unexpected pleasures and rewards corruption as a kind of evolutionthese are some of [my] themes He has never treated them better than in his new novel In Rabbit Redux all is ambiguous dialectical and yet finally novelistically resolved There are no Updikean curlicues of style or yawning gaps between symbol and event All is dramatized There are some structural faults and moments when characters dont ring true But I can think of no stronger vindication of the claims of essentially realistic fiction than this extraordinary synthesis of the disparate elements of contemporary experience Rabbit Redux is a great achievement by far the most audacious and successful book Updike has written ,,
BIRTH‐RATE DROP WORRIES POLAND,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/14/archives/birthrate-drop-worries-poland-officials-open-campaign-to-reverse.html,WARSAW Nov 13Polish officials have begun an extensive press campaign to reverse a rapid decline in the nations birth rate They are calling for a change in familysubsidy programs and in birthcontrol practices presumably including abortion regulations Special to The New York Times The annual rate of population growth now 85 per thousand is expected to decline to 77 per thousand by 1980 and to 34 per thousand by the end of the century according to the Central Statistical Office The population is expected to increase by only 18 per cent in the next 30 yearsfrom 32605000 now to 38590000 The adoption of a new familyplanning policy would in effect eliminate one of the principal issues between the state and the Roman Catholic Church which has vigorously opposed the present policy of limiting the size of families Birth Rate Declines Poland like most European countries experienced a postwar baby boom It reached its peak in 1955 with 800000 births which was a record 31 births per thousand The birth rate has declined steadily since then falling to 169 births per thousand in 1969 The decline is attributed primarily to difficult economic conditions and to a chronic housing shortage especially in large cities Other major factors are said to be an extensive plannedparenthood program and the ease with which abortions are obtained Last year there were 54600 births and 213000 abortions In theory abortions are obtainable only for health reasons or if the parents social and economic conditions are unsuitable for the raising of a child In practice any woman can get an abortion either in the free state clinic or through a private physician Poland is one of the few countries that permit abortion that takes into consideration such factors as living conditions in determining a womans eligibility Rural Attitudes Differ Some observers say that one factor not discernible from the official figures is the difference in attitude toward family planning between the rural population where families with five or six children are not uncommon and the generally better educated urban population where one child is the norm In a poll conducted recently by the Public Opinion Reseach enter 77 per cent of those who answered felt that the number of children should depend on the familys material situation Of those with university degrees 48 per cent felt that a high birth rate was undesirable while 13 per cent felt it to be desirable Thirtyfive per cent of all those polled felt that a family with three or more children was the ideal model Most in this group were agricultural and unskilled laborers
The Right to Open Trial A Legacy of English Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/16/archives/the-right-to-open-trial-a-legacy-of-english-law.html,The right to a public trial started in England centuries ago a reaction some say to the terrors of the Star Chamber and it came to the colonies as part of the common law It was written into the Bill of Rights and thereafter into the constitutions or statute books of nearly every American state England had had its Star Chamber and Spain its Inquisition in France there had been the lettre de cachet  three different proceedings each used for persecution and each marked by secrecy But in the United States legislators and the public alike agreed a man suspected of a crime would be tried in public And of all the basic guarantees in the Constitution that became one of the most accepted and least challenged It became so accepted in fact that there is relatively little law on the subject and very little precedent for the closed trial that State Supreme Court Justice George Postel ordered yesterday in the case of Carmine J Persico High Court Rulings Cited Thus the general rule is clearly that the defendants in state as well as Federal cases have the right to public trialseven if there is no state statute authorizing such a trial The United States Supreme Court has long held that the 14th Amendment makes the Sixth Amendments public trial guarantee applicable to the states But there are also traditional exceptions to the rule not all of which have been tested in the Supreme Court New Yorks Judiciary Law for example states that in certain types of cases such as divorce rape sodomy and abortion the court may in its discretion hold a closed trial Nearly two decades ago a judge in New York tried to create another execption It was the trial of the oleomargarine heir Minot F Mickey Jelke on charges of compulsory prostitution and Judge Francis L Valente excluded the public from the prosecutions part of the case explaining that the testimony would be offensive to public morality He did this over the defendants objections and Jelke was subsequently convicted In 1954 however the New York Court of Appeals upheld an intermediate appellate courts reversal of the conviction explaining that the Legislature had not included this type of case in its list of exceptions Jelke was later convicted once more after a public trial Still other exceptions though have been allowednumerous courts for instance have sanctioned the closing or partial closing for a trial where it was necessary for judicial administration The New York Court of Appeals thus found it acceptable that in the trial of the alleged killers of Malcolm X the audience was not permitted to hear one particular witness testify The witness had feared reprisals from those in the courtroom and this fear the court held to be legitimate In yesterdays case Justice Postel ordered the trial closed at the request of the defense lawyer who argued that jurors might read news accounts of the case and become prejudiced against the defendant The prosecution objected saying that the right to a public trial belonged to the public as well as the defendant But the prosecutions argument though it has often been made before has yet to become law Right Rests With Defendant During the Jelke trial for example a press association sought access to the trial by arguing that the right to a public trial was being denied The New York Court of Appeals decided this case the same day it reversed Jelkes conviction and thus after the issue was moot the court said however that the right to a public trial could be claimed only by the defendant himself The reason the court said quoting an earlier Supreme Court decision on a related subject was that the right was designed to protect the defendant It should be up to him to an open trial or not But if the defendant generally has a right to a public trial does he also have the right if he wants to a closed trial Here again there is little law In the case of the news media who wanted access to the Jelke trial the Court of Appeals said this A regard not only for fairness and logic but for justice and fairness to the defendant dictates the conclusion that subject to the courts approval and ruling he be allowed to decide against having a public trial The court did not amplify the words subject to the courts approval and ruling But there is precedent in other areas that could be followed here In 1965 for instance the United States Supreme Court ruled that although the defendant had a right to trial by jury he did not also have an absolute right to trial without a jury Or as Wayne R LaFave professor at the University of Illinois put it he couldnt turn constitutional rights inside out and demand that he not be given a right that the Constitution guarantees

National Notes,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/21/archives/national-notes.html,There were new efforts last week to throw roadblocks in William H Rehnquists path toward the Supreme Court But it seemed likely that the Assistant Attorney General would be able to surmount them all On Tues day if all goes as expected the Sen ate Judiciary Committee will approve President Nixons nominations of Mr Rehnquist and Virginia lawyer Lewis F Powell and send them on to the run senate The vote for Mr Powell is expected to be unanimous but five liberal Democrats may cast dissenting votes on Mr Rehnquist In fact last week the committee liberals tried to reopen hearings on Mr Rehnquists nomination but were beaten by the other 10 Judiciary Com mittee members The liberals wanted to question Mr Rehnquist and hear other witness on allegations that while an Arizona lawyer in the earlier 1960s he had tried to intimidate Negroes attempting to vote in Phoenixand that he had been member of two far rightwing

men who would appeal their draft status with a series of new proce dural rights Last week when they learned just how the Selective Service System intended to translate the law into actual regulations the reaction was very different The Central Com mittee for Conscientious Objectors Philadelphiabased organization that advises potential COs called the first news conference in its 23year history to denounce those regulations affect ing COs as regression unparalleled in all the years we have been dealing with the Selective Service System Some items that raised the commit tees ire  COs would be

members appointed by the Presidenthanded down a verdict last week and as the chart above indicates while there has been some improvement in the last six months the performance still ranges from poor to marginal at best The Commission placed much of the blame on President Nixon the time young men would have to take an appeal would be cut from the current 30 days for those living in the United States and 60 days for those living abroad to 15 days At weeks end Dr Curtis Tarr Se lective Service director ordered the questionnaire withdrawn The other new regulations however are still scheduled to go into effect No Pregnant Soldiers There is said the Court of Appeals in Sari Francigco last week a com pelling public interest in not having pregnant female soldiers in the mili tary

in 1970 when she discoverea mat she was pregnant Marriage she told her su periors was out of the question so was abortion The Air Force sent her back to the States where her baby was born in December of that year and ordered her dischargedthough she had given the baby up for adop tion But Captain Struck wanted to stay in the service She appealed the dis charge on constitutional grounds men who

who drive those Yellow Cabs with the little metal medallions on their hoods have long been on a collision course with the medallionless gypsy cab drivers But last week they found themselves in a kind of accord Both groups were assailing regulations proposed by the Citys Taxi and Limousine Commissions de signed to solve their mutual problems The solution offered by Taxi Com missioner Michael J Lazar dealt primarily with the gypsy cabs which he suggested came in two varieties There are the more than 9000 for hire limousines and private cars whose owners pay 100 a year for a livery license They are permitted to haul passengers for a fee but not to cruise the street in search of fares In theory their passengers telephone for service Then there are what the commissioner calls outright gypsy cabsapproximately 4400 in num ber without livery licenses unin sured and often unsafe to drive in The commission proposal To put the first group under city regulation and to move against and abolish the outright gypsies The agency would seek to set minimum standards for nonmedallion vehicles oversee driver qualifications and insurance and pre Vent overcharging of passengers The drivers of the citys 11787 Yellow cabs are not enthusiastic about the plan They have paid from 10000 to 30000 for Lhasa medal lions or ncenses that avow them to cruise about for fares They charge that many of the gypsy cabs of both varieties also pick up passengers who hail themthereby making a mockery of the medallion in which they have so huge an investment The gypsies on the other hand say they perform a necessary service most medallion cabbies had avoidedthey take passengers into low and middle income neighborhoods shunned by Yellow Cab drivers afraid of assault or robbery They attack the commis sion plan because it would not give them the authority to cruise for passengerswhile at the same time imposing stringent new rules upon them At weeks end It seemed likely that one or both groups of cabbies might challenge the Commissions plan in court BreatheQuickly It rained in Birmingham Ala on Fridayand residents took a long deep welcome breath of fresh air For three days the heavily

‘The Level of Health Care in Municipal Hospitals Is Shocking’,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/27/archives/-the-level-of-health-care-in-municipal-hospitals-is-shocking.html,Mr Shapiro or Rivera Spinelli Wilkins Wong or Ryan is about to die His tracheostomy tube the metal one temporarily placed in his windpipe to help him breathe is becoming clogged with mucous He needs to have it suctioned clean but there is no nurse around right now Ho will die tonight because of inadequate nursing care Mr Shapiro could have avoided this fate in an other hospital but he is in a New York City municipal hospital He will die because he is poor or be cause he is old or because he does not have a private physician He is a victim of the twoclass system of medical care in this nation This vignettte is designed to shock because the overall level of health care in the municipal hospitals is this shocking There is a lack of both pro fessional and nontprofessional staff there are decayed equipment and buildings large impersonal wards language barriers long waiting times in the outpatient departments dis organized medical record systems in adequate pharmacy and laboratory fa cilities lack of night or weekend clinics and of preventive care programs To deny that people die and suffer unnecessarily from these and other defects in both inpatient and out patient health services Is to deny the reality of the New York City munici pal hospital system It was to help correct these types of problems that the New York City Health and Hos pitals Corporation was created Its mandate in part Is to provide the needed health and medical services  [and] highquality dignified coin prehensive care and treatment to the ill and infirmed particularly those who can ill afford such services At this point in time the Health and Hospitals Corporation is in serious trouble Its problems derive from two interrelated primary sources First It is a victim of fiscal neglect chronic and recurrent The city hos pitals have over the years been crim inally underfinanced Money appro priated in the past has been funneled off Last year the Health and Hospi tals Corporation spent its appropriated budget of approximately 620 million It successfully hired about 900 addi tional registered nurses and ran responsive abortion program At that it continued to provide substandard levels of nursing care and essentially no real improvement in other areas of health care The second major problem and one that is clearly related to the first is far more pervasive The corporation has failed to establish itself as an advocate of health care and it has failed to be responsive to a wide Variety of inputs from both within and without The corporate adminis trative leadership has repeatedly failed to consult with its own board of directors executives within its hos pitals professional and nonprofes sional representatives and concerned community and public groups The lack of involvement of these parties in a meaningful way in the decision making processes in the corporation is to be condemned The isolation and covertness of the corporate adminis trative leadership has and continues to act against the effective provision of highquality health care for the people of this city Morale within the corporation at all levels is perilously low Clearly defined shortand long term goals and time lines have not been enunciated Management ineffi ciency persists leading to among other things delay in new employes getting on the payroll and loss of faith by vendors who have not been paid on time Doubt exists as to the credibility of the corporateleadership in the press the public and govern ment at all levels These comments are made in recog nition of the fact that in my belief the Health and Hospitals Corporation is the only currently viable organiza tional framework capable of providing dignified highquality health care to the large number of citizens it serves Its purposes are noble and its words laudable Its performance to date is dismaying and will worsen under the current budgetary pressures Since the majority of the board of directors are a combination of highlevel city offi cials and direct mayoral appointments the onus of responsinity for the des tiny of the corporation both Shortand longterm largely falls on th4layor of this city The decisions of the board Majority are a reflection of his ability and commitment to deal with the health needs of this city The effec tive open functioning of the Health and Hospitals Corporation as an advo cate and provider of health care could be a major credit to the Lindsay ad ministration In the meantime Mr Shapiro is dying and his death must be laid squarely on the doorstep of those Who hear him strangling and fail to respond
MOTHER WINS SUIT OVER PILL ERROR,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/28/archives/mother-wins-suit-over-pill-error-pharmacist-held-at-fault-in.html,A Michigan mother whose un wnated eighth baby was born because of a pharmacists error has won what a lawyer writing in a medical journal says is an important legal decision that raises provocative questions The questions concern issues arising from thirdparty insur ance company payments as damages for rearing the un wanted child In the case that William J Curran described in a recent is sue of the New England Journal of Medicine each morning the mother faithfully swallowed what she thought was the birth control pill that her physician had prescribed Reassured she continued to have sexual inter course without fear of preg nancy Instead she soon discovered that her calm mood was due to the tranquilizer that she was in fact taking The tranquilizer had no contraceptive benefit Somehow the pharmacist mis takenly had handed her the wrong tablets when filling her prescription The provocative questions re late to the costs of rearing an unwanted child ethical prob lems concerning abortions and social issues about parent child relationships and even vis iting rights The court focused its discussion on the economics of child rearing The costs of rearing the un wanted eighth child were just one of four reasons why the mother and her husband sued the druggist The others were The pain and anxiety of the pregnancy and childbirth Medical and hospital ex penses The wifes loss of wages owing to pregnancy childbirth and child rearing A judge in a lower court in Michigan dismissed the case summarily But the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed the decision held that all four bas es of recovery were actionable and ordered a jury to assess damages on the allegations Mr Curran said in an inter view from his office at the Har vard School of Public Health in Boston where he teaches legal medicine that the case is now expected to go to a jury in six months Pharmacist Held Negligent The pharmacist was clearly negligent the court said Mr Curran said that the court did not discuss the way it deter mined that the pharmacist not the mother erred in switching the tranquilizer for the contra ceptive Most birth control pills are dispensed on dial cards Tranquilizers generally are dis pensed in bottles The court rejected the argu ment that the joys of bringing up a child outweigh the expens es Mr Curran said He added that the court held that in modern times the value of the services of a child are largely illusory The question of aborting the unwanted child was raised But Mr Curran said The court ruled as a matter of law that no mother wed or unwed can reasonably be required to abort [even if legal] or place her child for adoption Under the damage award principle Mr Curran said that the pharmacist is basically re quired to furnish the funds to bring up another persons child The family he said has the child does not have to abort it or place it for adoption but nevertheless does not want it and considers it  legally and publiclya burden it wants someone else to pay for to bring up Mr Curran said that he guessed such a judgment in volving a full life expectancy could approach 700000
Some Who Decided Against Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/29/archives/some-who-decided-against-abortion.html,Some young and pregnant girls sat in a semicircle in a small conference room not far from the delivery room at Lenox Hill Hospital where each would soon give birth to a childout of wed lock They were explaining why when abortion is legal and availablethey had not had one Its just not right When youve been condi tioned by religion against it its impossible My sister had an abortion and she hasnt been right since She carries a little puppy around just like a baby My boyfriend said You get rid of that kid and Ill kill you I had a life in me and couldnt kill it The discussion was part of a series of group counsel ing sessions given by the hospitals Department of Ob stetrics and Gynecology under a program called Family Life and Education Various Backgrounds The girls whose real names are different were from various social and eco nomic backgrounds The talk ranged from men to mothers to motherhood Nearly all were going to give their babies up for adoption None expected to regret that decision despite recent court cases involving at tempts by mothers to re claim their children Jane a tall and handsome girl who has attempted sui cide several times has an other baby a boy in a foster home A doctor once suggest ed abortion to her I told him I could feel the kid kicking she said We can do it anyway the doctor had replied Jane seemed shocked at that idea my psychiatrist never mentioned abortion she added If the mothertobe decides on adoption it helps to talk out with others similarly sit uated the pain involved in deciding whether to see the baby at all to hold it and feed it And to talk about the babys father To help the girls examine these prob lems was the purpose of the sessions Ann was possibly the only one in the group who was still seeing the father of her child They plan marriage eventually Most of the fathers had abdicated the situation This is usually the case Dr Nini Vas Dias psycholo gist in charge pointed out And it shakes the girls con fidence in men I told him about the baby but he wouldnt help me said one little girl who looked not more than a child There was carefully con trolled emotion in Joans voice She was older than the others It took a long time to get over him and I dont want to think about him Im going to handle it alone Pregnancy is not a good thing to base a marriage on Lillian said explaining why she wouldnt really want to marry the man who is the father of her child Lillian didnt know if he knew about the baby She had written him four letters and had not had an answer Helen didnt want anything to do with the father of her baby I found out he got four other girls pregnant hell be doing it all his life she said sadly Living Away From Home The girls are referred to Lenox Hill by several homes for unwed mothers where for a variety of reasons they live before their babies are born Dr Vas Dias mentioned social stigma parental dis approval and younger broth ers and sisters at home among the reasons Usually the girl has no other place to go God wants me to have this baby because Im healthy and theres a couple some where who want a baby and cant have one Ann said Helen agreed If you put the baby up for adoption you know its going to have a good life An adoption agen cy is going to see to that Im glad Im pregnant Janes new baby like her first was to go to a foster home Her eyes were anxious as she said I just want to keep it until it doesnt cry any more in the night and wake them up Sometimes girls want to keep their babies but they are a little vague about how they can manage it If Im going to have it I want to see it definitely And if I see it Ill probably keep it said one of the girls Will you be able to asked Dr Vas Dias gently Well I want whats best for me and the baby she answered with a bit of un certaintly in her voice Family Hostility Dr as Dias asked how the girls felt toward their moth ers and how their mothers felt about their being preg nant Later she explained that competition with the mother is often a hidden rea son for getting pregnant Being pregnant puts a girl in the same situation as her mother My mother hates me said a pretty and childlike wisp of a girl Mine called me this morn ing said Ann She wants to come and see me I prefer not to see her There would be all sorts of vibrations We never got along not even when I was small What was wrong asked Dr Vas Dias We just didnt hit it off We got a little closer when I grew up Then she added as an afterthought Shes niceas long as I dont live with her Were like North Pole and South Pole when Im in the house said Jane If Im out of the house its just fine Helen described what hap pened when she told her mother about being pregnant Sit down I told her I have something to tell you Im pregnant She didnt speak She left the room I cried She didnt talk to me so I packed up and got out Then she called Now she says its my decisionabout adoption Otherwise shes good We never quarreled much Contraception Discussed My mother cried when I told her because my boy friend is far away and doesnt take care of me said Maria who talked very little The subject of contracep tion evoked a little conversa tion and a little laughter We didnt think about it Maybe now Ill get a life time supply of pills But pills prevent nature from doing its part said Jane The intrauterine device was mentioned Jane seemed interested Could it be put in before I leave the hos pital she asked Just before the session end ed Ann said Everybody wants to give a baby a mother and a father You dont have to be married to do that To be married is like So cial Security answered Jane Some kids brought up out of wedlock have a hard time Helen agreed Its better for a baby to have a father Everybody says the baby should have a name Whats the matter with my name asked Ann Then she laughed

The Talk of New York,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/02/archives/businessmen-here-pitch-in-to-help-liberal-presidential-aspirants.html,Successful businessmen who select politicians as objects of their charity usually cringe in horror at such words as left or even liberal Yet it is a rule of thumb that those Presidential candidates who attract such labels have an even stronger dependence on the business community here than rivals who are called middleoftheroad or con servative This paradox can easily be misunderstood It is emphatically not that most of the big political money raised in New York flows in the direction of such candidates only that no other business community in the country will provide them with more than a trickle It is calculated that onethird of the funds raised for Richard M Nixon in 1968 came from New York for Eugene McCarthy the proportion was closer to twothirds The big givers who wrote checks for the McCarthy campaign liked to think of themselves as a new breed of socially conscious businessmen They were responding to the Vietnam war and the disaffection of their children they would say not to their narrow need as businessmen for dependable contacts at the highest level in Washington The big money is mostly selfinterest money Its raised by the contractors the investment houses and the public relations men said Martin Fife a manufacturer of synthetic leathers who flew on an impulse to New Hampshire at primary time in 1968 Since he was ready to contribute more than enthusiasm he was rapidly promoted there to a finance chairman The McCarthy money was conscience money it was emotion money he said  Four years later there is still money for candidates who talk of peace and new priorities but the emotions are tinged with nostalgia and subject like the money to rationing The nostalgia is for the quondam Minnesota Senator who appears to have lost his hold on youth but still evokes strong loyalties in a few executive suites here the rationing is for candidates likely to be competing for that money at least until spring notably Senator George McGovern Mayor Lindsay and Representative Paul N McCloskey Jr Its a funny thing with McCarthy and some businessmen remarked one executive active in liberal politics and fund raising Its the first time they were ever exposed to a Presidential candidate in depth Its a little like their first blonde They dont want to let him go While they wait for an oracle on Mr McCarthys plans and further thinning of the ranks of candidates some of the big givers are sitting on their checkbooks They dont want to contribute to a fratricide they say A few believing they have learned enough about politics in the last four years to function effectively as strategists are concentrating on promoting a coalition of the McGovern McCarthy and Lindsay forces Stewart R Mott the politically wayward son of General Motors largest shareholder explained how this can be done Taking a sheet of paper he drew three overlapping circles then shaded in a tiny figure in the center That he said was the area of common interest that had to be enlarged They could he suggested set forth the issues alphabeticallyabortion amnesty and so forth Abortion and amnesty for draft resisters may not be the issues candidates are planning to dwell on in 1972 but they will listen carefully to Mr Mott who says his political contributions have amounted to 500000 since 1968 when he worked for Mr McCarthy after getting no response from Nelson A Rockefeller a man even wealthier than himself Mr Mott says he has made token contributions of 5000 each to the McGovern and McCarthy campaigns plus 2000 for Mr McCloskey He gave Mayor Lindsay 55000 for his reelection effort in 1969 and would gladly give him a token contribution now for a Presidential campaign he says but hasnt been asked Mr Fife has also been in touch with the Lindsay camp but hasnt been asked for a dime His inference wasnt that the Mayor was still undecided about running rather he concluded that the Lindsay campaign chest was already wellprovisioned Mr Mott says he spends 10 per cent of his time concentrating on his investment portfolio in an effort to maximize profits for social and political programs He sees no justification for legal limits on the contributions he makes to candidates which are peanuts in any case he says compared to money spent by businessmen seeking to advance business interests The real issue in campaign spending he contends is full disclosure which Mr Mott practices relentlessly unlike the overwhelming majority of major political contributors If the bill passed by the House of Representatives on Tuesday becomes law all contributions to Presidential and Congressional candidates of more than 100 will have to be reported By contrast Mr Fifes concentration on his business comes close to commanding 90 per cent of his time He is clear that what he does in politics by favoring candidates who generally urge heavier taxes on business is very much against my selfinterest as a businessman While he is skeptical about the practicality of proposals to limit large campaign contributions he says he would welcome the opportunity to pursue his political avocation in activities other than finance  Howard Stein the chairman of the Dreyfus Fund who is generally held to be Mr McCarthys most loyal financier believes that businessmen bring a special competence to politics and that more of them are ready now to extend themselves beyond checkwriting Taking time out the other afternoon from his study of stock performance charts in his luxuriously spare aerie in the General Motors Building Mr Stein theorized that a McCarthy  type administration would be good for the country and good for the economy too If most businessmen fail to recognize that now he said that merely demonstrates that 85 per cent of anything just goes along Robert T Bernstein who is president of Random House hasnt been convinced by his experience as a McGovern fund raiser that even those businessmen who dont go along show any special aptitude for politics Businessmen talk about being socially conscious he said I know I try to be But end to end any day Ive done more for me than I have for society Big contributions to campaigns like Senator McGoverns are not normally dictated by crass selfinterest but the big givers Mr Bernstein finds still feel a need to get close to the candidate and make an impression on him One executive gave 5000 after a private dinner in Washington with the candidate Since then he has called Mr Bernstein twice to express reservations about the Senators stand on particular issues that interest him When you try to raise money you listen the publisher said Its amazing how much opinion you have to listen to just to raise 500 For a man whos running for the Presidency its a terribly demeaning thing
WASHINGTON,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/03/archives/pearl-harbor-30.html,WASHINGTON Dec 2It is now just thirty years since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and Washington and Tokyo are fussing at each other again over money and trade but the present squabbles should not be exaggerated Looking back over this first postwar generation both countries have behaved very well and have established a relationship which should contribute to the peace and wellbeing of the world in the last thirty years of the century Optimism is out of fashion these days and the latest gloomy headline seems to overwhelm the slow and painful achievements of a whole era but in the long history of warfare between nations it is hard to find anything comparable to the generosity of the victors and the spectacular recovery of the vanquished in the thirty years since the end of that savage and tragic war One of the amiable characteristics of the American people is that they have no memory They are not haters They dont nurse their grudges It must be a surprise to most readers even to be reminded that Dec 7 is the thirtieth anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack for there is no vengeful spirit in this country toward the Japanese people For all our foibles and troubles we are still looking to the future and while it may be a little prideful to toot our own horn on the point maybe it is justifiable for nobosly else seems to be dramatizing Americas good qualities these days The Japanese record since the war is even more remarkable After all it was easier for us to be generous in victory than for the Japanese to be patient industrious and triumphant in defeat And this is precisely what the Japanese nation has done Stripped of its territorial conquests squeezed back with its hundred million people into its limited island space deprived of natural resources surrounded by the giants America China and the Soviet Union it has rescued its national sovereignty and integrity and by almost unimaginable gifts of intelligence industry and cooperation it has become the third industrial the in the world and certainly the most imaginative and cooperative human society in the family of nations It is only when you look at a few simple symbolic facts that you begin to understand the magnitude of the Japanese achievement They had to take their national life by the throat They had to control not only industrial and commercial life but personal life at its most intimate level They could not Sustain a rising population accordingly brutal as it may seem live births in Japan in the postwar generation have been outnumbered by volunteer abortions Just as they had too many people so they had too few raw materialsno minerals to speak of and no fuel to process them Yet they created a river of oil tankers from the Middle East one every fifty miles every hour of every dayand a flood of freighters carrying the coal and steel they do not have at home Washington and Tokyo are arguing with one another now not because they have failed in their relations over the period since the war but because they have succeeded beyond the dreams of either capital Now the problem is to get a successful and competitive Japan to share the common burdens of maintaining peace in the Pacific basin without reviving her militaristic traditions without destroying her economic progress and without destroying her ambitions to be on good terms not only with the United States but with the other two major powers in the Pacific China and the Soviet Union It is a very delicate operation and President Nixons voyage to Peking in February illustrates the challenge For it used to be thought that Japan close to China and the United States might be able to bring Washington and Peking together in a common understanding of their common problems but now ironically by his imaginative opening to Peking President Nixon is in a position to try to bring China and Japan together It will not be easy for he will have to reassure Chou Enlai that the United States does not want Japan to feel so isolated that Japan has to develop her own nuclear weapons which she obviously has the scientific and industrial power to do Against this background the differences between the United States and Japan about the dollar and the yen and trade restrictions and cotton quotas in North Carolina seem very small indeed USJapanese relations for peace and progress in the world are far more important not only for Washington and Tokyo but for Peking and Moscow as well On the thirtieth anniversary of Pearl Harbor the understanding of the United States and Japan over the last generation is vital to peace and accommodation with China and the Soviet Union in the Pacific Washington and Tokyo have demonstrated in the last generation that even the most violent wars between nations can be composed The problem now is to avoid narrower differences over money and trade and try to bring all the major Pacific powersthe US the USSR China and Japantogether to create a new order in the Pacific President Nixon has a real chance here in his February meeting with Chou Enlai For he has an opportunity not

A Lawyer Challenges the Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/04/archives/a-lawyer-challenges-the-abortion-law.html,A 40year old professor of law at Fordham University was named special guardian yesterday of all human fetuses between the 4th and 24th weeks of gestation scheduled to be aborted in the municipal hospitals here In an unusual prelude to what is believed to be the first major constitutional attack or the states recently liberalized abortion law State Supreme Court Justice Lester Holtzman appointed Prof Robert M Byrn legal guardian of the unborn whose lives in Professor Byrns words are threatened by abortion Justice Holtzman also signed an order directing the citys Health and Hospitals Corporation to show cause why the hospitals should not refrain from performing any further abortions pending the outcome of the challenge The showcause order will be argued Tuesday in State Supreme Court in Queens The suit was filed by Professor Byrn whose specialty is criminal law It charged that the states abortion law violated the 14th Amendment to the Constitution which holds in part that no state shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law As of last June 165000 abortions had been done in the city in the first year of the the law which essentially leaves the decision up to the woman and her doctor It has been estimated that about 60 per cent of the abortions here were performed on women from other states and countries The abortions must be performed within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy under the state law The appointment of special guardians by the court is a longstanding practice that is utilized when a judge determines that any allegedly injured person or group of persons cannot adequately represent themselves in court such as infants or incompetents Lawyers here said they could not recall any previous appoint ment of a guardian for an unborn person Mr Bryne who is unniiarried said that his opposition to the present abortion law has nothing to do with theology In asking the court to name the special guardian Mr Byrne said that a 24weekold fetus has a pulsating albeit primitive human heart The absence of heart pulsation is one of the indicia of human death he told the court Conversely the presence of a heart beat signifies the presence of life
She's Fighting Conviction For Aborting Her Child,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/04/archives/shes-fighting-conviction-for-aborting-her-child.html,DAYTONA BEACH Fla Dec 3Life for 23yearold Shirley Wheeler has always been on the shadow side of the American dream The eighth child of a southern millhand her mother died when she was 13 months old and her alcoholic father abandoned the brood She Was raised by friends and relatives in North Carolina and by the age of 16 she was castoff And two years lateras a result she says of being raped by two youthsshe was a mother Now Shirley Wheeler has been found guilty in Florida of aborting another child she carried and did not want The first woman in the state ever prosecuted and convicted under an abortion law that has its origins in the early 19th century she is also believed to be the first American woman ever held criminally responsible for submitting to abortion and possibly the first in the Englishspeaking world Im a convicted felon now because I chose not to bring another child into this world that I couldnt afford to take care of Miss Wheeler said this week in an interview I was afraid of having an abortion but I was even more afraid of having another baby Miss Wheelers appeal is now before the Florida Supreme Court She was convicted of manslaughter last July after a twoday trial under the provisions of an abortion law that was copied by Florida in 1866 from a New York statute that was written nearly 40 years earlier The state charged that she had assisted in the termination of the life of a quick fetus one that had moved inside the womb Sentenced to Two Years Miss Wheeler did not deny that she had had the abortion but she contended that the fetus was less than 5 months old at the time and that she had never experienced fetal movement She was sentenced in October to two years probation Miss Wheeler whose long auburn hair frames a lightly freckled face shares a small Daytona Beach flat with Robert Wheeler a 100aweek binder in a local printing shop They are not married although Miss Wheeler has taken his name She says that she could not marry Mr Wheeler even if she chose to because she is still legally the wife of South Carolina man she lived with briefly at 18 after the birth of her son The son is now being raised by her relatives Miss Wheelers conviction has made her an instant heroinemartyr figure to thousands of other women in the nation who see her as a victim of archaic abortion laws She was cheered when she spoke last month at a Womens National Abortion Action Coalition rally in Washington by a crowd that carried signs demanding Defend Shirley Wheeler She is strangely cast in the role for her white working class background contrasts sharply with that of the women who support her For the most part they tend to be middle class frequently college educated and often black A Loose Legal Liaison Shirley is a very compelling person said Nancy Stearns a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights in Washington who is handling the appeal Shes quiet and unassuming yet very strong in her beliefs And shes not just a middleclass kid who got in trouble Shes been through a lot of hard times The case has even fostered a loose legal liaison between elements in the Womens Liberation Movement and Playboy magazine a frequent target of feminists who describe its content as wellspring of sexism This case is too important to get involved in philosophical disputes with [feminists] declared Burton Joseph executive director of the Playboy Forum Foundation which has entered the Wheeler case as a friend of the court Our only goal is to abolish an unconstitutional discriminatory law    and that should be their goal too Like other Florida coastal cities Daytona Beach has a nucleus of young counterculture drifters They are lured here by the sun and other attractions of a resort area They fill menial jobs and usually are blamed by the local authorities for increases in petty crime or drug abuse The Wheelers lived on the fringe of this group staying clear of trouble except for one occasion when she was fined 18 for slandering a policeman who had given her a jaywalking ticket Until her arrest on the abortion charge she held lowpaying jobs as a sewing machine operator and a clerk in a wig shop A Refusal to Cooperate Miss Wheeler contends that she was prosecuted by the local authorities because of her life style because she was not wealthy and because she refused to cooperate with the police and identify her abortionist Horace Smith the prosecutor said charges were filed because for the first time authorities had both proof of the abortion and a corpus delecti the fetus He said they were found when Miss Wheeler was hospitalized during a miscarriage She had gone to the hospital when she began hemorrhaging and both the fetus and a catheter were found The authorities learned that about a month earlier when Miss Wheeler was about 3 months pregnant she had gone to an abortionist who inserted a catheter to cut off supplies to the fetus and thereby induce a miscarriage We of course could have made some arrangements if she had turned states evidence against the abortionist Mr Smith said but she told us it was none of our business Miss Wheeler remains as adamant today although she said that the fear of going to prison had given her an ulcer Ive really had some bad luck in my life and I dont want to bring a child into this world who may have to go through the same thing said Miss Wheeler a softspoken woman who describes herself as average in everythingintelligence ability and looks Miss Wheeler said she still experiences guilt feelings that her own birth contributed to the early death of her mother She said her first attempt at abortion after the rape in North Carolina was an experience shared by many unwed pregnant teenagers I felt so ashamed and dirty and had no one to turn to she said I kept it secret for five months and during that time I went to every dance I could and jumped off the front porch every night In the last months of that pregnancy she said she developed a condition that caused high blood pressure and other ailments that later prevented her from using birth control pills or intrauterine devices She drifted to Daytona Beach four years ago and met Mr Wheeler In 1969 she underwent her first successful abortion when she was six weeks pregnant Another pregnancy the following year was the one that led to her arrest Since then Mr Wheeler has had a vasectomy she said
The New Mystery — Maybe,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/05/archives/the-new-mystery-maybe-miracle-drug-the-new-mystery-maybe-miracle.html,LIKE all really difficult ques tions the one posed by the young Indian pharmacologist at Makerere University in Kam pala Uganda had the teasing ele ment of unexplained universal ex perience Why Dr Sultan H M Karim wondered did the umbilical cord stop bleeding after child birth  Logic and training led him to the working hypothesis that some substance in the wombs amniotic fluid caused the bleeding artery within the cord to contract He was still trying to identify the healing agent in his laboratory in 1966 when his reading led him correctly to suspect a newly identified group of hormones called prostaglandins Within three years he had gone far beyond the answer to his original question He had used injections of prostaglan din to safely induce labor in a sizable number of patientsand to abort one prized but injudi ciously pregnant Siamese cat Prostaglandin research exten sive enough five years ago to ac cidentally provide Karims clue has since undergone an explosive growth and now constitutes one of the most promising fields in the biological sciences An estimated 500 laboratories around the world are working on prostaglandins new scientific reports on the sub ject are appearing at the rate of almost two a day THE prostaglandins are a group of 14 compoundsthere may be others not yet identified  present in human beings and all other mammals They are classified as hormones The wellknown hor mones produced by the thyroid and pituitary glands however are circulated through the body by the blood and act on distant tar get organs In contrast the pros taglandins are produced by virtu ally all tissues of the body and act on the spot and they are involved in both pathology and normal body functioning The 14 identified so far resemble one another in basic chemical structure They can be classified as 20carbon acidic lipids the fatty substances present in cells Yet the minor chem ical differences among them make possible greatly differing effects There seems little doubt that if they live up to their early promise the prostaglandins will provide the basis for a shelf of highly ef fective medicines That day is in the indefinite future the wide variety of drugs now being tested are all considered experimental and none are commercially avail able They include some drugs capable of opening closed airways to the lungs making them poten tially useful in treating asthma and emphysema and some which clear the clogged nasal passages familiar to commoncold sufferers There are prostaglandins which shut off the secretion of stomach acid indicating possible value for pepticulcer control Several lower blood pressure apparently with out the undesirable side effects possessed currently available antihypertensive medications It is in the field of reproduction that the prostaglandins have truly startling implications Used in the early weeks of preg nancy a tiny amount of prostag landinon the order of a ten thousandth of an ouncehas pro duced therapeutic abortions Con traception once a month after intercourse and even conception is a distinct possibility Trials with hundreds of women have shown that within a few hours after use of vaginal suppositories containing prostaglandin menstruation begins whether or not conception has oc curred Some investigators think it may not even be necessary to use the suppositories as often as once a month They speculate that a woman would need to insert them only if she was late with her period on the average this might be no more than three or four times a year They regard pros taglandins as postconceptive con traceptives offering women the luxury of hindsight in determining whether they wish to be pregnant Though considerable research remains to be done to establish not only the safety but the best method of using such contracep tives controversy will not wait Those engaged in population con trol are enthusiastic Prostaglan dins have such new qualities and importance says Dr Reimert T Ravenhold director of the Office of Population of the US Agency for International Development that they might mean as much in controlling the reproductive proc ess as the introduction of penicil lin meant in fighting infection In England Dr Malcolm Potts medical secretary of the Inter national Planned Parenthood Foundation predicts that once techniques for using prostaglan dins are perfected they will by their availability and cheapness mean that every woman who wanted to could have the means of abortion in her own hands We shall see a complete rethinking of our moral and social attitudes to laywoman calls postconceptive contraceptive a euphemism for abortion She adds As a Catho lic I am of course opposed to both contraception and abortion But there are millions of non Catholics who while they do not object to contraception recoil in horror at the very thought of abortion Others shrink from that pros pect In a letter to Medical World News Penni Mulvihill a Catholic There will probably be less dis agreement with the practical argu ment advanced by Norman Apple Zweig a New York biochemist who says The birthcontrol pill isnt working satisfactorily The majority of the people we have to reach arent motivated enough to seek out a means of contracep tion The only way to get the ma jority of the 450 million women of childbearing age in the world is to get them when theyve got something in their belly The woman is motivated enough then if she doesnt want another mouth to feed A useful abortioninduc ing agent is the only answer for population control and Pros taglandins may very well be it That many women have second or first  thoughts about their pregnancies is both common knowledge and statistically de monstrable In the first year after easily available abortion became legal in July 1970 in New York State more than 200000 women had pregnancies terminated THE research will not wait for the debate either It is likely that every major drug company in the world is actively researching some aspect of prostaglandin The Upjohn Company a pioneer in the field which has some 700 scientific investigators in its Kala mazoo Mich research labora tories prefers not to divulge how many of them are involved in prostaglandin studies But some officials note that what is going on now not necessarily at Upjohn alone is reminiscent of the days when cortisone and other steroid hormones first appearedand as much as half of a pharmaceutical firms research effort went into them One measure of the com mercial and academic effort under is in the increased production of research papers Of 1200 scien tific reports on prostaglandins published up to 1970 800 ap peared in 1968 and 1969 The history of prostaglandin re search has most of the familiar chaptersfalse starts dedicated dogged investigators accidental linkups a tantalizing shortage of natural materials and finally syn thetic manufacture to permit mul tiple experiments Prostaglandins presented an additional problem Though omnipresent in the body they are there in such tiny quanti ties that they could not be iso lated and studied without rela tively recent analytical techniques As long ago as 1930 two New York City gynecologists with an interest in fertility problems Drs Raphael Kurzrok and C C Lieb had what seems to have been an unconsummated relationship with prostaglandins They discovered that strips of uterine tissue from women with histories of success ful pregnancies relaxed when ex posed to fresh semen while that from sterile women contracted But if Kurzrok and Lieb followed up on these promising observa tions they reported nothing fur ther MiracleDrug Three years later two investi gators working independently of each other made similar discover ies but pursued their implica tions In England Dr Maurice W Goldblatt was studying human semen in Sweden Prof Ulf S von Euler of the Karolinska Institute was working with extracts of sheep vesicular glands which pro duce semen Both found that when they injected either material into test animals it caused smooth muscle to contract and also low ered blood pressure neither effect could be accounted for by any known agents Von Euler coined the name prostaglandin for the material produced in the prostate A misnomer he apparently be lieved it was produced only in the prostate it has stuck neverthe less World War II interrupted von Eulers work After the war he concentrated on other research the isolation and identification of a basic nervoussystem compound noradrenalinewhich was to earn him a Nobel Prize But he encour aged a younger colleague at Karol inska Prof Sune Bergstrom a physician and biochemist to try to isolate prostaglandin and deter mine its structure The quiet hard working Bergstrom now 55 de voted his career to prostaglandin work and perhaps more than any body else deserves the credit for all that is happening now in the field His first need was for huge quantities of sheep glands He turned for financial help to Dr David I Weisblat an American friend he had met in the early nineteenforties when both were doing postdoctoral work at Ohio State University Weisblat a bio chemist who is now vice president for pharmaceutical research at Upjohn got his company to fi nance the purchase and refrigera tion of several tons of sheep glands Not until 1957 did Bergstrom succeed in isolating two different prostaglandin it took him an other five years to establish their precise architecture In the view of Dr John A Hogg Upjohns director of experimental chemistry and biology Bergstroms role in the field constitutes the stuff Nobel Prizes are made of But Bergstroms breakthrough could not be fully exploited Natural sup plies of the compounds were meager there were not enough available glands in the world to permit extensive biological test ing ONLY total synthesis of pros taglndins  production from chemicals right off the shelf cheaply and in large quantity could provide the logistical base for the broad research and exten sive clinical testing that was nec essary It came in two steps In 1964 and 1965 investigators at three laboratories Karolinska Unilever in the Netherlands and Upjohn discovered how to pro duce prostaglandin by biosyn thesis They started with a com mon fatty acid such as arachi donic acid when they incubated it with sheep glands enzymes in the glands converted the acid to prostaglandins This biosynthetic method of production permitted the distribution of prostaglandin at least in small lots of 10 and 20 grams to researchers all over the world In 1968 at Upjohn and in the laboratory of Dr E J Corey professor of chemistry at Har vard total synthesis began to be achieved for one after another of the prostaglandins On the basis of their structures prostaglandins have been divided into four main categories E F A and B Three each of the E and F groupsE1 E2 E3 and Fialpha F2alpha F3alphaare considered primary in that none is derived from any of the others The re maining eight members of the family are produced by modifica tion of the primaries As investigators have worked with increased supplies they have been able to resolve a number of seemingly unrelated mysteries Almost a quarter of a century ago Dr W Vogt a German researcher found a substance produced by the intestines which influenced bowel contractions he called it darrnstoff About 15 years ago a Welsh physiologist V R Pic kles discovered a substance which caused powerful contractions of the uterus during menstruation he called it menstrual stimulant In 1965 Dr James B Lee and a St Louis University team re ported that something in the rab bit kidney lowered blood pressure Recent research has shown all three substances are prostaglan dins Among the most dramatic find ings were those of Dr Karim the pharmacologist in Uganda who knew nothing about prostag landins but was intrigued by the functioning of the umbilical cord after birth When he read of prostaglandins in 1966 he ob tained samples of the hormones and was quickly able to establish their presence in the amniotic fluid He determined that an F prostaglandin not only is predomi nant in the fluid during labor but also appears in the maternal blood at the same time and that its level in the blood correlates close ly with uterine contractions His next step was a substantial test of prostaglandins as agents for the inducement of labor and childbirth in women at or near term His subjects were 300 women mostly Bantus who needed inducement be cause of postmaturlty prema ture rupture of the mem branes or other complications of pregnancy Using intra venous injections he admin istered oxytocin a standard laborinducing drug to 100 it failed to induce labor in 44 Another group of 100 received F1alpha which failed in 33 The remaining 100 were given E2 which brought on labor in 96 It seemed to Karim that if prostaglandins could induce labor late in pregnancy they might induce abortion early When a neighbors prize Siamese became pregnant by the next door ginger tom much to her owners distress he recalls I gave the Sia mese F2alpha and that solved that By 1969 both Karim in Uganda and Dr G M Filshie of Kings College London were reporting successful therapeutic abortions using intravenous injections with only minor side effects of vomiting and diarrhea in some patients There were reports that one prostaglandin ad ministered orally at or near the time for delivery success fully induced labor But then came reports that prostaglandins did not always trigger complete abortion in cluding expulsion of the con ceptus the fertilized ovum In some cases the injections in duced dilation of the cervix but curettage had to be used to complete the abortion Med ical authorities took a hard look at some of the early studies and found the defini tion of success had not been standardized when dilation alone occurred the case may have been listed as a success ful abortion Cautions Dr Leon Speroff of Yale Clearly dilation of the cervix is not a successful abortion If one is trying to evaluate the efficacy of an abortifacient agent use of the term success must be re served for a complete abor tion How often and un der what circumstances pros taglandin produce complete abortion and how that suc cess rate might be increased by changes in dosages and methods of administration are questions to be answered by future research But even when they are only partially successful the compounds still could have considerable value in therapeutic abortion Says Dr Speroff The fact that prostaglandin may di late the cervix but not result in expulsion of the conceptus raises the possibility of their use prior to curettage thereby eliminating the use of dilators with their attendant danger of perforation Perhaps too anesthesia requirements would be lowered or eliminated It is as an afterthefact contraceptive that prostaglan din will doubtless receive the most public attention Though much remains to be done a good deal has already been established A group of Up john investigators has shown that prostaglandin is the mysterious uterine factor which each month causes the corpus luteum to regress The corpus luteumliterally yel low bodyregularly develops after ovulation in the cavity left by the discharged ovum in the ovary It produces a hormone progesterone that readies the uterus to receive and nest the egg if concep tion occurs It had been known that when fertilization does not take place some thing caused the corpus lute um to regress and stop pro ducing progesterone When that happens menstruation follows When the researchers tried administering F2alpha to rats for any consecutive three  day period from day 4 through day 13 after mat ing the corpus was affected and pregnancy was termi nated Trials In humans followed and are still going on By Sep tember 1970 at a conference on prostaglandins sponsored by the New York Academy of Sciences and attended by more than 500 physicians and scientists from arouna the world Karim could report that he and his colleagues had effected normal menstruation in 11 of 12 women who had conceived and missed their periods for two to seven days Vaginal suppositories contain ing either E2 or F2alpha were used Each woman received two the second inserted four hours after the first There were side effectsnausea and abdominal pain similar to menstrual painbut these it seemed to both Karim and the women were a small price to pay At the same meeting Dr Marc Bygdeman of the Karol inska Institute reported simi lar results without side ef fects when F2alpha was in jected directly intd the uterine cavity a few days after the first missed period In cur rent tests 200 women in Sweden Britain and Uganda are using prostaglandins in ceptives to induce abortion as soon as they miss a period The use of prostaglandin as a contraceptive bas no connec tion with recently publicized research in which a synthetic form of the female hormone estrogen has been used in ef fect as a morningafter pill Aside from their potential value in contraception and therapeutic abortion prosta glandins may paradoxically help at least some infertile males to have children Ac cording to studies by Dr Bygdeman at Karolinska and Dr Bengt Samuelsson at Stockholms Royal Veterinary College male fertility may be related at least partially to prostaglandin levels in the se men In 40 per cent of the semen samples taken from men with otherwise unex plained infertility the re searchers have found low lev els about half of those for normally fertile men They are now trying to determine whether the deficiency can be overcome and fertility in creased We pick out men with a low content says Dr Samuelsson We then carry out tests to make sure neither other abnormalities E1 is then mixed with the infertile males semen and artificial insemination is undertaken The hope is that the added prostaglandin will stimulate uterine contractions thus moving the sperm more quickly to the Fallopian tubes to meet the ovum But both investigators emphasize that there is not yet enough infor mation to support this theory THE catalogue of current prostaglandin research apart from the investigations in the area of reproduction is a lengthy one holding the prom ise of alleviation of a variety of human ills  At the Upjohn laborator ies Dr Andr Robert a FrenchCanadian has shown that when dogs are given either E1 or E2 intravenously their gastric secretions are re duced In experiments with rats he has demonstrated that ulcers ordinarily pro duced in a variety of experi mental ways including ad ministration of cortisonelike drugs are prevented by E1 It seems likely that there is a relationship between the re duced gastric secretions and the prevention of ulcers And since it is now known that the stomach produces E Pros taglandins which may play a role in the normal regulation of secretions the theory has been developed that people with ulcers may have a de ficiency of the compounds Working on that assump tion investigators in New York Ohicago and San Fran cisco gave prostaglandin in travenously to human volun teers including some with ulcers Their gastric secre tions were greatly reduced The next step will be to de termine if ulcers can be cured this way if they can an at tempt will be made to find a more convenient oral method of administration  Such is their versatility that the same prostaglandin E1 and E2 which inhibit stomach secretions nicely open up air passages to the lungs and also constrict blood vessels in the nasal passages to produce a decongestant ef fect Dr M F Cuthbert of London Hospital Medical Col lege has used an E1 aerosol in asthmatic patients with promising results And at Em ory University in Atlanta Dr Richard T Jackson whose subjects included some per sons with colds has found that the same compound has a nasal decongestant effect that lasts up to 14 hours  One of the major uses for prostaglandins may be in the treatment of hypertension a problem that affects 20 mil lion Americans and is consid ered a prime factor in heart disease In a small proportion of cases no more than 15 per cent there is a definite phys ical abnormality such as a marked narrowing of a blood vessel or an adrenal gland tumor where the cause of hypertension is clear and can usually be corrected surgical ly But in the vast majority of cases the origin is obscure As a result the search for an tihypertensive drugs has had to be empirical those that have been found while useful and often even lifesaving are far from ideal One researcher Dr James B Lee of St Louis University School of Medicine believes that a deficiency of certain prostaglandin naturally pres ent in the kidneys may ex plain many if not most cases of hypertension Nine years ago while at Harvard Lee found that kidney extracts in jected into animals caused a striking drop in their blood pressure He has since estab lished that three active corn pounds in kidney tissue are the prostaglandins F2 F2al pha and Al The only ap parent function of A2 is to lower blood pressure Animal experiments have demon strated that it does its job by relaxing small arteries thus easing blood flow Studies in a human patient with hyper tension have shown the same arteryrelaxing effect and a striking fall in pressure This says Lee supported the theory that high blood pressure is a deficiency dis ease Recently Lee has given A1 to hypertensive patients bringing pressures down from amean elevation of 200100 to a normal 14080 And within five minutes after in fusion of A1 he has noted two other desirable reactions increases in the flow of blood to the kidneys and in excre tion of salt and water two processes often abnormally impeded in hypertensive pa tients Lee believes that in troduction of longlasting compounds particularly if ef fective by mouth may well augur a new era in the con cept diagnosis and treatment of hypertension Prostaglandins may also play a role someday in medi cation to combat thrombo genesis the formation of dangerous blood clots In volved in such clotting are platelets disklike objects in the blood Under some cir cumstances platelets aggre gate or come together and adhere to the internal wall of a blood vessel There they form a thrombus or clot that may lead to fatal blocking of the vessel Some investigators now are convinced that pros taglandins normally regulate platelet aggregation In test tube experiments they have been able to show that El in hibits both aggregation and adhesiveness and they have also used it to suppress thrombus formation in dam aged animal arteries Some recent preliminary work even suggests that prostsglandins may be able to break up and dissolve thrombi Other researchers in the andlovasardar field report that prostaglandins appear to have a digitalislike effect on the heart muscle increasing its efficiency without the toxic effects that digitalis sometimes produces  Recent experiments with animals raise the possibility that prostaglandin may have some value in treating arthri tis At New York University Medical Center Drs Robert B Zanier and Franco Quag liata induced arthritis in rats then treated some of them with Z The untreated animals developed severe persistent arthritis those injected with E1 had little or none Some prostaglandin re search has not yet advanced beyond the stage of fasci nating speculation Prosta glandins in excess seem to be involved in preventing the normal breakdown of fat cells Are prostaglandins re lated to the problem of obesi ty It has also been determined that brain tissue is rich in prostaglandins which are re leased upon stimulation Are prostaglandbis involved in that most mystifying field of all human behavior They are not the only un answered questions Though it has been 40 years since the original clues to prostaglan din were uncovered scien tists recognize that they real ly know very little about them It has been far more difficult to chart their func tions than it was to study the hormones produced by the thyroid pituitary and other special glands To check on the functions of glandpro duced hormones investigators could remove the glands from experimental animals and note the results of deprivation as a doublecheck on their find ings they could inject the hormones and watch the ef fects But with prostaglandins produced by virtually all tis sues ha the body such ap proadaes have not been pas sage With ultimate medicinal uses in mind pharmaceutical lab stories have been pro ducing dozens of antiprosta glendin compounds One type interferes with the bodys production of prostaglandins a second enough like poste glandins to occupy the sites where they normally act blocks their effects by usur pation Encouraging evidence that such research is on the right track came recently in a report described as of enor mous significance by the British journal The New Sci entist For years scientists have watched the lowly aspirin re lieve some of the most fre quent discomforts of man in cluding their own without knowing why or how it worked The New Scientist reported that researchers at the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences at the Royal College of Surgeons in London had demonstrated that aspirin is really countering the effects of a prostaglandin which un der some circumstances in duces fever headaches and inflammation The finding was proof that a simple safe and effective antiprostaglan din medication is already in use and that others may be possible FREQUENTLY however the research findings concerning prostaglandin include as many questions as answers While prostaglandin E from human seminal fluid contracts the seminal organs of the guinea pig it has the opposite effect on the corresponding organs of the rabbit F1alpha and F2 alpha contract all segments of the human uterine tubes E3 relaxes all segments E4 and E4 contract one end and relax the other end While E1 stim ulates the uterus of rat guinea pig and cat as well as human it inhibits the uterus of the rabbit What does all this mean Even the reason for the high concentration of prostaglan dins in human semenas much as 100 times greater than anywhere else in the bodyremains a mystery Dr von Euler and some other in vestigators believe that pros taglandins may not only facil itate ejaculation but cause uterine contractions helpful in transporting the ejaculate Should both these possible effects be proved says von Euler we have in prosta glandins unique hormones di viding their activity between two different organisms to facilitate reproduction That theory too trails questions behind it Apart from man only sheep and monkeys have significant amounts of prosta glandins in their semen And as Dr E W Horton a lead ing British prostaglandin in vestigator has noted wryly other animals seem to have no trouble reproducing sue cessfully Even in their relation to the bodys hormone systems the prostaglandin present a confusing picture in some tissues they further the ac tion of thyroid and other hor mones but in Gazers they in hibit such action A hormone need not affect a cell direct ly by entering and stimulat ing the inner machinery Instead it acts on the cell wall where it causes an en zyme to be released from the wail to the cell interior The enzyme is needed for the production of a remarkable substance called cydic AMP often regarded as a second messengerbormones being the first mesramgers It is cyclic AMP which carries out hormonal dictates within the cell Some researchers have de veloped a theory to resolve the seeming contradictions in the way Prostaglandins be have in various tissues They believe prostaglandin are part of a vast bodily moni toring system in which they encourage or inhibit hormonal activities indirectly by con trolling the enzyme in the cell wall required for production of cyclic AMP Some support for this belief was reported recently at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine where a research team led by Dr G A Robinson found that progaglandins are the only known agents which can raise the level of cydic AMP in some cells and decrease it in others ALTHOUGH the thera peutic dividends of prosta glandin research promise to be extraordinary there seems little disposition to rash imperfectly understood drugs into the marketplace As Yales Dr Speroff says The future of prostaglandin research may well have a crit ical relevance to human wel fare Enthusiasm is justi fied but enthusiasm has to be tempered by caution to avoid poor studies Inefficient effect and premature use Evetywhme the drugs are currently available only to qualified researchers and not for general medical use Clin ical trials in this country under license by the Food and Drug Administration began only last year There is some possibility that pinstaglandins may become available to doc tors in a few countries within a year for injections to induce labor and abortion But it probably will be several years before the drugs can meet stringent Government require ments for evidence of effi cacy and safety and become available for general use in this country Prostaglandins Were only at the threshold Both here and abroad in vestigators are checking on known side effects and how they may be minimized or avoided They are also trying to determine whether any un desirable heart blood gastro intestinal and eadocrinologi cal changes may be brought about by prostaglandinsand how to nullify them if they do occur Eventually many of the prostaglandins may become available in oral as well as injectable form And modi fications of the drugs so called analogues which are already being developed and tested in the laboratory may prove more desirable than the originals That would hardly be surprising The nat urally occurring steroid hor mones cortisone and hydro cortisone have been succeed ed by manmade modifica tions such as prednisone and prednisolone which for spe cific therapeutic jobs are more effective and produce fewer undesirable side effects Nor would it be surprising if many stillunsuspected uses for prestagbmdins remain to be found Four years ago sur veying the state of prosta glandin research Dr John W Richman of Upjohn observed This is an account of begin nings and is of necessity an unfinished story But the gate way to a new frontier has been opened An army of researchers has since crossed the frontier But even now the peat chal lenge of the prostaglandins is that nobody has any idea how vast the territory may be

that can not be usurped the area in which television distinc tively excels is news and public affairs particularly in live coverage of a major event but also in production of the informational or inves tigative documentary The most impressive history of television can be compiled by merely listing the solid achievements in this area  Increasingly there is talk about major museums setting up television archives similar to those already existing for film I Love Lucy would have to be included of course but no more so than Edward R Murrows 1954 See It Now expos of Sen ator Joseph McCarthy This past week in fact the Film Society of Lincoln Center presented its first ma jor tribute to television The Specific recipient The Tele vision News Documentary A Retrospective of CBS News Broadcasts 19521971 Ac cording to Martin E Segal president of the Film Society the television documentary in retrospect has proved it self to be profession and art as well as craft In retrospect also it seems clear that the documentary was to the controversial man ner born If the product is powerful and memorable it is also likely to be contro versial in subject or treat tnent or both That is the paradox creating the con tinual tug  of  war between broadcast journalists and broadcast owners In the past couple of years the owners have been winning The retrospective at Lin coln Center offered ample evidence of how much the viewer may be losing The MurrowFred Friendly years at CBS were amply repre sented including the hard look at migrant farm workers in the 1960 CBS Reports reduction Harvest of Shame But it was also curious to discover how alert television can be in anticipating na tional problems The Popu lation Explosion was shown in 1959 The Business of Heroin in 1964 Abortion and the Law in 1965 The Poisoned Air in 1966long before most of the subjects became fashionable crusades Producers meanwhile tend to feel that the good old days are irretrievable A common remark is that we couldnt do it that way to day Perhaps But in the greatly reduced market there are still heartening in dications that the documen tary form is if not well very much alive  On the evening of Thanks giving Day for prominent example CBS News added another outstanding produc tion to its credits     but what if the Dream comes true produced and written by Robert Markowitz with Perry Wolff as executive pro ducer Where The Selling of the Pentagon provoked journalistic controversy this intelligent examination of The American dream pro yoked thought Where one focused on a single powerful institution the other looked at the very roots of Ameri can life at the credo of com petition and acquisition Markowitz spent eight weeks with his subjects the Greenawalt family in affluent Birmingham Mich a suburb of Detroit Through hard work the Greenawalts have been able to afford isolation in a society of their peers a society conducting a love affair with the obvious good food beautiful clothes the best education The Greenawalts in other words represent the epitome of the American dream And vet something is wrong not with the Greenawalts who emerge as decent wellmeaning people but with the dream itself The children of the com munity have never known poverty but they do know drugs and shoplifting for kicks Mrs Greenawalt has won all of her competitions for husband family and beautiful homeand now goes to sensitivity sessions in search of fulfillment Mr Greenawalt is under strong pressures as senior vice presi dent of a Detroit bank and feels his family doesnt fully understand those pressures  The family has worked hard to win its safety in socialcultural isolation from the exploding cities yet Mr Greenawalt worries about his son not being able to relate to a boy who has had noth ing My sons problem is that he goes with WASPs with the same kind of people we are    One of the rea sons we moved to Birming ham was to insulate him in that but I want him to grow out of it too In a memorable scene the family invites three black boys to dinner in what the documentary describes as an attempt to give their chil dren their first knowledge of the world outside while pro tecting them from being hurt by it In an awkward situa tion for all concerned the three boys from the poverty of the city prove to be more sophisticated and assured than the children who have never known poverty  In the end the Greena walts were seen moving again to a bigger house in an even more luxurious sub urb The documentarys con clusion The American dream involves possessions and real estate and knows no limits History may ask is this dream of acquisition the one you want to put your faith in but we are running too hard to answer We are all in a race and there isnt any resting place and there isnt any finish line Provoking that kind of thought in the mass medium of television is a good deal more courageous it seems to me than provoking the ire of any single institution CBS News does not of course have a monopoly on the documentary On the most recent edition of Chronolog Nov 26 NBC News provided a firstrate es say on East Pakistan Pro duced by Bob Rogers who spent nearly two months in Pakistan and India the film clearly outlined the complex issues of race religion eco nomics and worldpower pol itics that have escalated into a major human tragedy  While recording the West Pakistani armys denial of at rocities Rogers managed to film Bengali villages that had been freshly destroyed by that army And while documenting the most gruesome situation I have encountered in 10 years of covering the violent side of international affairs he pinpointed the question able roles active and passive of the rest of the world in cluding the United States And on public television this past week Channel 13 WNETs Dateline 13 pre sented an outstanding Inves tigatory portrait of New Yorks famous District Attor ney Frank Hogan Produced written and narrated by John Parsons the special found the powerful Mr DA to be personally incorruptible but demonstrably inefficient Hogan declined an invitation to appear on the program The documentary form meanwhile struggles on Its future could add up to some thing more than welldeserved retrospectives

City to go to the theater my car was stolen Not all of you New York theatergoers have this kind of luck Some of you I understand get mugged in the West Forties And oth ers luckier still merely have to put up with surly boxoffice attendants un availability of tickets to all the worth while shows inflated ticket prices and astronomical restaurant tabs Dont get me wrong I love the theater I even used to be a theater critic for a little Philadelphia magazine and I still feel butterflies on opening nights But I decided a short while ago to try my bad luck elsewhere than in New York Since I was heading for a European vacation this fall anyway I signed up for a threeweek Air India theater tour called The Bard and the Bolshoi The package includes 11 stage performances in London Moscow Leningrad and Paris as well as hotel rooms most meals and a plethora of sightseeing for 559 up thanks to group air fares and mass buying of hotel accommodations and theater tickets British Overseas

dramatic fare like West of Suez Othello or Lear a reworking of the Lear legend by Edward Bond a young and avantgarde British playwright There are no substitutions you take what you get If someone has

he replies Curtains usually rise at 730 so its well to fortify yourself with a high tea and dine afterward You buy your pro gram from an usher for 25 cents practice that outraged one member of the tour During intermission ushers skitter up and down the aisles serving coffee tea and ice cream Or you can repair to the theater bar for a civilized drink It beats the tepid orangecolored concoction we settle for in Broadway theaters The hottest ticket in London is rob ably Butley a comedy by Simon Gray a novelistplaywright whose play Wise Child is scheduled for Broadway this season Butley is directed by Harold Pinter The Homecoming Old Times and stars Alan Bates whose movies in clude Zorba the Greek and the cur rent The GoBetween in a savage portrayal of a homosexual bent on self destruction He loses his wife his child his lover and ultimately his job as university teacher I found the play more disturbing than amusing but the audience collapsed in laughter British humor sometimes leaves Amer icans stonefaced simply because of the language barrier Consider for exam ple this bit of dialogue from Butley What is Reg like Hes like most people only hes from the North Laughter Translation the North of England is to Londoners as Brooklyn is to Man hattanites ie inherently comic I also saw a production by the Royal Shakespeare Company one of Britains national repertory theaters of James Joyces Exiles directed by Pinter who is all over London this year For a 56 yearold play the ideas are remarkably fresh although the language is some what stilted John Wood

next Saturday Of all the London plays I preferred ForgetMeNot Lane by Peter Nichols whose Joe Egg played New York a few seasons ago A warm and witty reminiscence of a boys adolescence dur ing World War II the play moves back ward and forward in time with snatch es of nineteenforties jazz to set the mood The London Observer called it a multileveled work of comic art deftly spanning time and generation gaps ForgetMeNot Lane contains indige nous British humor too Holding up a pair of winter underdrawers the lead Anton Rodgers who appeared on Broad way in Pickwick in 1965 says Theyre big enough for Lockharts Immoderate laughter from the audi ence It turns out that Lockharts Ele phants were a famous British circus act No matterthe plays humanity has a universal appeal We may soon learn whether the pro ducers share that assessment Forget MeNotLane closed on Nov 27 and there is vague talk that it might be brought to Broadway despite the fact that some feel it is too domestic to travel  MOSCOW There are 26 theaters in Moscow and all of them are jammed The Bolshoi Theater of Opera and Ballet opens its season about Sept 1 and runs through June so youre pretty sure to catch the big time between these dates Bolshoi means big and the company numbers 2000 singers and dancers It occupies two stagesthe old Bolshoi Theater itself and the modern Kremlin Palace of Congresses behind the Krem lin walls The theater tour includes three stage attractions during five nights in Mos cow not to mention half a dozen day time sightseeing tours just in case time hangs heavy In the USSR youre in

on ex tra performances at his own expense Tickets are cheapabout 385 for the Bolshois best ballet and opera seats to about 250 for the Musical Comedy Theater The Intourist Service Bureau in your hotel can usually get tickets on one or two days notice If your hotel is the handy downtown Metropole as ours was youre within a few blocks of most theaters Moscow performances start at 7 PM so we dined at 530 on theater nights I rushed out without dinner the first eveninga free nightto catch the Bolshoi Ballet at the Kremlin Palace of Congresses a vast 6000seat hall designed for Communist Party meet ings Virtually every seat was occupied The audience appeared welldressed cheerful and middleclass In a Soviet theater you must check your coata wise requirement considering the bulki ness of Russian outerwear It was snow ing in Moscow in October There are mass checking facilities no charge and no tipping You buy your program for about 35 cents Variety of Pyrotechnics Three acts of short balletsChopini ana Divertissements and Walpurgis Night from Gounods Faustgave the Bolshoi company a chance to dis play a variety of pyrotechnics Chopin iana in particular provided a series of eyepopping suspended leaps and dizzying spins and among the Diver tissements SaintSanss old reliable The Dying Swan summoned up the ghost of Pavlova who made it famous I found the individual performances su perb but the corps de ballet a bit ragged compared to the cool precision of Britains Royal Ballet In the intermissions the entire audi ence rushed for banks of highspeed escalators to the top floor where there were acres of buffet tables spread with openfaced sandwiches of ham salami and sturgeon blinis pancakes with melted butter ice cream with fruit sauces beer wine and sodas pastries oozing authentic whipped cream Soviet audiences eat well I neednt have wor ried about missing dinner Our tours scheduled performances in Moscow included the Bolshoi Ballets Don Quixote something of a shotgun marriage of flamenco and Russian styles and the Bolshoi Operas opulent produc tion of The Czars Bride by Rimski Korsakov So opaque was the operas plot that it defied explanation by our charming Intourist guide Lilya It is more complicated than War and Peace she sighed We also attended the Moscow Circus an intimate onering affair in a glitter ing new glasswalled circular building on the citys outskirts to which we were bused Everybody loved the cir cus14 astounding amazing stupendous acts almost any one of which would command the center ring at Madison Square Garden Perhaps my favorite Moscow evening was a nonscheduled performance  Moya Prekrasnaya Ledi or My Fair Lady in Russian at the Musical Com edy Theater It was an altogether en chanting production with lovely cos tumes and sets In fine voice were Eliza Doolittle pronounced Ayleesa Doo leetle and Henry Higgins pronounced because there is no h in Russian Genry Keeggins If you wonder how they man aged The Rain in Spain Falls Mainly on the Plain they used a favorite Russian tonguetwister that translates as Carl Has Stolen the Corals from Carol Judging from the audiences re sponse it worked fine During intermis sion by the way I made do with but tered black bread spread thickly with caviar at 50 cents a plate  LENINGRAD A ravishing largely 18thcentury city Leningrad has some 20 theaters and is the home of the Kirov Opera and Ballet Company All the theaters are occupied and playing to crowded houses People come by at the last minute and beg for just one seat said the girl at the hotels In tourist ticket desk In a typical week the Kirov Ballet will be doing Sleeping Beauty the Kirov Opera Glinkas Russian and Ludmilla while the Mali Small Thea ter does Petrouchka and Madams Butterfly At the Musical Comedy Thea ter you can catch RoseMarie minus Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald Prices are even lower than Moscows 330 for the best opera and ballet seats Leningrad performances start at 730 PM Every Soviet theater has its own repertory company and every company its own theater They repeat some pro ductions up to three years and add new ones each season The Kirov occupies the former Mariinsky Theater built in 1860 a domed imperial colossus that once supplied ballerina playmates to the Czars In its whiteandgold baroque in terior I counted 72 crystal chandeliers above the tiers of boxes plus an 18 foot central chandelier of raindrop rock crystal At the Kirov during four dizzy Len ingrad days and nights our tour group saw an uncut version of Sleeping Beau tya museum piece with choreography based on the original Petipa ballet The orchestra turned in a thundering per formance of the Tchaikovsky score Two rising young stars Gabriela Komleva and Mikhail Barisnikov danced Princess Aurora and Prince Desir in glorious style They repeatedly stopped the show and long after the curtain fell Russian balletomanes clustered at the orchestra rail to clap rhythmically and bring them back for bows During intermission incidentally the Kirov commissary added a new twist to the ample buffet by weighing the portions of ice cream and charging by weight Another evening some of us unsur feited went on our own to the Kirovs Russian and Ludmilla a sumptuous fairytale opera with ballet and what seemed a cast of hundreds And on the last night breathing hard by this time the entire group sat through The Magic Flute Mozart I concluded shouldnt be sung in Russian Although the voices were good the production was as dull as a plate of cabbage Nevertheless Id sum up the USSR leg of the theater tour as a thoroughly stimulating experience as long as ones constitution holds out  PARIS On a fine weekend in late October perhaps the best show in Paris is Paris itself flagbedecked for Brezh nevs state visit the Tuileries Gardens teeming with relaxdd Parisians There are also some 50 theaters playing every thing from Tennessee Williamss Sweet Bird of Youth to girlie shows Despite the abundance of fare Phil ippe Richmond editor and publisher of LOfficiel des Spectacles a weekly amusement guide is gloomy about the theater Everyone works only for his own interestsproducers directors ac tors theater owners he says It makes for rivalry instead of teamwork After considerable bickering for example most Paris theater owners have just agreed on an 830 curtain instead of to catch the suburban trade but there are still holdouts Paris ticket prices come closer to New Yorksup to 8 for the best seats at plays up to 13 for attractions like the Casino de Paris and the Folies Bergre Ticket brokers add a flat 20 per cent You pay for your programs and tip the usher For tour members 5aDay Tours Paris office selects ballet opera musi cals and variety shows They once tried Hair but canceled it after some up tight tour members objected For our first attraction during four nights in Paris we drew of all things Tchalkov skys Nutcracker performed by the ballet of the Opra Comique After the Bolshoi and the Kirov it reminded the of the annual soire of Miss Florence Cowanovas who changed her name from Cowan Dancing School some years ago in Philadelphia One of the corps de ballet fell flat on her tutu during the opening scene rose smiled gallant ly and continued The sets however were stylish and the costumes showed flair The Opra Comique is a charming rococo theater newly renovated A chic fairly youthful audience filled the Grand Foyer during intermission ingesting quantities of CocaCola and a Parisian version of Good Humors as well as champagne Big Bouncy Show Our second attraction was the Casino de Paris starring Zizi Jeanmaire in revue by Roland Petita big bouncy lavishly costumed variety show in 32 acts This is vintage tourist Paris no Parisian would be caught alive there The ostrichfeather supplier alone must make a fortune The nudes seemed less wellendowed than those I remember as a lad at the Folies Bergreon the Twiggy side remarked one tour mem ber But Jeanmaire belting out songs and dancing her way through colossal production numbers was her indestruc tible dynamic self My final theater fling in Paris on my own was Jean Anouilhs recent hit Ne Rveill Pas Madame Dont Wake Up Madame The hero a stage direc tor recalls his own life by manipulating the scenery and characters in a series of vignettes within the play Francois Poirier one of Frances top stage stars acted the directors role superbly This is Anouilh at his besta solid revela tion of character yet full of nuances  In sum the theater tour was well run No one lost his baggage or his cool which speaks well for the manage ment and the group Some complained about not getting their pick of stage performances but that seems to me unrealistic on a package tour I soaked up more theater in three weeks16 performances all toldthan I would in three months as a stayat home Besides compared with what cost me to replace my car stolen in New York the binge was a bargain

POPE REAFFIRMS CELIBACY POLICY,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/10/archives/pope-reaffirms-celibacy-policy-prohibition-against-married-clergy.html,ROME Dec 9The Vatican published a pronouncement by Pope Paul VI today strongly restating the Roman Catholic Churchs prohibition against married priests in its dominant Western branch the Latin Rite In the Latin church there shall continue to be observed in its entirety with Gods help the present discipline of priestly celibacy the pontifical statement said The statement appeared over the signature of Jean Cardinal Villot Pope Pauls Secretary of State in an introductory note to two documents issued by the Vatican The textson The Ministerial Priesthood and Justice in the Worldwere the final version of proposals formulated by the Bishops Synod held in the Vatican from Sept 30 to Nov 5 Declarations Not Binding The two documents revealed little that was not already known Cardinal Villots note said in effect that the Pontiff considered the bishops declarations to be advisory rather than binding Cardinal Villot stated The Holy Father reserves to himself to examine carefully in due course whether the proposalsand which of themcontained in the recommendations of the synodal assembly should [become] directive guidelines or practical norms The synod a consultative body was established following recommendations by the Ecumenical Council Vatican II 196265 that stressed church government jointly by the Pope and the bishops The most controversial topic during five weeks of synodal debates was celibacy for LatinRite priests At the close of the synod a majority of 107 adopted a conservative formula advising the Pope that the priestly ordination of married men is not permitted even in particular cases A strong minority of 87 voted for a more liberal recommendation urging the Pope in particular cases by reason of pastoral needs and the good of the universal church to allow the priestly ordination of married men who are of mature age and proven life No Changes Expected The close division seemed to indicate that the church might at some future time permit married men to be ordained to the priesthood in areas lacking sufficient clergy Since then many churchmen have voiced doubts as to the likelihood of any change in the celibacy law during the rule of the present Pope Todays statement appeared to confirm this view On the theme of justice the synod urged that women should have their own share of responsibility and participation in the community life of society and likewise of the church The synod proposed that womens rights should be studied by a mixed commission of men and women The synod warned that if the church appears to be among the rich and the powerful of this world its credibility is diminished and called on clergy and laity to reexamine their own way of life The document on justice said also that the fight against legalized abortion and against the imposition of contraceptives and the pressures exerted against war are significant forms of defending the right to life
Judge Voids 2 Sections of Florida Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/11/archives/judge-voids-2-sections-of-florida-abortion-law-calls-ban-on-the.html,GAINESVILLE Fla Dec 10 Judge Benjamin M Tench of the Alachua County Felony Court of Record today declared the first two sections of the Florida abortion law unconstitutional The action came in a hearing in which he dismissed charges against a college newspaper editor who distributed a list of abortion referral agencies Judge Tenth said that both Section 79701 which prohibits abortion and Section 79702 which bans the publication of abortion information violate the United States and Florida Constitutions The section prohibiting abortions was struck down primarily on the ground of invasion of privacy The section prohibiting publication of abortion information was voided on the principle of freedom of speech Ron Sachs 21 years old of Miami was arrested on Oct 6 after he admitted being responsible for distributing a mimeographed sheet giving a list of abortion referral agencies The lift was stuffed into many copies of the University of Floridas student newspaper The Florida Alligator The defense counsel Chester Chance filed a motion to dismiss the charges on constitutional grounds and submitted a 100page brief outlining his reesons At a hearing today Mr Chance and his cocounsel Fletcher Baldwin a professor of law at the University of Florida argued that not only was Lbw sectiop of the law under which Mr Sachs was arrested unconstitutional but also that the section prohibiting aborticins was also a violation of constitutional guarantees Mr Chance assailed the first section contending that the abortion law was passed in 1898 at a time when surgical procedures were more dangerous than they are now and that the purpose was to protect the health of the expectant mother and had nothing to do with the rights of an unborn child He noted that the first textbook on antiseptic proceddures was published well after the antiabortion law was written The law was also assailed as being vague The Florida Supreme Court has questioned its own ability to understand what it means Mr Chance said and has implied to the Legislature that the law should be rewritten He also cited cases in which similar laws had been struck down as an invasion of privacy Mr Baldwin criticized the second section deeming it a violation of freedom of speech and press The law is so vague he said as to encompass legal activites as well as an illegal act In his rebuttal Assistant State Attorney Eugene Whitworth said that Mr Sachs did not have standing to challenge the unconstitutionality of the abortion law He isnt a physician and he obviously is not a pregnant woman said Mr Whitworth who argued that the validity of the Florida law was confirmed in a 1963 test case
Nixon's Too Left‐Wing For William Loeb,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/12/archives/nixons-too-leftwing-for-william-loeb-publisher-william-loeb.html,FOR years William Loeb the publisher of New Hampshires most powerful news source The Manchester Union Leader worked hard for Richard Nixon Beginning in 1956 when he conducted a national popularity poll to stop the dumpNixon movement begun in New Hampshire by Harold Stassen through 1968 when his newspaper undercut George Romneys challenge Loeb has been as solid as New Hampshire granite for the President Until 1968 his efforts paid few dividends the White House was occupied by a succession of men who seemed to Loeb to turn the country over to softheaded intellectuals and black rioters while they devised plans to have the Soviet Union annex the United States MANCHESTER N H But in 1971 when Loeb received his first invitation to visit the White House for a dinner honoring President Suharto of Indonesia the country seemed in safe hands He told his readers We found the Nixons to be fine people whose personal conduct has set a splendid example of what an American family should be like Then President Nixon made a decision that Loeb calls immoral indecent insane and fraught with dangerthe decision to visit Communist China As he recalls that White House dinner now Loeb remembers it as confirming his judgment that Nixon is play acting I couldnt believe the way he used US Marines Loeb says in the even un accented way he says everything They had all these what I call bastard medieval trumpetsyou know the long horns but they have valves with banners hanging from them They blew a flourish on those horns and then broke into Hail to the Chief and then this fairly unimpressive man walks into the room  The fairly unimpressive man has joined the stinking hypocrite Dwight Eisenhower the No 1 liar in the USA John Kennedy and the skunks skunks skunk Eugene McCarthy on the 66yearold publishers list of enemies of the people politicians blind to the all  threatening Communist plot for world domination If his name appears on the ballot in the Presidential primary March 7 President Nixon runs the risk of facing the kind of public attack only The Union Leader can mount the sort of attack that has caused some liberals in the state to question the value of a free press WLLIAM LOEB and The Union Leader are in their quadrennial transition from provincial obscurity to national prominence Every other even year national political figures move into New Hampshire to begin the process of reelecting or replacing a President and their presence in the state offers The Union Leader a unique opportunity to influence national politics The newspapers importance results from a position of power unequaled in any other state The Union Leadercirculation 63000 and growing is the only statewide newspaper serving New Hampshires 740000 people it is the only morning paper in the state in The New Hampshire Sunday News it has the only Sunday paper and it is the only paper in Manchester the largest city in the state The other New Hampshire papers 8 dailies and 40 weekliesare limited in circulation and none provide comprehensive statewide coverage Most of them are conservative too and thus tend to reinforce The Union Leader Radio is not a factor in news dissemination and the states only commercial television station an ABC affiliate competes with Boston stations to the south and the rugged geography of the White Mountains to the north Because The Union Leader is their biggest client in the state the wire services feel its influence If it concentrates on an issue the wire services are hard put not to cover that issue for their other clients Finally the papers attacks on various public figures are so outrageous that correspondents for papers elsewhere conditioned to accept the unusual as news wire The Union Leaders excesses to readers back home As a result images such as these periodically leak from New Hampshire Watch those eyes of Muskie as they shift back and forth in an unguarded moment  keep YOUR eye on Moscow Muskie  This newspaper charges Senators Fulbright Goodell and Kennedy are doing more harm to this nation than any enemy has done in the entire history of the United States  Senator Kennedy certainly has a great deal of gall criticizing the daring US rescue mission for our prisoners in North Vietnam when he couldnt even rescue a girl from the bottom of the pond at Chappaquiddick bridge  The cold hard fact is that certain TV networks and certain newspapers and magazines are apparently controlled and in many cases ownedby men who hate the United States and whose first allegiance is to their Marxist principles Harsh and unrestrained as these past political judgments may be the 1972 Presidential primary in New Hampshire may find Loeb surpassing himself Senator Eugene McCarthys amazing showing four years ago has lured liberals in both parties who sense here an opportunity to turn another President out of office Three certain entriesDemocratic Senators George McGovern and Edmund S ONE GOOD TURN  A cartoon from The Manchester Union Leader which has been in the forefront of the battle to defend James R Hoffa the imprisoned Teamsters Union president In the late fifties the Teamsters pension fund saved the papers publisher when enemies cut off his credit Muskie and Republican Congressman Paul N McCloskey have been characterized by Loeb as enemies to the security of the country and Democratic Senator Henry M Jackson to whom the thought of a New Hampshire campaign has occurred has been denounced as a turncoat who decided there were more votes among the peaceniks than the patriots Then there is the conservative Democratic Mayor of Los Angeles Sam Yorty whom Loeb persuaded to enter the race In other times Loeb was not so fortunate as to have his own spokesman in a Presidential primary He never forgave Eisenhower a man whose entire career was made by press agents for overwhelming his first political love the late Sencitor Robert Taft of Ohio Loeb sat out two primaries in the nineteenfifties rather than support Eisenhower working instead to form a new conservative party and to keep Richard Nixon on the Republican ticket Except for the 1964 interlude during which he supported the likeminded Senator Barry Goldwater Loeb has consistently found in Nixon something to believe in and support Lately however his opposition to his old friend in the White House has been growing and Yortys agreement to bring the hardline message of the right into New Hampshire offers Loeb a vehicle for attacks on incumbent and challengers alike I had high hopes for Nixon Loeb says today But Ive been disappointed in part because of his foreign policy but mostly Im offended by the evidence of his petty duplicity  It has marked everything he does trying to play both sides of the street on every issue and it is repugnant He has tried to deceive both sides and that is not good for the nation Im just interested in getting someone in the White House who makes some sense With Nixon we are dealing with someone with no fixed philosophy and who is not terribly bright YORTY on the other hand is presented to the readers of The Union Leader in Page 1 news articles and editorials as a man who seems to be everything Nixon had once been to Loeb Yorty the publisher says represents common sense and an unfaltering patriotic position  I first became acquainted with Mayor Yorty 20 years ago when as a Congressman he was fighting those forces which even then wanted to disarm the United States and leave us helpless against our Communist opponents  He has always advocated that the United States should lead from strength not weakness As it is developing Yortys strategy in the New Hampshire primaryrefined during many dinners in the Loeb homeis the kind Loebwatchers have come to expect With the newspaper at his disposal Yorty is presenting himself as the moderate in the race His statements are carefully displayed on the front page for maximum impact and are accompanied by pictures of a pleasant smiling confident candidate Though others are given essentially equal space Loebs editors emphasize the extremes of their positions McCloskeys support for abortions for example has been mentioned repeatedly and the papers readership is largely Catholic in an effort to heighten Yortys moderate appearance Loeb is convinced that New Hampshire agrees with his position The idea that the people would elect somebody like George McGovern is unbelievable he says and he extends that feeling through the range of Democrats announced and potential While compared to Muskie McGovern Bayh Harris Lindsay and all of the other leftwing kooks Jackson looks good he doesnt look good in comparison to Mayor Yorty Yorty Loeb believes merely has to hold the middle road to attract voters from both parties crossing party lines is no problem here and win a primary fragmented by so many candidates Loebs periodic forays into Presidential politics are just one part of his continuing drive to cast New Hampshire in his own image It has always been my hope we could make New Hampshire an example to other states he says and in many ways we are The state has no sales tax no income tax My opponents say this is bad but I point out that Vermont is one of the highest taxed and ask them to show me where the schools roads and so forth are better there My opposition has been ridiculous on taxesthey say no more sin taxes Thats absurd What do you want to do skip sin taxes and tax other things My theory is that if you give politicians money theyll find a way to spend it Taxing is voluntary herethe sweepstakes and now you see other states are picking that up The beauty of sin taxes is that not only does New Hampshire live on sin but on other peoples sin at that Our biggest liquor sales are at the Massachusetts border [because the absence of a sales tax makes liquor cheaper] and 80 per cent of our racetrack clients come from Massachusetts SUCH views are pressed upon readers of The Union Leader by long distance for Loeb does not live in the state on which he lavishes his attention He divides his time between a home in Reno Nev his legal residenceand one in Prides Crossing Mass The Union Leader never loses its singleminded direction however because its daily operations are in the hands of men who have faith in the ab solutes of the Loeb philosophy Things are either right or they are wrong B J McQuaid the crotchety editor of The Sunday News and editor in chief of The Union Leader says he has always felt it would be confusing to the reader to hold a different editorial opinion from Loebs It seems to be a modern fad McQuaid growls with the certainty that his listener understands the danger of modern fads to hire people who disagree with you I think that confuses the reader  Mr Loeb has no equal in America for standing up and speaking out You may not agree with Bill Loeb but you are never in any doubt about where he stands McQUAID whos been a newspaperman for more than 40 years supervises the display of articles in the paperincluding Loebs Page 1 editorials His use of typefaces and spacing to reinforce editorial opinion makes the front page a typesetters nightmare On Oct 15 1969 to take one notable example The Union Leader published above its mastheadwhich includes the daily reminder There is nothing so powerful as trutha welter of red and black type delivering this notice to Moratorium Day marchers ATTENTION ALL PEACE MARCHERS Hippies Yippies Beatniks Peaceniks yellowbellies traitors Commies and their agents and dupesHELP KEEP OUR CITY CLEAN   Just By Staying Out of ItThe Editors Below that was an eightcolumn picture of Union Leader employes atop the newspapers building proudly displaying a sign that said AMERICA love it or leave it VICTORY IN VIETNAM Under the picture appeared an eightcolumn headline MORATORIUM DENOUNCED and a twocolumn editorial by Loeb entitled Hanois Little Helpers While these journalistic extremes startle outsiders the people of New Hampshire have been conditioned over the years to accept them as normal fare When Loeb came to Manchester in 1946 he found a defeated town It was the Queen City of textiles the home of Amoskeag Mills a world leader in textile manufacturing but the mills had dwindled after World War I and collapsed after World War II Left behind were row after row of company houses attesting to a culture of paternalism among the predominantly FrenchCanadian mill workers They had been conditioned by work and the Catholic religion to look to a higher authority for leadership Loeb quickly turned the paper into an aggressive watchdog exposing waste in government conflicts of interest and rigged bidding Investigative reporterswell paid and devoted to the publisherdug out stories to embarrass political enemies The Union Leader was the first paper to publish the record of telephone calls made from Chappaquiddick that raised serious questions about Senator Edward Kennedys account of the events of that tragic night Loeb threw open page after page to letters from readers 6000 were printed last year perhaps more than appeared in any other newspaper Circulation which stood at 40000 when Loeb took control started to climb and the paper has never been seriously challenged as the state leader The forces that would normally offer liberal opposition to a man like Loeb have been absent or muted in New Hampshire Largely because of the parsimony of its fragmented Legislature government is weak and has few of the civil  service jobs which tend to develop  through job security and detailed information about conditionsa liberalizing resource New Hampshire banks have traditionally sent their money out of state for investment and while they are concerned about corporate laws and the tax structure they lack the deep interest in other economic matters that widespread local investment would produce Finally the university system is fragmented Dartmouth dependent on outside resources has never developed as an institutional leader The University of New Hampshire is so poorly funded that high tuitions have driven away many potential undergraduates Here as in the rural South military service is a prime vehicle for social mobility for the young and both enlistment rates and highschool dropout rates are highoffering yet another reservoir of support for Loebs promilitary DURING the fall and winter Loeb and his third wife Nackey Scripps Loeb one of six heirs to the ScrippsHoward news empire stay at their house of 30 or so rooms at Prides Crossing so they can be near their 14yearold daughter who is in private school at Lexington Mass Loebs first marriage ended in divorce in the early nineteenthirties and his second was dissolved in 1952 after the settlement of an alienationofaffections suit brought by Nackeys former husband Loeb and his second wife had one daughter The Loeb house at the end of a halfmile driveway islike the family cars elaborately wired with lights and other devices to warn against unauthorized entry A Doberman pinscher and a German shepherd greet visitors but both are easily restrained by the firm hand of Mrs Loeb a quiet woman of artistic talents whose strong features are accented by a lack of makeup and a deep tan Like Loeb she is an expert marksman and is armed much of the time He is an officer in the National Rifle Association and a strong supporter of the right to bear arms I am in favor of the careful training of the entire population in the use of guns he says It might lead to a few more wife killings and that sort of thing but it would lead to a great diminution in armed crime THE Loebs day begins at 7 AM with two hours of tennis orif they are in Nevada horseback riding From 10 until 5 PM Loeb works in his study with a secretary who comes each day from The Union Leader to take dictation and returns to the paper to transcribe the work Loeb dictates his column It gives it more punch and lets me talk to the factory worker so he can understand it and an average of 150 letters a day Loeb favors subdued suits and sports clothes with jackets tightly buttoned A shadow of gray hair circles the back of his head but is trimmed so closely that the overall impression is of total baldness an expansive background against which thick black eyebrows play Except for an occasional limp hand gesture the eyebrows offer the only accent to his words which pour out in a stream Though less than 6 feet tall Loeb is solidly built and the combination of bulk and baldness bring to mind Daddy Warbucks of the Little Orphan Annie comic strip When he talks about people Loebs conversation is like dripping acid Presidents Nixon Eisenhower and Kennedy are characterized as fools or stupid or liars It is only when he talks of outdoor activities that Loebs conversation softens I could be perfectly content spending the rest of my life hunting and fishing he says But here too he tends to lecture on the right way to ski with fivefoot skis or fish for Atlantic salmon you have to use a ninefoot rod Opinions are important to Loeb His is a world of black and white grays simply confuse and distort reality In 1952 he left the Episcopal Church to become a Baptist because religion really means something to a Baptist He complains that one is not supposed to have absolutes any more But I have them honor good manners the country patriotism They are curious absolutes When he is pressed about how his bitter personal attacks fit his absolute of good manners Loeb says simply Now that is a good question and then dismisses it by explaining that the editorials are designed for shock value or to get people thinking As for patriotism his view does not approve of a young Vietnam veteran who has turned against the war and believes that the patriotic course is to end such military operations To one such veteran who tried to explain what had turned him against the war Loeb merely said You are confused Another of his principles is opposition to the multiple ownership of newspapers but he owns three besides The Union Leader small dailies in St Albans and Burlington Vt and a Sunday paper in Bridgeport Conn They are relatively independent running his column only occasionally as he devotes all his attention to the Manchester operation Loeb sees himself as 19thcentury liberalnot the modern liberal whose reaction to any problem is to pass law and appropriate someone elses money to try to solve it Others call him a Teddy Roosevelt liberal and it is a natural analogy for his father was President Roosevelts private secretary LOEBS early years seem to be reflected in his rugged outdoor philosophy his ultimate faith in armament and a militant foreign policy and his aversion to big business The Union Leader is one of the few newspapers with a profitsharing plan though there have been no profits since 1963 because he is paying off a 3million loan and he plans to leave its control to the employes when he and his wife are dead An only child he was born in Washington on the day after Christmas in 1905 Loeb once ran a copy of his birth certificate on the front page of The Union Leader Some say it was to show that Theodore and Mrs Roosevelt were his godparents others say it was to prove that he is not Jewish a rumor that spread during the early fifties in connection with his unbroken history of advocacy for the state of Israel I support Israel Loeb says today for the simple reason that it along with the United States stands as a bulwark against the heathen nonChristian world When Roosevelt left the White House the Loebs moved to Sagamore Hill with the Presidents family and William Loeb grew up under the influence of that household Educated in private schools Loeb entered Williams College with no clear notion of a career He distinguished himself at school primarily by resigning from a fraternity that would not admit a Jew and by inviting to the campus William Green the president of the American Federation of Labor that he says was considered a pretty radical thing in 1927 While he was in college he became a parttime reporter for newspapers in Springfield Mass and a parttime correspondent for The New York World He graduated from Williams in 1927 and spent two years at Harvard Law School dropping out when he decided that his ambition was to own a newspaper There followed a variety of jobs in business and journalism and an experience that seems to have been one of his most important Through that experience Loeb developed what he calls his special knowledge about Communism I infiltrated the Communist party in the nineteenthirties he says and I know how they work There is just no concept of the danger we are in His claim is based on the fact that in the early thirties he joined a group urging a boycott of Japanese products after Japans invasion of China The organization was later labeled a Communist front and Loeb maintains that he discovered the Communist ties and helped expose the group His experience with the boycott group seems to have been a turning point in Loebs life Only a few years before as a cub reporter he had become so incensed over roundtable discussion he was covering that he joined the debate It was a discussion of independence for India he remembers and it was conducted by of all people a British civil servant who helped design colonial policies in India Only the restraining hand of a reporter from The New York Times He gave me hell for not keeping my mouth shut saved the idealistic young Loeb from losing his job The same idealism led him into the boycott group and the discovery that he was being used made a deep impression The period is like a wellspring to which he returns in times of need Youre younger than I he will tell an adversary and dont remember the thirties and the policies of appeasement and the Communist activities that led to Woad War It When the talk turns to his personal evolution he again finds his explanations in the thirties That time is when my principles were refined and they havent changed I guess seen from the viewpoint of that age I was an idealist but seen from the viewpoint of today Im called reactionary You are supposed to adjust and if you dont you are called a reactionary I just havent changed much from those days Of the few people who know Loeb well only one offers another theory on his motivation His second wife Eleanor McAlister dismisses his profession of deep principle Everything he writes is done for one purpose and one purpose only Mrs McAlister insists to create controversy because he believes thats what sells newspapers For all his admiration of the Roosevelt image Loeb did not volunteer for or serve in World War U With help from his mother he acquired a small Vermont paperthe one in St Albans in 1942 His big break came in 1946 when in partnership he bought The Union Leader By 1948 he had complete control and started to create an outlet for what some of his editors call his radical conservative policies New Hampshire has never been the same THE last strong Governor New Hampshire had says one longtime political observer who like most liberal Republicans is bitterly antiLoeb was Sherman Adams and he just happened to be the last Governor before Bill Loeb The man who is Governor now Walter Peterson a Republican has repeatedly bat tied with Loeb on major issues and his experience illustrates Loebs power Now in his second term Peterson has been stopped cold in attempts to introduce a statewide tax in New Hampshire During last years reelection campaign he grew so concerned over Loebs drumfire attacks that he was forced into a major blunder Though observers in and out of government knew that his secondterm programs would require increased taxes Loebs pressure grew so intense that Peterson promised he would ask for neither a sales nor an income tax When he reneged on that promisehe was open to Loebs attacks for deceit Peterson Loeb told his readers spits in your face Loeb once picked up an innocent remark by Petersons daughter Meg and turned it into a running frontpage attack on the Governor At a White House conference on drugs in 1968 Meg said she knew some young people smoked marijuana but thought it was their own business Picturing Meg as the victim of misguided parents and part of a generation destroyed by drugs the attack continued until Governor Peterson bought space on the front page of the paper to say 1 am fair game Mr Loeb but I must ask you to stop picking on my 15yearold daughter who after all is only a young girl with many years Leeb says he backs Israel because it stands us a bulwark against the heathen nonChristian werld Dr William Bonner the new president of the University of New Hampshire learned first  hand of Loebs power shortly after the announcement of his appointment last summer Loeb assigned an investigative reporter to study Bonners background In a sixpart 25000word series filled with innuendo unsupported charges and brazen editorialization The Union Leader concluded that Bonner was a leftist threat who would destroy your most precious possessionyour children Bonner reacted in anger denouncing the work as garbage He toured the state seeking support and learned what most people in public life in New Hampshire already knew the fear of Loebs power and the lack of restraint in his attacks keep opponents quiet for years I would hesitate to say anything in public about Loeb one businessman told a reporter covering Bonner Its not a question of my speaking out its a question of what he will do in the paper to my family He has no sense of decency If theres anything he can publish against you he will I discovered Bonner said later that there is just no vehicle for another view Everything is so fragmented that it is always a fight in his terms and in his field Every day I opposed him gave him more fodder to continue the attack and in the end it was the university that suffered I had to under those circumstances withdraw DESPITE such power Loebs success with political candidates has been sporadic He can thoughalmost without failturn political novices into threatening candidates and he can regularly name the Democratic gubernatorial nominee Take the case of Gen Harry Thyng whom a Loeb editor persuaded to retire from the Air Force to run for office By carefully grooming Thyng with pictures and promotional stories and denouncing the opposition The only people opposing Harry Thyng in New Hampshire are the leftwing antiGod antipatriotism newspaper publishers and the usual Ivy League eggheads who are also against God and country and are in favor world government and appeasement Loeb built the man into a formidablebut in the end losingcandidate Because of his extreme views Loeb is always forced to run an unknown for public office Historically his power has been reflected the Democratic primary because of his influence in the Manchester area which includes 60 per cent of the Democratic vote in the state But by bringing in his own brand of conservative candidates Loeb divides the party the state chairman has refused to talk with Union Leader reporters and in the general election a coalition of disenchanted Democrats and upstate Republicansremoved by distance from direct influence  consistently keeps his candidates out of the statehouse Nonetheless Loeb has major voice in determining the issues in an election The result says one aide to Governor Peterson is that campaign on the state level never revolves around services but always taxes We are the only state in the nation without a sales or income tax because we never discuss services in this state The fact that we are 50th in state aid to local government state aid to local schools state aid to higher education these things are never discussed A campaigner spends all his time putting out brush fires started by Loeb and never has time to speak to the issues Over the years of course there have been efforts to dislodge the king The most nearly successful one came in 1957 when Loeb was lured across the border to Haverhill Mass where he began a newspaper to compete with The Haverhill Gazette which had been plagued by labor problems In the process of trying to freeze out his competitor Loeb entered into an agreement with groups of merchants promising to pay them a fixed sum of money if they agreed to advertise only in his paper and it became the only one in Haverhill A court fight ensued in which Loeb was found guilty of violating antitrust laws and fined 3  million Opponents sensing a chance to force Loeb out of the region closed off all credit sources and he was saved only when the Teamsters International Union bailed him out with its pension fund Loeb had been a consistent supporter of organized labor locally and had been introduced to the Teamsters by a union man at his newspaper He denies any attempt by the Teamsters to influence him but since the pension fund came to his rescue The Union Leader has become a leading element in the fight to defend James R Hoffa the Teamster president imprisoned on jurytampering charges ANOTHER attempt to curtail Loebs power was made in the midsixties by liberals disgusted with his attacks on the civilrights and antipoverty campaigns Loeb was national chairman of the Coordinating Committee for Fundamental American Freedoms which lobbied against the 1963 CiVil Rights Act and summed up his views on civil rights in testimony before a Congressional committee I know what the policy of the [Communist] party was in the late thirties on the subject of racial agitation and their plans to use it to bring about revolution in the United States In editorials he suggested that blacks stay in their place condemning James H Meredith for not being content with aneducation in a good Negro college The opposition was led by a group called Friends of Fair Journalism which was formed by the Rev Phillip Kenney a Catholic priest to persuade The Boston Globe to move into New Hampshire in competition with Loeb The movement failed to produce the hopedfor competition but it did cause some new and continuing problems for Loeb Father Kenney the vicar of community affairs for the Diocese Manchester together with 40 other Catholic priests and 106 Protestant and Jewish clergymen bought ads in The Union Leader not unmindful that they had to add to its profits in order to attack it charging that the papers editorial policies undercut the social gospel of the church and fostered an atmosphere hatred bigotry and racism Since then Father Kenney and likeminded clergymen have been constant targets a Loeb campaign against pulpit politics This year the campaign reached a new intensity forcing the Bishop who had remained above the battle to come down flatly on the side of his priests and the churchs role in social affairs AS the war of words rages in Manchester Loeb leads his comfortable life across the border in Massachusetts or in Nevada ignoring his critics Those things dont bother me he says I have a firm view of the transitory nature of existence and just dont worry about that sort of thing As to charges that he is a negative influence in the state Loeb blames the monied interests The people in New Hampshire have never supported or liked me I find my support among the

Youth:,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/12/archives/-borrow-a-baby-when-you-canvass-youth.html,LOS ANGELESStudents are more reflective these days a faculty member at Indiana University said recently They know that running down to the courthouse and protesting wont change much and that sitting by a babbling brook in a meadow wont change much either They want to be realistically progressive As the 1972 Presidential year approaches that phrase seems to sum up the mood of the nations youthrealistically progressive Last weekend more than 3000 students gathered in Chicago for an Emergency Conference for Young Voters At a series of practical workshops borrow a baby when you canvass and sober speeches the message was clear Blind crusades and symbolic protests are out The students felt it was time in the words of Representative Bella Abzug to rip off a piece of power by organizing on the local level and getting inside the Democratic convention in Miami Beach as voting delegates They cheered when Julian Bond the black state legislator from Georgia derided those who believe social commitment is measured by the length of your hair or think America can be smoked to its knees The Chicago meeting was only one of several in recent weeks that echoed with the themes of realism and organization Over the Thanksgiving holiday about 200 people met in Dallas to form the Peoples party which is meant to provide a leftwing alternative for disgruntled Democrats Even here some delegates seemed less interested in making gestures than in making an impact They agreed to nominate Dr Benjamin Spock the pediatrician and antiwar activist as a standin candidate for President in order to start the lengthy procedure of getting on the ballot But they hope that if the Democrats nominate either Senator Hubert Humphrey or Senator Henry Jackson some major figure such as former Senator Eugene J McCarthy would come forward to lead an insurgent campaign  and allow them to drop Dr Spock At Davenport Iowa during the same weekend about 400 veterans of the New Left voted to form a group called the New American Movement There was a general feeling at the meeting that radicals have isolated themselves with their violent tactics and elitist attitudes toward working class people The movements neopopulist program centers around gaining public control of the economy and stresses the formation of community organizations to monitor local utilities landlords and merchants Staughton Lynd the former Yale history professor and one of the godfathers of the New Left looked back on the days of mass marches and said We were hotshots at blowing peoples minds but we couldnt organize anything that would fit into a telephone booth With 25million young people eligible to vote for the first time next year the potential impact of such youthoriented gatheringsparticularly the Chicago sessionis enormous and the professionals know it How that huge youth vote will actually affect politics however remains unclear The conventional wisdom holds that young people will not vote in large numbersand that those who do vote will follow in their parents footsteps And it is true that on most campuses these days reading rooms are more crowded than meeting rooms and making love is more popular than making speeches The newspaper at Indiana University last week advertised a weekend in New York for 350 complete with abortion But there are signs that the conventional wisdom might be wrong Just getting 3000 people to Chicago at their own expense is an impressive feat Registration drives are going well in some places although by no means in allthe fever of Presidential politics has not yet begun to spread Yet there are signs that the young people are stirring In a number of college towns last month students helped elect local insurgent candidates Moreover the evidence indicates that young people will not vote just like their parents Counties and cities across the country now have Democratic majorities for the first time A poll of 23000 youngsters listed in Whos Who of American High School Students showed that 38 per cent registered in a political party different from their parents Said Mary Ruth Mann of the University of Idaho Young people still see alternatives they see there are choices to be made theyre more willing to point out hypocrisies Its easier for young people who havent been responsible for the mistakes to say things are screwed up
2 SUITS CONTEST BANS ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/14/archives/2-suits-contest-bans-on-abortion-justices-asked-to-declare-laws.html,WASHINGTON Dec 13 The Supreme Court was asked today virtually to sweep away the states antiabortion laws by ruling that it is unconstitutional for the government to interfere with womens control over their own bodies In arguments over the constitutionality of the antiabortion laws of Texas and Georgia two women lawyers challenged the statutes If their grounds were adopted by the Court the result would probably be to invalidate all laws that restrict physicians in performing therapeutic abortions However state attorneys in both cases raised procedural objections to any decision in the cases  including the argument that a pregnant woman could never successfully challenge on antiabortion law because she would inevitably have the baby before her appeal reached the Supreme Court and the case would become moot When the seven  member Court agreed to hear the two appeals  rather than to delay them with other major cases being held until Lewis F Powell Jr and William H Rehnquist are sworn in was widely assumed that the Court expected to dispose of the cases on the procedural issues without deciding the farreaching constitutional issues involved Many Questions Asked In the arguments today there was much discussion of the thorny procedural problems that make it difficult to challenge the constitutionality of antiabortion laws in Federal court However the Justices also asked numerous questions about the basic objections to antiabortion statutes At issue are two typical antiabortion lawsthe Texas statute which permits abortions only to preserve the life of the mother end Georgias more liberal law which permits abortion in cases of rape or defective fetuses and to preserve the health of the mother The only states that differ substantially from these are the four that permit abortion on demandAlaska Hawaii New York and Washington The broadest attack made today on antiabortion laws came from Mrs Sarah R Weddington of Austin Tex She asserted that the constitutions Ninth Amendment which bars the Government from disparaging unspecified rights retained by the people was violated by laws that denied a woman the right to decide whether to have an abortion No Supreme Court majority has ever struck down a law under the Ninth Amendment but a Federal District Court invalidated the Texas law on this ground Mrs Margie Pitts limes of Atlanta challenged the Georgia law on the more orthodox ground that to deny women physicians and nurses the right to seek and administer medical aid would deprive them of liberty without due process of law The basic case for upholding antiabortion laws was made by Mrs Dorothy T Beasley an Assistant Attorney General of Georgia She argued that states had a legitimate Interest in preserving the life of unborn children one that overrode competing fights of pregnant women The lone man in the case was Jay Floyd an Assistant Attorney General of Texas The states lawyers argued that the Georgia case was moot because the unmarried plaintiff had had her baby In the Texas case the married plaintiffs were said to lack standing because only an abortionist can be prosecuted under the antiabortion laws
He's the Legal Guardian for the Fetuses About to Be Aborted,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/17/archives/hes-the-legal-guardian-for-the-fetuses-about-to-be-aborted.html,Robert M Byrn who proudly says that ho is probably New Yorks No1 foe of abortion is an Irishman with en easy smile who keeps right on smiling even when he hears for the umpteenth time an innuendoladen description of himself A 40yearold bachelor Catholic law professor Oh Im always described that way Mr Byrn said in an interview in his office in the Fordham Law School 140 West 62d Street It reminds me of the time the press described Sammy Davis Jr as a oneeyed Negro entertainer when he married Mal Britt It seems to me that both descriptions ere irrelevent Mr Byrn a husky sixfooter Whose specialty is criminal law said that neither his single status nor his religion had anything to do with what he calls his zealous struggle against the states liberalized abortion law A Suit Has Been Filed Im interested basically as a lawyer who advocates the protection of life in the community he said If that is abandoned then the whole community value of life is in danger of breaking down And the next stop is probably euthanasia or the idea that only those who contribute to society have the right to live Last week Mr Byrn who is chairman of the Metropolitan Right to Life Committee asked a State Supreme Court justice to halt all abortions in the city until a suit he had filed on Dee 3 was settled The suit believed to be the first major Constitutional attack on the states liberalized abortion law charged that the law violated the 14th Amendment of the Constitution which holds in part that no state shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law Guardian of the Unrepresented At that time Mr Byrn was formally appointed legal guardian of Infant Roe a fictitious fetus representing all unborn babies between the fourth and 24th weeks of gestation who are scheduled to be aborted in city hospitals Such an appointment is a longstanding legal practice utilized when a judge decides that an allegedly injured person or persons cannot adequately represent themselves in court Until someone proves otherwise I believe that human life begins at the moment of conception said Mr Byrn sitting in an office decorated with antiabortion buttons and slogans and a photograph of an aborted 20weekold fetus in a bucket in a hospital And so far 250000 human lives have been lost in New York since the liberalized law went into effect Mr Byrn said that his eventual goal was through the courts to restore the law the way it was before July 1 1970 when the liberalized law went into ef feet Before that date most abortions were illegal in New York State When asked about the contention that women should have control over their own bodies and make their own decisions regarding childbirth the law professor replied I believe that each of us has the right to privacy in regard to our own person But here there is a superior Interestthe right to life Mr Byrn who has received threatening letters and telephone calls from women who disagree with him said that as a lawyer he was not opposed to abortion if it were done to save womans life although this rarely occurs any more At this point he said he is usually asked a hypothetical question about whether a 10yearold girl who is raped by a mental defective should be forced to bear the child Thats the toughest case he said The implication is usually that the mental defective is black My answer is that the wrong to the 16yearold girl has already been done and that we ought not to compound that wrong by killing a life We ought to bring all of the facilities of society together to help that mother and child What about the possibility that thousands of women would die of illegal botched abortions if the liberalized law were repealed As usual the figures are exaggerated he said No more than 500 women died of botched abortions each year across the whole country before we got the liberalized laws And Im quoting from Dr Christopher Tietze a demographer with the Population Council Social Services as an Alternative Mr Byrn who was dressed in a baggy tweed suit and a striped tie gave his views on the following On an alternative to abortion I would like to see the whole spectrum of social services used as a viable alternative I can appreciate that many pregnant women feel trapped and with todays cultural climate they feel that abortion is the only answer But suppose someone were to offer them an alternative in a confidential fashion without moralizing to them I think the vast majority would accept the alternative I think theyd rather not kill their babies Birth control In my own personal morality I agree with the Popes position But as a lawyer I think every married couple ought to make their own decision as to whether they should have a child or use contraception Says Parents Were Religious Mr Byrn was born in the Bronx to Roman Catholic parents who he says were religious but by no means fanatics His late father was a salesman There was one other child Francis who is also a lawyer and the father of five children After receiving his education at Fordham Prep Fordham University and Fordham Law School Mr Byrn went into private practice on Wall Street for four years before joining the law school faculty in 1963 He said that he had never considered entering the priesthood Today Mr Byrn lives with his mother Margaret in an apartment in the city I dont want to tell which borough because of the phone calls and he goes to mass every Sunday Marriage Sure I want it Thats something that everyone wants he said I like having lots of kids around But everything just never came together I havent given up hope though
Business and Public Interest,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/19/archives/business-and-public-interest.html,CHICAGOBusinessmen contributing money to sup port a corps of reformers who are taking after some of Chicagos business and po litical giants Strange but its happening here in what the participants insist is an affirmation of a new social consciousness in the business community Or at least a demonstration of what that social conscious ness ought to be Their instrument for do ing this is Businessmen for the Public Interest a non profit corporation that func tions through four young lawyers three research as sociates and a board of di rectors from among the 40 Chicago business concerns that help pay part of BPIs 250000 annual budget In its literature BPI describes itself as a combi nation of watchdog research center law firm and ombuds man Among its chartered purposes it lists the objec tives of providing relief for the poor and distressed les sening neighborhood ten sions eliminating prejudice and discrimination and im proving the environment BPIs tactics have been simple Send its lawyers into court or before regulating agencies to force compliance with the law or win new le gal interpretations that will force the corporation or the government to act With their lances leveled at anything from Com monwealth Edison to Mayor Richard J Daleys Chicago Housing Authority BPIs directors say they have only one criterion to guide them on whom or what they at tack It must be an action that will have an impact on the system and lead to sig nificant changes in it A major portion of BPIs interest has been centered on environmental improvement particularly in protecting Lake Michigan from further pollution But this has not diverted it from charging into such varied matters as repeal of the states criminal abortion laws racial discrim ination in admitting students to Chicagos largest commer cial high school alleged fa voritism in tax assessments on large Chicago banks fee splitting among Chicago at torneys or secrecy among Chicago aldermen in the own ership and financial backing of cable TV franchises On the pollution front BPI won its most impres sive victory this spring After gaining the right to appear as a citizens group before an Atomic Energy Commission licensing board BPI act ing with the Sierra Club forced the Consumers Power Company of Michigan to agree to construct cooling towers at its Palisades nu clear plant that will eliminate the dumping of hot water into Lake Michigan The agreement will add several million dollars to the Palisades installation costs But it broke the united re sistance of other lakeside power companies against anything except direct dis charges into the lake The Northern Indiana Public Service Company has since agreed to install a cooling tower at a lakeside nuclear plant in Indiana and the Fed eral Environmental Protec tion Agency has ruled that all lakeside nuclear plants must have equivalent closed cycle cooling systems The BPI has already run full tilt a Mayor Daley on two matters It has gone to court to publicize its charge that there was a blatant conflict of interest in the handling of a large urban renewal project sponsored by the Chicago Housing Au thority And it is participat ing in a second court suit backing its contention that the Board of Education which owns the land on which Midway Airport is situated is short  changing Chicagos school children by renting the airport to the Citys Department of Avia tion at a value rate below the fair value This summer BPI lost the first round in a law suit to force steel power and chemical companies to purify the industrial wastes they pump into Lake Michi gan near Chicago But it is continuing an appeal to a higher court Meanwhile it has a special corps of law medical and engineering stu dents taking samples of Lake Michigan water and prepar ing evidence for BPI to use in identifying ma jor sources of pollution around this end of the lake Most of the supporters of Businessmen for the Public Interest are executives of smaller companies but they represent a wide spectrum of the business community Among them are investment brokers small manufactur ers hotel executives retail ers and bankers When asked why they donate funds to an organi zation that has already em barrassed Commonwealth Edison United States Steel and the Cook County As sessor among others most say its because they believe the business community has a civic obligation to make the system work and BPI is an ideal means for them of fulfilling that obligation Its not without some trepidation that I went in Elliot Lehman president of FelPro Inc an automotive supply company said re cently The power com panies have often been our customers and I know what the DPI is trying to do in pollution control could cost them a lot of money But if were motivated only by fear then were missing what this country really stands for Increasingly tougher air pollution controls supported vigorously by BPI have meant that Saxon Paint Su permarts a hardward chain will have to scrap 100000 worth of old incinerators and pay a rubbish collector to haul away trash This is a painful move for us said Alan Saks presi dent of Saxon and an en thusastic supporter of BPI But in the long run this will benefit the whole com munity The organizing Impetus for BPI came two years ago from Gordon Sherman then president of MidasInterna tional the muffler repair chain who has since been pushed out of that company in a proxy battle Mr Sherman who had a reputation among Chicagos nervous business establish ment for aggressive social consciousness provided most of the funds in BPIs first year The MidasInternation al Foundation still gives gen erously Midas and three other foundations are in for 170000 in 1971 The re maining 80000 comes from the businessmencontributors Looking to next year the BPI directors have organ ized a 15man group of busi nessmen to begin soliciting more operating funds We arent looking for large contributions from any of the businessmen we call on said Alexander Polikoff a prominent Chicago civil rights lawyer who now serves as BPIs executive director Wed rather have 1000 from 200 involved businessmen than 100000 from two of them Mr Polikoff admitted that BPI had not as yet sought any funds from Common wealth Edison or United States Steel But who knows he asked maybe theyll de cide were a good way to demonstrate their social consciousness It would be nice if they did
"For Privacy From Cranks, Creeps and Crooks, Millions Getting Unlisted Phone Numbers",https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/22/archives/for-privacy-from-cranks-creeps-and-crooks-millions-getting-unlisted.html,LOS ANGELES Dec 21 Cary Grant is listed in the Los Angeles telephone direc tory But if you want to speak to the actor that is not the number to call Cary Grants private number is not listed And the Cary Grant who is in the book has had his listed number discon nected It was not possible to reach the other Mr Grant by tele phone to determine whether he too had opted for tele phone privacy But if he did he has joined millions of other Americans seeking to avoid unwanted calls by maintaining unlisted num bers The idea has caught on so widely in fact that in some places it has become trouble some and phone officials are trying to discourage it Of the more than 86 mil lion homes subscribing to the Bell Systemwhich accounts for some 80 per cent of the nations phones114 per cent last year had nonpub lished numbers Bells termi nology for numbers that subscribers have requested be kept private In 1964 just 73 per cent of 60 million phones had nonpublished numbers Celebrities politicians and bigbusiness executives have unlisted phones to avoid fans or crank calls Many women are unlisted to avoid obscene calls and many men and women to prevent calls from divorced mates or old friends they feel they have out grown A nonpublished phone number is also a way of avoiding sales pitches from a growing force of telephone salesmen and it makes it more difficult for burglars attempting to find out if any one is home at a prospective target house A surprising number of unlisted numbers are found in poorer neighbor hoods as one device to frus trate bill collectors And phone companies say a non published phone number has become a status symbol It Sounds Like a Big Deal If youre not in the book it sounds like a big deal to give someone your number one phone company spokes man said Los Angeles a mecca for celebrities and wouldbe ce lebrities leads the nation in nonpublished numbers with almost 29 per cent of the total phones in the city un listed San Francisco with 23 per cent is second fol lowed by the New York City area with 21 per cent and the Washington metropolitan area with about 182 per cent A spokesman for the Illi nois Bell Telephone Company says having an unlisted num ber to avoid telephone so licitations is largely a futile gesture Most companies sell ing over the phone he said use random dialing taking a prefix that identifies a neigh borhood and working combi nations of the last four digits Sometimes changing to an unlisted number is no help at all Grover Wiberg who operates a laundry and dry cleaning business in Sacra mento Calif wanted to cut down on the calls his son was receiving and got a non published number about five months ago Then he started to get two or three calls a night from people wanting to speak to Gov Ronald Reagan The phone company had assigned Mr Wiberg a non published number that is identical with one listed in the Sacramento directory under Ronald Reagan Of course that was not the Gov ernors number either Mr Wiberg believes the other Ronald Reagan is a California highway patrolman who gave up his number for obvious reasons But in Indiana both in cumbent Gov Edgar D Whit comb a Republican and his predecessor Roger D Brani gin a Democrat have had the number of the Governors mansion kept in the phone book Seen as Part of the Job Although people call at all times of day and night according to Mr Whitcomb who moved to a penthouse apartment recently and took his number with himmain taining a listed number is just part of the responsibility of being in public office The main trouble says the Gov ernor is that people just dont know who to call when they have a problem so they call the Governor Its their right to be able to do that Former Governor Branigin seemed often to relish such calls having himself a pen chant for late night calls On one such occasion in 1967 a student at the University of Indiana called the man sion at 430 AM to discuss the Governors veto of a bill that would have liberalized abortion law The Governor talked with the student at length and got his phone number At 715 AM when the Governor was ready to leave the mansion he tried to call the student back but got no answer Then he sent the state police around to wake up the stu dent That brought him out of it Mr Branigin recalls Politicians and government officials are divided on pri vate numbers Chicagos Mayor Richard J Daley has a non pulbished number which he changes from time to time when too many peo ple get to know it In Phila delphia neither Mayor James H T Tate nor Mayorelect Frank L Rizzo is listed But Mr Rizzos Republican oppo nent Thatcher Longstreth who lost the election is in the book In Washington people in politics are wary of reveal ing that they have listed num bers W Averell Harriman whose number is listed said through a secretary that he declined to participate in this study Representative Bella Abzug Democrat of Manhat tan according to an aide has never asked to have her number unlisted and has not had a problem with the listed number But the aide said it would be appreciated if this were not publicized Phone officials are not wholly pleased with the rise in nonpublished numbers The Pacific Telephone Company is encouraging subscribers in its CaliforniaNevada service area to keel listed numbers and Jerome W Hull presi dent of the company is set ting an example with a listed number himself The reason is the special handling required of nonpub lished numbers and the resultant cost Thomas Urbaniak a Pacific Telephone traffic supervisor says Even if the operator tells a person the number isnt listed the customer hangs up and tries another operator That doubles the time consumed Operators do not have ac cess to nonpublished num bers but many callers for information do not believe that Telephone companies will not give nonpublished numbers under any circum stances But some companies in an emergency will check with the subscriber to see if he wishes to call back the caller Phone companies report many instances of forgetful subscribers with nonpub lished numbers who were irri tated when they could not get their own numbers from in formation Some companies offer a compromisethe un listed number as distinct from the nonpublished number which is not in the book but is available from information Some telephone companies impose charges for nonpub lished numbers and others have asked regulatory agen cies for permission to do so Pacific Telephone is seek ing permission to charge 10 for a number change and 50 cents extra a month to main tain a nonpublished number A spokesman for the com pany said the

What Bing Crosby Is Doing for Golf His Wife Is Doing for Golfing Fashions,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/26/archives/what-bing-crosby-is-doing-for-golf-his-wife-is-doing-for-golfing.html,PEBBLE BEACH CalifIf Mrs Bing Crosby has anything to say about it a new dimensionchicwill be added to the 31yearold Monterey Peninsula golf tournament known affectionately as the Crosby Clambake this year Mrs Crosby whose husband sponsors the prestigious Pebble Beach tournament was reading a newspaper at breakfast one morning recently when she noticed a story about the efforts of some women golfers to improve their fashion image I thought to myself we in the gallery could look a lot better too Kathryn Grant Crosby recalled the other day So I made a couple of phone calls First called the 3M company in St Paul Minnesotathey finance the tournamentto find out if they would be willing to commission a designer to create some really beautiful golfing costumes They said yes Then I called Los Angeles and asked JeanLouis if he would consider taking on the project He said hed love to do it Mrs Crosby who was born in Texas 38 years ago lives in the northern California town of Hillsborough with her 67yearold husband who is virtually retired and their three children She is dressed exclusively by JeanLouis for both her very private life and her occasional stage and movie roles While she is only mildly interested in fashion she was so delighted with the four costumes the designer did for the coming Crosby ProAm Jan 1316 that she has been cheating a bit Ive been wearing them ever since Jean sent them up to me she admitted apologetically The minute the four boxes arrived Bing and I got in the car and drove to Pebble Beachits a 2 hour drivefor a picnic Then Bing played a few holes and I galleried [walked along] with him to give the outfits a dry run so to speak Dry run is a particularly good way of putting it 1 think We almost always have a little rain for the Crosby Anyway Bing loved the clothes Im not an easy person to dress fur golf or anything else Kathy Crosby continued I am 5 feet 4 inches tall weigh 105 pounds and it is important to have a sense of proportion when you are dealing with my size Great clothes are not for me theyre for the tall languid girls in the fashion magazines But these clothes work for me and they will work well for any womanplayers or spectatorsat this years tournaments Golf garb must be improved Mrs Crosby added Tennis had to put color and variety into the clothes worn on the court The first year Bing and I were married we lived in Palm Desert [a resort area which is near Palm Springs] and I must confess that the gang at the tennis club always looked considerably more chic than the golfers did Mrs Crosbys favorite of the costumes JeanLouis did for her is a wool tapestry tweed jumper which is worn with a body stocking in rust an ensemble that includes boots of soft glove leather made without zippers and topped with a minidress Bings favorite is the knicker outfit Mrs Crosby said Bing played golf with the Duke of Windsor once and they both wore knickers I think its a nostalgic thing with him With me its comfort the knickers feel so good The week the former motion picture star and his wife spend at Pebble Beach is about as social as the Hillsborough Crosbys get these days They have sold their Palm Desert home where they settled after their marriage in 1957 and moved to Hillsborough because as Mrs Crosby said It is possible to be a very private individual up there yet it is a small warm community Our children are in public school and I am a substitute teacher in the public schools Kathy Crosby is something of a triplethreat career woman In addition to her acting career and her teaching credentials she has a degree in nursing and could fill in at the Hillsborough hospital as easily as in the schools On several occasions she has substituted in her own childrens classes and found the experience agonizing The children are embarrassed and I am embarrassed especially during math period I dont teach math well at all In fact sometimes I just read Shakespeare during math period Bing and Kathryn Crosby have not burned behind them all bridges leading to the entertainment industry They still do Minute Maid orange juice commercials We have just finished shooting one in a state park Mrs Crosby said We are camping out having breakfast with lots of orange juice The money for the commercials goes into a college fund for the children Nat who is 10 is proud that he has already earned his way through his junior year in college The Crosbys also have a daughter Mary Frances 12 and a son Harry 13 who went on his first date the weekend after his mothers new golf clothes arrived I was chauffeur for the evening Mrs Crosby said You understand of course that I sat way down front by request so as not to embarrass anyone I perked up a bit when the boys brought me some popcorn during intermission After the movie we went to a pizza parlor and I waited in the car in front also by request But finally I got tired of being stared at in the car alone and I went inside and joined the party Though she seems totally immersed at the moment in her role of wife mother and golf tournament hostess Kathryn Grant Crosbys interrupted career as an actress is never too far from her mind I have noticed that too many of our friendspeople in Bings age group rather than minehave absolutely nothing to do when their children grow up and leave home she said So our Christmas television show [the Crosbys appeared en famille on NBC earlier this month] is important to me I dont want the public to forget And its important to the children too I want them to know what their father did for a living The Crosbys principal sport around Hillsborough is walking together and talking We talk about politics Mrs Crosby said Bing is fascinated by it but doesnt feel that entertainers have a right to be in politics We talk about abortion and the womens liberation movement I am married to a golfing priest and my views on abortion are not my husbands As for womens lib we feel that there are classy dames all over Some of them are in the movement some have made it on their own Kathryn Crosby is from a family of teachers and preachers and she does her fair share of both Bing Crosby is from a family of builders His life has been upbeat but he has had little time to play anything much but golf It is of special pleasure to both of them that the Crosby tournament has raised 2million to date for an assortment of charities
Steingut's Power Flows From a Brooklyn Storefront,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/26/archives/steinguts-power-flows-from-a-brooklyn-storefront-stanley-steinguts.html,Parked outside the brightly lit storefront at 4016 Church Avenue in East Flatbush on a recent Monday evening was a large dark sedan bearing the license plate New York Assembly 11 Inside the building a small group of men hovered around a table studying a map of Brooklyns 41st Assembly District Dominating them was their leader AssemblyMan Stanley Steingut proud owner of the lownumber license plate a token of his 19 years in office and a symbol of his current status as Minority Leader of the New York State Assembly Well lose these blocks said one of the men pointing at the northwestern corner of the district map Thats all right They dont vote said Mr Steingut This is good well get all the rabbis in here said a third man gesturing at the northeastern corner of the map Yeah but theyll have to work said one of his companions If they want deals said another sounding imposing with a cigar clenched between his teeth The others laughed at this and then Civil Court Judgeelect Anthony Jordan the man who had brought the map turned to Mr Steingut and said Your old house is back in the district I shouldnt have sold it said the Minority Leader who explained to a visitor The last time we had reapportionment I got redistricted out of my house The group continued to gaze at the map for a few more minutes Then their leader stood up and the others took that as a signal to leave They walked with him to the door joking about a captain who would probably be redistricted out of his house this time As they emerged onto the street Anthony Jordan made the final pronouncement of the evening Im getting out of politics he said My wifes going to be the captain now Everyone laughed and Mr Steingut moved toward the car with enviable license plate Thus ended an evening at the James Madison Democratic Club home base of Stanley Steingut and before that of his late father Irwin Steingut who also served as a power in the Assembly Stanley Steingut and his most devoted election district captains had stayed on a few minutes after the regular crowd left the spacious storefront that night to discuss the new lines they expected Republican leaders to draw for their district Though Mr Steingut once expressed public dismay over a Republicans description of reapportionment as pie slicing he and his loyal captains surveyed the district map as if it were indeed a luscious pie with pockets of richyield Democratic areas and lowyield fringes they did not mind losing Stanley Steingut at 51 has a reputation as a consummate politicannot just in Albany where he exercises his considerable legislative skills but also in his home district where even his enemies nay him homage and grudgingly praise the habits and sensitivities that have kept him in power Representing an area of about 100000 people approximately 55 per cent of whom are Jewish 20 per cent Italian and Irish Catholic and about 25 per cent black he constantly monitors the moods of his constituents both personally and through his devoted captains The other day for example he was able to head off some potential trouble when ho quickly arranged a meeting with Hassidic Jews who were planning a demonstration against him because they feared that their portion of Crown Heights would be redistricted out of the 41st Assembly District and swallowed up in a predominately black district Mr Steingut assured them that he would fight in Albany to retain the Hassidic section in the 41st AD Mr Steingut is a man of vast energy He rises frequently at 530 in the morning and has been known to rouse local leaders by phone before 6 just to ask them whats going on in their areas To those who have crossed him he can seem ruthless for he may refuse to come to any meetings they attend Since few community organizations wish a Steingut boycott it is his opponents who more often find themselves uninvited For a time Mr Steingut refused to appear at meetings with City Councilman Theodore Silverman who defeated the incumbent Councilman in Mr Steinguts district last year and who used to refer to the Minority Leader as a boss and a king Now Mr Silverman says he was misinformed he thinks Mr Steingut is not a boss but a forceful leader To his club captains Mr Steingut seems excessively generous and thoughtful One remembers the time the leader sent a personal note to the captains wife when she was ill Another tells the story of the day his brother was badly burned in a freak explosion Mr Steingut spent hours at his house that day making phone calls to medical authorities that brought crucial equipment to the hospital where the injured young man was being treated He hardly knew our family then the captain recalled He was just a neighbor On any given Monday or Thursday evening the devoted captains of the Madison Democratic Club gather at the storefront They come to meet one another and to engage in what they call contracts with constituents of the 41st AD Constituents with all man ner of complaints walk into the club after 730 PM and each of them is attended by a captain or a member of Mr Steinguts staff sometimes getting advice on the spot sometimes being told his problem will be solved as quickly as possible This process as old as the political club is what the captains mean when they say they are dealing in contracts The unspoken part of the bargain with each constituent is that he vote for the clubs slate in future primaries and elections The contracts are of course not binding but they can yield good results over the years Mr Steingut who is a partner in an insurance business with the Brooklyn County Democratic leader Meade Esposito has consistently won elections and primaries by bib margins The Minority Leader who once served as county Democratic leader grew up with politics learning to ring doorbells beside his father Irwin Steingut was for a brief time the Assembly Speaker and it has been his sons ambition to hold the same post  with which comes one of the most coveted of license plates New York Assembly 1 There are captains In the Madison Club who remember Stanley Steinguts father and who can recall the days when the club won votes by distributing turkeys to needy families on Thanksgiving and buying coal for constituents who had none But today the clubhouse style is radically different Where once a poor couple would have come to ask for fuel they now come to ask for help in straightening out their gas bills  as a couple did on a recent contract evening in the club And where years ago immigrant parents might have come to ask for help in getting their 18yearold son a job middleclass parents now come to ask how they can change their 18yearold sons draft status  as a family did on another recent evening at the club The coordinator of the Madison Clubs captains Samuel Plotkin sits on Selective Service Board 39 and every Monday and Thursday offers free advice to young men who may end up appealing for draft exemptions before his own board Nearly everything the Madison Clubs captains do brings them into contact with governmental agencies usually municipal ones And the services they perform would be unnecessary if their constituents were not frustrated by the administrative thickets and the sluggish performances in city bureaucracies Robert Steingut the Minority Leaders 26yearold son who now is active in the club told a recent visitor that he and the other club members spent most of their political effort in servicing the community in ways that the Traffic Department or the Police Department or the Board of Education did not An Ombudsmans Club The younger Steingut worked for a time as a substitute teacher and he vividly recalled his frustration on days when his paycheck went astray When I used to call the Board of Education you couldnt even get the Payroll Department on the phone Obviously aware that this kind of frustration is common among the voters in his district Stanley Steingut has his captains report all community problems to Mrs Pearl Anish whom he recruited onto his staff from a local ParentTeachers Association Mrs Anish then nags the city agencies concerned using the Minority Leaders political clout as a kind of ombudsmans club She can rattle off a quick list of the small and large services shes performed for the district in the last several weeks so great is the demand for her help As a result of her efforts for example an extra police unit was provided for Midwood where muggings had increased No dumping signs were posted on a garbagestrewn empty lot A traffic light was promised for a busy intersection near a school A poor family that needed Medicaid and public assistance was quickly processed onto the welfare rolls And a retired barber who was bored and unhappy at home was given a voluntary barbering job in a local high school Such community or individual services yield votes for Stanley Steingut who in turn rewards his captains with jobs One recent Thursday at his club there were two judges present who owed their election to the Minority Leader Several of his captains work for Brooklyn legislators One of them is a Fire Department inspector Mr Steingut himself speaks with pride of the fact that he has helped many a young lawyer get on in his profession During a recent interview he said he could not remember exactly how many he had helped but insisted the total was not enough One of his younger captains a Brooklyn College science major named Abraham Cofnas said that the older Madison Club captains liked to pat him on the back and tell him some day youll be a judge too When I hear that I cringe Mr Cofnas said Yet moments before he had been talking enthusiastically about Mr Steingut saying that he had total confidence in the Assemblyman in him responding to an issue that were concerned about Some Uneasy Contrasts The Madison Democratic Club survives with some uneasy contrasts It is a place where older men smoke cigars and talk openly of creating judges But it is also a place where young men who wear blue jeans speak earnestly of the quality of life in Brooklyn Even Mr Steinguts enemies concede that his club is one of the most active in the city with 600 duespaying members Its one of the bestrun clubs in the business said a Brooklyn politician who heartily dislikes Mr Steingut but thinks it is prudent to remain nameless under the circumstances No one in Brooklyn politics wants to be Stanley Steinguts enemy Mr Steingut calls his district a volatile one It is not an easy district to represent For it contains such a mixture of ethnic groups that one would have to be a veritable chameleon to keep them all happy Many of the whites fear the blacks and demand more police protection Racial conflicts have broken out at Tilden High School and its 19yearold former student body president  now a Madison Club captain  relates a woeful history of his term of office when he was torn between the demands of Italian and black students Inside the Madison Club a black couple is helped as courteously as a white couple Yet after the black couple has left a visitor may overhear a club member remarking that it is the blacks who are ruining Brooklyn College The blocks surrounding Church Avenue in the clubhouse area are deserted by 730 PM and club captains will not visitors walk alone to the subway stop ten blocks from the storefront Mr Steingut explains that his neighborhood is changing by which he means that the blacks are moving into it from BedfordStuyvesant and the whites are moving out We are trying to stabilize it he said the other night when he and his captains were discussing the redistricting lines over the old map of the 41st AD A Liberal Concentration Of all the captains who appeared at his club two contract nights running only one was black But if Mr Steinguts organization has been slow to reflect the ethnic changes in his district his legislative record has not The Minority Leader has consistently supported liberal legislative packages in Albany and argued against Republican tax proposals that might hit his poor constituents harder than his rich ones He opposed the sales tax when it was first introducedindeed he lost his chance to become Assembly Speaker back in 1964 when Governor Rockefeller persuaded Mr Steinguts Democratic enemies to vote for the sales tax in exchange for a Republican bloc vote against Mr Steingut Mayor Robert Wagner angry because Mr Steingut had not supported him in the 1961 mayoral race then helped to engineer the Assembly vote that put Anthony Travia in the Speakers post that Mr Steingut so dearly wanted In addition Mr Steinguts early support of abortion reform legislation brought him under criticism in the Catholic and Hassidic sections of his district During a recent interview he seemed to glow when he spoke of his legislative record a facet of his politics which like the liveliness of his club even his enemies have praised His is a peculiar blend of old and new politics His club has produced some of the most powerful Brodklyn politicians Eugene Gold the District Attorney Nathan R Sobel the Brooklyn Surrogate Judge City Controller Abraham Beame and most recently Civil Court Judge Anthony Jordan But his clubhouse also contains young captains who scorn the notion that they are in training to become judges or city officials Sophie M Herman has spent so many years coming to the Madison Club that she even remembers the Irish boss who founded it at the turn of the century John McCooey Her husband had worked as secretary to Irwin Steingut and for 35 years shed been a captain in the Madison Club In my opinion and I speak from the heart she told a visitor I think this is the greatest club in the world Yet she obviously did not feel completely easy working with 20yearold captains But what she and yoUng Abraham Cofnas had in common despite their generational antipathies  was their devotion to Stanley Steingut and their absolute confidence that he would listen to each of them The activities of my political club have drastically changed to reflect the current problems and the current interests of the people Mr Steingut observed the other day But what is also apparent is the overwhelming devotion of his captains who will not say one bad word about him To them he is never a boss but always a leader and if they have their way he will eventually get license

Sports of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/31/archives/racings-maverick-of-the-mountains.html,In the bright lexicon of racing Leon Greenberg is a name as bitter on the tongue as HotHorse Howie Samuels As president of Monticello Raceway Greenberg made deal permitting HotHorse Howies Offtrack Betting Cor poration to televise three races a night for the special edification of OTB cilents playing the superfecta To racing people being in league with HotHorse Howie may not be the same as selling your soul to the devil but the difference is negligible The Maniac of the Catskills Roosevelt Raceways George M Levy calls Greenberg whose superfecta show threatens to compete with Roosevelt when harness racing returns to Long Island Monday night In exchange for TV rights Greenberg wangled the only financial guar antee Samuels has made to any track a minimum of 10000 a night against Monticellos legal share of 1 per edification of OTB clients playing the superfecta This thing he says this creature of Howards all It has done is reduce state revenue by perhaps 10million and cost the horsemen and the tracks money without producing a penny for New York City now or in the im mediate future OTB has been operating long enough to be indicating a trend and the trend is all down With a claque like this HotHorse Howie doesnt need antagonists Smile and Be a Villain Is it true that you are a villain Greenberg was asked yesterday I prefer to be known as the Catskills catalyst he said What I am doing is very important to the whole racing industry We have created a forum in the courts and the newspapers that has brought the truth about OTB into the open Seeing the damage being done to the state to the horsemen and to all of racing the legislature cant afford to be complacent about this ridiculous law this what did Howard Samuels himself call itthis disaster of hurriedup legislation I was opposed to meeting with Samuels but if I am anything I am a pragmatist and my first responsibility is to my stockholders I held fast for a deal I never thought Howard would accept Simple economics dictated that I go along with this deal which makes certain an income of at least 10000 a night for 20 nights plus 50 per cent of any proceeds from the television show with OTB guaranteeing to spend 50000 on advertising The result has been a temporary financial success which could in the long run be harmful to racing On Cutting the Melon I believe that OTB can help the whole industry there is equitable distribution of revenue but I dont call the existing law equitable I call it an abortion It should not be the purpose of the law to make horsemen rich but if they dont benefit nobody does If the horsemen are hurt everybody is hurt This is what I think we should have No 1 have one race nightly with some exotic form of betting like the superfecta with a 25 per cent takeout to give the state a greater share the track a greater share with the provision that 50 per cent of it would go to the horsemen in purses and breeder awards and a little bigger share for OTB No 2 draw a line dividing upstate and downstate areas and allow no wagering across the line Three have a graduated scale for the tracks takeout say 6 per cent on the first 100000 handled 4 per cent on the next 100000 3 per cent on the next and 2 per cent thereafter Four make TV a medium for selling racing but dont allow any track to televise into anothers area I have just heard that the Monticello show intended for New York City is going all over the state on Channel 9 and closed circuit Thats nothing but an aid to bookmaking To Make Assurance Doubly Sure We have established in court our right to televise racing I believe television can do as much for our sport as it has done for pro football but we track operators cant sit in our board rooms Weve got to promote the sport as aggressively as Sonny Werblin promoted the New York Jets The superfecta in which the bettor must pick the first four horses to finish has had an average of payoff of 7000 for 3 at Monticello and Greenberg recognizes that these figures are attractive to cheaters For example if a fixer could make sure that two of the eight starters would not finish in the first four he could bet all possible com binations on the other six for 1080 Greenberg agrees that this sort of action demands the vigilance of highly qualified racing officialS not political hacks Yet a few years ago he was crying murder most foul because Albany told him what officials to hire and how much to pay them I admit I was very critical of Robert Glasser he says now referring to the chairman of the State Harness Racing Commission but he has done a great job The last few years we have had great supervision Our offi cials are tough pros who kick them out of here for one episode
